That, in accordance with section 5 of the Parliament Act 1974, the Senate approves the proposal by the Joint House Department for capital works within the Parliamentary Zone, being the installation of drinking fountains in the public gardens and on the tennis court pavilions of Parliament House, approved by the Presiding Officers on 3 December 1997 and presented to the Senate on 3 March 1998.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-03-03,"—For the information 
 of the committee, the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill has been on the Notice Paper  for something like five months. The Labor Party indicated—and still indicate—that they are ready to deal with it. Apparently the Australian Democrats are, too.
I understand the Greens have some reservations, even though Senator Margetts has said she is keen to progress the matter. I now see that Senator Margetts is indicating that she is not. Although this legislation has been on the Notice Paper for something like five months, I am informed that we have only just received the Greens' amendments. They have not been incorporated in the running sheet, although they can be incorporated fairly quickly.
It is in the interests of the chamber—and, of course, the government—to make progress on something. If it is easier to postpone consideration of this legislation to a later hour and debate the Appropriation Bills, then I will move in that direction. But, if there is a chance of proceeding with this legislation—if the Democrats, the Labor Party and the government are clearly ready to debate it, and if the Greens can get ready while we debate the first set of amendments—that would be the preferred course.
I do not want to spend two hours getting bogged down in re-writing running sheets if everyone really does not know what they are debating. So, if that is the case, it is the government's preference to move to the appropriations debate.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1998-03-03,"—The meticulous way in which the Greens have approached this social security legislation is demonstrated by the fact that we are going right to the wire. The government also has had five months in which to get alternative legislation ready. That is a choice for them to make. If there is a running sheet that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer can produce for us which has all the amendments available, then we are ready to proceed.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1998-03-03,"—We are ready to proceed with the social security legislation. We see no reason why it should be delayed. We are in the hands of the government when it comes to setting the pace 
 in this matter. I understand that there are some objections from other parties in the chamber, but I want to make it clear that, as far as our amendments are concerned, they are there and they are ready to be debated. If there are other problems, I think we ought to make that clear now. We make it abundantly clear that we are ready to proceed.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-03,"—I think it is hardly totally accurate, Madam Chair, for anybody to say they are ready to proceed. I realise that we have just circulated amendments, and I have just had Senator Stott-Despoja's amendments come to hand as well. There has been communication between the various officers, but it would appear in fact that even the Labor Party is not ready to proceed until they can check through other people's amendments to see where they stand on them.
—We are ready with our amendments.
—If you could let me continue. Yes, we might all be ready to talk about our own amendments but, in order to facilitate the debate, I am asking for us all to have a chance to look at other people's amendments so we can make sure the debate goes through as smoothly as it can, considering the importance of the issues.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1

"Quirke, Sen John",ALP,1998-03-03,"—Last night, when speaking to the Appropriation Bills, I was making out a case that in fact the Gulf War was something that was not contemplated by defence planners from any of the nations much more than a matter of weeks before that incident happened. I will also go on to say that the current situation in South-East Asia—although I doubt it will require a military response; I certainly hope it will not require a military response from this country—is another instance of the fact that we are living in a much more dangerous world.
There is no doubt that during the times of the Dibb report in the middle 1980s, when there was division between the Soviet Union and the United States, a degree of safety that is not present today probably could have been built into the world we lived in. I said earlier that the Falklands war was one of the conflicts which emerged very quickly. There have been other conflicts since that time. There are other potential conflicts.
There is no doubt that the defence parameters that have been used for many years in this country—that is, any conflict would have a 10- to 15-year lead-on time for us to get our act together—is now no longer so. There is no doubt in my mind that the world we are sailing into in the 21st century will probably see many more smaller conflicts and probably a number that we as a nation will become embroiled in in one form or another. As a consequence of that, we have to have a much more flexible approach to defence than what 
 we have had in the past. The old world where the United States looked down the barrel at the Soviet Union and vice versa, where indeed there was a discipline amongst many nations, has now gone.
In the last 10 years I think it has been interesting to see that we have put most of our weapons platforms in place. We have had funding for the Collins class submarines, the Anzac frigates and the FFGs before them, the FA18 aircraft, the Seahawk and the Blackhawk helicopters, and a number of other major defence procurement projects. Many of these projects started in the early 80s when defence in Australia was receiving something in the order of 2.4 per cent or 2.5 per cent, and in one year 2.7 per cent, of GDP. Of course it was a smaller gross domestic product then but as a percentage it was much higher than the 1.7 per cent that is now being given to defence.
In fact, one of the central planks of the Dibb report was that that 2.7 per cent should be expanded further to an average of three per cent of GDP throughout the years into the future. That unfortunately never happened. The high watermark for defence spending was going to be 2.7 per cent of GDP. Since the Dibb report, as a percentage of GDP defence spending has been declining. In fact, it has been around the $10 billion throughout. There are a number of consequences of that. Certainly, the world as Dibb saw it back in 1985-86 would have been much different had we now had defence expenditures of $18 billion per annum. If the defence budget was $18 billion instead of the $10 billion that it is now, there would have been a number of things we would have been able to do.
That has not been the case. Governments of both persuasions have not been able to match that. We have in many respects survived with a defence budget that has allowed us to spend money in other areas. I suspect that is not necessarily going to be the case in the future. There are some immediate problems which need addressing. The first one is in my view that of personnel. Obviously defence budgets over the last 10 to 15 years have been skewed towards defence procurement, to get hold of equipment, to get hold of the major weapons 
 platforms, to build up a stock of ammunition which would do us in the instance of a small medium-size emergency, to get sufficient ammunition so that defence personnel can get practice with that ammunition and so that we can have a rudimentary stockpile that would get us by in times of danger.
As I understand it, we have managed to put something in the order of $3 billion into defence ammunition stockpiles during these years. As I understand it, in 1983 when the Labor Party, of which I am a member, came to government that stockpile was only one-third of its present size. I think that is probably still inadequate. Of course, defence budgets are always enormously salary dependent and one of the great problems we are going to have into the future is that we are going to have to spend much more money in that area.
I suspect, too, that we are going to have to raise the question of the integration of our reserves into the defence forces as such. We currently have a very good reserve in Australia. The ready reserve, which we would need in any significant conflict, is going to be one of the important personnel backbones of the army. However, one of the problems that we now find ourselves in is that there is not the civilian support out there; namely, employers who are prepared to let people go into the defence forces for the necessary blocks of time to make sure their skills are adequate in instances where we may well need these people in the front line at very few days notice.
One of the reasons for my address on this question is to make a couple of significant points. The first one is that I think we will need to look very seriously at a legislative response to this. Not only do we need to give surety to the defence forces themselves, and in particular but not exclusively the army, but also we need to have surety that persons who join the defence reserve and are prepared to give their time and bring the skills that they have in civilian life into the army and into other services, are given the proper and appropriate support.
There is no doubt that our present defence spending requires that we have a ready re 
 serve. We are in a sense not spending money on defence; we are spending it on health, education and on a whole range of things. We are doing this on the basis that if a crisis were to arise we could very quickly integrate reserve formations into the defence forces; and we could rely on those personnel being properly and adequately trained so that they could go straight to the defence of their country.
The first point that I want to come to here is that, in the new world that we are going into, we need to have a very close look at the integration of reserve formations into the defence forces. We need to ensure that there are no impediments to that. We need to be able to carry on the tradition of broadly recruiting reserve forces from all walks of civilian life rather than just from those areas where employers, such as the various government organisations around the countryside, allow people to join. In other words, we need to put a much greater emphasis on broadening the recruiting areas for the reserves. We need to point out to employers of all types, whether they be government or non-government, that these people need support. This needs to be done so that their employees who are members of the ready reserve can go into combat and training situations and be integrated into the armed forces much more easily than is now the case.
We are going to have to look very seriously at the $10 billion. We have managed to get by—and we have got by. We have managed to buy most of the defence weapons platforms that this country will require well into the 21st century. We are seeing these weapons systems come on stream now. We have been able to do that with a defence budget that has been stationary around the $10 billion mark for a number of years. I suspect that will not be the case into the future. We are going to have to find a greater percentage of GDP. We have to make sure that the defence budget does not slip below 1.7 per cent, as it is now. There are some alarming signals. The government has said that probably the $10 billion mark will be the benchmark for the future. I would hope that the 1.7 or slightly higher percentage of GDP in a growing domestic 
 product in this country would be more likely to be the amount of money that we can find as a community for defence each year.
In essence, in an ideal world, most people—certainly people on this side of politics, and I suspect some on the other—would like to see defence spending given a lower priority. I say that, of course, because we, as members of parliament, are well aware of youth unemployment, homelessness and all the other problems out there in the community that we have scant resources to deal with. Indeed, housing and a number of issues out there are things which I would prefer to see us spend the money on. But in honest plain truth, the world we are now dealing with is a far more dangerous world, a world which requires a far greater level of defence preparedness and all of the downstream issues that come with it, than was the case 10 or 15 years ago.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (No. 2) 1997-98</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1
"Reynolds, Sen Margaret",ALP,1998-03-03,"—In speaking on the appropriations today, I want to focus on child care and the dramatic impact that government policy is having on the quality and availability of child care. I want to do this not from a partisan perspective, as you might expect, but by referring to an independent report that was released in Queensland last week. A media release put out by the Queensland Child Care Coalition states:
Federal cuts to child care are having a damaging effect on child care providers, forcing fee increases, staff cuts and causing parents to remove their children from professional care. A Queensland survey of child care services released today—
and this was last Tuesday.
reveals that both families and child care workers are hurting as a result of the cuts.
I want to highlight some of the findings of the survey carried out by this independent coalition—how they have focused their generalised concern and how they have come together to find out just what is happening in child care. It is very easy for people to go on anecdotal material and to say, `Things are crook.' But the Q Queensland Child Care Coalition carried out professional research to find out exactly what is happening. The Child Care Coalition's media release stated:
Amongst the findings of the Queensland Child Care Coalition's . . . survey of child care services in Queensland is a disturbing return to the `latch key kid' phenomenon, with parents allowing primary aged children to go home alone after school because they simply cannot afford to send them to child care.
A child care provider in Charters Towers commented that the changes meant that care for one child increased from $25.40 per week to $44.50 per week.
Anyone can see that that kind of a hike is just beyond the budgets of families. The media release continued:
The survey reveals that in the last twelve months 3,255 children have been removed from the 244 respondent services alone.
Not all services responded, but the survey shows that there are 3,255 children missing quality child care in Queensland. If you multiply that by what the position might be around Australia, we can see that it is a very serious situation. The media release went on to say:
In addition, other parents have been forced to reduce the hours of care for their children, resulting in a further loss of 12,070 hours of care.
So you have the children who are out of child care and you also have those who have less child care.
What is happening, of course, is that the hours worked by permanent staff are being reduced. `We are losing staff,' said one Ipswich operator. The media release continued:
The survey revealed that nearly 40% of the respondents had cut back on staff hours during 1997.
What does this mean for the child care profession generally? It means that people who saw a steady, secure future employment in child care now see that it is not an area to choose as a vocation; it is not an area that will provide them with steady employment because the funding base is far too uncertain.
Ironically, Mr Peter Walsh—I am sure you will appreciate the irony of that, Madam Acting Deputy President Knowles; the other Mr Peter Walsh will not share my views on this subject, but never mind—speaking on behalf of the Queensland Child Care Coalition, expressed grave concern about the negative impact that the child-care policy is 
 having on families and the Queensland economy. He said:
This second survey confirms our worst fears. Families can no longer afford to pay for qualified child care, so they are removing their children from care. Their need for care has not gone away so where are these children now? Who is caring for them?
I think that is the question we have to ask. If children are not in the recognised child-care centres with recognised providers, with quality care and with qualified staff, where are they? Families are using informal networks. Some of these networks are able to be categorised as quite responsible, but others may not be providing that qualified care. Parents will be making decisions that maybe our eight-year-old or 10-year-old is able to go home alone after school.
I want to read some of the statements that service providers are making about fee increases. A community centre in Ipswich stated:
Mainly with fee increases families have found it difficult as their wage had no rise to combat the rise in fees. Some parents commenting about their security of employment . . . I am finding that the overall spirit of families is suffering as parents battle to meet costs, not only with child care but elsewhere as well. Families are convinced that the government is determined to keep parents—
particularly the mother—
at home.
An after school care centre stated:
There have been many families who were made redundant (mothers and fathers), others were offered shorter hours instead of redundancy . . . Others are letting their Grade 6-7 (children)—
they would have an average age of 10, 11 or 12—
to go home rather than send them to child care.
The community centre in Ashmore stated:
Definite decrease in full time workers—not worth returning to work after paying for child care.
A private centre from Boronia Heights said:
A familiar comment from single working mums is that it is hardly worth them working. As for the small difference in income, they could be at home on benefit. Surely this is not encouraging these mums to stay in the workforce.
I digress for a moment to say that, despite the statements of Minister Newman and the 
 Minister for the Status of Women, Judi Moylan, that single parent mothers should not be a scapegoat in terms of their reliance on benefits, out there in the community and, regrettably, among some members of the government—although I am pleased to say that those two women and I am sure others are not prepared to indulge in that kind of scapegoating—there is still an attitude that single mothers are somehow getting what they do not deserve if they are on the single parent benefit.
Single parents in these situations are damned if they do and damned if they do not. If they are trying to meet their commitments by working, they are not getting the necessary support in terms of child care and they could be accused of `neglecting' their children. Yet if they go on the sole parent benefit, then they are accused of getting something that they do not deserve.
So quite apart from the overall question of quality of child care and the entitlement of families to assume that society will provide appropriate child-care standards, there is this very real dilemma for sole parents, particularly mothers. I think we have to seriously question the attitudes of those members of the government who are using this debate to try to popularise themselves. I think it is quite scandalous that some of them are prepared to do that.
A community centre at the Sunshine Coast reported:
Parents are opting not to return to full time work/full time care due to costs involved—many are opting to cut their work down from 5 to 3 days or 5 to 4 days where possible.
A Mackay area private centre said:
Downsizing at the local mines has been the main factor in children ceasing to use our service as families have left to work elsewhere.
Back in Brisbane a centre reports:
It is becoming impossible for working mothers to afford child care—they are spending almost more in child care fees than what they are receiving . . . 
An Inala family day care centre reports:
Parents are working part time rather than full time and this makes it difficult to find carers who will take part time children. More financially beneficial for parents to stay at home. 

Last year the government reported at the United Nations on its obligations under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. In the report, which I believe has not yet been tabled in this chamber or the other chamber, the United Nations committee recommended that an evaluation should be conducted of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 assessing its impact on women of different age groups with different levels of education and different occupation groups. It also recommended that the government assess whether the act leads to increased or decreased part-time and casual work and its impact on women workers' benefits.
The United Nations also recommended that a similar evaluation and assessment was needed for Australia's new child-care benefits scheme. Clearly, there has been no action on this report. Australia is not meeting its obligations under that convention. Quite clearly, this information that has come from the Queensland Child Care Coalition highlights that in just one area—child care—there are serious issues that are not being addressed.
I want to move to some of the survey results. I want to first focus on the increasing cost of care. The report states: Service Based Cost Increases
It was obvious from survey responses that service operators viewed increasing fees as a last option. Other strategies were implemented in an attempt to prevent fee increases. These are detailed later in this document. The survey results indicated that there is a genuine attempt by the majority of service operators to keep the cost of care down and not pass any additional costs on to families. Unfortunately fee increases could not be avoided during 1997.
Fifty five (55) respondents (22.5%) from a variety of settings increased their fees during the first six months of 1997. The fee increases ranged from .50c—$30 per week per child . . . 
A 50c increase per child might be able to be absorbed, but $30 per week per child is beyond the budgets of working families. The average fee increase was something in the order of $7.60 per week per child. The report goes on to say:
Sixty five respondents (26.6%) from a variety of service settings increased their fees in the last six months of 1997. The fee increases ranged from 
 $1—$30 per week per child, with the average fee increase being $11 per week per child.
Another area of concern is non-service based cost increases and the impact that federal policy is having here. The report states:
The majority of respondents stated that cost of care was the primary concern for parents. The fees charged by a service is only one component of the cost of care to parents. 1996 federal budget initiatives that came into effect during 1997 have also resulted in increased costs to parents. These initiatives included—
.	 Removal of the $30 per dependent child income disregard for the purpose of assessing family income
.	 The capping of Child Care Assistance . . . 
.	 No indexations of Child Care Assistance . . . 
.	 50 hour cap on Child Care Assistance . . . 
.	 Reduction in the CCA income cut off for families with two or more children
. . .              . . .             . . .
Parents largely find these changes difficult to comprehend. Concrete examples were given of how these changes are effecting families financially.
. . .              . . .             . . .
Other services predicted what fee increases in 1998 would mean to families:
""Parents are concerned at the amount of (fee) increase and find it difficult to understand the CA contribution. Some parents are not entitled to assistance and have 2 or 3 children in care. A session for these children . . . will cost the parent nearly $30. Most of our attendees are casual so CA will not be paid on an ongoing basis, so session fees will have to be paid for up front. This is fairly daunting. Further, the receipt and management of CA will require extra time from the co-ordinator increasing our operational costs.""
The second area of major concern is falling enrolments. Australia for the last 10 to 15 years has built up a child-care system that is professional, that is the envy of many countries. Now we have a situation where we are losing staff. We are also losing enrolments, and the child-care standard is being eroded. So what was a model scheme is now being so changed that it really is nothing like it was built up to be over that 10- to 15-year period. The report states:
A significant number of services noted variations to enrolments during 1997, either in the form of total removal of children from care or a decrease in hours of care required. (Removal from care— 
49.6% in first half of year, 61.1% in second half of year. Hours of care decreased 37.3% in first half of the year, 50% in second half of the year).
. . .              . . .             . . .
For the period 1 January to 30 June thirty three services (13.5%) indicated that 258 families decreased hours of care used by an average of 15.4 hours per week.
These statistics may not capture the imagination of some senators in this place, but they are certainly reflected in the hardship being placed on families around Australia. This is a Queensland survey, but this survey obviously could be replicated around the country. It reveals just how seriously government child-care policies are impacting on the families of Australia.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (No. 2) 1997-98</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,1998-03-03,"—These appropriation bills present a good opportunity to run over a few issues that may have been raised at estimates or are otherwise of some concern to senators. The first topic I want to address today is public opinion polling by government departments. This has always been a matter of some interest because all oppositions would like some scrutiny on what public expenditure there is on opinion polls that could be used by the incumbent government for political purposes.
So it would not surprise you, Madam Acting Deputy President Knowles, that many times whilst you were part of the opposition, your colleagues often put questions on notice questioning the Hawke-Keating government departments as to the extent of opinion polling—who was doing it, what the cost was, et cetera. I thought it was only fair to put a similar question on notice across all departments. I have been somewhat disappointed in the response, but not entirely.
This question was put on notice quite some time ago, and so far we have had 10 departments respond. Normally, one might get up here and ask ministers why their department has not responded. But I realise this is a complex question, so I had never had any intention of invoking the 30-day rule or even the 60-day rule. Maybe when it comes to the 150-day rule or in my mind I might seek to find out why we have not had responses.
The interesting thing is that five departments have fully responded and five departments have refused to respond. The first ones that came in, of course, were those departments that refused to respond. I also asked the premier department, Prime Minister and Cabinet, whether they have given some guidance because quite often, quite properly, Prime Minister and Cabinet will give some guidance in the mode and method of answering questions across portfolios. But I suspect that on this question on notice, from their evidence and from what I have seen, they did not give any guidance.
So far we have had answers in full from the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, the Department of the Environment, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of Workplace Relations and Small Business, and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. I must congratulate the departments: not only have they answered the question but they have also pretty much answered them fully.
However, there are five departments that have refused to answer the question: the Department of Defence; the Department of Industry, Science and Tourism; the Department of Health and Family Services; the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs; and the Department of Social Security. Their ostensible reason for refusing to answer the question is the degree of resources it would take to answer the question, which begs the next question: just how much are they spending on qualitative and quantitative research if it is going to absorb enormous amounts of sums to answer the question I have asked? It certainly did not stop the other five departments from answering the questions. Why won't these five departments answer questions which we answered in government and which five of their colleague departments have answered?
I have never been one to argue that it was incumbent on departments to answer every question put on notice irrespective of the cost of gathering the research necessary to answer the questions, because it can become a very expensive process. I recall that Senator 
 Calvert used to troll through the government Gazette and then roll all the questions into us with no particular purpose. So what I instructed the Department of Defence to do at the time was to cost the answer. Every time a question came in which cost $800 or $900 to answer, I used to include that in the answer. Senator Calvert then turned his attention elsewhere.
But to argue in this circumstance that it is too expensive is an unacceptable explanation. These departments have the information and should be able to provide it. It is a sensitive area. We want to know what sorts of questions they are asking. We want to know whether they are using it to bypass the normal political process and to inform themselves of public opinion which they can use in election campaigns rather than just in government policy formulation.
Therefore, if they are to assure us that they are not misusing research in this way, we need full transparency. We do not have that as long as these sorts of departments refuse to answer the questions put to them, if the questions are reasonable and do not involve massive cost. They do not involve massive cost in this case. The government and government departments should not hide behind and use as an excuse resources needed because, sooner or later, they will need to use that reason genuinely. Sooner or later, they will get a question of such complexity and such absorption of costs that they will want to use the excuse they will not devote the resources. So they should not use it simply as a shield to protect themselves with.
A most recent example of research was by Sweeney and Associates. On 20 January, cabinet determined to commission research about the Wik issue to more fully explain the government position, and they used qualitative research. I think there were six or seven focus groups involved and they were then to be tested on various concepts prior to a $3 million advertising campaign—mostly in the print media but some brochures—which was to cover the entire print media across Australia.
Some people would argue that is just purely government propaganda. Generally, I would 
 have to say that federal governments have had a far more honourable record in this regard than their state counterparts who seem to have no principle and on morals when it comes to expending taxpayers' money on so-called public information campaigns which only become in the end absolute propaganda for the government of the day.
The worrying thing about the Sweeney operation was that the material put before them was drafted in ministerial offices. The advertisements and the creative artwork were drawn up in ministerial offices. We know from questioning that it was not actually done in Senator Minchin's office. We know Senator Herron's office had a role to play but we suspect most of the drafting was done in the Prime Minister's office.
So they come up with these two cretinous ads, run them through two focus groups which cost $17,000 of taxpayers' money, and then they get results that they do not like so they dump the whole campaign. Well, good, we have saved about $3 million in that campaign. But everyone who looks at this area knows the dubiousness of qualitative research unless it is highly controlled. It is so interpretative, it is a bit like scoring the gymnastics or the diving at the Olympics—everyone disagrees. But, ultimately, you will only a get a good result out of qualitative research if you properly test concepts.
Having marginalised amateur apparatchiks up at the Prime Minister's office or Senator Herron's office designing their own ads and then running them past the focus groups led me to say the other day, `If you put in rubbish, you get rubbish out.' It really is not the way to approach it. If they were just doing this sort of research in order to reinforce how the government should get its message across, they would have used professionals and not non-gifted amateurs from the minister's office.
But trying to get answers on this during the estimates hearings was like trying to draw teeth. It was extremely difficult. Memories suddenly disappeared out of ministers and officials, et cetera. My colleague sitting in front of me, Senator Faulkner, asked a range of questions on what activity existed prior to 
 the cabinet decision, and he was basically told none. It was only later we got correcting evidence that some activity existed.
It was only when we went to another department that we found that that later activity consisted of booking $600,000 worth of advertisements over three particular days. I have been involved, as a minister for six years, in spending $60 billion but I would have remembered, even in that context, booking $600,000 worth of advertising—much more so than if you are just running the section dealing with indigenous affairs in PM&C. I doubt whether it is more than once every three years you would get the tap on the shoulder and say that you were going to order $600,000 worth of advertising.
That matter has to be re-pursued at another time. But if that indicates the degree of amateurishness that is getting in the system, one really has to worry about taxpayers' money. When you look at the next great plan for government advertising, it is on the CD issue. I watched Senator Lundy cross-examine our absent colleague, Senator Alston. When it was put to him as to whether a strategy had been developed in the department, the answer was no. Fifty questions later we got the full admission. Of course there was a strategy. Of course $720,000 was contemplated. Of course research was going to occur. So in response to the old tactic of the minister at the table—he cannot remember, et cetera—you just need to get a few questions in to them and suddenly—bingo!—the memory is absolutely refreshed.
I do not want to go into the whole strategy of the CD issue, but I did find something absolutely remarkable on page 4—`Target market for this campaign'. The primary targets were the general public, CD retailers, independent small record companies, performers and artists. The secondary target audience was `government backbenchers'. Are we really serious? The government is going to launch a $720,000 campaign, communications strategy, and part of the audience is government backbenchers. For heavens sake, that is what the government committees do! You have got a media committee. Why doesn't 
 Senator Alston go down there and convince them he is right on CD pricing?
—Remember what happened last time he went down there?
—That is cruel, Senator Faulkner. We know the last time he went to the committee, he got smashed. We know the Prime Minister had to intervene and pull the chestnuts out.
—What about the frontbenchers?
—I do not really think they are savable.
—You are not, anyhow.
—Even if the aim, Senator Crane, was to convince people like you on CD prices, not even you are dopey enough to put that in writing. You might get caught in a minister's office giving him advice when you should not be there, but I will say this for you: you were noticed. Your other colleague Senator Eggleston was in the room and no-one even saw him. They did not even know he was there; whether he was left over from a previous meeting or anything. But fancy putting in writing that one of your secondary target audiences is the government backbench. For heavens sake! It is taxpayers' money.
One of the other things that happened in question time today was that we heard Senator Vanstone quoting Senator Bolkus in the media. This is the government that was going to abolish aNiMaLS. This is the government that was not going to get into opposition media monitoring. Of course, they are into it like big black dogs. They abolished aNiMaLS and then, suddenly, six additional media advisers were appointed, mostly to junior ministers, scattered across each of the states.
These extra six people suddenly appeared on ministerial staff across each state. There was no public announcement by the Prime Minister of them. We have asked questions over the last two years: `What's all this about, Senator Hill?' `What's all this about, Senator Rod Kemp?' What do we get? Absolute weasel words. Then one day someone takes sick or someone has got something else, and Senator Parer wanders into an estimates 
 committee. Senator Faulkner and I ask, `Senator Parer, what's the purpose of this extra staff member?' `Oh, Senator, it is to monitor the media.' `Do you send back the material to the Prime Minister's office?' `Yes,' says Senator Parer. The whole thing gets exposed because we have a minister not properly brainwashed, not properly instructed. And so we have it.
It reflects the overall hypocrisy of this government: things they opposed, things they whinged about in government, they do. But there is a big difference. Labor did it up front. Labor had a media monitoring exercise up front, not a sneaky,  Prime Minister inspired, through the back door one; one which everyone would know about.
That is just one example of their sort of hypocrisy. If you want another one, I have an absolute classic one where the Prime Minister took firm and decisive action over certain problems with ministerial travel allowance. You all recall the press conference where he bravely got up and said that he had terminated two of his staff members. He did that at a personal cost—I understand that—but he terminated them. The following Monday he had to table all the papers in the parliament. What did we see in two of the papers? Resignation letters from chief political adviser Mr Grahame Morris and office manager Ms Fiona McKenna. They had actually resigned on the Thursday. They had offered their resignations to the Prime Minister.
What did he do? He terminated them. He sacked them. He could have done it for two reasons: firstly, to look like a firm decisive leader—and you need to do more than change your glasses to be that, but he could have done it for that reason—not to accept their resignation but instead to say, `I'm Mr Tough Guy. I will sack these people.' I think a more cynical reason is that, if you sack them, how much better off are they? Mr Grahame Morris was $25,230.10 better off by being sacked rather than resigning. That is evidence that Prime Minister and Cabinet confirmed in the estimates. Ms McKenna was $12,256.26 better off. So, whichever way you go, if it was just a cynical exercise to maximise their benefits the Prime Minister is condemned, and 
 if it was just a macho exercise in which he could show how tough he was, it has cost the taxpayers over $37,000 for that privilege.
I want to mention a couple of other things that have come out of estimates. Firstly, the Prime Minister referred certain of these matters I have been alluding to—I do not want to go into them in detail—to the Auditor-General. The Auditor-General knocked back some parts of the inquiry and they have never been proceeded with anywhere else. I warn for the future: it is no good a government sending a reference to a body that is not capable of dealing with it and saying, `That's the end of the matter,' because they have not dealt with it. That is not an acceptable practice and, if this becomes a repetitious thing, we will be demanding proper Senate inquiries to replace the legal inquiries that they should have.
The government is, at the moment, very good at instituting legal inquiries. Senator Faulkner mentioned a document from Prime Minister and Cabinet; a minute later the Federal Police are chasing up the leak. They never chased up who disappeared the aide-memoires out of the Prime Minister's office, but they are concerned about a leaked document.
I suggest they go and read the various sections of the privileges act, because the only evidence they had for referring that to the Federal Police was evinced from an estimates committee process. So whatever solution or conclusion they may have drawn would have been totally useless because it could not have been used anywhere. And lo and behold, you get to the next estimates committee meeting with the Department of Finance and Administration, a document is read out there, and they have got the Federal Police in—again.
It is not the only document that disappeared. The Kennedy report disappeared to the Canberra Times when only five senior DoFA officers had it. Guess what: no police inquiry. They put the internal fraud group in and dropped the matter—double standards again. If one leak is good enough to be investigated, the other is. We are at least able to say to DoFA that their so-called second leak was simply accidental, not a conspiracy, 
 not a direct act by a public servant and, hopefully, they will drop the matter if they trust our word on it.
I do think, though, that the newly formed Ministerial and Parliamentary Services is trying to tackle some of the endemic problems we have had with regard to parliamentary entitlements. Their reorganisation looks sensible: it has policy advisers, people who actually administer and people who respond to queries. While it is too early to say how well it will work, it is showing a promising beginning.
I want to close on two other matters. I guess they both come back to this aspect of hypocrisy. I do not know how many times as Minister for Defence I was asked cheap, sleazy, opportunist questions on the VIP fleet: `Are you intending to replace the 707s? Aren't they good enough?'- et cetera. Guess what this government is doing? It is looking at plans for $160 million to replace the VIP fleet, including two 737s, four Falcon equivalents and four smaller planes—10 in all.
They may expect me to get up and say `This is a disaster.' It might be. But I am saying that when a Prime Minister goes overseas he should have adequate transport to do so. Flying commercial involves all sorts of security risks. It is not fair on the other passengers. The 707s are still very useful as air-to-air refuellers for the RAAF. They are no longer a suitable aircraft for taking prime ministers overseas or prime ministers and leaders of the opposition around the country during an election period. So something should be done about it. I am not so sure the grandiose solution this government has considered and then pushed aside as an election gets closer is the answer. But something should be done about it, either by way of lease or by some other arrangement where you do not have massive down time and idleness of expensive assets. But something should be done about it if they can. I do not think it is up to the Labor Party to just go down the opportunistic path.
The final point I wanted to make: a replacement of the Lodge is back on the agenda. PM&C and the Prime Minister have said `No, no, its nothing to do with us. We are not 
 considering it.' Well, I think they should. I think that if this country does move to become a republic the Prime Minister should get Yarralumla and the new President of Australia should get another residence. That would cut the Gordian knot. We could get rid of the Lodge which is not suitable for a Prime Minister—that is probably why the incumbent spends very little time there—and in fact start all over again. If we move to a republic, it gives us an enormous chance to make that move to put the Prime Minister in Yarralumla and the President into a new residence.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (No. 2) 1997-98</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1
"Crane, Sen Winston",LP,1998-03-03,"—I rise  also to address a number of issues arising from the appropriation bills before us. The first issue is the change of direction that we in government have brought to this country. The general running of the country is much more attuned to a business approach and we are able to stand on our own and pay our way, as far as monetary and fiscal arrangements are concerned. The crucial steps we took under the guidance of our Treasurer (Mr Costello) when we came to government have now put this country back on track financially.
Comparing this record with what has occurred in Asia, I am not one of the doomsday people as far as Asia is concerned, even though some of those countries have gone through some pretty difficult times and still have some difficult times in front of them—particularly Indonesia and its social dislocation. Nonetheless, I believe they will come out of their problems fairly quickly with a much stronger financial system. While they may not grow at the rates they were growing before, they are still going to grow at a very significant rate—between four and seven per cent.
I raise the matter in this context because, had we not taken the action we did when we came into government and had we continued running the sorts of deficits that were being run by the Labor Party in their past five or six years of government, we could well have seen Australia in a very similar position to some of our Asian friends. That will be recognised as applying to the Australian economy if you do your sums and see how over the last five 
 budgets the Labor Party put something like $70 billion on the Bankcard. If we had added another $30 billion or $40 billion, we would have been looking straight down the gun barrel at the IMF and some very serious changes for our nation at this time.
The worst enemy that Australia can have in terms of economic policy—and it is particularly relevant to our export industries and businesses, a growing component of the Australian economy—is high interest rates, high inflation, and an overvalued dollar because of the misuse of monetary policy. I want to deal with that issue of the overvalued dollar. In fact, during that period of Labor government it cost our exporters many dollars out of their bottom line but at the same time it put our import competing industries at a very significant disadvantage. There was a large flow of cheap imports because our businesses were put out of business by that policy of the overvalued dollar when they could not compete. It was a very flawed policy, and we need to rebuild the Australian industry to a competitive position and to a confidence that we are going to have a long period of sound fiscal and economic management in this country that does not repeat the mistake.
This brings me to the comments made in recent times by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) who said that, if elected to government, he would ensure that Australia's budget would run at a surplus for the next three years. Why would we believe that when we look at his performance as the Minister for Finance for the last two years that the Labor government was in power? You would have to believe, on form, on the track record, that the dead opposite is likely to occur. So much for Mr Beazley's and the Labor Party's promises when they were in government, because invariably they were twisted; invariably they were broken, particularly the key ones which were so crucial to the Australian economy.
I will make some points that have come out of this change of direction with regard to the fiscal and monetary arrangements in this country. Over the 1980s inflation averaged around eight per cent. In the December 
 quarter of 1997, the underlying inflation rate was only 1.4 per cent. You do not have to be very clever to take 1.4 from eight to see what an enormous difference that makes to the inflation rate.
The budget is expected to have an underlying surplus of around 0.4 per cent of GDP in 1998-99. This should be contrasted with the underlying deficit of 2.1 per cent of GDP inherited by the government. The outlook for economic growth in Australia in 1997-98 remains as forecast in the 1997-98 budget, at a rate of 3.75 per cent. Growth for 1998-99 is forecast at 3.25 per cent.
If we continue to maintain our strict financial controls—our strict fiscal and monetary policies—I believe that over time we will do even better than that. And we must do better, if we are to address some of the economic issues for individuals in this country. As was noted in question time yesterday, I have to say how significantly better off people who have home mortgages are today as a result of the drop in interest rates. That speaks for itself. As I understand it, the impact of that is very close to the order of a wage increase of $100 per week, which is very, very significant indeed.
One cannot cover all these matters before us now in the time that we have. I particularly want to deal with the waterfront—the importance of the restructuring and the lifting of the performance of our waterfront. I find it unbelievable—in fact, I find it incredibly foolish, ridiculous, stupid; whatever word you want to use—that we still have people on the other side of this chamber, and also, particularly, the ACTU, supporting a closed shop on our waterfront. It has been inherently damaging to the Australian economy.
In that respect, when we consider the $420-odd million that was spent in 1991 to reform our waterfront, those of us in this chamber, around this country and in the other place must ask the question: why didn't we get a better result out of that? The answer is pretty simple: the reason we did not get a better result out of it is that those people who are rorting the system were left in control. There were no moves to bring some competition into the structure and to what was happening 
 on our waterfront. Until such time—and it is occurring now—that we do get some competition and some freedom on our waterfront, it will continue. Hopefully, what we are seeing now, where there is a new player coming to work in that particular area, will be expanded and extended, and we will get proper competition right across Australia. It does not matter whether those individuals are members of a union or not; if you have competitive forces working, people take a lot more pride in what they are doing, and they are much more likely to endeavour to outperform those who are working on the other side.
It is absolutely crucial over the next two, three or four months that the issues of the waterfront in this country are resolved and our performance becomes at the level of world best or close to it. There is no reason, when you look at the Australian climate, the facilities we have here and our ability to be innovative, that we should not be the world's best. We are the world's best at many, many things, whether it be in the economy, sport or in the medical field—one can run through these things. We must work assiduously to make sure that we lift our waterfront performance to that level.
I want to raise one particular aspect which has concerned me greatly in terms of some of the media and some of the claims that have been made relating to training. In this country, teachers can go overseas and train—there is nothing wrong with that; doctors can go overseas and train. We even allow Rhodes scholars such as Mr Beazley to go overseas and train. Farmers go overseas and train. But I find it incredible that as soon as some people go overseas to train to work on the waterfront, they are suddenly branded `renegades', `guerillas' and `mercenaries'. What a load of absolute, total nonsense.
How many on the other side who were union officials have gone overseas and trained? Many, many of them—and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. We have to apply the same principles to our waterfront, to the people who work on the waterfront, and let them become truly competitive and truly properly trained, because our system of 
 doing business on the waterfront has fallen into total disrepair.
I am disappointed that Senator Bob Collins is leaving the Senate. I have always found him to be one of the more honourable straightshooters on the other side of this chamber, but he was the minister who worked over that particular $420 million. It has taken him a long time to resign, I might say. He said that if he did not fix it in 12 months, he would resign but, nonetheless, I will put on the public record that I have enjoyed working with Senator Collins and I think he has made an important contribution to this parliament.
—This is where the bucket comes.
—Nonetheless, you have to live over on that side of the chamber with the legacy that you wasted $420 million of taxpayers' money and you got no return on it at all. You ought to have a re-examination of what you did. I will continue to remind people in this country that you chose to spend that money on the privileged few who have held this country to ransom on so many occasions without any morality or decency whatsoever. But I think, and I hope, that the game is up and they will become a competitive force as well on the waterfront.
I wish to say a little bit about the Natural Heritage Trust. I am not going to revisit what I said before when I made a personal explanation. Conservation issues in this country should be addressed in a proper manner, properly financed and through a system—I want to emphasise this for those people who are listening—that comes up from the bottom. That means the people on the committees in the landcare districts do the processing and make the recommendations which go to the regional assessment panels. They then go through another process, the state assessment panels. This is a very good system of identifying where the problems are and where the money has to be spent.
At present, whether it be on this side of the country or on our side of the country, one needs to recognise that the beneficiaries of the spending of this money will extend right across the spectrum of the nation whether or not they are in a landcare district or in an area 
 where the money is not being spent. I particularly want to refer to two areas: one is the Blackwood River, which runs into the ocean near Augusta in the south-west of Western Australia, and the other is the Swan River, which runs through our beautiful city of Perth. Much of the money, in terms of addressing the particular issues, will be spent hundreds of miles from either of those beautiful rivers. The Blackwood River runs through the Shannon basin, one of the most beautiful areas in the world and one which has the appropriate protections required to preserve that basin.
Money spent around Arthur River, out around Wagin—for people who do not know, it is 200 to 300 miles north—will ensure that the quality of the water running down from Arthur River will improve. Therefore, the quality at Augusta will improve. We will see a reinvigoration of many things, marron and fish, for example, which will come back into that water as it improves.
Senator Faulkner, you can laugh, but, as an ex-minister for the environment, you should know that you have to look at the source of the problem when addressing salinity in our rivers in this country. For instance, when we talk about the Swan River the beneficiaries will be the people in metropolitan Perth. The upper reaches of the Swan River go well beyond Northam and near Wongan Hills, and people need to understand this when talking about salinity in our rivers and about getting rid of the algal blooms and some of the other nasties that come with them.
Looking at the beneficiaries, running down the Swan River, for example, when you get to Perth, whose electorate is on one side of the river? It is Stephen Smith's, the Labor Party member for Perth, and the electorate, incidentally, got the highest level of grants of any city electorate in Western Australia. On the other side of the river is Swan, formerly held by the current Leader of the Opposition, but he could not handle the heat in Swan and ran to Brand. Swan is now held by Liberal Don Randall. A little further down the river, the electorate of Tangney is held by Daryl Williams. On the other side of the river, the electorate of Curtin is held by Alan Rocher. 
 When you get right to Fremantle, the member is none other than the one, glorious Dr Lawrence. So you need to recognise where the benefits of the Natural Heritage Trust fall and how they are going to improve whole river systems in this country.
The people of Adelaide are grateful that we are addressing in a proper manner the situation which occurs in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria as far as the Murray River is concerned. They are going to be the beneficiaries, as are the people along the river. These points are important. I know the Australian public can understand that, but you people on the other side of the chamber have an enormous problem understanding the importance of what is required in addressing the salinity and wind erosion problems in this country, and the need to replant much of our land that has been cleared because the understanding of science in the past did not give the land-holders the information required to understand the value and importance of vegetation. We now have that knowledge and that scientific base and we are doing something very constructive about the problems.
Finally, I return to where I began, to re-emphasise the point that, had we not taken the steps we did to get the fiscal management of this country right, we would now be suffering a lot more pain right across the community. We would be looking down the debt gun barrel, just as, unfortunately, many of our Asian neighbours are.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (No. 2) 1997-98</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1998-03-03,"—I want to canvass what I think is a very important issue, one that I have raised in the Senate estimates—that is, the fact that we have had exposed a loan from an organisation called the Greenfields Foundation which breaches the spirit of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. This is a bare-faced attempt by the Liberal Party to sidestep the disclosure provisions of the Electoral Act for party-political donations. We are starting to learn a little about the Greenfields Foundation and the loan that it has provided to the Liberal Party of Australia.
I think as background it is worth saying that the Liberal Party has a long history of exploit 
 ing apparent loopholes in the Electoral Act to launder money from undisclosed sources. Until 1995, the Liberal Party used the Free Enterprise Foundation to launder funds through donations of massive sums to the coalition without revealing where these funds originally came from. The Labor Party in government was successful in amending the Electoral Act to close that loophole by determining that not only the political parties themselves but also the associated entities had to disclose their source of funds. This did result in a very significant crackdown on disclosures in 1995, and the Free Enterprise Foundation was required to disclose any new donations that it received.
I have had an opportunity to look at the returns of the Liberal Party for a number of recent financial years, and they make most interesting reading. The Liberal Party's 1994-95 AEC return—that is, the political party annual return—showed that the Liberal Party had a $10 million debt to the National Australia Bank, which I might say also gave the Liberal Party backing in the 1996 federal election campaign. The Liberal Party's return to the Australian Electoral Commission for the 1995-96 financial year listed the debt to the NAB at $6,762,763. For the 1996-97 financial year, the debt to the National Australia Bank had been reduced, according to the return for that year, to $158,305. But, for the first time, in 1996-97 we had a new lender listed. That lender was the Greenfields Foundation and the Liberal Party owed $4,650,000 to the Greenfields Foundation.
From 1994-95 to 1996-97, the Liberal Party's debt to the National Australia Bank dropped from $10,068,527 to $158,305. The Liberal Party has disclosed that in the same period it paid $2,415,124 to the National Australia Bank and the Liberal Party has disclosed that in the same period it received $370,763 from the National Australia Bank.
I want to focus in my contribution on this Greenfields Foundation because, while the trustees of the Greenfields Foundation do not appear to be current officials of the Liberal Party—they are not quite in the same category, say, as the Baillieus whom we were talking about earlier today—the Greenfields 
 Foundation certainly seems to share an uncanny number of similarities with the Free Enterprise Foundation. For example, the Greenfields Foundation shares two of the three trustees with the Free Enterprise Foundation, which as I said is an associated entity and, therefore, does have to disclose sources of donations to the AEC. Those two trustees are Mr Tony Bandle and Sir John Atwill, who is a former Liberal Party president.
The 1996-97 disclosure shows that the Free Enterprise Foundation has a postal address of GPO Box 292, Canberra. The trustees of the Free Enterprise Foundation have a postal address of Post Office Box 52, Deakin West, Canberra. This postal address was also used by the Free Enterprise Foundation in 1995-96 and is now used by the Greenfields Foundation. I might say that the same postal address is also used by Bandle McAneney and Co. In fact, in the last three financial years, these two Canberra post office boxes have had $8,432,267 go through them to and from the Liberal Party of Australia.
Bandle McAneney and Co. has a long history of association with the Liberal Party. I think you will find that Mr Bandle previously was a trustee of the Liberal Party and he had some level of fame, or infame, for signing a whole lot of cheques down at the federal directorate of the Liberal Party during the years that Mr Eggleton was the secretary.
The Free Enterprise Foundation telephone contact on their return is for Bandle McAneney and Co. Of course, they are chartered accountants at Deakin here in the ACT, and—surprise, surprise!—Stephen McAneney is the third trustee for the Greenfields Foundation.
It is useful to remember the obligations of political parties. All donations over $1,500 to political parties, of course, must be disclosed. But, because the Greenfields Foundation money was in the form of a loan to the Liberal Party, the source of money to the Greenfields Foundation does not need to be disclosed to the Australian Electoral Commission under the Commonwealth Electoral Act.
A loan to a political party is, of itself, not a problem. The problem arises from the fact that the Greenfields Foundation can collect 
 substantial donations from sources which remain anonymous for the purposes of funding disclosure. Of course, this will remain the case until the Australian Electoral Commission examines the issue of whether the Greenfields Foundation is an associated entity—effectively that determination can be made only by the AEC. There is a regular audit of political parties once every three years. There might not even be an audit of the Liberal Party of Australia for a couple of years, but you have a situation where this money from the Greenfields Foundation is coming to the Liberal Party in the form of a loan.
There are a whole lot of issues about this loan that do remain unanswered. When will this loan be repaid? How will it be repaid? How is the funding secured? Are there any concessional interest rates arrangements in the financing? We do know that the Liberal Party has made a payment of $100,000 to the Greenfields Foundation. That money may not have been a repayment; it may have been moneys used to set up the foundation.
But, even if it is a repayment on a loan, it is certainly at a very lucrative rate of about 2½ per cent. There does not appear to be, in any sense, any indication that that would be any commercial rate of interest or a loan on a commercial basis. The Liberal Party is exploiting a loophole, or an apparent loophole, in the Commonwealth Electoral Act. By doing that, the Liberal Party can receive moneys through a loan which it might never have any intention of repaying.
What is an associated entity, you might ask? Section 287 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act defines an associated entity as one which is either controlled by a political party or which operates wholly or mainly for the benefit of a political party. Section 314AE of the Commonwealth Electoral Act requires an associated entity to lodge an annual return, including details of all gifts of more than $1,500 received during the financial year and specifying the details of the donor.
Greenfields have not lodged such a return, and we await a request from the Australian Electoral Commission to require them to lodge a return. As I have said, the AEC's 
 regular audit of the Liberal Party could reveal the terms and conditions of the loan and other information which, I expect, would reveal the Greenfields Foundation as an associated entity and one which, quite obviously, given all this evidence, does operate wholly or mainly for the benefit of a political party.
What do the principals of the Greenfields Foundation have to say about all this? In the Financial Review on 5 February this year, there was an article which appeared under Lenore Taylor's by-line saying:
. . . because the electoral disclosure laws cover donations to political parties rather than loans, its trustees argue there is no need to disclose where the money came from.
Mr Bandle, who is also a trustee of the party's previous secret funding vehicle, the Free Enterprise Foundation, would not comment on where the foundation's money came from or even when it was set up.
On the same date in the Australian  newspaper, Mr John Kerin wrote:
Tony Bandle, making his first comments on the nature of the secret Liberal Party contributor The Greenfields Foundation since its existence was disclosed in a Liberal Party return this week, said he could not disclose the foundation's backers.
""Unfortunately, it's a private foundation . . . I can't comment at all except to say it will make fairly significant contributions to charity,"" he said.
""The Greenfields Foundation will make substantial contributions to organisations such as those that look after blind children.""
Really? In the Financial Review  on 4 February, after this issue had been exposed, we find another trustee of the Greenfields Foundation—it is not Mr Bandle or Mr Stephen McAneney—Sir John Atwill, who, as Senator Conroy would know, is a former federal President of the Liberal Party, saying:
I have no knowledge of Greenfields. I have nothing to do with it.
—He is not. He is just a signatory.
—He is a trustee. I hope someone in the Liberal Party tells poor old Sir John Atwill that he is actually a trustee and that he had better take a bit of note of what is being done in his name.
The situation in relation to this particular matter is that we do know that the AEC wrote 
 to Greenfields to inquire as to their status as an associated entity. However, the response of Greenfields was that they did not feel that they were required to provide any further information. They are into covering up. They have a lot to cover up. Given the connections to the Liberal Party and the Free Enterprise Foundation we say that it is essential that the AEC investigate the Greenfields Foundation to ascertain whether or not they qualify as an associated entity. We believe there is an enormous amount of evidence to suggest that this is just a fundraising arm of the Liberal Party.
At the moment, the AEC says that they do not feel that there is a enough evidence to warrant such as an investigation. During estimates they informed us:
We have no authority in the act to go behind a separate foundation on the basis of any suspicion that we may have.
They have conceded that they may be able to pursue the Greenfields Foundation after a regular compliance audit of the federal Liberal Party, but, as I have said, we might have to wait up to two years for this audit to take place.
We have here an open and shut case of the Liberal Party deliberately trying to breach the spirit of the Electoral Act. That is what they are on about. They are trying to side step, get around, any form of public scrutiny of what is a huge sum of money from yet unknown Liberal Party donors—many of whom may well be overseas donors to the Liberal Party.
What we say in the Labor Party—and I know that my colleagues agree with me very strongly on this—is that the public has a right to know who these donors are. They have a right to know because the business of government needs to be transparent. It is a fundamental principle. What we have here is a very serious loophole in the Electoral Act being exploited by the Liberal Party. I hope that this parliament will take the necessary action to shut this sleazy operation down.

"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,1998-03-03,"—Tonight we are continuing to debate appropriation bills Nos 2, 3 and 4 which require an additional appropriation of about 
 $1.684 billion. That represents about one per cent more than the 1997-98 budget estimated outlays.
Most people would want us to ask: what does this mean in terms of jobs for Australians? If you look at the government's record you find that by August last year—and I do not have up-to-date figures—they had cut some 62,000 jobs out of the public sector nationally, 1,100 of which were cut from my home state. Unfortunately, I do not have accurate figures for the private sector, but they are also significant and growing. This is from a government that said it would deliver employment, create jobs, and bring unemployment down in this country.
This is also from a government that intends, as we heard earlier, to spend some $750,000 of taxpayers' money and utilise the intellectual property branch of the Department of Communications and the Arts to educate its own backbench on the merits of its CD import legislation. People would really want to ask the question, as, I think, Senator Ray asked earlier: why can the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts, Senator Alston, not convince his backbench of the merits of that legislation? I think we know why he cannot. It is fraught with all sorts of problems which will have a serious impact on employment in the music industry.
Another area that I particularly want to deal with in the appropriation bills is two appropriations in respect of the Tasmanian regional forest agreement, the RFA, which total about $27.4 million. When the Tasmanian regional forest agreement was signed we heard much about how many jobs would be created as a result. We had figures of up to 800 new jobs that would be created as a result of the Tasmanian regional forest agreement. It has been there for a few months now and I would suggest that fewer than 10 jobs have been created as a result of the Tasmanian regional forest agreement.
There is another important aspect to this $27.4 million. It was supposed to be used for the purposes of protecting forests on private land. We heard about that today with regard to the Baillieu fence in Victoria. I find it 
 rather interesting that Tasmanian farmers have to get their money by negotiation—and, at this point in time, they will be expected to pay capital gains tax on that money when they get it. Obviously, the Victorian Liberal Party members and farmers have much more clout than their Tasmanian colleagues because they will not have to do anything of the sort.
I pursued this matter in estimates with the minister about whether or not the landowners would have to pay capital gains tax, but it is a question that remains unresolved. It is one that should be resolved because if it is not then the government, as much as it might like to say it will, will not be able to reach the targets that it set down from an environmental point of view. That will essentially mean that much of the land that should be managed in accordance with conservation values will not be so managed in the case of Tasmanian private land.
As I said, what does it mean for jobs? It does not mean anything for jobs. In fact, sawmilling jobs in Tasmania, which one of the principal aspects of the regional forest agreements was about, are declining in great number. I read with some interest that North Forest Products has purchased one of the biggest woodchip machines in the world, and where is it going to be installed? In Tasmania.
The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) used to accuse Paul Keating, the former Prime Minister, of being the king of woodchips. That is very interesting in terms of job losses in what is a very important resource based industry in this country. What has happened with woodchips since John Howard, the now Prime Minister, has taken office? They have gone up and up. Indeed, North Forest Products have just got an agreement with the support of the federal government to increase the volume out of New South Wales by some 600,000 tonnes a year. By the same token, many hundreds of jobs are being lost in New South Wales in the sawmilling and processing industries.
What has the government done about the Wood and Paper Industry Council, the body that was supposed to provide information and advice to the government about how we would rebuild manufacturing in the wood 
 resourced based industries? What has happened with that? Nothing. It has been turned into a Mickey Mouse show with no effect.
Let us go back to my own home state again with regard to the paper industry. We have heard much about what this government has proposed over the two years it has been in office, in particular as it related to anti-dumping laws. The government said prior to the election that it would take certain steps and do certain things with regard to anti-dumping. It has taken them 22 months to make an announcement that they will do something. Indeed, Minister Moore and Minister Truss, in making the announcement, would have given people the impression that they had legislation ready to run with, that they had a bill that they would introduce to the parliament in this very first week of the new sitting. Not so; the bill has not even been drafted. It is not even in draft form—yet this from the government that talks about protecting jobs.
The minister said, `We have introduced the fastest system.' If you have introduced it, why isn't it working? In Burnie and Wesley Vale in Tasmania there are two paper mills very dependent upon the protection of anti-dumping measures, even more so in the face of the Asian economic crisis. You would have thought that a government would have been prepared to take steps as quickly as possible. Even when they made the announcement, what did they announce? They announced a complete copy of the bills that we introduced in both the Senate and the House of Representatives last year. It was exactly the same thing—nothing different. They did not propose anything different. We have had three ministers for customs in 22 months. We had Mr Prosser, then Senator Ellison, who was minister for a very short while, and now we have Minister Truss, who is still running around trying to work out what he should do and is not doing anything.
Other areas, in so far as my own home state is concerned, have suffered at the hands of this government in terms of money that has been taken from the state. The Liberal state government in Tasmania has been bagging the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, and his govern 
 ment all over the place with regard to the money that this government has cut out of health funding. Our state has suffered so greatly in respect of health it is almost unbelievable. The state of health in Tasmania is in such a pathetic situation that if something is not done the whole system will be bankrupted.
As I said, the government keeps saying that it is all about jobs—it is about maintaining jobs and job security. We have seen them claim on many occasions, `We have lower inflation, the lowest interest rates, et cetera.' Nobody wants to buy homes. Why would they? They do not know whether they will have a job tomorrow.
I referred earlier to the  Copyright Amendment Bill 1997 . It is a rather interesting situation in that the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts, Senator Alston, has tried to get a win on many issues in this parliament. He has not got any yet. This seems to be the last bastion for him. He has sought to convey to the Australian public and to try to convince this parliament—he has failed to convince his own backbench—that we will get cheaper CDs. There is no evidence of that. In fact the government have trotted out Professor Alan Fels, the chief of the ACCC, to defend their position, to argue their case. But Professor Fels, before the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, could not prove that there would be cheaper CDs. Indeed, what will happen is that significant damage will be done to the local music industry.
We have had evidence that the local industry, and particularly new artists, will suffer greatly; that there will not be the support there for them; that many of them will not be able to survive. We all know that the possibility of the importation of illegal and pirated CDs into this country is very real. Yet the government and the minister seem to want to ignore that. They want to ignore it because they know that customs, as the agency responsible for imports into this country, has no capacity to deal with the type of potential that will come as a result of legislation removing parallel import restrictions. They simply will not be able to manage. As a result of that, 
 significant job losses will occur. The government has totally failed to understand the role of the local industry.
The fact is, as was pointed out even to the Attorney-General's Department, which did acknowledge that there would be an increase in the level of importation, that there is a problem associated with the protection measures that are currently in place. Of course, that being the case, what does this government intend to do about it? It intends to do nothing. It intends to say nothing. It wants to introduce this legislation that will decimate the industry. Of course, I can recall Senator Alston, I think even in this place, referring to what is currently the most popular, and indeed the highest income earning music export this country has, Savage Garden, saying that they could have made it had this legislation been in place. That is simply not true.
Nobody, but nobody, in this country will seek to invest in new talent or artists without their being able to secure some right. I use, as a reference to that, the circumstances of a person purchasing a franchise. This government made much ado about providing new provisions to protect franchisees. Of course, a franchise is a right. You buy a right. If you buy a Kentucky Fried Chicken franchise and you set it up in Fyshwick or Queanbeyan, then you do not expect another person to come and plonk another Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet beside you. There is a law to protect the right that you purchase.
Why would you expect a person or a company within this country to invest in artists, and provide them with security and a start in the world, when they will have no capacity to protect that right in this country if you remove parallel import restrictions? Because all that means is that, as soon as the records are produced overseas, other people can import them back into this country and cut out the sales that would otherwise be in place as a right. The right is conveyed, as it currently stands, with those CD import restrictions.
Of course, there are no answers from the government with regard to these matters, no answers with regard to the number of jobs that will be lost in the promotion area, and no 
 response with regard to the jobs that will be lost in the transport area. I do not think many people realise that the music industry is one of the biggest users of air transport in this country because most of the product is shipped by air. There will be a range of effects in this area in terms of employment.
Under the appropriations within these bills we have lost huge amounts of money in my state. Even when it was put to the government on a number of occasions with regard to the cuts that it made to various Tasmanian projects, the Tasmanian members of the government have never sought to argue the case for their own state. They ought to feel ashamed. In Launceston, there has been some $30 million lost in various areas: the Australian Maritime College lost about $15 million for a cooperative research program centre; the university lost about $10 million, and on it goes. Even the now returned member for Bass, Warwick Smith, who ran a petition around a suburb known as Mowbray to install a Medicare office in Mowbray, promised the people that he would do so if he was voted back in but he has never achieved that outcome.
It is a pretty sorry situation when these people who have the responsibility of government have done exactly the opposite to what they promised to do in the state of Tasmania. Indeed, they have taken away millions of dollars from Tasmanians and they have not delivered in any way, shape or form, the types of commitments that they gave. Of course, we have debated many times the matter of core and non-core promises. For Tasmania, it means no promises are to be kept. Whether they are core or non-core, none of them have been kept. I think the government members from Tasmania have a responsibility to answer to the Tasmanian people as to why that is the case and why they have not been able to deliver.
As I said, in the latest round of events in terms of Tasmanian jobs, the jobs of paper workers at Burnie and at Wesley Vale are under very serious threat. The minister does have a power available to him to do something about it. He has chosen not to. I would suggest that Chris Miles, the member for Braddon, ought to be pursuing the minister to 
 get him to take the steps under current legislation to protect those jobs. I am quite sure, and it worries me, that the company may well be looking for an excuse to see the mill at Burnie, in particular, close. I think the minister, at least, ought to be ensuring that the company does not use circumstances that he has allowed to occur to be the scapegoat for the closure of those mills.
Appropriation bill or no appropriation bill, I think there are many issues that need to be resolved as a result of this government's actions over the last two years. We have had two budgets, not many jobs. We have had aged care torn to pieces. I noticed the other day that Minister Warwick Smith said that there was no reason why the government should not keep the $145 million that they had raised out of the nursing home daily fees. In fact, they should be putting that money back into the system—and the churches have called upon them to do this.
The government have been rabbiting on that there is a need for some $500 million to restore nursing homes at least to a level where they can be considered livable. You have got $145 million that you have snipped off the aged care community. Why don't you give it back? Why don't you put it back into the system? It is about time the government started doing things that are in the interests of the Australian people and not continuing down the line of just tearing things away from them and not, as we head towards an election, trying to cover up with Wik legislation and industrial relations activities such as those that have been conducted on the Webb Dock in Melbourne. It is a very sad state of affairs indeed.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (No. 2) 1997-98</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1998-03-03,"—It is traditional in debates on appropriation bills for senators to touch on a variety of issues that range far and wide. In my contribution to this debate today I am going to make some comments about issues relating to national savings, tax, retirement income and expenditure, and, if time allows, the current economic problems in a number of Asian countries.
National savings are very important for the economic future of a country. National saving 
 is critical to a nation's capital formation, investment, economic development and, hopefully, resulting job creation. It is important for a country to maximise its own saving, not just from the point of view of capital formation, economic development and investment but also in order for it to maximise control of its own economic sovereignty. There are also greater costs associated with importing foreign capital, although inevitably a certain proportion of capital is required to be imported.
There is no doubt that Australia has a significant savings problem. If you look at the statistics on Australia's national saving over the past 30 years, you will see that there has been a slow but steady decline. But Australia is not alone in having a savings problem; we share this problem with other OECD nations. Official statistics show that there is perhaps—and I emphasise the word `perhaps'—only one country that does not have a serious national savings problem and that is Japan.
Just to make a side comment about tax, interestingly, one of the solutions touted to increase national savings is to introduce consumption taxes in a variety of forms—a goods and services tax or a value added tax. Certainly, the current government has rechristened these taxes BOBITS or BIBITS, depending on their latest repackaging attempt to sell a new indirect tax.
The theory goes that if you tax consumption people will save more. This is a particularly interesting theory, given that in the last 30 years most OECD countries other than Australia have introduced a variety of indirect taxes, whether they are called a GST or a VAT. Not only have they been introduced but they have slowly but surely been increased.
What has happened to national saving amongst those OECD countries? National saving has declined. So you could argue the reverse of the proponents of a new consumption tax. You could certainly argue that, if you track savings in OECD countries and you track the introduction of an indirect consumption tax and its increase, that a consumption tax leads to a reduction in national saving, not an increase.
I think it is important to look very briefly at the causes of a reduction in saving, not just in Australia but around the world. Time does not permit me to go into all the detail, but I suspect there are much deeper and broader factors, particularly cultural and demographic changes. Certainly, the working generation of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s had very strong memories of the Great Depression and World War II. There is no doubt there was a much stronger saving ethic in our community.
Combined with this is the fact that we are an ageing population; a greater proportion of Australia's population are over the age of 65. We also combine this with the very regrettable fact that the level of people out of work in our community is much higher than it was in the 1940s through to the early 1970s. For very obvious reasons people who are out of work for substantial periods of time and people who are retired are net dis-savers.
I referred earlier to the increasing proportion of our population over the age of 65. In 1994, about 12 per cent of the population were over the age of 65. By the year 2051—it sounds a long way away; it is over 50 years—23 per cent, or almost one in four people in this country, will be over the age of 65. We have an ageing population. There is a range of problems and challenges—some would certainly refer to them that way—associated with this ageing population. We need to be able to provide a secure and comfortable retirement income for people over the age of 65, as well as a range of expenditures in areas such as health and other specific aged care services.
I certainly consider as a member of a Labor government that it is the role of a Labor Party to provide fundamental support in areas such as education, health and incomes. By incomes, I mean a decent income for people not only while they are employed or unemployed but also while they are retired. The ageing population presents a significant number of major challenges or perhaps problems. I referred earlier to the statistics: one in four will be over the age of 65 by the year 2051. It seems a long time away. However, to accrue sufficient retirement income for that period with our changing demographic, the 
 earlier you start, the easier the resolution of the problems becomes.
As I mentioned earlier, there are significant problems on the income side of the equation to ensure a sufficient income in retirement, particularly when I suspect the expectations of today's generation in the work force are for a retirement income something greater than the current age pension, which is approximately $9,000 a year. On the expenditure side, governments have to fund expenditure in areas such as health and nursing homes. We have seen some recent debate about nursing home policy in this country. So it is quite critical to take a long-term view of both retirement income and service provision.
The Liberal-National Party has taken a range of decisions since it was elected to government. It is appropriate, of course, as this week marks the second anniversary of the election of the government. But the government has taken a range of decisions that I would contend exhibit a fundamental lack of vision—indeed, a lack of compassion—for our rapidly ageing community. The government has taken a very short-term view, particularly in the area of retirement incomes, that will greatly magnify the long-term problems that we have to face.
I am sure many senators in this chamber recall Labor's commitment and, firstly, its action to introduce the superannuation guarantee, phased in to nine per cent by the year 2001-02 and to match that with a government contribution of three per cent and an employee contribution of three per cent, making a total of 15 per cent.
This government, Mr Costello particularly, has taken the view that government co-contributions should not be contributed to superannuation in this country and it would be delivered in another form—a savings rebate. If you look at the level of contributions for retirement incomes amongst comparable countries—these are the OECD nations—the average level of contributions is 13 per cent. They are struggling to maintain existing levels of retirement income, even with 13 per cent contributions over a person's working life.
What do we have? We have nine per cent. It is interesting to look at the projected income a person will receive from the nine per cent superannuation guarantee. Average weekly earnings of $36,000 a year over a 40-year period will equate to a pension of about $9,000 a year for a person on reaching retirement age. I would emphasise that a significant proportion of Australia's population do not earn $36,000 throughout their working life.
So how will people survive in their retirement? This government has effectively reduced their long-term retirement income, certainly on that side of the equation, and attempted to take a range of measures to reduce the service delivery to people when they retire. Of course, there is another way to provide essential services to people when they have retired, and that is to require the expenditure of their other asset, and their only other major asset is their own home. Australians want to pass this major asset on to their next of kin. Understandably, there is a great reluctance for a person to be required to use part or all of their asset, their own home, in funding retirement expenditure.
That is exactly what the current government tried to do with the recent nursing home fiasco. It rejigged its policy, it juggled it around and finally had to do a backflip because it found out—I think to its political cost—that anything that attempts to touch the family home as an asset is not politically acceptable in this country, and understandably so. At the same time, it has embarked on a policy of ensuring that the income that Australians receive when they retire will not be as great as it would otherwise have been.
I referred earlier to the savings rebates. I have commented on this before but, very briefly, the money that was to be paid in to Australian workers superannuation was specifically targeted at low and middle income earners. Certainly no-one who earned more than $70,000 was going to benefit from the government's three per cent payment to superannuation. Mr Costello abandoned that commitment and he is introducing a rebate. This rebate will be 7.5 per cent in 1998-99, and in the year 1999-2000 it will be 15 per cent, up to a maximum of $450 a year. If you 
 look at people who save voluntarily in this country, they are generally, not exclusively, higher income earners.
So what Mr Costello has done is taken away three per cent from low to middle income earners in this country that should have been paid into their superannuation for their retirement income. He has repackaged it and paid it generally to higher income earners—people who do not need that form of subsidy effectively for their retirement income.
 The savings rebate also has another very serious consequence in that it is unlikely to add to national savings. One of the virtues of Labor's approach to superannuation is that it did lead to an increase in national saving. If we look at last year's budget papers, nowhere is there any modelling for the projected increase in national saving as a result of Mr Costello's savings rebate. I suspect that, in their more honest moments, the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, Mr Costello and members of the government are worrying about the political return on billions of dollars that have been committed to this savings rebate, particularly also given the large question mark over any increase in national saving that would result. Even Mr Ted Evans—in one of his more honest moments at Treasury estimates—admitted that it was a significant risk.
 In concluding my remarks on superannuation and compulsory retirement schemes, it is interesting to note that a number of Asian countries—as a result of rapid economic development and also rapid social change consequent on that economic development—are introducing compulsory national saving schemes. Certainly, the most famous scheme is in Singapore, which has been in effect for well over 20 years. But there are other countries: Thailand, Malaysia, Japan and I note that in the last few weeks Hong Kong has introduced a compulsory national savings scheme for retirement of 10 per cent with five per cent employee contribution and five per cent employer contribution. As I said earlier, what stands out is that contribution levels of less than 10 per cent are not sufficient to provide a decent retirement income for Australians and those countries in Europe that have an 
 average contribution level of 13 per cent are really struggling to meet current pension requirements.
 I want to touch very briefly on the current problems we are experiencing as a consequence of the Asian crisis. At a lunch in Sydney on 15 December last year, which was actually at the Machiavelli Restaurant, the Prime Minister said:
The single-most important thing that has happened over the last 12 months to Australia is that we have been able to withstand and come through relatively unscathed, the enormous financial turbulence in our part of the world. And of all the things that might be said about the last 12 months, that is the single-most important thing.
He went on:
. . . we first came into office to tackle the economic situation that we inherited, the very large budget deficit, the very poor levels of national savings, the inadequate industrial relations system . . . 
A few days later he said, `We have fireproofed the Australian economy against the ravages of the Asian economic meltdown.' We have had Mr Costello say this in September last year at a conference of economists:
The fact that Australia has been immune to the instability that spread throughout South-East Asia—
A month later, on 22 October, he said that the impact of the crisis on Australia—this is his prediction of the future—would `hardly be measurable'.
There are three observations to make in respect of Mr Howard's comments. Firstly, Mr Howard gave a commitment to give an annual report to parliament. He certainly did give that report at the end of 1996, as I recall, but he did not do it at the end of 1997; instead, he fronted up to the Machiavelli Restaurant in Sydney and gave his assessment of the past year. If Mr Howard wants to front up to the Machiavelli Restaurant—in front of what must be a very sympathetic audience and a paying audience as well—rather than give his annual report to parliament, I suppose that is his prerogative, but it is not the commitment he gave at the last election.
 Secondly, Mr Howard and Mr Costello were wrong in their analysis of the effect of the current problems in Asia. The latest evidence of the problems in Asia are in the 
 trade figures that were released yesterday where we had a $600 million trade deficit in January. We also had the release of figures showing a 57 per cent reduction in applications for tourist visits to Australia. The ABS rural exports figure fell $1.88 billion, which was the lowest figure since November 1996. But what is most disturbing is that imports of consumption goods rose to $2.28 billion. Our deteriorating trade deficit, mainly as a consequence of what has occurred in Asia, will have a significant economic impact and ultimately an increase in unemployment. I might remind the Senate that the Prime Minister was boasting last year that he had fireproofed the Australian economy against the ravages of the Asian economic meltdown.
Thirdly, the Prime Minister also forgot to acknowledge the role Labor has played in some very fundamental economic reforms in its 13 years in office with record low industrial disputes, healthy corporate profits, floating of the dollar, deregulation of the financial system and lower corporate tax rates. Perhaps the Prime Minister did not want to openly—and in a balanced way—acknowledge Labor's record, but perhaps he forgot to acknowledge Labor's record. He did not particularly want to. Perhaps he forgot—like he forgot when he was Treasurer in 1983 during the election campaign to tell the Australian public that the then deficit would hit $9 billion, which in today's dollar terms would be over $25 billion—and he has the gall to accuse our current leader, Mr Beazley, of creating a black hole.

"West, Sen Sue",ALP,1998-03-03,"—I rise tonight to address a couple of issues that have been brought to my attention as a result of the recent estimates process and media comments that have appeared in the Financial Review . The first one relates to the intended rise in airport landing charges at Kingsford Smith airport in Sydney, and the second one relates to nursing homes. There have been three articles in the Australian Financial Review —or there had been up to last week—about additional increases in airline charges and landing fees for aircraft flying into Kingsford Smith airport.
It is certainly still not clear from the estimates answers—and a lot of those have still to come back on notice—what impact these rises will have on regional and rural commuter airlines that operate almost solely within New South Wales. There is grave concern on the part of the industry that there will be a significant increase in the cost of airline tickets—and, therefore, access—to KSA for regional and rural people. It is not just me who is concerned; the leader of the National Party in New South Wales and many others have expressed their concerns in the regional newspapers in recent times.
The FAC has provided the industry with details of what their options are. I have not yet been provided with those, but they are coming on notice. I think it is important that we understand just what is being asked of industry and what the impact will be. Airlines like Impulse say that for them, over a two- or three-year period it means additional running costs of about half a million dollars. Another larger airline that operates more flights out of KSA has estimated it will cost them an additional million dollars.
Increases of between $10 and $25 a ticket are being talked of. The intrastate airline industry will not be able to bear these increases very readily. The increases will certainly have an impact on the access of the people of rural New South Wales to Kingsford Smith airport. But it will not just affect the individual. There is industry west of the Great Dividing Range and north and south of Sydney-Newcastle-Wollongong. The increases will impact on Newcastle because there are small commuter airlines that run from Newcastle to Sydney. I presume it will also affect Canberra because the major operators, the big domestic carriers, have only a very limited number of jet services in and out of KSA to Canberra.
It is the smaller subsidiaries—the Kendall airlines and the Eastern airlines—that operate the bulk of the services from Sydney to KSA, and they will, of course, be affected. The increases will have a major effect in my own area of Bathurst. We have a 6.30 a.m. flight. It is a very popular flight because it enables business and industry people to be in Sydney 
 for a nine o'clock appointment. They spend all day on appointments in Sydney and can then catch the ten past seven flight home at night and not have the additional cost of an overnight stay.
If airline fares were to rise by $20 or $25, these people would not fly. They would still leave home at about six o'clock in the morning, but they would drive in their cars to Sydney for their appointments and have to drive back in the evening. People will tell me, `Oh, it's not a great number of people.' But if you add up the number of people from all around the region, you will find that there will be a few more cars on that already dangerous road. The NRMA has worked out that the section from Penrith to Bathurst is probably the most dangerous road in NSW; statistically more dangerous than the Pacific Highway heading north from Sydney, which has had additional funding put into it. The impact of this move will be to disenfranchise the access of a lot of rural people to Sydney.
There were suggestions by the FAC when I spoke to them about it that they were going to spend a lot of money at Kingsford Smith airport. That is fine. I asked them what amount of the moneys that they were expending would benefit regional and rural New South Wales. Fifty million dollars is to be expended on new pavements and taxiways, and that is very welcome. Something like $400 million will be expended on the international terminal. The bulk of travellers from regional and rural New South Wales do not use the international terminal; they use the domestic terminals. It does not seem fair that they will have to find and bear a disproportionate amount of money to meet those charges.
I did not think that charges were to be used to control the number of flights into and out of Kingsford Smith airport. Last year we passed the Sydney Airport Demand Management Bill. That bill outlined the fact that there were slots available to the industry for utilisation, that the industry was moving to slot times and that regional and rural commuters would certainly be able to get access to that facility. In fact, I was told they were going to 
 be ring-fenced, and I was again told this at estimates.
I want to know the answer to a question I keep asking: if the Sydney Airport Demand Management Act is in operation and is controlling the number of aircraft movements per hour, why do we need to have peak and shoulder charges as well as flat landing charges for the rest of the day? The department cannot answer that question for me. I can foresee—and I prophesy here—that if these landing charge increases take place, regional and rural commuter airlines will be unable to take up the slot times that they are allocated in the peak times. I would bet my bottom dollar that, once they cannot take up those slot times because of the peak and shoulder charge increases, we will see regional and rural commuters lose access to KSA in the mornings and in the evenings at the peak times when, I think, we have as much right to travel as anybody else. So it is of major concern and major importance.
There is another issue that relates to that bill. In the committee stage of the bill I asked for the figure for the revenue from the peak and shoulder charges to 30 June 1997. That was taken on notice. I received a letter from the minister six weeks or so later providing me with a figure but telling me that it was commercial-in-confidence. When I wrote back to the minister and asked why it was commercial-in-confidence the reason given was that the FAC `requested that it be treated as such because it was now in competition with the privately operated airports in Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth and believed that the public release of this information would not be in the best interests of the airport.' At estimates I wondered what was in the best interests of the airline traveller—and I still do.
When I asked Mr Snelling, the witness from the FAC, why this information was classified as commercial-in-confidence, he did not know. I asked him whether he could provide information on the peak and shoulder charges at KSA—how much revenue each charge had brought in. He said that he could get that for me, which then led me to ask why it had previously been commercial-in-confidence. I still ask that question. He was quite happy for 
 me to say what the amount of money was. For the 12 months to June of 1997, just under $7.5 million was raised.
I have a grave concern with the way this government is moving on privatisation, outsourcing and that type of thing that we are going to see more of this `It's commercial-in-confidence'. That is fine, but I want to know why it is commercial-in-confidence and what happens about accountability. There has to be accountability in all of this, not just in the interests of the airport and privatisation but of the travelling public and of the taxpayer. It is very important that we do not lose sight of this. Every time I get a letter that tells me something is commercial-in-confidence I am going to continue to say, `Why?' and `Give me the details'.
The amount of revenue that is brought in to the FAC coffers by the peak and shoulder charges and by the general landing charges at Kingsford Smith airport is of interest to taxpayers, because they want to know how much is being subsidised and how much assistance is being given. If that $7.5 million is being paid so that it makes them competitive with the other airports, I wonder what the charges are and what the revenue from them is for the privately leased airports.
I leave that issue at this stage and turn to aged care, an issue that I have been pursuing ever since the government advised that it was going to change aged care. In fact, I have been pursuing it and involved with it for as long as I have been here. I have probably been pursuing it for the last 30-odd years in my nursing career.
Aged care is vital. It is something that should be given with compassion and care; it should not be something which is just a book entry. I raised the case the other day of a 55-year-old gentleman who has Alzheimer's disease and whose family has a farm. The income from that farm is negligible, because they have been in receipt of exceptional circumstances funding. They are still in receipt of a healthcare card because the income is so low. Because of his Alzheimer's this gentleman requires institutionalisation in a nursing home but, because of the value of the farm and of a small rental property, they 
 are being charged the maximum accommodation charge per day that can be levied on them, because they are non-pensioners.
This government some time ago outlined this wonderful new change—these wonderful new incentives and innovations—for intergenerational transfer of family farms. But it was for people who were in receipt of aged care benefits. At his age, my constituent—with Alzheimer's disease, an adult family, and a wife with a disability who cannot work the farm—is not eligible for the intergenerational transfer because he is not at age pension age. The only language I can think of to describe that situation is unparliamentary.
I know that this initiative was sold as the panacea, as the solution to all of the problems of the rural industry when they needed to transfer property. Now we have this situation that I am acquainted with. I will be working very hard to ensure that this family is given a classification under hardship provisions. He did not ask for this disease; he has a chronic illness. It is an illness that can affect any age, but because of the type of illness it is he is treated in a nursing home. It is not at all fair.
Also on aged care I turn to a letter that I and a number of people have received from a region of New South Wales where the directors of nursing have formed an association representing 35 institutions. They have written a very lengthy letter outlining their concerns and their thoughts about the changes in aged care. To say that they are uncomplimentary is putting it fairly mildly. They have grave concerns with the resident classification scale.
In estimates late last year I introduced into the debate a report by Chris Aisbett from LAETA that had been done for the New South Wales Nurses Association, the New South Wales College of Nursing, and Geriaction. The report indicated that the resident classification scale is a flawed instrument. With pressure here in this chamber during the debate on the original legislation, we actually have managed to get the government to agree to a review after three months.
Let me go through this letter and talk about some of the things that this group of directors of nursing are raising. These are all registered 
 nurses with good qualifications. I have attended an in-service day that was held by a university that works out of that area as well. They are well-qualified people who know what they are talking about and who are expert in the area of aged care.
They say that they were quite happy when the idea of a single instrument was introduced, because they thought that that would measure the direct care needs of all people accommodated in residential care facilities. They say:
Upon final presentation of the RCS
it is now very clear that it is purely a Funding Tool to measure ""relative care needs"" only and therefore, has very little to do with classification and direct care needs.
They are critical of the training for the RCS. They say:
The Training for the RCS was initially found to be adequate, however, since that training the intention and wording of some questions have changed creating confusion, uncertainty and indeed the movement of some residents to lower categories, even from high band to low band. The wording between questions is inconsistent, the weightings are inappropriate for the delivery of care required, particularly, for example the Medication question . . .
This is one of the questions about which I am getting a lot of concern expressed to me by the industry. I admit that I have a nursing background and I have good contacts within these areas. They continue:
. . . the Medication question which gives maximum weighting for an injection which may only have to be administered monthly and does not require the equivalent amount of effort and time as does crushing and mixing medications and standing to administer the medications to a confused, unco-operative or ""slow"" resident, not once a day, but up to four (4) times a day . . .
The monthly injection can score higher than the administration of the medication. The other area of that which is causing grave concern is for hostels when they are using dose sets and Webster packs. These are methods of putting doses of medication together into an appropriate pack so that somebody just has to come along and open up one particular blister from the Webster case at the time it is due to be administered or, in 
 the case of the dose set, to slide back a slide on the lid.
These are being filled, and are required to be filled, by someone who has the appropriate qualifications. In the hostels in New South Wales that I am talking about, that is a pharmacist or a doctor. It is the hostel that has to foot the cost of that, not the patient. These people are being classified as the second lowest, and there is a big difference  in the classification scale between the second lowest and the next one, which is where I think they should be, and I think most of the industry would agree with me. That is an added impost upon the hostels.
The department tells us that they do not have to do it, but part of accreditation is that they will improve standards. They will have good, high standards. This is the sort of procedure that they should be adopting for good care and standards—and they are being penalised. That is just one instance where the resident classification scale falls down, and falls down badly. The sooner that review is made public, the better for everybody.

"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1998-03-03,"—We are now debating the appropriation bills, which deal with the way money is collected and how it is spent on behalf of the Australian taxpayer. It is proper that rigour be brought to bear on the considerations of that process, and we have heard much debate directed to that issue.
I want to talk about a few matters, all to do with the wise and good expenditure of money. It is not simply a matter of bringing to the process an accountant's mind or an economist's mind; there are other issues to take into account.
I want to talk about certain matters to do with the working people of Australia—on Webb Dock in Melbourne, at Cobar in New South Wales, Yarrawonga in Victoria and Grafton in New South Wales. I probably take a different view on these matters to Senator Crane who was speaking earlier in this debate. I often disagree with Senator Crane on economic matters and industrial matters, but he is a person of outstanding character. I 
 would not take issue with his character or with his integrity.
Competition on the wharves around Australia is a good thing. It is a good thing that people who work on the wharves be as productive as possible. It does not follow from that that the way a number of people have gone about attacking the Maritime Union of Australia on the wharves in Melbourne is the correct way. The first thing to be remembered about the situation on the wharves of Melbourne is this: it has to do mainly with working men and working women of Australia.
Most adult people in Australia work. Some earn more than others and it is often said that some people earn too much. `Profit' is not a dirty word, nor is `decent and proper wages' a dirty phrase. The fact that people earn money should not be a situation that attracts criticism or attracts a combination of forces to stop them earning what they are entitled to and have properly earned, just as there should not be a combination of forces to stop people earning profits. Indeed, we have provisions under the Trade Practices Act to look to that. It seems to me that those provisions in the laws of Australia, whether they come from statutory law or from common law, are more protective of people's right to earn a profit than they are to get decent wages for themselves.
For most people, the strength of their bargaining position comes from their ability to combine, to put forward a common demand that leads to an agreement. In so far as that unionisation is stopped, to that extent, people's ability to earn a reasonable income is prejudiced. It is said there were 15 people in Australia who could repair the breakdown in power in Auckland in New Zealand. No doubt those sorts of people can command pretty much on their own what they would. But most people who want to get a reasonable wage and reasonable conditions need to go forward in a union and, in so far as we have laws that break down that ability, as I said before, to that extent, people's ability to earn a decent and proper wage is affected.
It is clear that the Webb Dock affair arose out of a unfortunate strategy—which included 
 government, Patricks and the National Farmers Federation—to bring down a particular union and, to that extent, to stop working men and women getting what they deserve from industry. I do not particularly want to go on about Webb Dock because I want to deal with some other matters, but I want to say this: the more prosperous a nation, the better it is for all of us. The better cared for is our environment—we have heard much talk about the environment today—the better it is for all of us. The more we can go forward as a community, the better it is for all of us.
One of the bases upon which we can best go forward as a community is that there be truth and a candid exchange between people. One of the great problems with the affair at Webb Dock was that there was not that frankness. There was not the candidness that was needed to make sure that reform of the dock went forward in a way that had a communal sense to it and produced justice all around, so that not only was there profit but that there were fair wages awarded to everyone.
I want to say something about the situation at Cobar. That is a tragic situation, not only for the people in the copper mines who have been deprived of their due return for the labour they put in there but for the town as a whole.
—Hear, hear!
—I am glad that Senator Brownhill is here. He is a man who represents New South Wales and represents it well. He has affirmed that it is a tragedy for that town. It is something which we, as a parliament, ought to do something about.
—We are, of course. We are pursuing it through the ASC.
—Thank you for that—you are pursing it. On paper you have a minor company, Cobar Mines Pty Ltd, which is in deep financial trouble but which has, through various connections, links with Ashanti Goldfields Ltd and even with Lonrhos back in London. The tragedy is that you have a group of workers and a very good town which is suffering because the money due to the people who have been working in the 
 mines is not forthcoming. It is always a concern to everyone, including everybody in this chamber, I would suggest, where you have a structure of companies with enough money to pay what is due to working people, but the structure is such that the actual company that employs them can go into liquidation owing money that is due to the people who have worked hard and vigorously to obtain a just reward.
There is a similar situation in Grafton with a meatworks run by Gilbertsons. Again, it is a situation where people are going to be deprived of their proper remuneration because of a company law. I do not think this is a party political issue. I think anybody, no matter what party they are in, would be anxious to see that people who have worked through the sweat of their brow and have earned money are not denied that money because of a flaw—and I think it is a flaw—in our corporate law.
—Corporate law of insolvency.
—Yes, and the law of insolvency. Thanks for that, Senator Brownhill. The other situation I want to talk about is Yarrawonga. I have to be a little careful about this one because it is still before the courts. This involves a meatworks owned by ICM, which I think is a company owned by the same people who own Uncle Tobys. What has happened there is that people have been shut out of the works while they are undergoing a revamp—indeed, a major overhaul. It is quite clear that that meatworks at Yarrawonga was in need of the overhaul that it is undergoing, but things have been arranged in such a way that the Workplace Relations Act is being used to have the workers stood down while the slaughter house is undergoing the restructure that is needed. One would have hoped that the employer was such an employer that he would have made sure the major restructure that was needed was carried out so as not to penalise those good and faithful people who had worked for the company for a long time.
As I said, this matter is before the courts, but it just seems to be a very mean spirited approach to life to shut your workers out, to 
 put them on the grass—and I use that phrase—on the basis that negotiations are being conducted under the Workplace Relations Act. It is mean spirited to use that opportunity to undertake these major works. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

That the Senate take note of the document.
This annual report refers to the Tiwi Land Council, which is a unique and special Aboriginal Land Council situated on the Tiwi Islands just to the north of Darwin. Year after year in this chamber I have drawn attention to the uniqueness of that community and the excellent work that has been undertaken by the Tiwi Land Council on behalf of its constituency members who live on what are generally known as the Bathurst and Melville islands. The Tiwi Land Council is a small organisation. It enjoys a very good accounting process, a very strong accountability, and looks after a wide range of activities on behalf of the people who live on the Tiwi Islands.
There are a number of matters referred to in this report that I would draw to the attention of my colleagues, particularly those that naturally affect issues relating to Aboriginal land, whether they are to do with culture, heritage, sacred sites and the processes that go with them. They extend into other important areas, such as health, training and employment, tourism occupations and freight and pearling. This small community that is so 
 intimately involved and so successful certainly deserves commending.
I will not seek leave to speak at a later time this evening, but I also notice that document No. 4 relates to the annual report for 1996-97 of the Anindilyakwa Land Council, situated on Groote Eylandt. Similar to the Tiwi Land Council, the land council on Groote Eylandt is almost as successful. It concentrates on Aboriginal land management issues and whilst, in my opinion, that community has more social problems than the Tiwi Islands, it is very interesting to note that the business range of activities covers fishing, turtle breeding, involvements with Telstra, mining negotiations and rehabilitation, but they also concentrate on many of the issues relating to the social dimension of that community.
It is interesting to note that the finances of both these organisations are well structured and well maintained. In a moment, when the next report is tabled, I will make some more specific comments with regard to other land councils and current reviews that are being undertaken in the Northern Territory. I would single out for particular commendation and reference the reports of both the Tiwi Land Council and the Anindilyakwa Land Council.

"Gibbs, Sen Brenda",ALP,1998-03-03,"—I rise tonight to speak about an article in the Courier-Mail  yesterday which I found deeply disturbing. The article detailed a study conducted by the Council to Homeless Persons which revealed that almost 30,000 people in Queensland are homeless. The tragedy is that this figure underestimates the total number of homeless people because it includes only those using homeless services. The study 
 stated that 147,000 people are using homeless services nationwide and found that, in the 1996-97 financial year, there were a further 304,000 requests for assistance from homeless services that were not met. This represents twice as many people who are actually helped by the homeless services.
There are several tragic revelations in this report, including that throughout Australia over 38,000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24 used homeless services during the year. A further 69 per cent of homeless youth were not in education at the time of using the homeless service. Moreover, homeless families data include 25,000 adults and 46,000 children. Furthermore, of the 48,500 women using homeless services, just under 50 per cent, which is 21,000 women, were escaping domestic violence. Included in this figure are 8,000 homeless Queensland women, 4,500 of whom cited domestic violence or sexual and emotional abuse as the reasons for their dire situation.
A further feature of concern in the study is the over-representation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people amongst the ranks of the homeless. They represent 12 per cent of people using homeless services, despite comprising only two per cent of the entire population of Australia.
The Council to Homeless Persons has rightly identified unemployment as the major impediment to kerbing Australia's homeless numbers. As education is crucial to future employability, the statistic that 69 per cent of homeless youth were not in education or training is of particular concern, in terms of the ability of young homeless people to access employment in the long term when their homeless situation is resolved.
Rather than attempting to assist these people, the Howard government has cut just about every available lifeline they could access, such as the proposal to abolish income support to 16- and 17-year-olds who are not in education and training, and the introduction of a parental income and assets test for unemployed 18- to 20-year-olds. Furthermore, there are the forthcoming changes to employment service provider arrangements whereby Australia's free employment service will give 
 way to large private providers not interested in homeless people who need considerable attention before they are job ready.
While the Commonwealth-state supported accommodation assistance program is obviously working well and covering a number of people in need, it is clear that further support and additional initiatives are needed from governments to attack the causes of homelessness. It has traditionally been Labor governments which have developed these initiatives. Many in this parliament will well remember the coalition parties' politically inspired beat-up when the previous Labor government attempted to initiate welfare payments for homeless youth to ease their circumstances. It is time conservative governments challenged their stereotype reaction to homeless people. The vast majority are not in this predicament solely as a result of their own failings.
The Council to Homeless Persons data reveals that financial difficulties, domestic violence, family and relationship breakdowns are the major reasons people become homeless. The most tragic revelation from this study is that of family homelessness. Due to shortages of affordable housing, high unemployment and increased family poverty, family homelessness in Australia is increasing dramatically. An area of major concern is the data that shows almost half of the 46,000 homeless children nationally are under five years old. Obviously, this impacts enormously on a child's psychological, educational and physical wellbeing.
What is particularly distressing—and we should all be concerned about this—is that it appears that the cycle of homelessness is being passed on to succeeding generations with little difficulty. Unfortunately, there are too few resources and initiatives to break the cycle. Many families do not know how to make a bed or use kitchen appliances as they have never experienced a home environment.
The Council to Homeless Persons data echoes many of the issues raised in a recent St Vincent de Paul study. As the largest community based provider of services to homeless people in Queensland, the St Vincent de Paul organisation has found that nine 
 out of 10 men were homeless due to financial difficulty, eight out of 10 women were homeless due to domestic violence, and six out of 10 homeless people were aged between 25 and 44 years.
What is clear from the research is that the old image of a homeless person as an elderly male of scruffy appearance and with a bottle of booze in his hands is now ancient history. The average age of the homeless person has dropped to around 30 years. Those people are presenting a raft of problems to community care organisations as they are prone to mental illness, substance abuse, financial problems and relationship breakdowns. These people are regarded as high maintenance by community care organisations that barely have sufficient funds to meet basic shelter needs and are showing signs of buckling under the strain.
My attention has been alerted to one such organisation, the Albert and Logan Community Care Centre, which provides emergency accommodation and housing for sole parents in the Beenleigh and Logan areas south of Brisbane. This organisation has been forced to turn people away on a weekly basis due to the unavailability of resources. I urge the new Queensland Minister for Families and Community Care to focus on providing financial support and creative initiatives for organisations like this one. Hopefully, the new minister will prove more capable in this area than her recently departed predecessor—sacked Minister Kevin Lingard, who was out of his depth in this field.
Coalition governments have one last chance in Queensland and at the federal level to show they now have a commitment to social and community welfare. If they fail to use the great advantages and opportunities incumbent government presents they will forever be branded as political ostriches with their heads in the sand on homelessness and community care issues.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Homeless Services</title>,Adjournment,15,1
