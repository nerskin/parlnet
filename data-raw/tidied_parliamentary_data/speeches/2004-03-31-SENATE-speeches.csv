"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2004-03-31,"—Labor will not support the government's attempt to bring on further consideration of the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2003 and the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2003. The bills impose a duty on ethanol imports and remove the excise exemption on fuel ethanol. The legislation forms the central plank of the government's deeply flawed ethanol policy. As indicated during the debate on the legislation in this place on 12 August last year, Labor does not oppose the passage of these bills, but on that day we moved to defer their consideration until such time as the government complied with the Senate return to order for the production of documents related to the ethanol excise and production subsidy. In other words, we think the government should come clean on its dirty dealings with Manildra before the Senate signs up to the Manildra deal.
The pattern of deceit surrounding the government's formulation of ethanol policy is now well known. The deception began in late 2002 when the Prime Minister held a secret meeting with Mr Dick Honan, the head of Manildra. Mr Honan is not just the chair of Manildra; he is one of Australia's richest men and, not at all coincidentally, one of the coalition's biggest political donors. Mr Howard denied his meeting with Mr Honan had taken place not once, not twice but three times in the House of Representatives. We only know the meeting took place because I obtained the meeting record through an application under the Freedom of Information Act. That meeting record exposed that Mr Howard and Mr Honan discussed the very substance of the government's ethanol policy just weeks before the Prime Minister announced the Manildra-friendly ethanol package. So friendly was that package that Mr Honan's companies got a whopping 96 per cent of all production subsidies in the scheme's first year. Manildra has now received tens of millions of dollars under a scheme cooked up behind closed doors without any regard for the interests of the biofuels industry beyond Manildra. This week's ethanol announcement, championed by poor old Senator Boswell among others—
—I thought I did a pretty good job.
—I am sure you did do a very good job, Senator, and I respect your manful attempt to justify the policy framework. I completely understand the role you played. Senator Boswell's announcement is, in fact, a concession that the original plan agreed to at the Prime Minister's meeting with Mr Honan and announced in September 2002 failed everyone except Manildra. What a concession of policy failure.
When these bills were first considered in the other place, Labor had no objection to them in isolation. At that time, we did not know about the Prime Minister's secret Manildra deal. Once we found out about the deal, the Senate supported a Labor initiated return to order for the production of documents that exposed its inner workings. The order was made on 16 October 2002 for presentation on 21 October 2002. We fully expected the government to comply with the order, and with good reason. On 21 October Senator Ian Campbell, the Manager of Government Business, told the Senate: 
I can indicate that the government intends to comply with the order as soon as possible and fully expects to be in a position to do so shortly.
Those were Senator Ian Campbell's words. On 12 December 2002 Senator Ian Campbell rose in the Senate and said, and I quote him again:
While consideration of the documents is close to conclusion, the government has not been able to provide its final response by the close of business for this, the final sitting day—which is something that I had certainly hoped to achieve since I had given an undertaking to the Senate.
It was a strong undertaking. He went on to say:
I have spoken to the minister tonight about it, and I have actually also spoken to Senator Kerry O'Brien and have given him an undertaking on behalf of the Minister for Industries, Tourism and Resources, Mr Macfarlane, who is actually the coordinating minister. There are six other portfolios to deal with. The minister is happy for me to commit to tabling those documents out of session by next Tuesday—
that is, by Tuesday, 17 December 2002. Senator Campbell concluded by saying, and I will quote him yet again:
I am confident, dare I say—the Hansard might be quoted back to me next year!—
as indeed it has been, and is again today—
that we will achieve that, and I have said that to Senator O'Brien privately and now on the record.
On 5 February 2003, more than a year ago, Senator Ian Campbell again rose in the Senate to address the ethanol return to order and said: 
Over the summer recess, the documents have been thoroughly gone through in regard to the normal protocols that apply to tabled documents responding to a Senate return to order. The government has been unable to stand by the commitment that I made on behalf of it back in mid-December. The government is seeking to conclude its consideration of these documents and its compliance—albeit very late—to the order of the Senate. My latest advice is that the government will respond as soon as possible.
That was on 5 February 2003—more than a year ago. And what has happened since then? Nothing, except resolutions of the Senate noting the minister's false commitments and urging the production of the documents. Each and every undertaking from the government on this matter has been false. Each and every undertaking has been broken. Despite the passage of 17 months, not one document has been tabled in this place in response to the order of the Senate. It was because of this failure, compounded by the government's broken commitments, that Labor moved to defer consideration of these bills in August last year. We said then, and I say now, that compliance with the return to order will result in Labor giving proper and likely favourable consideration to the passage of these bills. 
I turn to the support the deferral motion gained from the Senate. The deferral motion was, incidentally, similar to one passed by the Senate in 1995. It was moved by then Democrat Senator Lees and supported by the coalition
—Who?
—The coalition.
—Really?
—Including many members now sitting opposite.  
—Was Senator Boswell one of them?
—I suspect that he was a supporter.
—Guilty!
—I would have voted with the government.
—Senator Boswell said that he would have voted with the government. I am sure he can recall this matter vividly, and he will address that matter in the debate. On 12 August last year, Labor's deferral motion was supported by the Democrats, the Greens and the Independents, with the exception of Senator Harris. I want to remind the Senate of what Senator Allison said on that occasion on behalf of the Democrats. She said:
With regard to Labor's second reading amendment, I indicate that the Democrats will be supporting this amendment, and we will be supporting it for a range of reasons. I think it is time for the Senate to get tough with the government on returns to order in this place. We have seen total disdain—I think that is the best way to describe it—on the part of the government for providing documents that ought to be in this place.
Senator Allison also said: 
I do not think I am disclosing anything I ought not in this place, but Senator Campbell—
I think that means Senator Ian Campbell—
approached me earlier and suggested that we should not support this amendment because these documents had already been sourced by the ALP. If that is the reason that the government intends to pull this bill—as it is threatening to do—then I think it is pretty pathetic. What we are saying is that we agree that these documents should be tabled in the parliament. 
Later in the quote Senator Allison said: 
But I want to know that everyone in this place is entitled to see that document, not just the ALP because they have asked for it under FOI. If these are documents that are relevant to this debate, then let us have the debate when we have the documents. Let us treat this parliament as a part of the decision making in this country, which requires that all of the evidence necessary to engage in that debate and that decision making is available to us. If the government has something to hide in these documents, we ought to know that too. 
Senator Allison went on to say:
There is no way that the Democrats will not support a demand for documents which are relevant to the piece of legislation which is being debated. I think we have had enough of the nonsense in this place from this government about reasons why documents will not be provided, and we will not stand for any more of it.
Those are fine words—ones we expect will garner Democrat and other support for Labor's opposition to the government's motion today.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,0,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-03-31,"—We have had many debates in this place about the need to get tough with the government on returns to order, and the Democrats have spoken on that more than anybody. That is part of the reason, as I said, that we supported a motion to censure the Leader of the Government in the Senate yesterday. It is appropriate that we target the government about contempt for the Senate but we should not continue to damage the ethanol industry as a consequence of not supporting the further consideration of the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2003 and the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2003. I do not think it is overly helpful if we have an ongoing attack session today that simply leads to further undermining of the ethanol industry as a consequence, and that is what has happened. So I think at this stage it is appropriate that further damage is not done to the ethanol industry as a by-product of that sort of attack.
Debate (on motion by Senator Bartlett) adjourned.   ",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,0,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-03-31,"—I have given an earlier submission on the Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Bill 2003, and I will summarise that again to the Senate. The purpose of the Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme Bill 2003 is to bring taxation of biodiesel fuels into line with the fuel taxation framework, which was announced by the government in last year's budget. The government said that all the fuels used in internal combustion engines will be subject to excise from 2008, including petrol, diesel, ethanol and biodiesel. Originally the level of excise was to be based on the energy content of the fuel. Subsequently that was changed by the government to reduce the impact on gas and alternative fuels, which previously had not been taxed. Having moved from levying excise on fuel volume, litres of fuel, to energy content, joules of energy, it is only a small step for this parliament and this government to levy the excise on carbon content, effectively converting it to a carbon tax. That would favour gas over petrol and diesel. I quote from pages 83 and 84 of the government's report, the Fuel taxation inquiry report, which came out in March 2002:
The above analysis shows fuel taxation to be an appropriate instrument for charging for the externalities of fuel use for which there is a strong correlation between the external cost and the type or amount of fuel used. Climate change is an example of such a cost. 
For ethanol and other biofuels, the relevant carbon content should be that of the energy used to manufacture the fuel. Biofuels, which includes those coming from sugarcane, are manufactured with fossil fuels—because you need energy to convert the cane into ethanol—would be taxed at a higher rate than those manufactured from renewable energy such as solar or wind power and obviously at a higher rate than those factories and installations where energy efficiency is used. This could be extended to tax the energy used to produce the feedstock—for example, fertiliser, agricultural machinery and transport used to grow the crop—but research would be needed to measure the impacts. The Greens say that the problem here is that it is a very poor halfway house. We should be moving to a carbon tax. As the government recognises, there is a huge need to tackle global warming.
We are dealing here with fuels that are a very small component—in the order of one, two or three per cent—of the fossil fuel usage in Australia. The legislation does not tackle the big issue that is contributing to global warming, which is the burning of fossil fuels in this country. While you can see that this taxation proposal is an improvement at the margins, it is missing the big point, which is that this nation should follow the nations of Europe and impose a carbon tax. That is where the effort should be, and this is no substitute for that. I will ask the government in the committee stage about where we are insofar as assessing this nation moving to a carbon tax. I know the government has set its face against that, and Prime Minister Howard is opposed to it, so we are slipping further and further behind in modern taxation policy and environmental policy in the approach to global warming—which, I remind members, has recently been stated by consultants to the Pentagon as well as by senior meteorological experts around the world, including the former head of the Bureau of Meteorology in Britain, as a greater threat to the world than terrorism because of the enormous impact of social dislocation, economic breakdown and environmental devastation that global warming presents, not just at some time in some future century but in the century and in the lifetimes of people alive on the planet today.
In the committee stage, I will question the minister about a statement in the Canberra Times on Friday regarding Manildra, the major ethanol producer in the country. The Canberra Times reports Mr Howard, the Prime Minister, as having said that Manildra has made donations to all political parties. It is on the record that Manildra has given more than half a million dollars to the government in the last two years for which records are public. It is a classic example of the corrupting effect of donations on the political system in Australia and why the Greens so strongly espouse an end to the political donations system which gains and buys favour in this country and with this government.
The Prime Minister's statement that Manildra had made donations to all political parties is wrong. The Greens have not taken any donations from Manildra, nor would we. I will be asking the minister during the committee stage what the Prime Minister based that statement upon and whether or not he has misled parliament—and certainly the public, depending on where he made that statement. It is a parliamentary statement so far as I can see and a very serious misrepresentation of the facts. There we have it. This is a marginal measure by a government which has lost the central plot in moving this country towards a reduction in the burning of fossil fuels, towards a cleaner future and towards undoing the current accumulating damage from the policies of governments like the Howard government which worsen the spectre of global warming for the current generation of Australians and people around the world. ",SENATE,<title>ENERGY GRANTS (CLEANER FUELS) SCHEME BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2004-03-31,"—I want to say a few words in welcoming this legislation, the Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme Bill 2003 and the Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003, and, in particular, in welcoming the decision of the government that was announced on Monday to extend the excise free period from five years to eight years to enable the ethanol industry to get off the ground. I will refer briefly to the history of policy development in this area. In October 2001 the coalition published its paper `Biofuels for cleaner transport' in which it set an objective for the production of fuel ethanol and biodiesel in Australia at 350 million litres by 2010. Part of the strategy to encourage the development of the industry was to enable it to operate in an excise free environment. However, in March 2002 the fuel tax inquiry which had been established by the government reported, and it recommended contrary to that position that all liquid fuels, irrespective of their derivation, should be excisable. The government in the 2003-04 budget adopted that recommendation in part by announcing a regime whereby the industry would be excise free for five years and then, in the subsequent five years, excise would be phased in so that after 10 years biodiesel and ethanol based fuels would be fully excisable.
The decision to adopt in part the recommendations of the fuel tax inquiry and to abate the commitment made in the document `Biofuels for cleaner transport' in October 2001 caused understandable concern in the industry. The Australian Coalition for Ethanol—whose spokesman, Mr Elliott, I see and acknowledge in the gallery this morning—have been very active in bringing to the attention of government the concerns that they had about the shortness of the excise free period and the infeasibility, from the point of view of their industry, of making the significant capital investment decisions necessary to get the industry going in so short a period.
I want to acknowledge the extremely dedicated work that Mr Elliott has done on behalf of the ethanol industry. I want to acknowledge the contributions, among others, of my friends and colleagues Senator Ron Boswell and Senator Brett Mason in bringing this issue to the attention of government and seeking the concession which was announced by the Treasurer on Monday—to extend the excise free period to eight years before the five-year phasing in of excise begins. That decision seems to have made all the difference, and I see that Mr Elliott is quoted in this morning's Courier-Mail as saying:
... the Government's move would be the difference between his project—
the project with which he is concerned—the establishment of a biorefinery in Dalby in Queensland—
going ahead and not going ahead.
Mr Elliott is quoted as saying:
... he now hoped the plant would be producing ethanol based on sorghum by early 2006 ...
The Dalby biorefinery is the most developed proposal to build the ethanol industry in my state, Queensland. The promoters of the project have provided for a total investment of $80 million in the project. When it is operational, it will bring 34 direct permanent and 186 indirect permanent jobs to the town of Dalby and, in the construction phase, it will create 465 construction jobs. Dalby, which is an extremely attractive town on the Darling Downs in Queensland, is typical of the kinds of rural centres which will now be able to partake of this new industry and to find a new use for their agricultural produce. We have become accustomed to thinking of ethanol as an issue that relates to the sugar industry, but ethanol can also be derived from grain; the Dalby plant proposes to derive ethanol from sorghum. 
I welcome this announcement, as I have said publicly. I want to thank Mr Elliott, Senator Boswell, Senator Mason and others who have contributed to the government's thinking in this regard. This decision once again demonstrates the commitment of the Howard government to regional and rural communities. The decision to enable this industry to develop—as Mr Elliott said, the decision that makes the difference between projects like the Dalby project going ahead and not going ahead—reflects an approach to decision making which I would describe as judicious pragmatism. This is not an ideologically driven government; it is a government which will make public policy decisions having regard to the interests of small regional and rural communities, as this decision exemplifies. It is wholeheartedly to be welcomed.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY GRANTS (CLEANER FUELS) SCHEME BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2004-03-31,"—The Australian Democrats strongly support the view that Australia should be supporting a reasonable ethanol plan. As my colleague Senator Allison has outlined in some detail in her speech during this second reading debate of the Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme Bill 2003 and the Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003, the Democrats strongly believe that there needs to be a reasonable excise free period for ethanol and other biofuels which are covered by these bills. Yesterday we saw the government announce that cabinet has revised the arrangements which will be included in these bills, and those amendments are currently before the Senate and will be discussed in the committee stage. They will allow for an excise free period for ethanol, other biofuels and cleaner fuels to be extended from the five-year window that the government had proposed in its legislation to an eight-year window with a four-year wind down beyond that. In our view these amendments are a significant improvement on what was put up in the original bill.
We have watched with great interest the continuing fight within the government and the bureaucracy over whether Australia should be supporting a viable renewable fuels industry or not. It was particularly interesting from our point of view to see the research paper produced by CSIRO, ABARE, and the Bureau of Transport and Regional Economics in February 2004. The report appeared to conclude that Australia should not go down the track of supporting an ethanol or a biofuels industry because it would be too costly to get the jobs in place and the environmental effects would be questionable. That report, like everything produced by ABARE on energy and particularly renewable energy, was fraught with dubious assumptions, breathtaking generalisations and generally an anti-environmental stance.
I will briefly outline for the Senate some of the concerns which come out of that report. The report massively understates, for example, the sugar industry's potential role in biofuels growth. It assumes less than 29 per cent of the new biofuels' capacity and that some $60 million of additional biofuels is sourced from sugar cane. That is compared with the research from the Sugar Research Institute which suggests that sugar could provide up to one billion litres of ethanol from B-grade and C-grade molasses. The CSIRO-ABARE-BTRE report assumes only six per cent of the sugar industry's potential contribution to the biofuels market will flow through. This is very significant because the report goes on to acknowledge that biofuels sourced from sugar have much more significant health effects in terms of reducing emissions than other biofuels. This changes significantly the assumptions and the forecasting in that report. It also changes the carbon emissions content. The production of ethanol from sugar is essentially emissions neutral because it is releasing carbon in the sugar cane which will be resequestrated in subsequent sugar cane. That changes the emissions content of the modelling. 
The report also massively understates where the energy comes from to produce ethanol. In particular, the report assumes that 50 to 100 per cent of the energy used to create ethanol comes from coal fired power stations. Those are the emission and energy assumptions underpinning the report. As any person involved in the sugar industry will tell you, the energy to produce ethanol comes from the burning of bagasse and other biomass in the sugar mills through the cogeneration process. As a result, the actual energy used from fossil fuels is going to be a lot lower than that assumed in the report.
Something else that leapt out at me from that report which is worth noting for the record is that it assumes an oil price of $US21 a barrel for 2010 and a moderate rise to $US25 a barrel by 2050. Compare this with the current oil price which is well over $US30, with the New York benchmark price hitting a 13-year high of $US38.18 in March 2004. No long-term analysis of the oil price per barrel has been assuming an oil price of $US21 or $US25 a barrel pretty much since the early seventies. Yet this is the sort of very shoddy analysis that ABARE is putting up to justify what has always been ABARE's position, which is the defence of fossil fuel industries in this country. The Democrats were very disappointed by the official agencies' modelling and that they would put up a piece of modelling to government on official letterhead which has such dubious and questionable assumptions in it.
The Democrats are pleased to see that the other lobbies—the Business Council for Sustainable Energy and the various proponents of ethanol and biofuels plants—have managed on this occasion to overcome the shoddy work that was coming out of the government's official agencies. I acknowledge that there has been a continuing debate within government about the future of biofuels and renewable energy generally. I notice again in this morning's Financial Review that that debate continues over whether the government should improve its mandatory renewable energy targets or not. I hope that in that debate the government does not rely on the sort of shoddy modelling that comes out from some of its official agencies in terms of determining the future of renewable energy.
I would like to talk briefly about the impact biofuels and renewable energy could have on a key industry in my state, the sugar industry. The research coming out from AEC Economics suggests that the introduction of ethanol, in terms of the excise exemption we are talking about today and even mandating for a 10 per cent ethanol add to fuels, could actually increase the returns to sugar producers by around $230 million a year or about 20 per cent. It is a very significant potential value adding opportunity for the Queensland sugar industry. It is something which the industry has been extremely excited about, and I notice that the announcements by cabinet this week have been welcomed by cane growers and other sugar groups within Queensland.
Moving to a decent, mandated renewable energy target—taking it from the so-called two per cent target to a real two per cent target; better still taking it to a five per cent target or the 10 per cent target that the Democrats have been advocating—would increase the returns to sugarcane farmers by a whopping 40 per cent or $483 million. Some significant value-adding opportunities would come out of the combination of getting renewable energies, through the burning of bagasse and some aspects of cane trash in the sugar mills, and turning molasses into ethanol. Then you would be talking about an increase in returns for sugarcane growers of around 60 per cent on the current price. That is when you would be starting to talk about a viable, long-term industry. Turning sugar into an energy crop, in addition to it being a sweetener crop, would provide real benefits to those areas.  
Of course, we are not only talking about ethanol from sugar—and we should not obsess about that. The grains industry also has very significant opportunities to produce ethanol. As Senator Brandis pointed out, the eight-year window we are now talking about with these amendment bills will provide sufficient investment certainty to get the $80 million Dalby biofuels refinery off the ground, which is, of course, looking at turning sorghum into ethanol and other products. In addition, I would hope that the plants under discussion in Gunnedah and Swan Hill would be back on the drawing board as a result of this change. 
What we need beyond the excise exemption we are talking about today are further measures to promote the ethanol industry in Australia. We need confidence-building measures. The damage that was done by the Labor Party's and the motorist organisations' deceptive campaign on ethanol labelling last year now needs to be undone. The lies and distortions of the truth that were told about the impact that ethanol would have on motor vehicle engines need to be undone. The labelling that I see all over petrol stations in my home town of Brisbane, proudly declaring `This petrol contains no ethanol' needs to be undone. Unfortunately, the government has not been prepared to grasp that issue to the extent that is needed. We need a confidence-building program to follow on from this excise reduction today—one that looks at decent labelling and recognises the clean fuel content of fuel, one that does not scare people away from ethanol but rather recognises the benefits that it can provide. We need to ensure that that confidence building at some stage includes working towards an appropriate mandatory target in terms of adding ethanol to fuel. We need to ensure that that confidence building extends to other biofuels as well. 
I have talked a bit about ethanol today but, in some respects, biodiesel is a much more exciting product than ethanol because it has more significant health and environmental benefits in reducing diesel particulate emissions and greenhouse emissions. It is something that particularly excites the Democrats. Certainly the economic case for biodiesel is even stronger than the economic case for ethanol. From a health, an environmental and an economic point of view, I would like to see a day where biodiesel is much more dominant than fossil fuel based diesel in our transport industries. That is something which the government should be working towards. I have spoken with several proponents of biodiesel plants and they believe that they can compete in that industry as long as they are given a reasonable start.
This legislation has been a shambles, from policy-making all the way through. When the Dalby biorefiners first put together their proposition, before the last federal election, they sought an assurance from government as to its intentions and its ethanol policy position. The government was quite clear that ethanol would remain excise free. They did the planning and sought finances on that basis. Then the government changed its mind and decided it would impose an excise on ethanol but provide a production subsidy. Overnight that plan significantly changed the effectiveness of their biofuels plant, rendering it no longer viable because they would not have enough time to bring a return on the capital investment.  
Now, after many months of lobbying and toing-and-froing between the industry and government, we finally have an eight-year window, which still is not entirely satisfactory but at least will provide the certainty that is needed to get the current batch of plants off the ground. Once that eight-year window closes I wonder whether there will be sufficient investment certainty for new plants to develop. That is something we will worry about, I suppose, when we come to it. 
This flip-flopping approach can be contrasted with the approach taken by the Canadian government, many European governments and the American government where they have been adamant in getting an ethanol or biofuels industry off the ground and moving it forward. It reflects, to some extent, the continuing influence that the fossil fuels industry has over both the coalition and the ALP in this place, which is very unfortunate. It is worth noting that the Queensland Labor government has been adamant all the way through this debate that it wants to see a full excise exemption for ethanol to ensure that renewable energy becomes a crop for farmers in Queensland. Unfortunately, that message has not got through to its federal colleagues, something which is very disappointing and about which I have spoken at great length in this chamber on previous occasions. Even yesterday the Queensland primary industries minister Henry Palaszczuk said:
An eight year exemption is obviously better than five, but the Howard government promised the people of Australia the exemption would be retained. It has broken its promise, again.
It is a pity he did not also comment on the Labor opposition's point of view. They have been happy throughout this debate to support no exemption at all—according to the comments from Bob McMullan. That is something that we certainly need to pin them on. It is worth noting that this is a significant contrast to the Labor Party's policy when the Keating government was in power. In 1993, the Labor Party and the Democrats reached an agreement for an ethanol bounty of $30 million a year, which really helped to provide a kick-start to the ethanol industry in this country in the first place. Unfortunately, that bounty was removed in the first Costello budget in 1996.
The Democrats have a long history on renewable energy, biofuels and ethanol. We will continue to push hard to ensure this industry gets off the ground. We would like to see this legislation taken further, and these issues will be raised in the committee stage. We would like to see an exemption from excise for biodiesel produced in small quantities for personal use. For example, biodiesel can be produced from used fish-and-chip oil. It can be produced by thousands of people as a hobby to power farm equipment, tractors et cetera, and as a clean renewable energy source.
The government needs to do more to promote the industry. The label fiasco has been extremely damaging to the industry and urgently needs to be addressed. The development of renewable energy and biofuels as a viable, value-adding opportunity for regional Australia needs to be taken through with a decent mandatory renewable energy target, which I spoke about earlier. This is an enormous opportunity to get regional development going in Australia. Biofuels such as ethanol—renewable energy—are the best alternatives we have seen in many years to develop a new value-adding opportunity for regional Australia. This government has not quite grasped the significance of the potential of biofuels to create new jobs, new opportunities and new income sources in the bush. I hope both the government and opposition will recognise that potential and take it forward. What we are doing today will not be the end of the ethanol and biofuels debate, but rather the beginning of a new chapter of developing opportunities for regional Australia, producing cleaner emissions and improving our health and the environment.

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2004-03-31,"—I thank the participants in today's debate on the Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme Bill 2003 and the Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003. The bills give effect to two measures announced in the 2003-04 budget. The first of these relates to fuel tax reform and the second relates to the cleaner fuels component of the government's Measures for a Better Environment commitment to encourage conversion from the dirtiest fuels to the most appropriate and cleanest fuels.
The bills are integral to and assist in delivering the government's policy to move to a fairer and more transparent fuel tax system over the longer term. Under the provisions of the Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme Bill 2003, an entity will be entitled to a cleaner fuel grant if they import or manufacture cleaner fuels. The Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003 brings the administration of the Energy Grants Cleaner Fuels Scheme under the administrative and compliance framework of the Product Grants and Benefits Administration Act 2000. This aligns the administration of the scheme with that of the other payment schemes administered by the Australian Taxation Office.
The amendments proposed by the government extend the excise-free period on currently untaxed fuels by a further three years and define the cleaner fuels for which grants would be payable as biodiesel, ethanol, compressed natural gas, liquefied natural gas, methanol and liquefied petroleum gas. Under the amendments, grants will be payable to fully offset excise and customs duty imposed on biodiesel from 18 September 2003 until 30 June 2011. Grants will be paid to partially offset any excise or customs duty imposed on biodiesel, ethanol, CNG, LNG, methanol and LPG for use in internal combustion engines for a period of four years from 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2015. The grants will reduce in five even instalments from 1 July 2011 to 1 July 2015, raising the effective rate on each fuel from zero before July 2011 to its final rate from 1 July 2015.
These arrangements will provide greater certainty for industry and a longer period for adjustment into an excise paying environment. The timing strikes a carefully considered balance between desirable fuel tax reform and the appropriate period of adjustment for affected industries. This extension of the excise-free period will give confidence to industry proponents who argued that the original five-year excise-free period was not sufficient time to properly establish new, alternative fuel plants, particularly biofuel plants. In particular, biofuel project proponents who have applied for grants under the government's biofuels capital grants program will be contacted by Invest Australia regarding the effect of these changes on their applications and on the assessment process. In commending these bills to the Senate, I urge the Senate to look at them in the subsequent committee stage as integral to delivering the government's policy to move to a fairer and more transparent fuel tax system over the longer term, which can only benefit the national interest.
During the contributions to the second reading debate, Senator Brown raised a point in relation to Manildra donations. If I have captured what Senator Brown said correctly, he referred to a quote by the Prime Minister in the Canberra Times that Mr Honan had donated to all political parties. Senator Brown queried this. I obviously do not have the relevant article in front of me. However, I am aware that Mr Dick Honan is on the public record as having made donations to a number of political parties. I believe that would be the context in which the Prime Minister may have made these comments, or something to that effect. The Prime Minister would have made comments on what he understood to be the correct position. A number of other matters to be raised in the committee stage will require a considered response on behalf of the government but, for the purposes of summing up the debate, I again commend the bills to the Senate. 
Question agreed to.
Bill read a second time.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY GRANTS (CLEANER FUELS) SCHEME BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2004-03-31,"—We are considering the House of Representatives message with respect to a number of amendments that were successfully moved in the chamber to the Superannuation Safety Amendment Bill 2003. The original bill did not contain measures that were objectionable to the Labor Party, and we supported the bill. However, the original provisions in the bill fell way short of what the Labor Party consider adequate in terms of protecting the safety and the security of the retirement income system of Australians through superannuation. 
On a previous occasion when we debated the bill, I made the point that Australians now have approximately $550 billion in superannuation savings. It is a substantial part of our retirement income system, together with the age pension. It is unacceptable in principle to the Labor Party that a bill dealing with the safety of superannuation does not provide for full compensation, for example, in circumstances where theft and fraud occur from an individual's superannuation fund. The Labor Party have been arguing this principle for some years. It is now the policy of the Labor Party to ensure full compensation in the event of theft and fraud. It is not a matter that should be left to the discretion of the minister of the day, whoever that may be. There should be full compensation, which means 100 per cent, in the event of theft and fraud.  
The Labor Party take the view that superannuation has a very special status. Obviously it is for retirement incomes. That gives superannuation in part its special status. It is moneys that accrue over a long period of time; it can be 30 or 40 years through a working life. In the event of theft occurring, it is quite catastrophic in its impact. We are talking here about superannuation savings that are now compulsory for Australian employees. Superannuation is now at a contribution level of nine per cent—thanks to the Australian Labor Party, which introduced compulsory superannuation in Australia. In the main, superannuation is now the compulsory element underpinning our superannuation savings system. So it is long term; it is for retirement. 
Superannuation is complex. It is not easy for many in the community to understand its complexity. If your money is stolen prior to retirement, it is quite a catastrophic event. So superannuation has a unique purpose as a financial product in Australia's finance system. It has a unique purpose for retirement savings, and it is also compulsory. If a person's money is stolen—let us say they were in their 50s or 60s; whatever age they decide to retire—they could not simply go back and work in order to recover the moneys that were stolen. That is impractical. We know from the government's recent announcement that they want Australians to work until they drop. The Labor Party do not support this policy. The Treasurer, Mr Costello, has said on a number of occasions that there will be no such thing as full-time retirement. He does not want people to stop working. That might appeal to some people in the community; it does not appeal to the Labor Party. We do not believe in the concept of `work until you drop'. We think it is impractical and unfair. Whatever the circumstances, it is grossly unfair that, if a person's money is stolen as a result of theft and fraud, they will not be fully compensated. They should be fully compensated in those circumstances.
The minister has used her discretion and exercised the existing mechanism on a couple of occasions—the most well-known case being Commercial Nominees—to provide 90 per cent compensation. The Labor Party does not believe that is acceptable, given the circumstances I have outlined. It should be 100 per cent, and it should not be up to ministerial discretion. I am not criticising the minister personally in the case of Commercial Nominees, but I do not believe it is appropriate that a minister should be required to make those sorts of decisions about levels of compensation.
The Labor Party have adopted as policy the extinction of the compensation mechanism and applied it to a couple of other circumstances in superannuation. For example, there are some post-retirement products—annuities or pensions that people buy when they get to retirement—that are not covered by theft and fraud. If you are in retirement, we have the somewhat ironic situation where you may get no compensation if you have invested in a superannuation annuity pension product and your money is stolen. That is unacceptable to the Labor Party. Our new policy of full compensation in those circumstances is reflected in the second reading amendment. It is not reflected in an amendment to the bill we are considering the message on but, for the reasons I have already outlined, the Labor Party believe that full compensation should be provided.
The third area is where an employer goes out of business, goes bankrupt or the business fails. The Labor Party has adopted as policy that, where a business fails and there are outstanding superannuation contributions that the employer has not placed with the superannuation fund, there should be full compensation. The Labor Party argues that superannuation is a basic employee entitlement in this country now. Again, that is not reflected in the message or in the bill, but it is reflected in the second reading amendment that the Labor Party successfully moved on the previous occasion. 
The Labor Party believes this is an absolutely fundamental issue of principle. It is Labor policy. The Labor Party will not back away from its amendments to the bill. Therefore, we will not support the request from the House of Representatives. I have no doubt that the minister will argue that the compensation that has been awarded in the circumstances of Commercial Nominees is adequate in the circumstances. She has advanced that argument on previous occasions. The Labor Party does not accept the Liberal government's approach with respect to theft and fraud compensation. The theme, as put forward by the Liberal Party, is that there should effectively be a penalty if theft and fraud occur and that you should not fully compensate because otherwise you would have trustees, who are the guardians of our superannuation system, making irresponsible decisions—there would be less pressure on them to live up to their obligations as trustees and therefore full compensation should not be payable. I do not agree with that approach. I have outlined why theft and fraud should be covered fully.
The argument advanced by the Liberal government falls over for two basic reasons. Firstly, it is a trustee system. Therefore, why should we expect the individuals in the trust to bear part of the losses in the event of theft and fraud? If trustees are involved in theft and fraud, they may well end up in jail. There may well be part compensation payable, the trustees may well be sued and some moneys may be recovered from the trustees but, at the end of the day, that is not a big help to the victims, who in this case are members of a superannuation trust. They are a member of a superannuation trust because the Australian law requires them to be. There is no choice about being in the superannuation system; it is compulsory in Australia for employees. Even if we accept the theoretical argument about choice of superannuation funds, which may or may not be implemented in practice, the argument still holds that you are legally obliged to be in a superannuation fund. Whether or not you can choose which superannuation fund you want to be in is debate for another time but, even if that theory came to pass in practice, it is still compulsory. No matter what superannuation fund you choose to join, there should be full compensation in the event of theft and fraud.
I have not heard the latest news about what has happened to the trustees of Commercial Nominees and I do not know whether they have been successfully prosecuted. The minister may be aware of where the legal case is up to, but I do know that at least one of those trustees who, prima facie, was involved in theft and fraud at Commercial Nominees ended up in Guatemala, in Central America, in some exotic location from which extradition apparently is very difficult.
—I've been there!
—Senator McGauran has been there. Thank you, Senator McGauran, for that contribution to our superannuation safety debate.
—That is good news. It would be even better news if we knew that the fellow that is in Guatemala, having been involved in the theft and fraud case of Commercial Nominees, was back in Australia. I hope he is in jail. The minister may be aware of where we are up to with the proceedings in that case. 
I mention that one of the trustees ended up in this exotic location in Central America because, even if this individual is brought back to Australia and ends up in jail, that is not particularly satisfactory for the poor victims who had their money partly or wholly stolen. It might be useful, and important in terms of our system, that that individual should end up in jail if successfully prosecuted, but it is no great solace to the victims. The Labor Party are very clear: we think that it is a very important improvement to the Superannuation Safety Amendment Bill 2003. The changes contained in the bill are modest. They are changes the Labor Party support, but we think fundamental to this issue of the future of retirement income systems and superannuation in Australia is full protection in the event of theft and fraud in the circumstances I have outlined. We will not be supporting the request from the House of Representatives to back down. The Labor Party have got a clear policy and we will not be backing down.
We have got a Liberal government that is weak—very weak indeed—when it comes to the protection of Australians' retirement incomes. I do not think there is anything more fundamental than ensuring full compensation in the event of superannuation theft and fraud. In concluding, I would appreciate it if the minister has the detail of the case involving Commercial Nominees, and where that is up to, and if we could have some indication of when the regulations would be available if this bill were to be passed.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION SAFETY AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,3,1
"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2004-03-31,"—The Democrats will be supporting the minister's motion not to insist on these amendments this morning. We do so with a little bit of reluctance in some respects, but our concern is very much to ensure that this bill is proceeded with in this session of the parliament. The Superannuation Safety Amendment Bill 2003 seeks to set in place the legislative framework for a modernised and strengthened prudential supervisory regime for superannuation. The reforms are to commence on 1 July 2004 with a two-year transitional period. The industry has accepted this timing and is preparing for implementation on that basis. The government has argued that it is vital that the bill pass the Senate before the end of the autumn sittings in order for the reforms to commence on time. Should the bill not pass the Senate in these settings, it would not be possible to finalise the supporting regulations and operating standards for consideration by the Executive Council until immediately prior to the commencement date for the reforms. Delaying passage of the bill would also prevent the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority from finalising its guidance material, which will help ensure that industry fully understands and is able to meet its new obligations. These are obviously very important, and industry has made it quite clear to us that it wants this bill to proceed at this point in time.
There will obviously be a debate during the election campaign about superannuation safety, and I should acknowledge the excellent work that Senator Sherry has done on behalf of the Labor Party in outlining a very comprehensive policy of reforms in these areas. But the time for that debate is, I think, during the election campaign rather than at this time. We do want the fairly mild set of measures in this legislation to take effect from 1 July. I think that is a reasonable position for the government to argue and to put before the Senate and for the Senate to agree to. I think the debate over the appropriate level of compensation in the case of theft and fraud, and whether that should be extended beyond theft and fraud to cover negligence or employer collapse, are reasonable matters to be argued but should be argued at the appropriate time. At essentially five minutes to midnight in terms of the implementation of this bill is probably not the best time to do it. 
There are two amendments, and I did not quite catch Senator Sherry's approach to the second amendment disagreed to by the House of Representatives—Senate amendment (27)—which was about the reporting arrangements of defined benefit funds. I do want to put on the record that the Democrats will not be insisting on this amendment at this time. There are in relation to defined benefit funds some significant reporting arrangements already in place. Trustees, for example, as the minister pointed out last time we debated this bill, are required to report to members when employer sponsor contributions are less than the actuarially approved amount. The trustee must also tell members the consequences for the fund of the shortfall and what action the trustee will take in relation to the shortfall.
The introduction of further reporting requirements for defined benefit funds would impose costs on both funds and APRA for what could be seen in some circles as a fairly minimal cost. The concern of industry in particular is that these costs may make defined benefit funds less attractive to employer sponsors, and that is something which the Democrats are concerned about. Defined benefit funds have been in decline in the corporate sector over a long period of time, despite the fact they have provided a very, very good product for many workers. I think the Senate should think very carefully before imposing new cost requirements on defined benefit funds, which may ultimately result in more funds being taken out of circulation by their employer sponsors. From that point of view, we will not be insisting on the amendment, but we would, through the minister, seek to ensure a message is sent to APRA that the Senate is deeply concerned to ensure that defined benefit funds are being fully actuarially supported by employers and that APRA continues to be active in this particular area—and possibly more active than it has been in the past.
In respect of the Democrats' view on the appropriate level of compensation, we are increasingly less attracted to the government's argument that there is a moral hazard argument in respect of compensation for failure of superannuation funds. In theory the argument can be sustained that the consumer should be aware and should accept some part of the risk in respect of their superannuation investments. In practice, of course, that does not work, because it is impossible for a consumer to know what their fund is up to. They rely on annual reports from their trustees. It is virtually impossible under current statutory arrangements for a consumer to hold their trustees to account in any way, shape or form. In addition it is also noteworthy that most workers are told what superannuation fund they will be in and do not get to choose the superannuation fund they will be in. From that point of view, the notion of moral hazard in this area is a principle which is not as strong as the government makes it out to be.
Nevertheless, on this occasion, the Democrats are prepared not to insist on the amendment. We note that there is a continuing review of part 23 being conducted by government, and we note that there is an ALP policy to change the ministerial discretions in this area. As a result of those two significant developments, we note that this will be a continuing area of debate, but at five minutes to midnight before this bill is to take effect probably is not the best time to have that debate. So we will not be insisting on the amendments at this point in time, but we certainly are sympathetic to the content of both amendments. I think that they are matters to be debated at another time in this place. ",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION SAFETY AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,3,1
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2004-03-31,"—We are debating the message and my motion that the committee not insist on amendments (26) and (27). Amendment (26) relates to what has been colloquially called the 100 per cent compensation matter—inserting a requirement in the legislation for the government to provide financial assistance of 100 per cent for superannuation losses due to fraud or theft. As has been noted this morning, the government is rejecting the amendment. I should just say why briefly. Under part 23 of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 the minister, in this case me, has discretion to grant compensation for losses as a result of fraudulent conduct or theft. In exercising this discretion the minister may grant financial assistance up to 100 per cent of the determined eligible loss. I should say that I can envisage situations where it may be appropriate to do so but I can also envisage cases where it certainly may not.
Ministerial discretion ensures that public interest considerations can appropriately be taken into account when determining the level of financial assistance to be paid in the event of theft or fraudulent conduct. Within this framework, it has been longstanding government policy to cap financial assistance provided under part 23 of the SI(S) Act at 90 per cent of the eligible loss. Eligible loss is not necessarily confined to the amount of an investment that may be lost; it can also extend to the costs of replacement trustees and other expenses.
Payment of less than 100 per cent financial assistance seeks to address moral hazard concerns. In particular, it ensures that fund members bear at least some responsibility for any losses, have incentives to monitor their accounts and check that funds are being managed in a prudent manner. Were the Senate to support the government's choice legislation, any arguments about investors being trapped in some fund being inappropriately managed would be at least addressed by members being able to choose a fund that is managed appropriately. The government's approach to compensation also ensures that the cost of losses resulting from theft or fraudulent conduct is shared equitably between members of funds who have suffered losses and other superannuation fund members through financial assistance levies imposed on all funds.
Capping financial assistance is also consistent with international practice and other government assistance programs. Comparable overseas financial assistance schemes generally limit the compensation paid through either a percentage or a monetary cap. The fact that something might be done in other jurisdictions is not necessarily an indication that the Australian jurisdiction should fall into line or be the same. We can be out in front and often are. I think our superannuation system is arguably one of the best in the world. If other jurisdictions do not provide 100 per cent compensation, it does tend to suggest that there is a carefully thought out position not only in this jurisdiction that something less than 100 per cent is appropriate. The United Kingdom's Pension Compensation Board limits payments of assistance to 90 per cent of loss suffered, except where a person is within 10 years of retirement and 100 per cent is paid. The OECD reports that countries such as Canada, the United States and France impose caps on payments while Japan and the United Kingdom provide a percentage based limit on compensation.
The government considers that determining the level of financial assistance should continue to be implemented using the existing arrangements in part 23 of the SI(S) Act. This will ensure that appropriate flexibility in the operation of these provisions is retained. The Senate's amendment to mandate the level of financial assistance would inappropriately limit the minister's ability to take into account public interest considerations when applying government policy. As I said a little earlier, I can envisage situations where 100 per cent may be appropriate; I have had cases where 100 per cent has not in all the circumstances been appropriate. 
Senator Sherry mentioned that I had used my part 23 powers a couple of times. I am reminded that, since becoming minister, I have actually made 802 determinations in a total amount in the order of $45 million in financial assistance to those investors who were the subject of fraud in relation to management of their investments. That was rightly so. It was something that needed to be done and it was appropriate that that response be made for those investors.
Before I go off the compensation issue—I had not proposed to actually respond to Senator Sherry's sort of set speech whenever we have a debate on superannuation—it is appropriate that I note my advice is, in the other place this morning, Senator Sherry's colleagues were of the view that Labor would not be insisting on these amendments. I do not know if it is just one more policy confusion or backflip, whether it could not be held onto for a couple of hours or the party has changed its view since this morning. It is certainly very difficult to run these matters in the Senate when you get a totally contrary indication in the House of Representatives.
I want to take this time in the committee stage of the debate to make a few comments on defined benefit funds and the reporting requirements for defined benefit funds. The government will not be supporting the Senate's amendment to the Superannuation Safety Amendment Bill 2003 requiring defined benefit funds to report annually to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority on their financial position and for APRA to publish information on its web site concerning the financial position of defined benefit funds.
The government considers that the current provisions provide appropriate protection to members and ensure that they have sufficient information upon which to make informed decisions about their superannuation. The Financial Services Reform Act and associated regulations already require information on the management, financial position and investment performance of superannuation funds to be provided on at least an annual basis. This information includes audited fund accounts or abridged financial statements and details of fund reserves. In relation to defined benefit funds, the trustees are also required to report to members when employer sponsor contributions are less than an actuarially approved amount. The trustee must also tell members the consequences of the shortfall for the fund and what action the trustee will take in relation to the shortfall. 
The financial services reform regime also requires the ongoing disclosure of material changes and significant events to members of superannuation funds, which may include a significant event relating to solvency. In addition, members of the public may request copies of the audited accounts of a superannuation entity. In meeting a request, funds must provide a copy of the auditor's report, even if this has not been specifically requested. The introduction of further reporting requirements for defined benefit funds would impose additional costs on both the funds and APRA for what must be regarded as minimal, if any, additional benefit. These costs may indeed make defined benefit funds less attractive to employer sponsors. Labor's amendments would tie defined benefit funds up in further red tape for little perceived benefit, or indeed none at all. 
I have a few final comments in relation to the urgency of the bill. I am very mindful at this stage of the progress of this bill that it is urgent; indeed that has already been noted by Senator Cherry. I urge senators to consider the importance of these improvements to superannuation safety and to support the bill, as amended by the government, without insisting on further amendments. It is vital that the bill pass the Senate before the end of the autumn sittings on 1 April 2004 in order for the reforms to commence on time. Should the bill not pass the Senate in the autumn sittings, it would not be possible to finalise the supporting regulations and operating standards for consideration by the Executive Council until immediately prior to the commencement date of the reforms. 
I was asked about the progress of the regulations. As would be well known, the government released discussion papers regarding the regulations and operating standards for industry consultation in December last year, and submissions were sought by the end of February. My information is that the regulations are currently being drafted and that I can anticipate them being finalised in early May and ready for the Executive Council in mid-May. 
Delaying passage of the bill would also prevent APRA from finalising its guidance material—which is probably as important as anything else that industry might need—which will help to ensure that industry fully understands and is able to meet and comply with its obligations. Industry has indicated the importance of having all the elements of the new supervisory regime in place well in advance of the transition period for the reforms, in order, quite understandably, to provide certainty and to assist in the smooth implementation of the reforms.
I commend to the Senate the strong model that the government has developed for the safety of superannuation, which has been widely consulted on and carefully developed. I regret that the Australian Labor Party is unable to support what are unarguably significant advances in relation to securing the safety of the retirement incomes of Australians. I thank the Australian Democrats for their support of this legislation as amended by the government.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION SAFETY AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,3,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2004-03-31,"—Firstly, the minister referred to my reference to compensation being awarded a couple of times and then stated that 802 compensation awards have been declared. Of course, the vast bulk of those 802 relate to one case—Commercial Nominees and all of its subentity trusts. Secondly, as I said, the Labor Party believes these are useful but very modest safety measures—very modest indeed—that do not go far enough for the reasons I have outlined. Thirdly, the minister touched on some of the international compensation provisions, and they certainly vary. What is different in Australia compared with the United Kingdom and the United States, which are two comparable systems, is that the UK and the US do not have compulsory private savings for superannuation or pensions in the private sector and Australia does.
—They have choice though.
—I accept that interjection and will get to it in a second because the minister is wrong. With respect to compensation for theft and fraud, in the United Kingdom the Labour Party is introducing a theft and fraud fund. It is a funded, separate legal entity that will provide compensation. But in the UK you are not dealing with 100 per cent of employees being in a compulsory, private sector superannuation system or private pension system as it is in the United Kingdom; you are dealing with a system where approximately 40 per cent—and it is rapidly declining, I have to say—of private sector workers, and public sector workers for that matter, are in private pension plans. You are dealing with a similar situation in the United States where a significant minority of workers are in private pension plans, either traditional defined benefit funds, as we know them, or what is known as 401K plans. So you are dealing with a minority of the work forces in both the UK and the US. 
In Australia, 90 per cent of Australian workers are in compulsory superannuation. The remaining 10 per cent of employees are not members because their earnings are too low. The Australian system is not unique in the world but, certainly compared with those two countries, it is unique in that it is compulsory and covers a much greater proportion of the employed work force.
I was not going to go back to the choice debate but the minister did interject and say that they have got choice. She is absolutely wrong. In the United States there is no choice of fund, as the minister would argue, at least in theory. There is investment choice within a fund, which the Labor Party has no argument with at all, but, if you are a member of a private sector pension plan in the United States and it is a defined benefit fund, you do not have choice in those circumstances. It is impractical. It just does not exist in the United States. If you are in a 401K plan in the United States, there is no choice of fund. You are a member of the fund that the employer provides in the United States in respect of 401K. There is certainly a vast range of investment choice within the 401K private sector retirement plans.
—Precisely.
—But that is not what you are referring to, Minister. In the United Kingdom, there was an experiment with choice of fund. Margaret Thatcher introduced choice of fund back in the 1980s. This is where an individual selects a fund to be a member of. In fact, the Thatcher government said to existing members of private pension plans in the United Kingdom, `You need to go and make a choice of fund.' Many did that. What happened? We had the largest financial scandal in UK history, if not anywhere around the world in the last 25 years. When members of private pension funds in the United Kingdom chose a fund, they got ripped off. They got ripped off, largely by exorbitant commission based selling, when they were convinced to move from one fund to another. This case is well known. It caused huge controversy in the UK at the time. The compensation industry ended up paying 11.5 billion because of the mis-selling scandal. The financial services industry had to pay this amount in compensation as a result of the mis-selling scandal as a direct consequence of the Thatcher government's ideological obsession with deregulating and imposing a model of choice of fund on the UK system.
This is an approach this government wants to emulate in part—not in whole, I have to say, but certainly in part. In response to the mis-selling scandal in the United Kingdom, the UK Labour government had to come back in, re-regulate the system in terms of the so-called choice option and impose a cap on fees and charges of, I think, one per cent. It had to re-regulate the system because of the mis-selling scandal that occurred at that time. It is not correct for the minister to interject with the assertion that they have choice in the United Kingdom and the US. It is just not correct.
—It is not compulsory.
—To take your interjection, the dangers of a mis-selling scandal are actually greater in a compulsory system because you are covering, in our case, approximately 90 per cent of the work force. But there is not a choice model—which this government is advancing—on offer in the United Kingdom or the US any more because they learnt some very bad lessons as a consequence. The so-called choice debate is one we will have on another day. ",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION SAFETY AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,3,1
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2004-03-31,"—There are two comments I want to make briefly because we are getting right off the track of this bill. Senator Sherry said that, because most of the decisions that relate to the exercise of my discretion relate to commercial nominees and the various entities associated with commercial nominees, that means I have used my discretionary powers a couple of times. Senator Sherry is wrong about that. I am required to make individual discretionary determinations. In fact, there have been 802, which is not a couple of times. They relate to determinations that require the exercise of ministerial discretion. It is simply wrong to say that I have exercised my discretion a couple of times in that regard.
In comparison with other countries, Senator Sherry is right in his observation that Australia is leading the world when it comes to a safe and broadly available retirement savings system. Even though not all workers have compensation, the impact on individuals is no less catastrophic. The United Kingdom, as I understand it, still caps the available compensation. The point I was making in relation to my interjection about choice is that superannuation is not compulsory in the United States, which was taken as an example. We all know that there is investment choice if one is a member of an employment fund in the United States, but the point that follows on from what Senator Cherry said is that obviously Australians do not currently, in many instances, have the choice of changing funds. Where it is not compulsory it oversees jurisdictions. Obviously in those circumstances the safety issues and the need for compensation may not be as compelling if there is greater and broader investment choice.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2004-03-31,"—I would like to make some general comments on the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Extension of Time Limits) Bill 2003 and the Senate amendments to it. From the debates on this bill in this place so far this week we have seen the true colours of the Minister for Family and Community Services. The minister had a chance to put forward a bill that is fair and that resolves some of the very difficult problems with the government's family tax benefit system, but with this bill she failed. Since June 2000, when the government introduced its family payments system, it has been an unqualified disaster. The system is grossly out of step with the lives of modern Australian families. Families are asked to do the impossible—that is, to estimate their income a year in advance—and then they are punished with large debts when they inevitably fail in that task or when their circumstances change through no fault of their own. The Commonwealth Ombudsman has criticised the rules, which he argues often result in unavoidable and large debts for families. Also, the Prime Minister's own work and family task force delivered to cabinet in December 2002, 15 months ago, a scathing report on the family payments system. 
In the face of all the problems, there has been no substantial action. This bill represents mere tinkering at the edges. Over the three years this scheme has operated, it has delivered to families 2.9 million incorrect payments—that is, 56 per cent of all payments have been incorrectly delivered—worth $2.5 billion. The percentage of families with family payment debts remains extremely high and the level of debt has also remained significant—at an average of around $900 for every family with an overpayment. There has been a significant increase in the percentage of families who are being underpaid throughout the year, with an average of $32.50 a fortnight forgone—and $32.50 a fortnight can be enormously significant in the life of a young child. These are the figures for the payments being forgone by families under this system, which has been, as I said, an unqualified disaster.
This dismal record speaks for itself, and it shines a light on the Howard government's blatant contempt for the wellbeing of Australian families. Labor is committed to root and branch reform of arrangements for families. This morning Mark Latham announced the first steps of Labor's commitment to a baby care payment for Australian mothers. Labor meets its commitment to paid maternity leave through its baby care payment, but this is also a commitment to assisting non-working mothers during the weeks and months after a baby is born. Following the birth of a baby, Labor will give eligible mothers a baby care payment, paid in fortnightly instalments, for a minimum period of 14 weeks. This payment will be $3,000 in 2005, but by the year 2010 the payment will rise to $5,380. What this payment represents is Labor's commitment to paid maternity leave. This is the first step in our setting out very detailed proposals to fix this unqualified disaster in family assistance and support.
I am proud we have made this statement today, because my first question in this place was about the maternity allowance scheme that was introduced by the then Labor government. What saddens me is that it has taken nine years to move beyond the down payment of just seven weeks of basic income support to a plan that will meet our international obligations and eventually deliver 14 weeks of income support at total minimum award rate level for Australian women who have babies. This will also deal with many other problems. For instance, Labor's proposal to date—and I stress this point—assesses income at the time of birth. It does not ask families, as the family tax benefit scheme does, to assess in advance their income over a 12-month period. It does an assessment of a family's income at their time of need. Unlike the baby bonus, it actually delivers income support at a family's time of need. This demonstrates our credentials and our plans for what we will do with the family payment system, and more detail will follow.
In the context of this bill, and our concern that the minister has not gone beyond the initial limited proposal to deal with family tax debts, it demonstrates that Labor will have a much more comprehensive plan. Our baby care payment—simple and easy to understand—will relieve the financial pressures on families at the time a baby is born, allowing mothers to recover from childbirth and care for their newborn baby.
This is just the start of Labor's reform drive. The family payment system must be reformed to end the cycle of debt created by the current flawed rules. The minister knows the system is flawed. The Prime Minister told the minister's predecessor in a letter last year that Australian families had seen nothing from this minister. That is why Labor has made amendments to the bill before us today. This bill extends top-up payments to half the people who missed out on them. We welcome what it does but we are very scornful that it does not help everyone. We know that a group of families numbering more than 25,000 were denied over $37 million in 2000-01 family tax benefit entitlements, at an average of almost $1,500 per family. These families deserve—and, I stress, need—that money. 
The Australian community has become extremely cynical about measures such as the $1,000 waiver that John Howard introduced before the last election to try to buy off families' concerns about this flawed system. In part, this is what a measure such as this is. It is very limited and it does not deal with the flaws of the system. Anyone following the political cycle needs to be extremely cynical. We were told at the time of the $1,000 waiver that it would only be necessary for the first year—people would get used to the system, debts would start falling and the numbers of families involved would start falling. But none of this has happened. The number and size of family tax debts has not gone down. The government claims administrative hurdles prevent it from being more generous.
—You're misleading the chamber, you know.
—Minister, why can't you release a public notice or place ads if there is no other way to contact families? The truth is that the government does not want to try, because it does not want to give families their due. We have seen over the last few days from the leaked cabinet-in-confidence document that this minister is more concerned about achieving $2 of cuts for $1 of benefit in this budget than about being more generous to families who are missing out under her system. The government ought to remember that it encouraged families to claim at the end of the year or to seek a catch-up payment to minimise the risk of getting into debt. Now it has said to these families, `You can't have your entitlements unless you're within a particular time frame.' This is an extraordinary double standard when the department is now cross-matching families' income circumstances and pursuing debts up to 10 years old. It is a considerable double standard. Labor has no problems with the 12-month limit for families to lodge tax returns for compliance purposes, but this has nothing to do with the eligibility for past period claims. If a family subsequently proves its entitlement, it should be paid the benefits. 
I would also like to address howls from the government that Labor did not provide any sort of top-up payment. We have heard this consistently from the minister during question time, but now I have an opportunity to demonstrate that this argument simply does not stack up. The previous family payment system had very little use for top-up payments because most families were paid on the basis of their previous year's income. With wages growth, this was a very generous system because it allowed families to be paid greater payments than they would have been eligible for if a prospective annual income test had been used. But more importantly—and this has had to be drawn out of the department quite painfully at past estimates hearings—for those whose income was going to fall or rise, the system had a 10 per cent income buffer which allowed families to retain all entitlements, even if their actual income was up to 10 per cent more than their estimate. No such buffer exists in this system. 
This is a despicable attitude from a government that simply does not value the contribution that families make. Our amendments and those of the Australian Democrats attempt to address this top-up issue and a range of other problems in the system. Labor has moved an amendment that seeks to address the government's clandestine recovery of family assistance debts through family tax returns, without consent. Currently, when a family accrues a family assistance debt, often without their knowledge, their tax return may be stripped to recover all or part of the overpayment. All of this occurs without warning to hapless families who were counting on the money for bills, or school fees or other such concerns. Most families do not even know they have a debt, let alone the fact that it may run into thousands of dollars. The government relies on the fine print in the TaxPack that says `refunds may be used to offset family assistance debts'. But the truth is that there is not so much as a phone call or a letter before the money is stripped.
The Ombudsman has called for an end to this practice, or at least to have a requirement whereby a family assistance debt may not be recovered from a tax return until a subsequent financial year. But have we seen any movement from the government on this issue? No. Labor's amendments seek to provide for written consent from families before debts are recovered from tax returns. This need not be an administrative burden. The consent could be contained in the TaxPack or on the annual income estimate forms that families are required to fill out, or at the time of an original claim. This would give families a greater sense of control.
The Democrats have moved an amendment that I would also like to comment on briefly. It deals with a clause that does not allow debts to be waived, even those which are the fault of Centrelink, unless a family can prove they are in financial hardship. Clearly this is a problem which requires reform. It is simply not good enough for government mistakes to be borne by families through the use of this slippery hardship clause. We recognise that this is a limited piece of legislation that offers some belated assistance to a small group of families. For this reason, we would be extremely reluctant to see it mired in this chamber. But I must stress: the government's intransigence, its unwillingness to address even basic flaws in the family payments system has created great community anger. Naturally enough, when people see legislation in the parliament that offers some hope of reform, they want their issue dealt with. I implore the government to reconsider its opposition to the very modest and sensible amendments which have been moved by Labor and the Democrats.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (EXTENSION OF TIME LIMITS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,4,1
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2004-03-31,"—The Family Assistance (Administration) Act 1999 deals principally with family tax benefit, FTB. In essence, the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Extension of Time Limits) Bill 2003 is aiming to ensure that families which have underestimated income for a period of the previous two years can now lodge late claims to receive a top-up. On the surface, that is a fine principle, it is a fine piece of legislation, but we Democrats see that there is an opportunity within the broader debate to deal with the very real problems with debt which are being encountered by families. Senator Collins touched on some of them. 
In essence, we are finding that many people are receiving debts through this process, some of which are caused by government departments and not by the citizens. As a result, families find that debt recovery is being undertaken by one of two process: either money is taken from their tax returns—which is inconvenient and a surprise, a shock and a difficulty for many families—or they are being presented with letters giving them up to 28 days to begin a process of repayment of debts which can be several thousands of dollars. The difficulty is that the debts are often incurred as a result of Centrelink error. Unlike the Social Security Act, which waives debts wrongly incurred by the department, this measure is not accommodated in the family assistance legislation. People can only argue for some kind of humane method of repayment if they can prove some kind of hardship. We have heard throughout the course of this debate that many families may only be in receipt of welfare payments yet still are not being considered to be in hardship. The Social Security Act 1991 makes it clear in section 1237A(1) that: 
Subject to subsection (1A), the Secretary must waive the right to recover the proportion of a debt that is attributable to an administrative error made by the Commonwealth if the debtor received in good faith the payment or payments that gave rise to that proportion of the debt.
So we have this discrepancy under the Social Security Act where debts are waived when it is the fault of the government department, but that is not the case when the debt is the fault of Centrelink. We came to this debate thinking that this was a very good opportunity—indeed, the only opportunity—to broaden the discussion and ameliorate the difficulties through the debts that are being incurred. Our amendments went to three core elements which we thought should have been in the legislation. Firstly, where an administrative error was made by Centrelink and a family incurred debt, that debt should be waived; secondly, Centrelink should provide very clear options in an unambiguous way for clients to begin the process of repayment when the error was made by them; and, thirdly, one of our original amendments was to ensure that in repaying a debt a client ought not be in a position where they were repaying more than 50 per cent of their total income. We accept in retrospect that that was a well-meaning and clumsy attempt by us to ensure that families were not placed into particular financial difficulty but the minister did say that it would be the case that families in that situation would not be in a position of paying any greater than 14 per cent, which is a far better option nonetheless and something which we agree with. We have not yet seen, I do not believe, any real administrative process for dealing with and addressing that. In approaching the legislation, we were trying with our amendments to harmonise the treatment of family tax payment with the provisions in the Social Security Act of waiving the debt when the error is Centrelink's and the person has received the money in good faith. 
The key difference between the Social Security Act and the Family Assistance (Administration) Act is that the family assistance bill requires that the recipient who received the money in good faith can only have the debt waived if they can demonstrate financial hardship. There are two key problems with that: firstly, people often do not know about the provision and certainly Centrelink does not make them aware of it; and, secondly, the Welfare Rights Network can recite many cases of people who are on pensions or benefits with debts of $2,000 or more but who are not considered to be in financial hardship, begging the question: if people in that scenario are not, who is? During the committee stage of this debate on 13 October the minister said:
I have not done the costings for this amendment but I believe it would be enormously costly. 
I think that is an extraordinary statement and admission. Effectively, what the minister is acknowledging is the considerable extent of Centrelink error. The minister went on to say: 
It will also mean that, because somebody had made an error in entering the data, some people either get a top-up they do not deserve or a bill that they do not deserve at the end and which should have been dealt with during the year.
We would say let us keep the wedge politics out of this debate and concentrate on getting Centrelink to do its job properly. We believe the incentive, if we can build it into legislation before having to pay for poor administration, should help enormously. There is considerable anecdotal evidence suggesting that most errors are not caused by people underestimating their income but by computer and calculation errors in making arrears payments or dealing with where a dependant child, for example, moves from FTP to youth allowance, or Centrelink gives the wrong proportions of family tax benefit A and B. 
It can be complex, and staff can get it wrong and families have no idea what they are entitled to. So there is a range of questions that come out of that for Minister Patterson. I think the minister needs to answer: what is the number so far of families who have had changes to their payments made in this financial year because of changed circumstances? What is the number of overpayments raised last financial year due to underestimates of annual income? What is the number of overpayments made due to family changes in composition? What was the number of overpayments due to administrative error? We also need to know what level of Centrelink error might be prepared to be tolerated and accepted by the government. What is the average annual income for those people who want a top-up through the tax system in 2002-03 versus the annual income of those people who received an overpayment debt?
In considering this legislation, we introduced a raft of amendments which were aimed at harmonising this situation. For example, amendment (3) went to the heart of trying to ensure integrity of debt recovery. We are not bleeding hearts about this for the sake of it; we want to ensure that a deadline is not imposed on people about making choices of options. The point is that this was a way of giving people two weeks to make a decision about how they would repay, after which Centrelink could determine it. The 10-day option was introduced so that people have to state their choice of repayment option within an administratively feasible time. The minister has told us that already people have 28 days, but all they are given is 28 days to pay. This is quite a different proposition and as such we intend to insist on amendment (3) and others.
Our amendment (5) went to the heart of social security issues relating to repayment amounts. Unlike social security payments—where there is a protection that the maximum withheld will be 14 per cent in the event of overpayment—there is no such legislative protection for family tax benefit. The point of the amendment was to give such protection in legislation, as opposed to protection in policy or administration. Minister Patterson has suggested to me in informal discussions that our amendment was clumsy, and I acknowledge that. My staff and I have indicated to the minister that we would be pleased to change the amendment to better reflect current practice—which she advised me was more generous in terms of the government's proposal—should she wish to provide that amendment. But the proposal was not forthcoming. There has not been any further discussion or negotiation on that. 
The minister has indicated that she wants people who are receiving FTB to be better informed about their entitlements, that forms will be fixed and that the seven choices—that we have spoken about and heard about—she has heralded will mean that people will, hopefully, make mistakes less often. While that might be the case, the minister has not taken the opportunity to persuade us of that. She did not reply when we asked why the family assistance officer letter copy, which we discussed, was different from the one that she provided that came forward with options. The minister also did not provide information, as requested, about Centrelink guidelines on debt recovery, and the minister did not provide us with any legislative and administrative options that could satisfy us that people would be subject to less debt due to Centrelink error. I would have been more than happy to have negotiated with the minister but that option was closed. 
In return for a top-up for 30,000 families, we would like some guarantee that the administration of a flawed policy is less harsh on those 645,000 families who incurred a debt. We are not talking about policy—and if we are, then it is micropolicy. We are talking about the administration of government policy—administration being the key point—and trying to ameliorate the harmful effects of poorly thought out and flawed policy. It is our view, therefore, that the amendments that the Senate originally agreed to should remain.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (EXTENSION OF TIME LIMITS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,4,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2004-03-31,"—First of all, I was very encouraged by the forthright support for the family that was offered by Senator Collins in her address to the committee. This is a matter which will in fact be of such great importance within the next few months. It will be very interesting to see what emerges from the budget in respect of family policies. Family policies will determine, in my view, the outcome of the next election. Of course, this measure that we are discussing at the moment does not deal with the broad issues—to which Senator Collins adverted—that need to be dealt with at some time. This measure deals with the issue of top-ups for a number of families—approximately 35,000, as far as this legislation is concerned, or more if the legislation is amended.
The legislation is troubling for this reason: it has become an exercise in legislative brinkmanship, and that concerns me as a member of this chamber. In essence, I was told by the government that senators had to accept the legislation unamended, as there was no longer time to take account of amendments due to the setting up of computer systems to implement this legislation—take it or leave it. But if I decide to leave it, the government have said to my office, with little subtlety, that it will publicise the names of senators who denied those 35,000 families a top-up of their family assistance bonus. It is a petty and childish approach—even a child would not do that. They can publish my name as much as they like, but my primary concern is to see that Australian families do not miss out on those benefits. Of course, my immediate inclination is to say, `You please yourself and go down that track.' But my duty is to those 35,000 families, who are missing out on average, I think, about $600. The minister might remind me. 
I insisted to the minister, in a meeting with her, that information should be provided by the Australian Taxation Office and Centrelink with respect to this particular problem—that is, the set-up time for computer systems to implement the legislation. It was my concern that Australian families not miss out on benefits that led me to support the opposition's amendments and request with regard to the legislation. I supported the opposition's proposals. Briefly, the opposition has proposed that even more time be allowed for families to submit their tax returns so that even more families would potentially be eligible for government benefits. That seemed reasonable to me. I was also happy to support allowing families to give their consent to debt recovery through tax returns. I agree that it is important that steps be taken to help families to minimise any debts that they may have incurred through the family payments system. But more needs to be done to allow them to be informed of that possibility, rather than money disappearing from their tax refund. Many families have tight budgets and plan carefully where their tax refund money will go—to pay particular debts and so on. So it is not reasonable to take money without them giving informed consent. 
In meeting with Senator Patterson I was not able to argue past a number of administrative snarls that appear to be dictating government policy on this issue—and, I am told, dictating what the Senate can realistically do to amend the legislation. I met with the minister on this issue last week, and we discussed what was and was not possible according to advice from the Australian Taxation Office and Centrelink. I do not want to be unreasonable and support amendments which are impossible administratively, but I am concerned that administrative restrictions, dictated largely by what I see as the rigidity of computer systems, are impeding decisions by the Senate and impeding what it can and cannot do. That really is not acceptable.
I asked Senator Patterson why we could not give Australian families even longer extensions of time, as suggested by the opposition. Senator Patterson said that severed datalinks between the Australian Taxation Office and Centrelink meant that this was not possible without significant work going through paper files. I asked whether the Senate could make appropriate amendments to reverse the severed links, and I was told that this was not possible. To convince me of the administrative impediments to amending the bill, the minister agreed to get further information direct from the ATO explaining why there were these problems. I assume that that came direct from the ATO, through Senator Coonan. Senator Coonan relayed advice from the Commissioner of Taxation that delays in passing this legislation could lead to costs of around $200,000 for three months extra administrative work, which of course would delay families getting their money.
So the situation, as put to me, is that I can support extra money for the 35,000 families who would otherwise not be eligible for top-ups to their family payments or I and other senators can be held responsible for denying those benefits to families. I am told that I cannot extend the time limit further to allow even more families in. The minister has said that the Taxation Office has advised that, if the legislation is passed without amendment on or before tomorrow, 1 April, the ATO will be able to incorporate the two-year extension for lodging tax returns into their system update for this year, and the datalink between the ATO and Centrelink will be available for the 2001-02 income year. The minister stated in writing to me that any amendments to the legislation, even if passed by 1 April 2004—that is, tomorrow—could not be incorporated by either the ATO or Centrelink. That presents us with a real difficulty.
I conclude by saying that I am still inclined to support amending the legislation to stop families having overpayments deducted from their tax refund without their consent. I believe that that could be taken on board by the minister and by the government. Surely that could be done administratively, by appropriate directions. But I am in a difficult situation and I know that the Senate has been placed in a difficult situation. I insisted on getting and I obtained—I thank the minister—information from the ATO and Centrelink. Obviously, these organisations would not deliberately mislead. If that information turns out to be inaccurate then they will be caught out, but I have to take it on face value since they have put it in writing. As I say, that leaves us in a difficult situation with regard to deciding the issue on the basis of not denying a substantial number of people a substantial amount of money.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2004-03-31,"—A number of senators, including Senator Harradine and I, put some issues to the government for explanation in this debate and there has been no response. I can understand if Senator Patterson does not want to make a contribution in this debate. I was somewhat perturbed that, during my contribution, she interjected and accused me of misleading the chamber. Yet I find it interesting that Senator Harradine has exactly the same explanation of what the government provided to him as indeed has been my advice. It seems there is some question before the chamber now from Senator Patterson as to what other senators in this place have been informed on this matter. We are very disturbed that Senator Patterson has not responded to any of these issues. I invite Senator Patterson to do so before we vote on the matter. If not, then we are in the chamber's hands and obviously we proceed from there.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (EXTENSION OF TIME LIMITS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,4,1
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2004-03-31,"—I outlined the government's position on the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Extension of Time Limits) Bill 2003 when it was before the chamber previously. A message has come from the House of Representatives with regard to the bill. I am conscious that Senator Collins made some comments about FTB overpayments not going down. They have gone down. When you compare the ongoing figures for the relevant quarters with last year's results, you find that the number of overpayments has gone down, the level of overpayments has gone down, the number of top-ups has gone up and the number of people who are receiving top-ups will go up. Do not let the truth get in the way of a story: that is Labor's approach. With regard to some of the issues that Senator Greig raised, there was a request for information which involved a huge amount of data. We gave him as much of this data as we possibly could to be of assistance.
I know Senator Harradine feels strongly about the issue of people's tax returns not being reconciled. But this is a joint Centrelink-ATO payment. There are other moneys that people receive that do not have PAYE tax taken out of them. As I have said before—I think it was in the previous debate on this bill—some people may have a small shareholding and get a very small dividend. At the end of the year they may feel a bit miffed that a third of it has to go in tax, but they understand that. It is about reconciling what we owe to the taxpayer and what the taxpayer owes us at the end of the financial year with regard to our tax and family tax benefit.
Over and again we hear of people's concern about the level of debt of families—and I am concerned about this as well. I do not think it is appropriate to encourage families to go further into debt. If there is money from their tax that is in credit and they have had more assistance from the taxpayer over the year than they were entitled to, compared with a family in a similar circumstance during that 12-month period, then we believe it is appropriate and right that it should be reconciled as far as possible at the time. All we would be doing, if we were to support the amendment, would be to make families go further into debt.
The bill is about families who have not lodged their tax return. It would have been nice to get the bill through sooner, because not doing so continues to create some problems at this late date. I would encourage families to lodge their tax return; it makes it easier. It does surprise me that some people do not lodge their tax return—but I suppose it was a former Prime Minister who set the example of getting your tax return in late. I encourage families to lodge their tax returns. But for those families who have not, we have extended the time period so that they can get a top-up. We think there are about 35,000 families who will get that top-up. That is what this legislation is about.  
The government were unable to accept the amendments to the bill. As I said to Senator Harradine, when people write to me about the top-up and about not getting it back in, I have to say to them that the government put an amendment before the house but that we could not agree with other amendments attached to it and, therefore, the bill was unable to go forward. I have to explain that that is what happens when you put legislation forward and it is not supported. 
I believe this is important legislation. It has a time limit on it for a number of reasons—one is the updating of the computer systems and the other is that we have delinked data between Centrelink and the ATO to protect people's privacy. We had a cut-off point, which is one of the factors that have affected this legislation. We are saying that we want to extend this cut-off point. It will catch some people—about 35,000—who have put their tax return in late and who will receive a top-up. It is beneficial. We can have a debate about the other issues at another time, but it was important to debate this one because of the time factor. I have had some assurances that we will get the support to take the bill through. That would mean that about 35,000 families would be better off by over $700 or $800 on average.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (EXTENSION OF TIME LIMITS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,4,1
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2004-03-31,"—It was very interesting to hear Senator Patterson say that the bill was very time critical and that it needed to come forward, because my understanding of where this legislation was sitting on the House of Representatives bills list was as a matter not to be dealt with urgently—and all of a sudden it appeared today. I think it more reflects some of the pressure that the minister has been under this week from some of the information that has now become publicly available about what the government's plans might be. 
Indeed, what the minister did not deal with was Senator Harradine's concern. The issue that even some very childish threats might be made against senators during this process is, I think, very concerning. But the substantial issues still remain. The minister knows that there has been nowhere near the decline in the level and number of debts that families are experiencing under this system. If you go back to the $1,000 waiver that the Prime Minister introduced and to his claims that the system would work out over time, that families would come to understand it and adapt to it, you find that none of that has happened. 
What the minister has not addressed, for instance, is the Ombudsman's views about what should occur with tax stripping. There is a very clear recommendation there that, at the very least, we should make it the prospective year ahead rather than the current year for tax stripping. But no, that is being ignored. The government is just simply being mean in some of these matters. They will not cost a considerable amount of money. It is sheer intransigence. Having the minister deal with this matter as she has today, without clear and adequate address to the issues at hand, stresses the concern we all have. None of us here want to hold back money to 35,000 families, but the manner in which this matter has been dealt should be of serious concern to all senators in the chamber.

"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2004-03-31,"—Senator Collins said that FTB overpayments had not gone down. There was also a comment by Senator Greig—and I will stand corrected if this is not correct—that most overpayments were Centrelink errors. That is not correct. Centrelink officers undertake about 4.2 billion transactions a week. I think that works out to something like 19 million transactions on a working day. Yes, there will be errors. Sometimes the error is due to the officers, sometimes the error is due to the clients and sometimes the error is due to a mixture of both. Every effort is made to reduce those errors. 
If I were a shareholder in a bank and that bank made the error of depositing $500 into somebody else's account, I am not sure that as a shareholder I would be very impressed if the bank said, `We don't need to actually recoup that; we made an error.' This is taxpayers' money. Centrelink tries as hard as possible to reduce the number of errors; but, in the end, it is about families in similar circumstances receiving the same amount of money. We can always do better to reduce the errors, but it is difficult to argue that a family should receive more than it is entitled to. 
If the money was received in good faith and it was an administrative error—and this rule applies to all tax payments; as I said, this is a hybrid between Social Security and Tax—and there is hardship, there is the opportunity for waiver. So there is a condition there. What we want to do in any system in which we are using taxpayers' money is to treat families in similar circumstances in the same way. That is what we are about and that is why there has always been that rule when dealing with the tax office in terms of errors. As I said, this is a hybrid between Tax and Centrelink. 
I am not going to say any more on this legislation, except that the bill is about giving families who put their tax returns in late an opportunity to get money to which they were entitled because they had a top-up due to them as a result of being underpaid in a family tax benefit. I think it is important that the chamber gets the legislation through. It was not a childish threat, as Senator Collins said. I was stating the facts. People write to me and ask: `Why haven't you done this? I've got my tax in late. I need a top-up.' I explained to Senator Harradine that I have to say to them, `We put a bill forward; we could not accept the amendments'—people can make a judgment on whether or not we should have accepted the amendments—`and this is why we were not able to proceed with it.' That is not a threat; that is reality.
If the opposition fails to support something, or opposition members or Independents fail to support something, it is legitimate to say: `We had a go at it. We didn't agree with their amendments. Now let the public make a decision as to whether we should have agreed with the amendments or not, but that is the reason we didn't continue with it.' That was not some sort of childish threat; I was just explaining that people were writing in saying they wanted their top-up. I was saying that we had legislation before the house, which had been stalled because of amendments we could not accept and, if they were not accepted, I would continue to write to people in the same vein, which I think is legitimate. But it was not some childish threat, as Senator Collins called it. I think Senator Harradine understood what I was saying.

"Senator EGGLESTON,",LP,2004-03-31,"—Napoleon Bonaparte famously said, `Let China sleep', but there is no doubt that China has woken and is becoming an increasingly important economy not only in the Asian region but, more importantly, in the world. China, as we all know, is the world's most populous nation, with approximately 1.3 billion people. It has the world's fastest growing economy and is rapidly becoming an economic giant. As a result of market reforms, China's economy has experienced a long period of substantial economic growth and has become the sixth-largest in the world. Between 1978 and 2001, its gross domestic product grew at an average annual rate of more than nine per cent, peaking at 14.2 per cent in 1992. As a result, China's GDP has quadrupled since 1978. In 2003, its economy grew by 9.1 per cent and, assuming its reforms stay on track, high rates of growth are predicted to continue.
China is a vitally important trading partner for Australia. As China's economy continues to grow, so too will its importance to Australia. Since the mid-1990s, we have witnessed nearly a trebling of our two-way trade with China. In 2002-03, it was our third-largest merchandise trading partner, up from ninth in 1990. With trade to the value of $22.6 billion, comprising exports of $8.8 billion and imports of $13.8 billion, this represents export growth of 12.5 per cent and import growth of 22.3 per cent on the previous year. In 2002-03 our services trade with China had a value of $1.9 billion. Australia's exports to China have been growing strongly. Between 1995 and 2001, they increased at an average rate of 16 per cent annually. However, this strong rate of export growth has been matched by imports from China, which have experienced annual average growth of 17 per cent since 1995. The result is that, in 2002-03, Australia experienced a trade deficit with China to the tune of almost $5 billion.
The Australian and Chinese economies are highly complementary. As a major exporter of primary commodities, Australia is well placed to feed China's insatiable demand for raw materials to fuel its economic growth. According to the economic analytical unit of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade:
Vastly different Australian and Chinese economic endowments and strengths mean Australia faces relatively little competition from China in export markets and strongly complements China as a trading partner. As a net exporter of many products China demands, particularly minerals, energy and agricultural commodities, Australia is well placed to benefit from its rapid growth. Australia also is a large net importer of goods China supplies to world markets, including a wide variety of more labour intensive consumer goods.
In 2001, primary commodities comprised just over 80 per cent of the value of our exports to China, whereas manufactured goods made up 86 per cent of Australia's imports from China. Australia's major imports from China include textiles, clothing and footwear, computers, cameras, mobile phones, toys and sporting goods.
We live in a world of increasing trade liberalisation. China's accession to the World Trade Organisation at the end of 2001 will eventually result in enhanced market access and associated opportunities for Australian exporters. According to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, China has committed to reducing a range of trade and investment barriers. Industries that are expected to benefit are the wool, sugar, wheat, barley, meat, seafood, horticulture, dairy, cotton, rice, oilseeds, wine, processed foods, hides and skins, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, metals, information technology and auto-motive sectors. In late October 2003, Australia and China signed a trade and economic framework to enhance trade and investment and promote cooperation in various key fields. As part of the framework, both countries have agreed to undertake a joint feasibility study into a free trade agreement. 
China is second only to the United States of America in its consumption of energy and is highly dependent on coal. Natural gas consumption in China is predicted to grow strongly as a result of China's rapidly growing economy and as a more environmentally friendly replacement to coal-fired electricity generation. China's latest five-year plan makes clear that natural gas will play a larger role in the country's energy mix in the future. Given the significant reserves of natural gas off the north-west coast of Western Australia, the increasing emphasis on natural gas in China presents obvious opportunities for Australia. However, the magnitude of the opportunities will ultimately depend on a variety of factors, including China's ability to meet its needs from its own domestic reserves. ABARE believes that, for reasons of energy security, China will seek to diversify its sources of natural gas. Of course, Australia will be one of a number of producers in the Asia-Pacific region that will compete to supply natural gas to China. However, our natural advantages include our stable security and economic environment, our political security and our legal system. These things give Australia an important competitive edge in terms of ensuring security of supply of LNG.
In August 2002 the North West Shelf venture was successful in securing the largest ever single export deal in the history of the country when it was selected as the sole supplier of gas to China's first ever LNG project in the province of Guangdong. In a deal worth up to $25 billion, the North West Shelf will supply 3.7 million tonnes of LNG annually over 25 years, commencing in mid-2006, and possibly rising to five million tonnes by 2008. The proposed Gorgon venture, off the north-west coast of Western Australia, is also important in terms of the possibility of sales to China. On 24 October 2003 the Gorgon venture signed an agreement with the China National Offshore Oil Corporation to supply LNG to China. This agreement is subject to final contracts and, according to the Gorgon joint venture participants, will see:
... CNOOC Limited ... purchase a substantial equity stake in the Gorgon gas development, and its parent, CNOOC will arrange to purchase foundation volumes of LNG from Gorgon for use in China. CNOOC will also assist Gorgon to secure markets in China for a further designated amount of LNG.
Assuming that final contracts are signed, the deal will involve a substantial amount of LNG and further significant export earnings for Australia. Indeed, it could be worth from $20 to $30 billion over the 25-year period from 2008.
In respect of agriculture, China is expected to move away from producing broadacre crops. Its imports of agricultural produce are predicted to expand by an average of 15 per cent each year until 2010. This will provide increased export opportunities for wheat, barley, animal feeds, beef and other land intensive crops. In 2001 tourism and education were amongst Australia's top 10 exports to China and are viewed as being an area of significant potential. In 2000-01 tourism and education made up 53 per cent of our service exports to China. The approximately 30,000 Chinese students studying in Australia make China our top source of international students. The attractiveness of Australia as a study destination was underscored in 2001-02, when visas granted to Chinese students increased by a massive 51 per cent and by a further six per cent in the following year. Now we have a very large number of Chinese students studying in this country. 
China is Australia's sixth largest source of tourists, which is a surprising statistic. In 2002 there were 190,000 visitors from China to Australia, compared to just 22,000 in 1993. It is a measure of the value placed on bilateral relations that we are one of few Western nations to have been granted approved destination status in China, allowing group tourism to this country. Since the scheme commenced in August 1999, around 100,000 Chinese group tourists have visited Australia. The announcement in October 2003 of the gradual expansion of the tourism scheme to eventually cover all of China is proof of the success of the scheme and will further boost tourist numbers. The Tourism Forecasting Council expects China to be our fastest growing market over the decade from 2002. Likewise, China has become a popular destination for Australian travellers, with 26,500 visitors in 1993, compared to almost 137,000 in 2002. The Tourism Forecasting Council is predicting that Australian tourism to China will grow more strongly than in any other main destination market in the decade from 2002 with average annual growth of 6.8 per cent, compared to average growth of 2.8 per cent across the board. By 2012, it is forecast that approximately 263,000 Australians will visit China annually.
In summary, China's economic rise has been remarkable and has been and will continue to be mutually beneficial to China and Australia, as Australia supplies China with the raw materials to fuel its industrial growth and China supplies Australia with relatively inexpensive labour-intensive manufactured goods. Beyond the economic synergies and trade considerations, it has to be said that China is playing an increasingly significant role in regional and world affairs. There can be no doubt that the development of our relationship with China will be at the forefront of Australian government policy considerations from here on into the foreseeable future. China indeed has awakened from its long sleep.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Foreign Affairs: China</title>,Matters of Public Interest,5,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2004-03-31,"—Last Thursday in the Senate, Senator Allison asked me, as the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, a question about water contamination at the Ranger mine. I have quite a lengthy answer from the Minister for the Environment and Heritage and I seek leave to incorporate it in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The answer read as follows—
I would like to reiterate the Government's concern that the mining company allowed this incident to occur. It should not have happened, and I have asked the Supervising Scientist to work with the mining company and the NT Government to ensure that appropriate mechanisms are put in place to prevent a recurrence.
Senators will be aware that in any mining operation, indeed any industrial operation, accidents or incidents will occur. What is important is that systems are in place to ensure the early detection of these incidents and to ensure the protection of people and the environment when incidents do occur:
There have been a number of events at the mine in the 20+ years since the mine started operating, and last week's event was at the more serious end of the scale. However, none of these events have caused any harm to the people or the environment outside the mine site. Just last year, in his submission to the Senate Inquiry on the Environmental Regulation of Uranium Mining, the Supervising Scientist provided a thorough analysis of all of these incidents. He concluded that, of the total of 122 incidents that had been reported at that time since mining began at Ranger in 1979, one incident has been assessed as being of moderate ecological significance and one incident has had significant impact on people working at the mine.
Given the proximity of the Ranger mine to Kakadu National Park, the Commonwealth expects nothing short of best practice environmental performance at the Ranger mine. 
This latest incident is clearly not good enough and will need addressing to ensure that it does not happen again. I must, however, note that the overall number of incidents reported is also an indication of the rigour of the reporting framework, and that not every incident is as serious as the one that occurred last week.
Since this issue was raised in the Senate last Thursday, the Supervising Scientist has advised me that, some of the contaminated water had been inadvertently discharged at the Jabiru airport, which is on the mine lease.
As soon as becoming aware of this incident, I immediately asked the Supervising Scientist to carry out tests to assess what, if any, impact may have occurred to the external environment. Over the weekend, tests were conducted, and I was pleased to see that the Supervising Scientist was able to formally advise that the people and the environment of Kakadu National Park had not been harmed by the leak of contaminated water from last week's leak. This news provides an assurance to the area's Traditional Owners and other Aboriginal people that local bush tucker and creek water are safe to consume.
In relation to worker health issues, I can advise that approximately twelve mine workers have reported health issues, and both the mining company and the Supervising Scientist have sought specialist advice on possible health impacts.
Over the course of these events I have asked the Supervising Scientist to treat this issue extremely seriously, and he has informed ERA that operations at Ranger should not recommence until we have complete confidence that systems are in place that will not allow a similar incident to happen again and there is no risk to people or the environment.
As a result, the Ranger mine remains closed. Approximately twenty mine workers were allowed back on site last night, for maintenance operations only, and more are expected to return to site today. I must stress that these workers will be engaged in maintenance activities only and that no decision has been made on resumption of actual mining and milling operations. The NT Government regulators have concurred with the Supervising Scientist's assessments in relation to return to site issues.
It is likely that a decision on possible resumption of mining and milling operations at the mine might be made in the next few days.
The Supervising Scientist met with and briefed Traditional Owners, including Senior Traditional Owner Yvonne Margarula, at Jabiru yesterday, and also participated in a public forum in Jabiru in which approximately 150 Jabiru residents raised concerns about issues associated with last week's incident.
As to the question on possible punitive action, it is clearly too early to consider this issue.
I note that media reports this week suggest that the NT Government may consider legal action against the company. This is appropriate given the NT's responsibility for day-to-day mine regulation.
As Senators were advised last Thursday, I have asked the Supervising Scientist to conduct an immediate inquiry as his top priority. I expect to receive a full and comprehensive report from him once all the facts are known and that is when the Government will consider any possible punitive action.
Any recommendations made by the Supervising Scientist will be pursued by the Government, and any possible measures will be taken with the intention of ensuring that such incidents do not happen again.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Environment: Uranium Mining</title>,Questions Without Notice,11,1

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-03-31,"—Senator Allison informed my office shortly before question time that she intended to raise this matter. The history is that she put a series of questions on notice regarding the UNMOVIC weapons inspection process in the lead-up to the Iraq war. A number of these questions were rhetorical in their nature and, I respectfully suggest, were little more than an attempt to re-argue the reasons behind Australia's involvement in the Iraq war. Notwithstanding that interpretation, my office has contacted the Prime Minister's office and we are attempting to get the answer for Senator Allison as soon as possible.

That in the opinion of the Senate the following is a matter of urgency:
The need to address the Indigenous health emergency in Australian which sees the health of Indigenous Australians going backwards in a time of national prosperity, because of the failure of successive Governments to halt this decline, and that this crisis in Indigenous health be a priority in the upcoming Federal budget.
I thank the Senate for allowing the time for this urgency motion on a very important matter in this country. At a time of record national prosperity, the health and wellbeing of Indigenous Australians is in deep crisis. It is slipping further and further behind the health of other Australians and it urgently requires immediate action from all levels of government and, more particularly, the federal government. 
Australian Indigenous people now live 20 years less than the rest of the national population. When we look at the percentage of the population who are expected to live to the age of 65, most Indigenous people in this country will probably not get there. Indeed, compared to Third World countries, Australian Indigenous life expectancy is far below life expectancy rates in countries like Nigeria, Nepal, Bangladesh, India, Thailand, Vietnam and so on. The statistics are that twice as many Indigenous children are born at low birth weight and, in remote areas, they are three times more likely than non-Indigenous children to die before their first birthday. The major cause of illness is preventable infections.
Adult Aboriginal people are now hospitalised at about twice the rate of the rest of the population. Among Indigenous people, the rate of rheumatic heart disease is six to eight times higher; the rate of diseases of the circulatory system is about three times higher; respiratory disease is four times more common; and diabetes occurs four times more often. The rate of kidney disease among Indigenous people is nine times higher than the general rate for non-Indigenous people and, in some regions, 25 and even 60 times higher than the rest of the population. This is a situation of national shame and it affects us all. It is not just a sectional interest matter. It is not just about Indigenous people in this country; it has severe economic consequences for the entire nation. The cost of inaction now will blow out to unsustainable expense in the future.  
There is a common myth that this emergency affects only a few Indigenous people in remote areas. That is not true. It affects all Indigenous people. Many of the health problems are more visible in remote communities. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations live in urban, regional and remote areas and, as a whole, suffer from the same health problems I have described. There is a clear relationship between poor education, high unemployment, poverty, inadequate nutrition and poor health. When you couple these factors with over two centuries of dispossession, social exclusion and the like, it is no surprise that Indigenous Australians continue to have the worst health statistics of anyone in this country. 
Numerous reports in recent years and, most recently, last year's Productivity Commission report on overcoming disadvantage have described this crisis in heartbreaking detail. Gary Banks, the Chairman of the Productivity Commission, described the disparity in life expectancy of Indigenous Australians as a tragic loss and a waste for Indigenous people and Australia as a whole. Each of these reports has made recommendations to government about how to fix this situation. The government is yet to respond.
This morning we heard the Prime Minister saying that he thinks Indigenous people in Australia should not receive any special treatment and that everyone should be treated equally. This may appeal to aspiring One Nation voters, but the fact is that Indigenous people are not treated equally. If we want to talk about equality then treatment is exactly what they do not get. The practical reconciliation approach to Indigenous health by the Howard government can only be declared an unmitigated disaster. It has only ever promised little more than what we know has not worked in the past: mainstreaming of services, more government control and a lack of recognition of historical circumstances.
A key feature of this approach in recent years has been the historical scapegoating of ATSIC and, before that, the Department of Aboriginal Affairs as being responsible for all the major failings of Indigenous policy. The fact is that the blame for the state of Indigenous health cannot be laid at ATSIC's feet. ATSIC has no responsibility for health in this country. Health is handled through mainstream services at Commonwealth and state and territory level. People seem convinced that the government spend a lot more on Indigenous health than they do on mainstream Australia. This is simply not the case. As the Fred Hollows Foundation's recently released information kit states:
Indigenous health programs account for less than one per cent of Commonwealth funding of health services.
In 1998-99, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare calculated that for every dollar spent per year for the general population on schemes such as the MBS and PBS only 37c was spent per Indigenous person. Indigenous people have less access to general practitioners and instead usually go to community health services or public hospitals. This high hospital use reflects a failure to deliver adequate primary health care. More is spent on high-cost hospital treatment because too little is being spent on more community health care services which can help prevent serious illnesses that exist. 
I am aware that I am going to get two minutes at the end to sum up in this debate. I would hope that this important issue does not become a political football, because it requires full cross-party support to provide the solutions. It does not need each of the major parties to beat up on each other about their failures or who owned what policies and programs over what period of time.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2004-03-31,"—I thank Senator Ridgeway for proposing today's debate because the growing Indigenous health crisis in Australia is indeed a matter of urgency. It is disappointing that the Australian Democrats did not recognise this fact when they did their dirty deal with the coalition on the introduction of the GST, a regressive tax that has had a direct impact on the wellbeing of disadvantaged Australians, including Indigenous Australians—the very Australians subject to today's urgency debate.
While Senator Ridgeway is content to forget his party's not-too-distant betrayal of disadvantaged Australians, I can assure him that those on this side of the chamber have not. But at least Senator Ridgeway, the Democrats' spokesman on Indigenous affairs, is here talking about this important issue. I am pleased to join the debate on behalf of the Labor Party and will be joined by two Labor senators with a deep understanding of Indigenous disadvantage and with a close working relationship with Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory and Queensland.
The key person missing from this debate or at least not on the government's speaking list is the reluctant minister for Indigenous affairs, Senator Vanstone. She is the minister responsible for this government's appalling contribution to Indigenous health outcomes over the past eight years. She is the person answerable to the Senate and Indigenous Australians for the Howard government's lamentable performance on Indigenous health. So appalling has the performance been that I am hardly surprised she is not here. But that does not mean she should not be here accepting the responsibility for this crisis. I would encourage the minister to stop hiding in her office, stop hiding behind the junior government senators listed to speak in this debate, stop hiding behind her bureaucrats and stop hiding behind ATSIC.
The minister should come into this place and tell us why, under the Howard government, life expectancy for Indigenous females has declined. According to the latest report of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, the bitter fruit of the Howard government's so-called practical reconciliation agenda is an early death for Indigenous women, who now have a life expectancy of 62.8 years, which is lower than the life expectancy rate for females in India. Life expectancy for Indigenous men is just 56.3 years, which is lower than life expectancy for men in Burma, Papua New Guinea and Cambodia. It is so low that no Indigenous man can reasonably expect to ever claim the age pension, let alone make it to the Prime Minister's venerable stage of life. Under this Prime Minister, the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous life expectancy for men and women has grown. That is right; it has grown.
This month the Fred Hollows Foundation launched an information campaign on Indigenous health. It follows the campaign launched last month by Australians for Native Title and Reconciliation, which focused on the same shameful failure to deliver improved health outcomes for Indigenous Australians. One of the matters addressed by the Fred Hollows Foundation, which was surprisingly omitted from the motion before the chamber, is the link between the provision of decent housing, good education and improved health outcomes. It has long been known that people with unmet housing needs are likely to have poor general health, more chronic illness and higher death rates. The link between education and health outcomes is often overlooked but has been effectively highlighted by the Fred Hollows Foundation. The foundation has noted that poor education leads to fewer life opportunities, lower income and poor health outcomes. Conversely, poor health often leads to poor educational attainment. These are matters the Howard government has failed to come to grips with during its long period of office. It has used Indigenous disadvantage as little more than a wedge to divide Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. The government has talked about practical reconciliation but the only practical outcome it has been interested in is electoral gain from its practice of racial politics. 
The coalition had some practice at that in opposition when it mounted its disgraceful—never to be forgotten, in fact—race campaign in the wake of the Mabo judgment. Once, Mr Howard was pleased to provide tacit support to Liberal candidate and One Nation founder, Ms Pauline Hanson, when she was engaging in the most repellent sort of racist politicking. Now Mr Howard has got the dog whistle out and is giving it a big blow, using the sort of language employed by the conservative opposition leader in New Zealand.
—What's your Mabo legislation delivered for Aboriginal health? Absolutely nothing.
—Who wrote this rubbish?
—Order! If people stopped shouting, I could take the point of order.
—Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order going to two standing orders. One, this bloke is in breach of Senate standing orders by reading word for word a speech probably written by a junior staffer. Two, he has just called our Liberal Prime Minister racist, which is an absolutely intolerable slur against standing orders. I ask that he be brought to order on both standing orders.
—On the point of order, what I said was that the Prime Minister was engaging in racist politicking. That is quite different from the suggestion by Senator Ian Campbell, and I do not believe that is unparliamentary at all.
—What are you doing, you scumbag? You are a disgrace. Sit him down!
—This is the worst thing for Aboriginal people!
—It is unparliamentary to engage in the sort of conduct that the Manager of Government Business in the Senate, who continues to perform in the way that he usually does, through his petulant and childish activity, is engaging in in this chamber. He is now showing that he has no control over his temper, he is behaving in a most intemperate way and he ought to be counselled by the whip, who is sitting behind him and behaving in the same fashion.
—Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I am totally devastated by what has been happening here in the last couple of minutes. I thought we came in here today to have a fair dinkum plug for Indigenous health. What have we got? I appeal to you, Mr Deputy President, and to the Clerk of the Senate—
—There is no point of order. 
—There is a point of order, and that is that you should withdraw any imputation that this government is a racist government and that the people engaged by this government, including all the people in this chamber, are racist. I am absolutely disgusted with the person who wrote that speech, who obviously—with respect to the reader—was not the reader.
Honourable senators interjecting—
—Excuse me! I have heard the points of order. On the second point of order first: I have sought and listened to the advice of the Clerk, as well as weighed up the matter in my own mind, and there is no point of order. On the first point of order, in respect of the reading of speeches that seems to take place in this chamber: I would suggest that, if we are going to start applying that rule rigidly in this chamber, we will apply it to everyone. Whilst I hear what you say, there are technical matters that people do refer to in speeches and do read. If you want to pursue that point of order then if you desire I will take it up with the President and we will see where it goes from there. On the second point of order: there is no point of order. I did hear what you said and I did hear what Senator Heffernan said. It was skating close to the mark—
—Engaging in racist politics? It was unparliamentary and should be withdrawn!
—Wait a minute. It was skating close to the mark but the advice I have and the opinion I have formed is that it was not unparliamentary, as stated.
—Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order.
—Just let me finish my remarks, Senator Heffernan. I would advise you, Senator O'Brien, to be careful in how you describe and attribute motives to other people in this place.
—What I wanted to say was that the sort of language—
—Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. This government, and I think the Prime Minister, have been accused of engaging in racist politics. You have now ruled that in order.
—No.
—I would ask that you refer that ruling to the President and ask him to report back. This is a dangerous precedent and I would ask that, at the very least, you refer that to the President—that you give me and the Senate an undertaking that you will refer it to the President and seek his ruling as a matter of absolute urgency.
—I will refer that to the President, as I think I said I would.
—Now we see that the conservative opposition leader in New Zealand, Don Brash, is practising the sort of politics that appeals to a prejudice that is resident in non-Indigenous Australians and I believe the Prime Minister is doing just the same thing. This morning, Mr Howard told Channel 9 what he told 3AW a couple of weeks ago, which is that he is no longer sure that Indigenous people deserve a role in their own affairs; he is not even sure they deserve an opinion. Today he said:
... I don't think abolishing ATSIC and replacing ATSIC with another body is a good idea ... the real alternative is to treat everybody equally and ... maintain programmes that look out for disadvantage where that disadvantage exists.
That is, according to Mr Howard, bureaucrats and non-Indigenous politicians here in Canberra know best. Clearly, those would be the same bureaucrats that have delivered the health outcomes we are discussing here today. I am not sure when Senator Vanstone pays attention to Indigenous health issues. She has been hiding from responsibility during this debate and has never acknowledged the Social Justice Commissioner's report tabled in this very chamber. I know the only time Mr Howard pays attention to Indigenous issues is when Mark Textor and the other apparatchiks of the Liberal Party headquarters tell him there is prejudice in the community that he can exploit. I wish he paid more attention, because if he did he would understand that ATSIC is not—I repeat not—responsible for health funding. 
—You pathetic little creep!
—The senator does not believe that. Perhaps he could look up the budget papers to see where the health funding is, but I do not believe that Senator Ian Campbell is worried about the facts in this matter. Mr Howard himself—nobody else—is responsible for Indigenous health outcomes. That is something he might want to reflect on the next time he tries to shirk responsibility.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I am absolutely disgusted by the tone of this speech and I am appalled that someone would write a speech—
 (Senator Brandis)—What is the point of order, Senator Heffernan?
—The point of order is that I would appeal to the Clerk of the Senate to give an urgent ruling to the earlier decision of the chair.
—Senator Heffernan, you can informally approach the Clerk but you cannot appeal directly to the Clerk through me. There is no point of order. I ask senators to contain themselves.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Can I ask that Senator O'Brien reflect on the remarks he is making and on the tenor of his speech. It reflects poorly on the Senate. Could I suggest that he resumes his seat, reads the balance of the speech—
—There is no point of order, Senator Campbell.
—The point of order is that he is reading his speech, which is against standing orders.
—I have just assumed the chair and I will keep an eye on that.
—What I have suggested is that, if he is going to read his speech, he sits down and reads it first. He has obviously had this speech prepared by a junior staffer—
—There is no point of order. 
—Please hear my point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President.
—Senator Campbell, the point of order you expressed was that Senator O'Brien is reading his speech. If he is reading his speech, I will direct his attention to that fact and I will rule him out of order.
—I joined with Mr Latham yesterday in announcing a new policy from the opposition, and in relation to that policy—
—That wasn't a policy!
—Here we go again: Senator Campbell cannot contain himself! The framework rejects the politics of division that have characterised this government, but let me move the debate on Indigenous affairs forward, because that is what we are here to do. Yes, we will move on from the ATSIC model, one damaged on the part of ATSIC commissioners by internal disharmony and alleged misbehaviour and on the part of the government by spiteful and ill-informed attacks and policy paralysis. We depart from the government in that regard by having a plan and being prepared to release it. 
—I spent a lot of years working on Indigenous issues.
—Order! Senator Campbell, Senator Mackay, Senator Heffernan: please be silent.
—We also depart from the government on principles of Indigenous participation and program delivery. Labor believe Indigenous Australians are entitled to a voice in national affairs. We also believe Indigenous Australians are entitled to a role in Indigenous program development and delivery at the regional level. These principles are informed by our party's longstanding commitment to self-determination for Indigenous Australians and the comprehensive consultation with Indigenous people that I have conducted over the past four months around the country.
It is because of this consultation that I am surprised that Senator Ridgeway was so quick to denounce that Labor plan as having been developed in isolation from Indigenous Australia. In fact, so quick was he that he only had time to ask for a copy of Labor's announcement and then rush to do a doorstop to gain a few cheap headlines. He had no time to give me a call because the truth would have curtailed his ill-informed comments on the plan. I expected no more from the government—and I have seen that sort of behaviour in here all day and have not been disappointed by Senator Vanstone's furious comment in response to Labor's announcement—but I am disappointed that Senator Ridgeway chose to follow the practice he did in rushing out and performing a doorstop, stating that there had been no consultation, without even bothering to ask me. Let me say that in relation to the issue of health I am looking forward to a positive contribution from Senator Ridgeway. I believe that he is committed to the issue of developing Indigenous health in this country and—
—That is the worst speech on Indigenous affairs I have heard in 13 years. You are an insult—
—Senator Campbell: order!
—I believe that we will get positive cooperation from the Democrats in relation to what is one of the most important issues this country faces.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Indigenous Affairs: Health</title>,Matters of Urgency,22,1
"Ferris, Sen Jeannie",LP,2004-03-31,"—I would have to say that I can only agree with Senator Campbell. In the eight years I have been in this place I have never heard a speech which so disgracefully impugned a number of leaders not only in this country but also in New Zealand. First of all, we had the government being accused of running racist politics—a shameful accusation. We had the New Zealand Leader of the Opposition being accused of being a racist. We had the minister for Indigenous affairs being impugned. We had the Prime Minister himself being impugned in this last speech. And unfortunately and absolutely regrettably, we had the appeal by Senator Ridgeway—who was the first speaker on this matter of public urgency—completely ignored. Senator Ridgeway appealed for the contributors today not to make the subject a political football, not to make the subject a matter for sledging and slagging, but the very next speaker in here today made an absolutely regrettable and disappointing contribution which was, I am sad to say, racially based. 
There can be no disagreement by any thinking person in this place that there are dire problems in the area of Indigenous health. I can only say, from my visits to the Pitjantjatjara lands in South Australia, that the health issues that now confront the lands in my home state are a tragedy. I shall never forget visiting the lands eight years ago and seeing young children sitting sniffing petrol. We have tried very hard in South Australia to deal with this issue, and I am sorry to say that we have failed. The failure of Indigenous self-government to provide health services is a complete tragedy.
I agree with you, Senator Ridgeway: let's not make this into a political football, because there is no thinking person in this chamber, in this parliament, who would not argue that we can do more. Last month the South Australian state government finally admitted what many of us have known for many years—that is, that self-government on the Pit lands has failed. This conclusion came from the Treasurer in South Australia after the Adelaide Advertiser revealed that an urgent $7 million health funding package that was promised in May 2003 had never been delivered by the state Labor government to health workers. That was funding that had been provided in response to a 2002 coronial inquest into the tragedy of petrol sniffing on the lands. As Kevin Foley said at the time—and I agree with him and I think everybody in this place would agree with him:
Self-governance in the Anangu Pitjantjatjara lands has failed.
He said:
I think this is an acknowledgement that 20 years of doing what we thought was right for the Aboriginal lands has failed ...
Indigenous self-government on the Pit lands in South Australia has not only failed the Aboriginal people as a whole; it has also failed the Aboriginal children on those lands. This has been made clear, and the dire situation in the Aboriginal community of Yalata is, unfortunately, a similar reflection of the same problems where domestic violence and child abuse are rife.
Those in opposition here say that they will abolish ATSIC and ATSIS and replace them with 35 individually elected Indigenous regional bodies. That sounds awfully like regional land councils to me. We already know the land council model does have some quite fundamental difficulties. The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs has outlined those on a number of occasions in this place. I do not think there is any doubt that there are better ways of managing them, and the minister has given an undertaking that she will act on the report of Jackie Huggins, Bob Collins and John Hannaford and make an announcement regarding the future.
The Howard government has nearly doubled Indigenous health funding since it came to office, and such spending is now at record levels. There is no doubt that money is being made available. The issue is to make sure that it is being spent in the right way, Senator Ridgeway, and that area has been looked at by Jackie Huggins and her colleagues. Funding for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Program stood at $272 million in 2003, a real growth of 99 per cent since 1996.
—Senator Crossin, a 99 per cent increase since 1996 is no mean feat when the government inherited a $10 billion black hole on coming to office. Our priority in increasing Aboriginal health funding by 99 per cent in eight years is commendable. In the 1999-2000 budget, $78.8 million was provided over four years to improve Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people's access to primary health care through our Primary Health Care Access Program. I am pleased to say that an additional $19.7 million, commencing this financial year, was allocated in the 2001-02 budget. There is now very clear evidence that more Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people than ever before are having disease detected and treated. 
—It is very easy to come in here on the opposition side and hand wring and say that we need more money. While I am trying to keep the politics out of this, Senator McLucas, we have allocated 99 per cent more than was allocated in 1996, and more Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people than ever before are having disease detected and treated. Thank goodness for that. And thank goodness also that Indigenous infant and perinatal death rates have fallen by one-third over the last decade. I know they have further to fall—we want them to be the same as for the rest of the Australian community—but at least we are making some progress. There has been a fall of over one-third in Aboriginal children's death rates.
There are a number of achievements that I could go through today, but I simply want to reiterate: this issue is too important to be a political football in this place, and it is too important to be the subject of racist remarks, unfair and unfortunate comments about New Zealand's Leader of the Opposition, the minister in this place and a number of other individuals who have made a very clear commitment to Indigenous health.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Indigenous Affairs: Health</title>,Matters of Urgency,22,1
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2004-03-31,"—Senator Ferris, you are right: this is a very important issue. In fact, it is an issue of national significance, but it is also a national disaster. It is a timely and appropriate debate, particularly when yesterday representatives from the Fred Hollows Foundation provided briefings to a number of us and held a national press conference where they again asked for the issue of Indigenous health and the crucial state of the health of Indigenous Australians to be placed as a national threshold issue. Their letter that went with the information kit they distributed to people yesterday asks for a national understanding of the reality of the situation to be again awoken—in other words, to try to give Australians, front and centre, a genuine and real understanding about what is happening with Indigenous health.
It is not about playing politics; it is not about sledging each other across this chamber; it is about somebody actually taking responsibility for improving outcomes for Indigenous Australians particularly when it comes to health. That responsibility of the federal government of this country lies squarely and solely at the feet of the Prime Minister, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and, of course, the Minister for Health and Ageing. Someone has to take responsibility. We have now had eight years of this federal government, yet we see no significant improvements.
The Fred Hollows Foundation said yesterday that little has changed, that a massive health crisis still exists in Australia. Indigenous people now have a life expectancy more than 20 years less than that of other Australians. Life expectancy for Indigenous Australians is worse than for people in many developing countries—and we have had recorded in press clippings in the last 24 hours a list of those countries. Indigenous infants are dying at the same rate as babies in some of the most impoverished developing nations. The Indigenous infant mortality rate is twice as high as that of non-Indigenous people. Twice as many Indigenous children are born at low birth weight than any other Australian babies. Low birth weight is an important indicator of chronic health problems later in life. In remote areas, particularly in places like the Northern Territory, Indigenous children are three times as likely as non-Indigenous children to die before the age of one. Sadly, the major cause of illness is preventable infections. 
I have raised in this place time and time again, through estimates, the incidence of trachoma in this country and, in particular, in the Northern Territory. But in the Territory the incidence of trachoma is estimated at between 12 and 20 per cent amongst children in Aboriginal communities, and there is currently no data available on the presence of trachoma nationally. Trachoma is a disease which has largely been eradicated in many Third World countries. Australia is the only OECD country where blinding trachoma still exists. That is a national disgrace. When we talk about a rich country, a country full of opportunity, how is it that we still have Indigenous people in our own backyard suffering from trachoma?
We can eliminate trachoma with courses of erythromycin, but we also need to ensure that Indigenous people have healthy lifestyles, that we eliminate their having to have 40 people to one house and that we seal roads in Indigenous communities. But, for eight years, this government has not even started to try to tackle the housing problem. There is an opportunity for the housing problems in this country to be overcome. There is now a need to walk hand in hand, I believe, with corporate and private businesses in this area. We are never going to find enough public dollars to put enough houses in Indigenous communities. It is time to start talking to corporate businesses and to the private sector about how they might jump on board and alleviate the problem. But this government just sits on its hands and is doing nothing that is proactive to overcome the problem.
Aboriginal children in remote communities in the Northern Territory suffer so many middle ear infections in early childhood that only seven per cent have normal, healthy ears. By 2½ years of age, 25 per cent of children have perforated eardrums—think of that. By the time little Aboriginal children are 2½, 25 per cent of them have perforated eardrums—imagine the pain of that, let alone their inability to speak properly or hear what is going on. It is estimated that up to half of Aboriginal children in remote communities have a hearing loss. The current rate of ear infections in remote Northern Territory communities ranges from eight per cent to over 50 per cent. The World Health Organisation regards a rate of four per cent as a massive health problem.
I have seen it myself. I stood in a classroom at Yirrkala in 1981 and saw kids with chronic ear infections, and we did as much as we possibly could back then. But let me tell you this: when I went back to that community only two weeks ago to attend the funeral of an Indigenous man who was well respected and loved in that community, I saw kids still running around with chronic ear infections. It seems that nothing has changed. One has to wonder whether the day will come when we see a turnaround in the results and an improvement in what is happening.
Only $600,000 of $29 million is spent on Indigenous Australians this financial year by Australian Hearing Services. Australian Hearing Services are contracted by this government to provide hearing services to all Australians, in particular Indigenous Australians. But picture this: of $29 million, only $600,000 is spent on Indigenous Australians through their own program. Is this because Australian Hearing Services have a mainstreaming approach? Is it because the federal government does not direct them about the way in which they need to spend their money? Either way, I cannot get an answer out of this government at estimates about why that is the case. 
So when we talk about practical reconciliation, I have given you this afternoon two very real examples of how the health of Indigenous Australians in this country could be practically improved, and the government are doing nothing about it. They give me no answers at estimates about why there is a lack of progress in this area. They provide excuses as to why it cannot be done rather than solutions about why it can be done and, more importantly, when it will be done. When are we going to see a turnaround in these statistics that are embarrassing and that should make us, as a country, ashamed of the fact that we still have Indigenous Australians in our midst who are suffering one of the worst health outcomes in the world? It is an international disgrace and we should be ashamed of it.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Indigenous Affairs: Health</title>,Matters of Urgency,22,1
"Lees, Sen Meg",APA,2004-03-31,"—I thank Senator Ridgeway and Senator Ferris for giving up time so I can have three minutes in this important debate. In the very short time I have I will not dwell on the statistics and the details of the health crisis facing Indigenous Australians except to say that a life expectancy of 47 for men and 50 for women in the Northern Territory is an absolute disgrace. Indeed, it is beyond adequate description.
What I want to look at are some solutions. The solution is not just more money for health—and here I acknowledge that the Commonwealth has put it in some extra money. More money is urgently needed, yes—particularly for the pooled funding model that is working well and that should be extended nationally. I stress here that Indigenous Australians still get less Commonwealth funding per head for primary health care than other Australians. But the solution is not just to have more money for health services. It is about education, it is about jobs, it is about housing and it is about good phone and Internet services. It is about a whole-of-government plan, a whole-of-government approach. The key, I believe, is in education to ensure that local Indigenous people can qualify for the jobs in their own communities. 
There is so much to be done in Aboriginal communities—from nursing and teaching to maintaining roads, building appropriate housing and ensuring sewerage systems are for the 21st century, not the 19th. There are desk jobs, jobs on garbage trucks, jobs in child care and aged care. There are jobs in providing clean water, which many communities do not have. There are jobs in tourism, jobs in protecting the environment and jobs in such things as the Camel project at Kaltukatjara, or Docker River, which still cannot get the funding to really get under way.
But as I travel and visit Aboriginal communities I find classes in primary schools of 23, 27 or 28 kids, who do not have English as a first language, with just one teacher. In Adelaide that would not be tolerated. In Adelaide we find the general rule is to have one teacher for every nine ESL students. So what chance do these Indigenous kids have? A private Indigenous college, Nyangajatara college, which takes students from an area where only one or two kids a year ever manage to get through secondary school, now has around 100 students but is struggling for funding. The college is not classed as an ordinary private school, so it cannot tap into the hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars poured into our top private colleges.
They are only eligible for money from the small Indigenous education pool. So, if kids at this college get money, some Indigenous kids somewhere else are going to miss out. That means these kids are still sleeping in dongas, the staff are still in caravans and they have been learning in borrowed prefab work huts. I do commend the Commonwealth for just funding three classrooms—my lobbying of Minister Nelson sent them $2½ million to get some accommodation. But this still is not enough. But we are told, `No, the cupboard is bare. They can only access Indigenous funding.' We cannot blame ATSIC for the crisis in Indigenous health. It is years since they had health money. It is the states and territories that look after primary and secondary schools as well as health. The Commonwealth needs to put more money into the private sector in Indigenous education.

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2004-03-31,"—I rise today to speak to this matter of urgency. I preface my remarks by thanking Senator Ridgeway for bringing this to the attention of the house and particularly for his appeal to respect this very important motion. The appeal was: `Let's not politicise it. Let's in this place give the respect that this sort of motion should be accorded.' I am very pleased that on this side of this place it has been respected. I do not think anybody would be foolish enough to deny that the state of health in Indigenous Australians is much worse than that of other Australians. It would be a disservice to the health and allied workers who daily toil to improve the state of Indigenous health to say that nothing has been achieved. As a member of this place once said, anyone who thinks things have not improved in Indigenous communities was not around 20 years ago. I was in and around those communities 20 years ago, and things certainly are better than they were then—not in every area, but substantially across the board that would have to be the case.
As the Fred Hollows fact sheets point out, the state of Indigenous people is not actually getting worse but—and this is probably more important—the gap between the health of other Australians and Indigenous Australians is getting wider. This matter of urgency ends up by saying `that this crisis in Indigenous health be a priority in the upcoming federal budget'. I could not disagree with that. I am quite sure that this government is considering the budget, particularly those budget areas, in that context. We cannot believe that just throwing money at this problem is going to make a change. Somebody said to me the other day that the definition of lunacy is doing the same thing again and expecting something different to happen. Plenty of money has been thrown at this issue by a series of governments in the past. We need to do more than that.
With respect to health most Australians think, `If you're ill, if you're sick, you go to hospital and recover.' It seems like a fairly basic process. We are still seeing the health issue in that context: we get ill, so we need access to services to prevent the downstream consequences that I am about to address. Many of the communities that I visit evidence no knowledge of even basic hygiene. That is down to a whole range of issues. Sometimes they do not even have running water. It is okay to say to them: `Why don't you wash? Why don't you have a shower?' but it is pretty hard if they do not have a shower or access to those facilities. Quite often those facilities have been provided but the maintenance is not done.
It is important to recognise that sometimes people who turn up at these health centres have very simple sores and abscesses that could have been fixed with a bandaid and a bit of Betadine but, because of their lack of knowledge of very basic first aid, they wait for something to happen, so the wound festers and then they go to the health clinic. These are very basic issues of education that we really need to stick to. Many of the communities—particularly in Northern Australia, because of the genealogy of the people that inhabit that area—appear to have a predilection to diabetes. It is particularly sad when you go to these communities and see that the only things these people can eat—young Indigenous Australians particularly—are Coca-Cola, chips or chicken. That is their only choice. We are trying to build an environment where they can somehow come out of the cycle of dietary and environmental conditions that places them in the worst possible demographic for diabetes. I have spoken to a number of the food suppliers and some of that is changing. ALPA and Independent Grocers have made a number of substantive changes in that area, and they have moved very fast to ensure that the food is not only available but available at a reasonable cost. It is the right of every young Australian, particularly, to have access to a reasonable diet at a reasonable cost. 
School attendance is a very important issue for basic education. You can talk to young people on the street and say, `Put something on that cut,' and they will look at you oddly, because they do not understand how germs get into your body. If you puncture your body you must do something about it, but you cannot get that basic education if you do not go to school. The issue of school attendance, and education principally, obviously has a great impact on health issues. Even those people who do go to school have to deal with chronic middle ear infection, which was mentioned a moment ago by the senator for the Northern Territory on the other side.
We have had some very good programs that focus not necessarily on getting more money but on ensuring we empower the community and community leaders to work very closely with the health workers to bring about good health outcomes. A classic is `strong women, strong babies, strong culture'. That was introduced by the previous CLP government in the Northern Territory and very wisely continued by the Labor government that is there now. That is a bipartisan approach to good policy. There is no politics in it. It is a smart thing to do and we will keep doing it. The evidence for that program was in part of the Fred Hollows Foundation's fact sheet. The program act-ually reduced the number of low birth weight babies from 19.8 per cent in the early nineties to 11.3 per cent in 1994. It is a significant difference. The people who are operating in that program understand the outcome. It is not all about money; it is about community involvement. It is a very important program.
I can mention another program about diet, health and looking after the aged in our communities. We have a Meals on Wheels program in Ramingining. Every day sections of the younger community go out and shoot a buffalo or catch barramundi, crabs or long bums and bring them in for the old people, because they know and understand the importance of bush tucker. It is an awful lot better than the chicken, the hot dog or the Chiko roll you are going to get as the alternative. It is really important for maintaining health. The Commonwealth fund that absolutely excellent program. The Primary Health Care Access Program is another excellent program that has very good outcomes, and it is a step in the right direction.
I was with Senator Patterson in Kintore recently when we opened a magnificent health centre, brand-new and gleaming in the sun. That health centre will be full of people who are compassionate, well skilled and dedicated to resolving those issues of health in the communities. But, if we keep relying on the infrastructure and funding outcome issues alone, we are not going to deal with the issue that has been brought to us today. I do not think there is any government program at any level or any community action which you can point to and say, `This is enough.' We need to do much more. We are taking some steps in the right direction, but this issue cannot be put down to funding and infrastructure alone.

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2004-03-31,"—I rise to add my voice to the call for the government to recognise as a matter of urgency the need to address the emergency in Indigenous health in Australia. I want to focus my remarks this afternoon on the health emergency faced by Indigenous women and Indigenous children.
Australian Bureau of Statistics figures presented in Dr William Jonas's Social justice report 2003, which was presented to the Senate only recently, paint a distressing picture. In the period from 1997 to 1999, for the general population life expectancy for women was 81.8 years. That grew for the general population to a life expectancy in 1999-2001 of 82.4 years. For Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women, though, the story is very different and very concerning. In 1997-99 the average life expectancy for Indigenous women was 63 years but in 1999-2001 that dropped to 62.8 years. That simple, single statistic should send shivers down the spines of us all. To have in 2004 a cohort of the Australian population with decreasing life expectancy is shameful and we have got to do something about it. The report went on to say:
Approximately thirty years ago, life expectancy rates for Indigenous peoples in Canada, New Zealand and the United States of America were similar to the rates for Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders in Australia.
However, he says:
... Australia has fallen significantly behind in improving the life expectancy of Indigenous peoples. Although comparisons should be made with caution (because of the way different countries calculate life expectation) data suggests Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander ... females live between 10.9 and 12.6 years less than Indigenous females in these countries.
The countries he refers to are Canada, New Zealand and the USA. So, while in those countries the life expectancy for Indigenous peoples has been improving, over the same period of time in Australia we have done nothing to improve life expectancy. With the same access to resources, the same access to technology and the same access to the same research, we have not been able to bridge that gap. It should be a matter of shame to us all that, for women and children of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander descent, we have not been able to match those results and reverse the statistical data.
The National Rural Health Alliance reports that, compared to the rate for the general Australian population, infant mortality is much higher for Indigenous infants. In the period from 1990-92, the annual death rate for Indigenous infants was 26.8 for males and 24.9 for females per thousand. This compares with 7.9 males and 6.2 females per thousand in the general population for the same period. Our Indigenous children are dying at almost three times the rate of non-Indigenous children. That simple statistic should tell us everything. It should tell us that something has to be done and has to be done now. The Aboriginal death rate for 15- to 24-year-olds is four times worse than that for the non-Indigenous community. They also report that the more remote the area in which an Australian infant lives, the worse their health status will be.
Statistics show that the reality faced by Indigenous people is an emergency and they show that for women the situation is getting worse. I was shocked to see the change in mortality rates. Certainly we need to gain a greater understanding of why this is the case. The concern that has been expressed in this place today is shared by many other, if not all, professional bodies in the health care sector. The President of the AMA has spoken strongly about what we need to do. He said: 
Funding is part of the equation, access is the other.
He said initially:
All Australians should feel ashamed that one group of people in our community faces a health reality worse than many third world countries ...
The National Rural Health Alliance yearbook and annual report calls on the federal government, through the Prime Minister and his cabinet colleagues, to lead a national campaign to improve the health of Indigenous people. The Royal Australian College of Physicians in September 2003 released a comprehensive policy on Indigenous health, which I commend to everyone in the chamber. One thing that they have committed to do and have in fact done is develop a partnership with the Australian Indigenous Doctors Association to create a mentoring scheme for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students seeking a career in health. I am pleased to advise the Senate that Mr Alan Sambono was appointed earlier this month as the project officer for that scheme.
As I said, the issues are to do with access but they are also to do with a range of other factors. In the inquiry into Medicare, the Aboriginal Medical Services Alliance Northern Territory said that access to primary health care was a significant indicator of the quality of health outcomes for Indigenous people. They went on to ask the question:
Do Aboriginal people currently have good access to quality PHC services?
They stated:
Historically, Aboriginal people have had very poor levels of access to PHC services relative to non Aboriginal Australians. The major funding sources for PHC services for non-Aboriginal Australians are the Commonwealth's MBS and the PBS programs ...
They went on to quote Professor Deeble's data of 1998:
... for every $1 spent on non-Aboriginal people there is $0.41 spent on Aboriginal people and for the PBS the corresponding figure is $0.33.
—That's wrong.
—Senator Patterson said Professor Deeble is wrong. Let us have the information, let us have the data and let us have the discussion. The message is clear. It is about access; it is about levels of funding. We are facing a crisis for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It is not only about access but also about the culturally appropriate delivery of services and lifestyle issues.

"Heffernan, Sen Bill",LP,2004-03-31,"—I congratulate Senator Ridgeway for bringing on the debate on this matter of urgency today. I condemn the racist slurs made earlier in the debate and I will leave it at that. Indigenous health is obviously about better education, better tucker, better housing and all the things that have been mentioned. No-one is going to dispute the fact that we have a lot of work to do for Aboriginal people in Australia. I am proud to say that I have never had an Indigenous person come into my office angry and go out angry. In fact, in 1996 in this place I said:
No less is the challenge imposed on this generation of Australians by the centuries of misunderstanding and neglect of our indigenous people. We must provide for the return to our indigenous people of their self-esteem: built up over thousands of years by their majestic mastery of traditional living, land custodial skills and timeless culture; broken down in 200 years by the inevitable exploratory nature of man, the intrusiveness of his machines, the enticement of his money and the destructive onslaught of his social habits. 
A paradigm shift is required and will only occur when provision is made for our indigenous people to progress, even in remote areas, from communal benefit to individual benefit; when access for all Australians to health, education and employment is not distorted by location or station in life; and when, regardless of race, creed and colour, we purge those leaders who believe all should be equal except the equalisers and who see the often generous funds of government as the opportunity for a feast on which to fatten their personal circumstances while neglecting the famine.
Unfortunately, when these predators turn onto the public purse a lot of Australians turn off.
There are a lot of good things happening; there are a lot more to be done. Recently David Liddiard from NASCA visited my office. He put a great case for some great things that are happening out in remote areas. I am hopeful that we will be able to assist him. He personally raises $1 million a year on his own to go out there into Indigenous communities. One time I was with Tracker Tilmouth at the Apatula Community at Finke and Tracker said, `Go down to the local store and you'll see these kids have got terrible glaucoma and a lot of dialysis problems and renal failure.' I went and kicked a footy in the paddock with the kids. I said to them, `What do you kids need most of all?' They said, `We'd like a swimming pool.' A swimming pool would be a great way to improve the health of kids in that region because it would clean the dust out of their eyes. If you go to a place like Yuendumu, where there are 900 people and half of them are school age kids, probably at best half of them go to school and they do not get fed. There is not a lot of light at the end of the tunnel for some of these kids. I have also been to remote communities where alcohol is a serious problem and where the women and kids live in warlike conditions. They are not game to let the kids go into the houses at night for fear of being abused.
I went to the hospital at Alice Springs and visited the ward for premature babies. There were all these little girls who looked like they were only old enough to be going to school but they were the mothers of all these little kids. I think the little ward accommodates seven kids but there were often up to 15 kids there. When the mothers and babies leave, the hospital staff do a fantastic job. They give them a little locked tucker box of food for the baby. What chance have that little mother and little baby got when you have to send them home with a locked tucker box so that someone else does not get at the tucker? There are a lot of complications. A lot of the people that live on the dry Todd River bed in Alice Springs have become a curiosity for tourists, which is shameful for all Australians. A lot of those people are there because they have nowhere else to stay while mum, dad or someone else is having renal dialysis. In the Northern Territory, shamefully, there are only three places, as far as I know, where you can get renal dialysis—Alice Springs, Darwin and Tennant Creek.
—And Tiwi.
—And Tiwi, is it? That is a failure for all Australians. You see another failure when you go to congress in Alice Springs and they tell you that a lot of the money that the Commonwealth sends to the Northern Territory government gets diverted. It does not end up where it belongs. These are complicated issues and it is not just about money. I applaud the Hollows Foundation for highlighting these issues. There are a lot of good things happening; there are a lot more to be done.
This government has done a lot of good things: access to Medicare and pharmaceutical benefits has improved, with expenditure on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders having increased by 50 per cent since 1996. That is having a go. The number of Indigenous specific primary health care services funded by the government has increased from 108 to 152. I could read through endless statistics showing how things are on the improve, but we have a long way to go. As much as anything, these people need help with education and they need fostering and parenting skills so that the kids get fed before they go to school. There are a whole lot of things involved in health. 
I applaud everyone involved in this debate and I plead for every Australian to be aware that we have a lot of work to do. As I said earlier, in 200 years we have destroyed this precious culture. We have broken down Indigenous people's great skills and we have an obligation to put all those back in place. I am pleased to see from the statistics that we have 44 general medical practitioners—that is 50 per cent more than in 1996, so we are on to it.

"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2004-03-31,"—I despair at the level of debate in dealing with what are crucial issues in this nation, certainly in respect of dealing with the merit of the arguments as opposed to accusations of both wedge and reverse-wedge politics. This issue confronts all of us and we have an obligation to deal with a crisis which is happening in our backyard. The motion that has been put forward is a very simple and reasonable one. I seek the support of the Senate to show the leadership that is required to mitigate the circumstances of misery that exist in so many Indigenous communities across the country. It is no secret that Indigenous people in this country do not vote in such numbers to make a difference to any side of politics. We do not decide the outcome. It is also true that we do not garner that broader Australian respect and that we are often despised and seen in a poor light. I often wonder about the future of the young, given the harmful and negative images that are portrayed, and what they must think about their life circumstances and opportunities for their future. We sit on the edge of society, in the riverbeds and the ghettos throughout the country, perhaps sometimes through our own fault, but that is no reason to point the finger of blame or to try to find someone to cast that upon, to leave people to live or to die. I despair because I do not believe that these people have chosen the circumstances into which they are born.
There are other issues that we need to deal with and we cannot continue to hide behind the rhetoric, saying that we are doing great things and being able to spend more money when the figures themselves continue to give lie to the claim that things are getting better. It is not just about figures; we are talking about people. The right leadership is what is required, but there is also an obligation upon us. We are the ones who should be held to account if our policies and practices have made life harder and not easier for Indigenous people in this country. We should also hold ourselves in contempt if Aboriginal babies continue to die younger. Many of the people in my own community do not live to enjoy the fruits of retirement, let alone have the capacity to build some wealth to enjoy in the future. It requires a different approach and a change of heart.
Yesterday when I attended the launch of the Fred Hollows Foundation on putting the facts out there, it was said that Professor John Deeble estimated that an additional $300 million per year is urgently needed to achieve an equitable allocation of health care resources and to train the additional work force that is required. We are talking about nothing more than $12 per Indigenous person in this country, the same amount of money over a year that is spent in a week on defence. The call that is being made is not unreasonable. If there are surpluses in this year's budget, if we have this crisis happening in our backyard and if our fellow Australians do not enjoy the same life opportunities and choices, we should commit surpluses to dealing with that emergency crisis.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2004-03-31,"—by leave—At the request of Senator Lightfoot, I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the Republic of Indonesia and Independent State of Papua New Guinea, which took place from 7 to 19 December 2003, and I seek leave to incorporate a tabling statement by Senator Lightfoot in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
The delegation was led by the Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Hon Ian Causley MP, Member for Page in New South Wales. Other members of the delegation were Senator Robert Ray; and Mr Harry Jenkins MP, Member for Scullin in Victoria.
I would also like to record my thanks and appreciation for the excellent assistance provided by the staff of the Australian Embassy in Indonesia and the Australian High Commission in Papua New Guinea throughout the delegation's visit.
Indonesia and Papua New Guinea are exceptionally important countries for Australia and the Delegation set itself a comprehensive set of aims and objectives to accomplish, including:  
	To maintain and strengthen links between the Australian Parliament and the Parliaments of Indonesia and Papua New Guinea.
	To observe the economic situation in the two countries, including progress on structural economic reform.
	To gather views and opinions on the security situation in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea and possibilities for enhancing further cooperation with Australia.
	Observe the conduct of politics in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea.
The visit to the Republic of Indonesia was highly successful and the delegation confidently believes that the aims and objectives of the visit have been met. During its busy schedule of meetings the delegation had the opportunity to explore a number of important issues with the political leaders of Indonesia and members of the Indonesian Parliament, business leaders and economic experts.
The visit was beneficial in increasing the understanding of the political and economic challenges facing the country and the many opportunities that are available to both countries. The visit strengthened Indonesia and Australia's already strong relationship and created opportunities for it to develop further.
The aim of the delegation to maintain and strengthen links between the Australian Parliament and the Parliament of Indonesia was met when the Leader of the delegation, presented the Speaker of the House of Representatives (DPR), Akbar Tandjung, and People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) Chairman, Prof Dr Amien Rais with official invitations to nominate an Indonesian parliamentary delegation to visit Australia. I was pleased to be advised that plans for that visit are now underway.
In addition, delegates support the continued engagement of the Australian Parliament with the Indonesian Parliament, and has recommended the development of an MP partnering scheme, possibly managed through the Inter-Parliamentary Union, whereby individual MPs from both parliaments would agree to maintain contact with, and offer support to each other, on a personal basis.
The relationship between Australia and Indonesia is a wide-ranging one encompassing political, trade, people-to-people links and cultural exchanges. The breadth of the relationship is one of its strongest attributes, with strong education and tourist links supporting an increased understanding of both countries. Over 17,000 Indonesian students are currently studying in Australia, making them one of the largest groups of foreign students in Australia.
The Delegation's program provided for a number of opportunities to meet Australians working and studying in Indonesia, as well as Indonesian alumni from Australian universities and Indonesians with Australian business interests. These meetings demonstrated the depth and strength of people-to-people links between the two countries and the extent of Australia's engagement with Indonesia.
Based on these meetings, the delegation urges the Australian Government to consider the continuation of Australia's tertiary scholarship program with a view to increasing the number of scholarships available.
Whilst we were in Indonesia, it was interesting also to be briefed on Indonesia's preparations for the upcoming general and presidential elections and on recent constitutional changes. Indeed, in meeting with the Vice-President, HE Hamzah Haz, the Vice-President advised delegates that whilst there were 48 registered political parties in 1999, there are now more than 200 registered parties. The Vice-President advised delegates that Indonesian people were in favour of democratic processes and suggested that the votes of the rural population may be surprising.
Delegates were also able to witness the advancements made by Indonesia since the economic crisis in 1997 and given that 2004 marked the end of the IMF structural adjustment program, delegates encouraged Indonesia to continue its progress toward economic reform and advised of Australia's willingness to assist in this regard. In fact, in its report, the delegation has urged the Australian Government to discuss with Indonesia, options for providing further governance assistance to institutions in order to facilitate investment in Indonesia. 
It is important to note for the Parliament that when the delegation arrived, there was much discussion in the Indonesian media of Australia's announcement to cooperate with the United States of America in the development of a missile defence system. There appeared to be some confusion over the announcement and the suggestion was made that Australia intended to develop an offensive system with the United States. In discussing these issues, delegates reassured Indonesia that Australia had agreed to cooperate with the United States of America in the development of a missile defence system and that Australia's alliance with the United States was not contrary to Indonesian interests. 
Based on these misconceptions, delegates have recommended that the Australian Government consider informing the relevant members of the Indonesian Government prior to future major defence announcements.
Another very important theme in the Delegation's meetings, both in Jakarta and Yogyakarta, was the role of Islam and Islamic institutions in both countries. The Delegation met with Professor Dr Syafi'i Ma'arif, Chairman of Muhammadiyah, who had returned from an Australian Government-funded visit to Australia the previous week, as well as representatives of Indonesia's largest Muslim organisation, Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), Islamic think tanks and the Rector of the State of Islamic University in Jakarta, Azyumardi Azra. Delegates reassured Indonesia that Australians are very tolerant and accepting of all religions, including Islam and informed the Indonesians that Australia has a large Islamic population and preservation of the culture is supported by government funding to Islamic schools.
Similarly, the delegation's bilateral visit to Papua New Guinea was also a success. Discussions in Port Moresby largely focused on the newly agreed Enhanced Cooperation Package, whereas, discussions with provincial governors and administrators centred around the lack of basic services, law and order issues and, the importance to the economy of improved road maintenance.
Highlights of the visit included visits to traditional Eastern Highlands villages, and calls on the Bitapaka War Cemetery and Volcanological Observatory Project in East New Britain.
Geographic proximity and historical links have given Papua New Guinea a special place in Australia's foreign relations. The strength and depth of this relationship is evidenced by the signing of an enhanced package of cooperation between Australia and PNG which is designed to help PNG address its key challenges. In a new era of the partnership, Australians will work side-by-side with Papua New Guineans in the areas of policing, law and justice and economic and public sector management. It is not surprising then, that this announcement prompted much media comment in PNG and that during the delegation's visit, the majority of meetings held with the delegation, the package and its operation was discussed.
The aim of the delegation to maintain and strengthen links between the Australian Parliament and the Parliament of Papua New Guinea was met when the Leader of the delegation, presented the A/g Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Hon Jefferey Nape MP, with an official invitation reiterating Australia's desire for Papua New Guinea to nominate a parliamentary delegation to visit Australia. Delegates were very pleased to be advised that the Papua New Guinean Delegation is visiting the Australian Parliament this week.
Delegates witnessed enormous enthusiasm from all members of parliament that met with the delegation to tackle the many challenges facing Papua New Guinea. Delegates believe that such enthusiasm should be encouraged and supported. 
Similar to the delegation's recommendation for Indonesia, the delegation supports the development of an MP partnering scheme, possibly managed through the Inter-Parliamentary Union, whereby individual MPs from both parliaments would agree to maintain contact with, and offer support to each other, on a personal basis.
The PNG economy is currently experiencing difficult times. PNG's economy is dual in nature, including a `modern' formal economy and a large informal economy where subsistence farming accounts for the bulk of economic activity. The formal sector provides a rather narrow employment base, consisting of workers engaged in mineral production, a relatively small manufacturing sector, public sector employees and service industries including finance, construction, transportation and utilities. 
The delegation received a briefing from representatives of the Coffee Industry Corporation on PNG's second largest agricultural export, coffee. The delegation was told that coffee is a grassroots economic activity for people to participating in but that government investment was needed for the larger coffee producers. Delegates were also informed that there are a number of difficulties facing Eastern Highlands coffee growers in relation to getting their produce to market. For example, feeder roads in the province are in very poor condition and air freight is very expensive.
The delegation was also pleased to meet with managers of New Britain Palm Oil Ltd (NBPOL) and tour one of NBPOL oil palm estate, a cattle yard and a newly-commissioned oil palm refinery. The company is the leading palm oil producer in Papua New Guinea and the largest private sector employer. Palm oil has recently overtaken coffee as PNG's leading export.
Delegates were briefed on NBPOL's environmental management of oil palm plantations in West New Britain, and saw first-hand the contribution NBPOL has made towards improving the quality of life for a large percentage of people in the province by providing housing, education, basic services such as water, sewerage and health and infrastructure maintenance.
Reflecting the strong ties between Australia and Papua New Guinea, the development cooperation program between our two countries is by far the largest of any of Australia's bilateral aid programs. The delegation visited the headquarters of the internationally-renowned Institute of Medical Research (IMR) in Goroka, as well as the Court Users Forum, a successful project that falls under the Law and Justice Sector Program. 
One of the highlights for the delegation was visiting these very remote villages. The delegation was interested to hear that these villages had not been visited by any government officials—either from Australia or PNG—for over 30 years. The villagers, dressed in traditional dress, extended a very generous and warm welcome us, presenting us with billums, leis and spears. 
We were invited into the villager's homes to observe their basic lifestyle. These villages do not have access to basic services such as electricity or clean water and they were only accessible by 4WD vehicles. Visiting these villages demonstrated the great disparity in Papua New Guinea between the capital, Port Moresby and the provincial areas which are home to approximately 90 per cent of PNG's population.
It was evident to the delegation that there are very few funds available for the development and provision of many basic services to rural areas in Papua New Guinea. The delegation accepts that AusAID provides significant funding to Papua New Guinea and considers the delivery of that assistance to be effective. However, the delegation's visit, particularly the visit to these villages, highlighted a need for `grassroots' or provincial funding. It would provide for basic services and the development of small-scale businesses to generate employment and income. 
To this end, the delegation recommends the Australian Government investigate options for the `grassroots' delivery of development assistance and suggests that an expansion of the PNG Incentive Fund may be one vehicle through which to do this.
Toward the end of the visit, Mr Deputy Speaker laid a wreath at the Bitapaka War Cemetery in East New Britain, commemorating the Australian troops who participated in World War I and World War II and to pay homage to the Australians who lost their lives. It was most important for us and a very significant event for delegates.",SENATE,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,<title>Parliamentary Delegation to the Republic of Indonesia and Independent State of Papua New Guinea</title>,Delegation Reports,27,1
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2004-03-31,"—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the document.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
Let me first of all just put on the record our thanks to the delegation secretary, Ms Saxon Patience, for all the work she put in on this particular delegation. I would also like to extend my thanks to our embassy in Jakarta for the enormous amount of hard work they put in to make this a very smooth, productive and rewarding visit. However, I must say, having not been to Indonesia for over eight years, that some of the attitudes expressed about Australia in Indonesia quite shocked me. 
I had not been to Indonesia since December 1995, and I found that on a number of major issues there were considerable misunderstandings of the Australian position. We often heard the words `deputy sheriff of the region', and we endeavoured greatly to say that that was not the role that the Australian government perceived or played within the region. On a whole range of other issues we found that Australia's position was misunderstood. On many occasions when we took our interlocutors through these subjects, I think we convinced them that their view and perception of Australia was not necessarily in accord with the facts of the matter. I might add that I do believe that if you are on a delegation your job is never to criticise your own country, and I think the whole delegation managed to abide by that.
But there was one issue on which I could not assist the delegation leader or Senator Lightfoot, and that was when we were asked questions about our involvement in the US missile defence system. This has greatly spooked, and is greatly misunderstood by, many people in Indonesia, many of whom seek to regard this as an offensive system. Whilst it is a defensive system, it can have escalation implications that make it an offensive system. I can see that. But absolutely no proper explanation has been given—or at least received in Indonesia—as to our involvement. This is passing strange, because it has been the normal practice of both Labor and Liberal governments to give the government in Jakarta some heads up on any dramatic changes to defence and foreign policy. In other words, before a strategic review is finalised and published, before a white paper is finalised, there are often briefings of countries in our region to let them know basically where we stand. That gives them an early heads up so that they do not either overreact or misinterpret the situation. In this case, it was not done. In this case, Australia's signing-up to the missile defence system came as a complete surprise and is still misunderstood there.
We can all speculate on why this was not done. I suppose the most obvious explanation is that the government released its attitude to this particular thing prematurely merely to ambush the Leader of the Opposition. I have never heard that denied, although I cannot assert that it is absolutely true. But it seems to fit the pattern that, in order to raise an issue in which political gain may accrue, these matters were prematurely disclosed to the parliament of Australia and to the Australian public without the normal precaution of briefing a range of regional governments as to this change in defence posture. If that is the case, this government has put its own political self-interest ahead of the nation's self-interest.
It is not much use dwelling on what has happened in the past; we cannot rectify that in the sense of when the announcement was made. But I think that one of the recommendations on page 17 of the delegation report, which I will quote from, is quite timely. I must also say that I understand that the Joint Standing Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee sent a delegation to Indonesia at around the same time as the one I was on, and they found very similar concerns expressed in Indonesia about our signing-up for the missile defence system. On page 17 this report says, in part:
	It was evident to delegates that there were many misconceptions surrounding Australia's announcement to participate in the development of a missile defence system which created a sense of apprehension on the part of Indonesia. The delegation recommends that the Australian Government inform the relevant members of the Indonesian Government prior to future major defence announcements. 
That is the message from our delegation. I think it is the same message that the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade will bring back. I hope the government listens to it, because I think it is most important. It has been the tradition that we have done it in that particular way. I hope that the missile defence announcement was merely an aberration and that it does not fit the government's behaviour. If it was done for political expediency and ambush, I think the government is to be condemned for that, because you have to take the long view in these defence and foreign affairs issues.
In conclusion, I must say it was a little disappointing that two of the delegates had to drop out of the delegation at the last minute. But I would like to pay tribute to Mr Ian Causley for the excellent job he did in leading the delegation; to Mr Harry Jenkins, who also was a major contributor; and to Senator Lightfoot, who was a very active participant in the delegation. We did get very good access and we saw a whole range of people. We enhanced our knowledge and in turn, hopefully, the knowledge of the parliament. One thing that did come out of the visit was a view from the Indonesian parliament that these reciprocal visits are great for eliminating misconceptions between the two countries. I encourage such visits to continue into the future.

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2004-03-31,"—I will finalise what I was saying beforehand. We were talking about the issue of a statement which could have been regarded as a threat. I think there were discussions taking place before we broke for lunch. The actual indication from the minister's office was that, should the bill not get through, the minister would be alerting the public to those individuals who blocked its passage. I do not make anything of that. I did raise it in my speech in the second reading debate. I think it was probably a little over the fence to say that the minister would be alerting the public to those `individuals' who blocked its passage. We are here to examine matters on their merits.

"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2004-03-31,"—I did say to Senator Harradine that people were writing to me asking me why they could not get their top-up. I said that I would have to answer the question by saying that we had legislation before the Senate and there were amendments we could not accept, and I would have to indicate the people who opposed it—whether they were Independents, opposition or whatever, as has happened before.
I have said to Senator Harradine privately that one of my staff might have been a bit overzealous in the way he expressed that and I apologised personally for that. It was not said the way I would have had it said. But I do think it is appropriate. It has happened before that you say, `We would have liked to do this but, given the fact that X, Y and Z opposed it, the legislation did not get through.' That was the only intention of that. We had to make it very clear that we could not accept those amendments and that that would be the reason why the bill would go down. I have apologised. I will apologise to Senator Harradine publicly here in the chamber. It was not meant in any way to be a threat other than to say that that is what I would have to do to explain it to people who were writing to me asking why they could not get the top-up.

"Murphy, Sen Shayne",IND,2004-03-31,"—I make this point to the minister: in the course of any process in this place where the government is trying to push through legislation, I do not think it is appropriate to take any course of action like that which has been taken in the context that has been put to Senator Harradine. We all have a responsibility to seek certain outcomes and we do not always agree. There have been a number of occasions where the government has brought forward what it thinks is the correct position and it has ultimately been amended. This is no different a case. I think to go down the road—whether it is a threat or not, implied or otherwise—of suggesting that, if certain people do not support the government's legislation, they will be named— 
—That was not the intention.
—I understand from Senator Harradine—and I do not want to misrepresent what I thought I heard him read—that somebody, whether it was you or somebody else, would be informing members of the public, in particular those families who would in your eyes be likely to not receive a certain payment, of the names of the people responsible. I would just suggest to you, Minister, that that is not the way the business of this place ought to be conducted. I would hope that some people might be big enough to take a different approach and maybe even indicate an apology to that effect.
—She has already done that.
—I have already done that.
—I am sorry; I missed that.

We then say that there were amendments that we could not accept—and people make the judgment about whether we should accept them or not—and we would have to say that the opposition or whatever opposed it. We have done that with a lot of other bills that have gone through; we have said that the minor parties did not support certain bills. I did say that I thought one of my staff sent an email that was a little zealous. I apologised privately to Senator Harradine and I have apologised here in the chamber.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2004-03-31,"—Last night Senator Vanstone made some comments to the chamber after I incorporated a speech in the second reading debate on the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2004. I understand that the Opposition Whip raised the matter this morning in the chamber. I draw to the minister's attention that it is unusual for me to incorporate education speeches. I enjoy the prospect of failing this pathetic government on education, a practice I developed when you were education minister, Senator Vanstone. I learnt that there was much to say about the government's failings in this area. But we were requested by the government managers and by our own whips to facilitate the progress of the chamber given the particular time of the year. As a consequence, I supported that call. 
—It was a difficult decision—that is true. I did support the call and I found when I read the Hansard this morning that Senator Vanstone had made some statements which I find extraordinary given the circumstances of the proceedings last night. I am wondering whether she is now prepared to respond to the Opposition Whip's request this morning to give us an explanation of her remarks or perhaps to indicate to us whether or not she still maintains that attitude.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2004-03-31,"—Madam Chair, this debate is about higher ed. It is not about something I said last night but, if people's egos are so frail that they cannot stand a simple admission by a senator that she does not generally approve of the practice of incorporating second reads, then something is very wrong. Something is wrong if you cannot come into this place and put your view. I said, as recorded in the Hansard last night—I have not checked the Hansard but I think you were here—that I fully accept that the speeches were not being incorporated because people did not want to bother making them; they were being incorporated probably to accede to a request and to be helpful to the government. That record stands as an acknowledgment of exactly what you have said. Exactly what you said is what I said last night.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,2004-03-31,"—I thank the minister. I am not quite sure whether that constitutes an apology or an explanation but this is not a trivial matter, Minister. The reality is that we, to reiterate what I said this morning, were exhorted by the government manager to incorporate where possible. I had to do some fast-talking to convince Senator Carr to incorporate his speech, because he normally, as he says, pays very assiduous respect to matters of education. It was not just Senator Carr who incorporated his speech. All the parties incorporated their speeches, and it was an agreement around the chamber. When I read the comments this morning in Hansard, which I do not have in front of me although Senator Carr may, you said it—
—`diminishes the standing of the parliament'.
—Diminishing the standing of the parliament—that is actually what we took umbrage to. You may regard that as a frailty of ego. It is not. We were asked to do this by the government and we did it. After discussions with Senator Faulkner, we have requested a clarification be given or at least an admission be made that it was a personal view although you cannot have a personal view, I would submit, that is in direct contradiction to that of the people who manage the chamber. We have a proposition—which I think you may have fulfilled, albeit somewhat ungraciously—that until this explanation was provided we would not grant leave for the incorporation of speeches. It is not really up to me to decide whether that explanation fulfils that criterion or not but I do want to assert here that it is not a trivial matter, that it is not a matter of frailty of ego; it is a matter of trying to run the chamber in a cooperative way.
Comments like that, Minister Vanstone, simply do not assist those of us who are responsible for running the chamber at this time of year. We have before us a proposition from the government manager that there is no time limit as to when we finish sitting tomorrow. We could be here at four o'clock in the morning. I think it is more likely that we will come back on Friday. Our position will probably be that we should sit until 11 o'clock tomorrow night and then come back on Friday, which may cause you some problems, I understand. In respect of your explanation, I do not know whether you wish to be slightly more gracious, but I will seek advice from my leader as to whether your explanation fulfils the criterion.

I think it is clear from the Hansard last night—and if you read it fairly you will see this—that my statement is a statement of my opinion with respect to that practice, but it is also an acknowledgment that you were asked to do this. I cannot see what else you can ask for. If what you are seeking is an acknowledgment that it was not your idea and that you were asked to do it, I think that is contained in my remarks last night.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2004-03-31,"—I move opposition amendment (3) on sheet 4203:

9A Section 36-35
Repeal the section, substitute:

The minister has indicated that this was a case of us not being bothered to make our contributions to the chamber. One thing I can assure you of, Minister, is that I am very bothered about this government's education policies. If the government takes the view that incorporating speeches late at night on the third last day of a session is a reflection of our lack of interest, I can advise you that it is misled. There are probably another 10 or 15 bills to go tomorrow and this is not the sort of action, I would have thought, that any of the government managers would want to encourage.
I took the view with this particular bill that the government made some fundamental errors. Fundamental problems have emerged as a result of the shoddy work done last year. We had the extraordinary situation where a university like Notre Dame was going to be seriously disadvantaged by the incompetence of this government. These were measures which we pointed out last year would occur, but because of the sordid arrangements entered into by the government with Independent senators here a proposition was carried as a result of that backroom deal that no amendments would be considered to the government's higher education package last year. There was to be no consideration whatsoever of any improvements to the government's legislation. No attempt would be made whatsoever or allowed whatsoever to correct the errors of the government's draftsmen. It was inevitable that circumstances would arise within three months of the higher education package being carried by this chamber that the government would be back in this chamber seeking our indulgence to redress those errors.  
That is essentially what has happened here. The government has a series of amendments here which they claim are technical and which they claim are merely incidental but which of course are not incidental. They are of great importance to a number of institutions because they highlight the fact that the government had acted incorrectly and, if those errors had not been corrected, those institutions would be seriously disadvantaged.
There were other amendments that this government sought in terms of access to large sums of government money, which result from the government imposing upon universities terms and conditions which were unheard of in the higher education system in this country. They allowed for a higher level of ministerial direction of universities, which fundamentally undermined the traditional values we had come to expect in this country about the independence of universities. This of course meant that the government were asking universities to act in a way which was inconsistent with state acts of parliament. That is a consequence directly, once again, of the government's haste to put together a very shoddy arrangement. It is a consequence of the government's failure to understand the implications of that package. 
That is essentially what the discussion was about and I am pleased that the minister has provided us with an opportunity to once again draw that to the public's attention, and I will continue to do so. I look forward to the election campaign, when this will become a major question. Minister, I believe that the public will see it in the same way that I have argued today. I believe that the Labor Party's position will lead to a need for us to return to these issues and to undertake a fundamental rewriting of this legislation to remove from the statute books provisions which are seeing a massive increase in the level of burden being placed upon students by the fee regime being imposed and by a level of intervention in the operations of universities which, as I have said, is unprecedented in the history of higher education in this country.
So, Minister, I look forward to the election because I expect that you will be on this side of the chamber then. I look forward to your views then. I think that you will come to the view once again of the glories of opposition and I am sure that you will appreciate only too well that when a request is made at the end of the parliamentary session that matters be incorporated into Hansard you will have to face that dilemma. I look forward to the resolution.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2004-03-31,"—I rise tonight to speak on the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Strategic Investment Program Amendment Bill 2004. I move the second reading amendment that has been circulated in my name: 
At the end of the motion, add “but the Senate recognises the importance of innovation in the TCF sector and the need for policies that stimulate long-term growth and economic prosperity.
 (Senator Kirk)—Senator Carr, your amendment has not been circulated.
—It should have been. It was prepared some time ago and the request made. If it has not been circulated, I ask that it be circulated. It is such a succinct and precise statement of the problem with this bill that I am sure the chamber will have no trouble accepting those sentiments. It is necessary to highlight the difficulties that are emerging in the TCF industry. I have just been advised that there is a problem here. The chamber assistants have said that they had it ready to distribute but the government changed its mind and it was not able to be distributed. This is yet another example of the poor management of this chamber by the government.
The point of this second reading amendment is to highlight the need for the government to acknowledge the need for a change in policy and the need to emphasise that the TCF sector has an important role to play in this country. It has a very bright future if a policy setting which concentrates on innovation and which is committed to the long-term growth and economic prosperity of that sector is developed.
The bill provides for increased access for the leather and technical textiles sector to the strategic investment program in the final two years of the program. We will be supporting this bill for two reasons. Firstly, the program is currently underspent and any underspend should, in our view, be directed to the TCF industry. Secondly, there are parts of the TCF industry that will not be eligible for assistance under the government's proposed post-2005 TCF assistance package. The post-2005 assistance arrangements for the TCF sector are vital in assisting further restructuring of the TCF industries. The future of this important Australian industry rests with its ability to innovate, to invest in research and development and to unlock the creative potential of its employees. This will lead, in our judgment, to a higher level of quality exports. Exports will be the basis on which we can develop and protect this industry and ensure its long-term sustainable growth.
It is appropriate at this point to consider some other aspects of the post-2005 assistance package. We have strong differences with the government over different ways in which the TCF industry can be assisted to meet the challenges it will face in the future. We take the view that there should be no further tariff cuts without a comprehensive review of the TCF industries. We take the view that there should be a proper inquiry into the effects of reductions in tariffs up to 2010 and that that should occur before further tariff cuts are undertaken. It is a pretty straightforward and sensible approach, I would have thought, to have an inquiry into the effects of changes before the changes occur where possible. We say that on this occasion, that is clearly possible.
We are not in the business of seeking to wind the clock back. We are not about freezing tariffs indefinitely. We are not about pretending that the world has not changed. We are ensuring that this industry does have a future and that proper investigations of alternative strategies are pursued to maximise the opportunities for the owners of businesses in the TCF sector and for people employed in those businesses. If you look at the situation post 2007 we have to examine whether or not further tariff cuts are in the industry's long-term interests. What strikes me here is that there is a strong contrast with the approach the government is taking on this issue. This government is blinded by an ideological obsession with pursuing tariff cuts at any cost. This government is about abandoning its responsibilities to examine the social and economic implications of its policies. 
It is important that we look at what the Productivity Commission is saying. This is a body that has argued for a very long time that tariff cuts are of great benefit. But in the last report on TCF issues it was able to put a case that simply rests on the proposition that it is not able to demonstrate that further tariff reductions will generate a net national benefit. When the Productivity Commission itself cannot demonstrate a benefit, we are entitled to look a bit more deeply into what the government is proposing. The government is trying to suggest that the Labor Party are essentially old world and protectionist, that we are about interventions for their own sake. Nothing could be further from the truth. We are about ensuring that this country has a good policy framework, that the government measures up to its own responsibilities to the people of this country and that the information that is gathered, which directly affects the livelihoods of tens of thousands of families in this country, is sound. We are saying there should be a proper information collection process so that we can make judgments based on evidence, not on prejudice. It seems to be an approach that is currently lacking from the government's policy framework.
A Labor government will establish a review to examine the best means of ensuring that we can maximise opportunities for both workers and management within this industry. We are about looking at the issues of tariff and non-tariff barriers. We are about looking at market access. We are about making sure that this industry is able to take full advantage of the circumstances in this country that give it the most likely chance of success. We are about making sure we examine the social impacts of government decisions on workers, on regional towns and on the broader community. That is not an ideological obsession; that is commonsense. It is an approach that assumes that the people of this country are entitled to the support of government, that they are entitled to look to their government to make sure that policy decisions are taken by a government that actually understand the implications of those decisions.
Labor support a new strategic investment program for the TCF industries, but a new SIP program that encourages innovation and investment in research and development and in exports. Labor are concerned that the government are looking to cut the SIP from 2009 without looking at where the industry is going to be in 2009. Again, we say they are putting the cart before the horse. We need to examine the implications of policy before the policies are acted on—a sensible approach, I would have thought. We will have a good look at this legislation when it is introduced into this chamber. We say that it must be targeted at the right types of TCF enterprises to ensure that the right type of activity arises from government activity—activity that is research and development intensive, that is export oriented and that genuinely provides encouragement for innovation.
Labor also take the view that it is incumbent upon any national government to have an effective labour adjustment program for the textile, clothing and footwear industries. The Howard government abolished Labor's labour adjustment programs in 1997 without any consideration of the social impact of that decision, without any consideration of the effects that the abolition of such programs would have on those textile workers who were losing their jobs. On the face of it, the government's $50 million, 10-year structural adjustment program does not seem to us to meet the necessary requirements. It fails to face up to the challenges that will be faced by many workers within this industry. For a start, it is too little money over too long a period. If we are in the business of providing real assistance to workers in this industry, we should be trying to improve language skills, we should be providing vocational education skills and we should be genuinely finding alternative employment opportunities. 
The other area that concerns the Labor Party is the question of exports. We say that the growth of exports is fundamental to the capacity of this industry to have a prosperous future. That comes back to the issue of our capacity to gain access to international markets. We say that there needs to be concerted and sustained effort by government to improve market access for this country's textile manufacturers. It would seem to me that the proposed US-Australia free trade agreement fundamentally ignores this issue. What concerns me is that if that agreement does get up in its present form, as certainly is likely on the basis of the evidence that has been presented to me, we may in fact be denying Australian textile manufacturers the opportunity to secure access to the world's biggest market while at the same time the arrangements entered into leave open the possibility of Australia being flooded by US goods. So I believe there is an issue here about the effect of such an agreement on Australia's national interest.
Finally, I will talk about some misrepresentations on these issues that the government has been pursuing with the textile industry. Labor's position on these questions is very clear, and I have outlined it again tonight, but the government has been seeking to present these issues in a thoroughly distorted manner. It has been suggesting to employers that the Labor Party are seeking to block the strategic investment program. This is despite the fact that we have not actually seen the bill. This is despite the fact that the bill, as we understand it, will not provide significant assistance for some years. This is despite the fact that the government has repeatedly heard our statements of support for the SIP. It is being said that the government will propose that, unless agreement is made on the tariffs issue, there will be no SIP. It is the government that is blackmailing this industry. It is the government that is saying that unless the Labor Party capitulate on the tariff question it will not provide strategic assistance to the industry. We call that what it is—blackmail—and we will not stand for it. We will not be bullied into this.
The government had an opportunity to discuss these matters in a bipartisan way last year. I wrote to the minister and the minister's response was tardy, to say the least. Now we have a situation where the government is going to the industry and suggesting that the Labor Party is acting improperly. We have stated our position clearly: there should be no further tariff reductions until there is a proper inquiry into the effects of them. We also say that we will support the SIP—and if the government wants to put the bill into the chamber it can test our resolve on that question. Equally, it will be able to test our resolve on the tariff issue. But we will not bow to the blackmail that the government is proposing and we will say to the industry, `Go back to the government and say to them, “If you are serious about a SIP, put the bill into the parliament. Test it; see what the Labor Party's position really is.”' We have stated it publicly, and I repeat it here tonight. Do not try to blackmail us by suggesting that there has to be a trade-off in this manner in the dying days of this parliament.
We have seen with the legislative program so far that this government has treated this bill as a minor issue. It has constantly reduced this bill's priority on the legislative program. So it surprises me when the minister's office rings up and asks, `Is there a problem with the bill?' We say, `No, there is no problem with the bill. It is up to the government to determine the priorities that are set by the government as to when legislation is debated in this chamber.' We have sought to facilitate debate on these questions; that was a matter that was raised here a short while ago. We say to the government: if you are serious about a new SIP for the industry, put the bill into the chamber and you will find out what we are about. We will demonstrate our bona fides on those questions, but do not go to the industry, misrepresent our position and essentially propose a blackmail arrangement, because we will reject such an approach. I commend the second reading amendment to the chamber.

"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2004-03-31,"—I rise tonight to speak to the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Strategic Investment Program Amendment Bill 2004. The textile, clothing and footwear industry is a critical one, as Senator Carr has outlined. The Productivity Commission has noted that in 2000-01 Australia's 5,000 TCF firms generated turnover of $9 billion and provided factory based employment for at least 58,000 people in this country, a significant number by any means. The commission noted that at that time there were also the equivalent of as many as 25,000 full-time employees engaged in outwork related to the industry.
The report of the Productivity Commission review of TCF assistance was released in July last year. The government considered the recommendation of the Productivity Commission, and in November last year the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, Mr Macfarlane, announced that there would be a five-year pause on tariff reductions for the TCF industry from 2005 and that this would be followed by a gradual 10-year program of tariff reduction. To enable the industry to adjust to the new tariff arrangements, the government has announced that a $747 million assistance package will be implemented. We expect legislation giving effect to these proposed changes to be introduced into the parliament in the near future. I see that as the key bill that needs to be debated by this chamber as to whether or not it would win Senate support or, for that matter, Australian Democrat support.
A key element of any proposal for major change such as the government's plans for post-2005 arrangements for the industry is consultation with stakeholders. With respect to the TCF sector, consultation with industry and employees is especially critical. There have been mixed reactions so far to the decisions taken by the government. On one hand, business owners and employers within the industry are keen to have some certainty sooner rather than later. They have accepted a program of tariff reduction and they need to know the exact terms under which this will happen over the next decade. This will of course enable them to strategically plan their investment in development activities to develop niche areas and expand their export activities to ensure the long-term sustainability of the industry. On the other hand, employees of the TCF industry are justifiably concerned about the very real prospect of job losses under these new arrangements.
The National Secretary of the TCF Union of Australia has expressed serious concerns about the government's proposed amendments to the strategic investment program. The reduction in funding to the SIP scheme could see the loss of 30,000 jobs in the TCF sector by 2010, despite the fact that the government has promised $50 million for a 10-year structural adjustment program to assist any displaced workers as part of its plans for the post-2005 assistance arrangements for the industry. The government's media release describes this as `a program to offer case by case support to assist workers affected by large plant closures'. At first glance, this seems insufficient for what is likely to be a major program of labour market adjustment. The government is going to have to prove, I believe, that the transitional assistance component of its proposed changes to the assistance scheme is sufficient to help employees in the TCF industry develop and adapt their skills and retain or find new jobs. 
Certainly the range of people who have visited me—those from the union, the workers, and those who have been led by ministers in the Victorian parliament—have expressed concern about the likely impact on both jobs and the industry. The industry could be forgiven for a certain degree of scepticism about whether or not this government is truly looking out for its interests, because in the recently introduced free trade agreement with the United States, for instance, the opportunity to significantly improve export prospects for the industry was forgone by the trade negotiators. The TCF industry is facing significant challenges in coming years. It needs to be able to believe that the government really is looking out for the best interests of the industry and keeping an eye on the future.
The Democrats have been vocal critics of the blind faith of this and the previous government in market solutions and untrammelled competition policy, which has led to manufacturing and industry being undermined by an array of government policies including the reduction in tariffs, the restriction on research and development tax concessions, cuts to industry assistance programs, an unsympathetic tax system, heavy compliance costs from poor implementation of the new tax system, and a failure to engage in strategic industry and regional development planning.
We expect legislation to be introduced in the near future to give effect to the government's entire plan for the TCF industry and we are committed to a thorough examination of all of the proposals and a full assessment of the precise nature of the impact it will have upon this sector. We do acknowledge the need for certainty, especially with regard to long--term strategic planning for investment and industry development. However, we have serious concerns about the prospect of major job losses as a result of these changes. If we can believe what has been said so far, then certainly the numbers that have been forecast are quite significant and do need to be taken into account.
The bill before us does not raise the same level of alarm as the bill that is likely to come in the future will. As we are all aware, it is a transition measure and applies specifically to the leather and technical textile industries. The bill introduces an alternative cap for certain grants in respect of TCF value adding under the SIP scheme. Total grants for value adding made to leather or technical textile firms in the 2003-04 and 2004-05 income years are equivalent to the sum of the total grants for new and second-hand plant and building expenditure and research and development expenditure. The additional funds available for these matching grants are capped at $3.9 million. The leather and technical textile sectors of the TCF industry are not as vulnerable as other sectors. That has been noted particularly in the Bills Digest, which says that these sectors:
... have been less affected by the tariff reductions than other sectors in the industry and have responded positively under the SIP. Both sectors have performed strongly and have developed their export capability.
I note also that the leather industry in Australia has a turnover in excess of $730 million and employs more than 3,000 people, especially in regional areas. The leather industry accounts for 35 per cent of total TCF exports. The Australian technical and non-woven textile industry is also a strong performer, employing an estimated 10,000 people and with an annual turnover of around $1.7 billion. This sector has also experienced a healthy growth in exports. The bill will give firms in the leather and technical textile sectors an opportunity to engage in strategic planning and investment activities to maximise their opportunities to be as competitive as possible after 2005. 
The Democrats support this bill, but we will be watching very carefully to determine the merit of the next phase of the legislation that will implement the government's entire plan for the industry after 2005. We are committed to a process of thorough and careful scrutiny of the proposals when they are introduced into the parliament. A full assessment of the impact that these changes will have on the industry will, I believe, be essential to determine whether or not the assistance measures offered by the government are sufficient and properly targeted. We acknowledge the important contribution the TCF industry makes to the Australian economy and the need to ensure that this contribution is encouraged and developed in the decades to come. In conclusion, I am pleased to give the Democrats' support for the second reading amendment moved by Senator Carr on behalf of the opposition.",SENATE,"<title>TEXTILE, CLOTHING AND FOOTWEAR STRATEGIC INVESTMENT PROGRAM AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,36,1
"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2004-03-31,"—I rise to speak tonight on the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Strategic Investment Program Amendment Bill 2004. I welcome this bill being put this evening. As Senator Carr highlighted, we believe it has been a long time coming. The bill provides for an alternative cap to allow leather and technical textile businesses to access additional funding for the final two years of the strategic investment program. The leather and technical textile sectors combined employ an estimated 13,000 people in Australia and have a turnover of nearly $2.5 billion. Encouraging the leather and technical textile sectors of this industry is a laudable aim because they are the elements of the sector which has seen the smallest reduction in employment for the textile, clothing and footwear industries.
What I am most concerned about, as all of us should be, is the creation or maintenance of jobs in this industry. Employment in the TCF industries has fallen from 120,000 in the late eighties to 71,000 in 2002. There are obvious reasons for this dramatic fall in employment, many of which are entirely out of the control of any Australian government. While the government has provided some assistance to ease the effect of tariff reduction on the industry, the focus of that assistance has been on cushioning the move towards tariff reduction for business. As is so often the case, the Howard government has failed to address an even more serious concern: the thousands of workers who may well lose their jobs in the TCF industries as a result of the removal of tariff protection.
The government's time line for tariff reduction in this industry is hasty and irrational. Most concerning of all is that it will cost thousands of jobs because of its failure to protect workers. It has been estimated by the Victorian government that 6,500 jobs will be lost in that state alone. Because of the concentration of TCF manufacturing in regional areas, the Howard government's policy of accelerated tariff reduction will have a serious effect on communities where TCF industries are the primary source of employment. It is unwise for any government to implement economic and trade policy without looking at the broader implications of its actions, yet that is exactly what this government has done. 
The Labor Party has committed to holding tariffs in this industry at current levels pending a review. Under a Labor government, that review will take the tariffs and trade barriers of our trading partners into account in the process of reducing our own tariffs. That is the balanced and sensible policy—one which takes real trade conditions into account, and one which would serve to protect Australian industry and jobs against unfair trade barriers imposed by other nations. In stark contrast, the current government has imposed a rigid and strict tariff reduction time line on an industry which cannot afford to be exposed to the trade practices of other nations. The current government appears to be motivated not by the national interest but by a sweeping ideological preference for the removal of tariffs come what may. That ideological preference was clearly articulated by the government's recent free trade negotiations with the United States which sold out Australian industry while providing American business with unprecedented access to Australian markets.
The former Labor government was realistic about the challenges which will be faced by workers in the TCF industries. Labor realised that many workers in the industry are from non-English speaking backgrounds. Labor knew that those workers would have trouble finding work in other industries, and as such implemented the labour adjustment program—a program designed to help employees, the very people who stand to lose the most as tariffs fall in this industry. But in 1996, the Howard government abolished the labour adjustment program. We have a government which, on the one hand, has decided to hasten the removal of tariffs but which, within its first year of government, removed a program providing skills to the very workers who will be affected the most. The government, under considerable pressure, belatedly reintroduced the labour adjustment program under a different name and with considerably less funding. Labor has committed to reinstituting an appropriate labour adjustment program which has appropriate levels of funding. It is only fair that Australians for whom there is a possibility that their jobs will disappear be retrained and provided with other skills.
Labor are committed to that process, while the Howard government's actions have proven it to be unaware of the requirements of these workers. On this side, we see that the TCF industries have the potential to grow. We know that they will be able to maintain profitable and long-lasting businesses. But there needs to be a hands-on approach to the development of sustainability in the industry. The leather and technical textile sectors have proven that the industry is viable. That is why we have committed to creating a permanent textile, clothing and footwear industry council. That council will focus on increasing innovation and developing export strategies to ensure value added exports. This is in stark contrast to the Howard government's approach to the industry which appears to be merely recompense for its failure to implement an appropriate time line for the reduction of tariffs.
We will not oppose this bill because it does provide assistance to elements of the textile, clothing and footwear industries, but it is part of the government's piecemeal approach to saving this industry. What the industry needs is not bits and pieces, but a program which truly believes that there is a future in manufacturing textiles, clothing and footwear in this nation. In conclusion, Labor have developed a plan with that objective and will implement it for the good of the 70,000 Australians who are still employed in that industry.",SENATE,"<title>TEXTILE, CLOTHING AND FOOTWEAR STRATEGIC INVESTMENT PROGRAM AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,36,1
"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2004-03-31,"—I rise to make a few brief points about the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Strategic Investment Program Amendment Bill 2004. I do so on the basis of the importance of the TCF industry, in particular to my home state of Victoria, where a large proportion of the industry is based. If we look at the figures of every group of employees in this industry that numbers over 1,000, we see that on a seat by seat basis, apart from the seat of Fowler, every other area is in Victoria. In the seat of Batman, there are 1,440; in Calwell, 1,700; in Corio, 1,443; in Holt, 1,087; in Indi, 1,189; in Maribyrnong, 1,585; and in Scullin, 1,838. That is certainly a significant proportion of the Victorian industry. This is a very important and crucial industry providing a large number of jobs and it ought to be good quality, secure employment. 
There has been a significant transition in this industry over the years and many of the companies in the industry have adapted and gone high-tech. They have very high skills, good delivery modes, excellent products and fantastic quality. It is an industry that is worthy of government planning and intervention, not to be discarded, as this government seems intent on doing. There is certainly no evidence and no indication from anywhere, including the Productivity Commission, that a further reduction in tariffs in this industry is going to drive further productivity or efficiency in this industry. There is no evidence of that whatsoever.
What this government is doing to this industry is simply putting them in a race to the bottom in terms of wages. When we are trying to compete with low-wage countries with unlimited resources of labour, such as China, we will only win that race to the bottom. That is not what we ought to be doing to this industry or to any other industry, for that matter. What we need to do is have a proper, structured industry plan with government intervention that actually encourages innovation and investment in this industry and that drives further high-skilled jobs, innovation, investment and research and development that can provide a secure future for the numerous people who work in this industry and for future generations. This industry should never be seen as an industry that is dying, as one that we should give up on, trying only to look after those who are in it now and pretending that we should have no industry into the future.
The Victorian government commissioned a report very recently called The Long Goodbye and this study tells us a lot about the TCF sector. It noted the Webber and Weller study that was done in 2001 that demonstrated that one-third of TCF workers retrenched in the early 1990s had not found commensurate jobs. The findings of The Long Goodbye study indicated an even bleaker picture for this industry. Almost one-half of retrenched workers had not found employment after the mean time of 39 months after the date of retrenchment. While most workers had worked full time before retrenchment, few of those who found jobs were able to obtain full-time employment after the period of retrenchment, and not a single person was earning as much as they had before retrenchment. That paints a very bleak picture indeed.
At a time when we have had significant economic growth in this country, it seems astounding that the government has simply discarded this particular industry. I think that is shameful situation, considering the number of people in this industry and the value that it contributes to our economy and our society. We know that it contributes about $9 billion to our economy every year. There are substantial fiscal costs if we abandon this industry, as this government seems intent on doing. By November 2004 the number of TCF workers across Australia is projected to fall from about 68,400—the figures for May 2003—to 39,500. That is a substantial reduction across the board in this industry, but also in many of the regional centres where this industry is a major, if not the only, employer. 
Based on ABS labour force figures and the survey conducted by The Long Goodbye study, the cost of retrenchments to the federal government in terms of unemployment payments alone will be an additional $114 million per year. Those social costs are often not factored in when the government decides not to proceed with any form of protectionism in the absence of a structured industry assistance program that actually looks at saving the industry, investing in it and making it sustainable into the long term, and that is an unfortunate situation indeed.
Clearly, the free trade agreement recently negotiated with the United States also fails this industry. The unfortunate part of it is that the US has applied the yarn forward rule in this industry. The United States TCF industry have what they call the yarn forward rule, which effectively means that as long as the yarn is produced in the United States, even though the high labour intensive part of actually making garments or footwear may be done elsewhere—in Mexico, Chile or in other areas where the US does or does not have free trade agreements—the goods can be considered to be US goods for the basis of our free trade agreement with the United States.
We say that that is a significantly unfair advantage, especially since we cannot take advantage of that provision. Our industry, for a whole range of reasons, imports most of its yarn, yet most of the high labour intensive parts of the industry are in fact done in Australia. The yarn forward rule does not assist our industry in any way in getting export markets into the US, but the free trade agreement certainly assists the US industry in getting export markets into Australia. We say that the free trade agreement has failed this industry, just as the government has failed it and looks as though it will continue to fail it time and time again.
Labor has a very different approach. We certainly do not believe that we should be removing the tariffs on the current government timetable. We say very clearly that no tariffs should be reduced until we have actually done a comprehensive study into the social and economic impacts on this industry and come up with a proper industry plan which will deliver the incentive and the ability for the industry to grow, invest, become even more high tech, efficient and sustainable into the long term and continue to provide that very necessary employment in this particular sector. While Labor does support this bill, its effect is simply to spend an underspend in the existing program. We think that is terrific, but it does not do what is really required to make this industry sustainable into the long term. We call on the government to develop a proper industry policy, one that has an objective of saving and encouraging this industry into the future.",SENATE,"<title>TEXTILE, CLOTHING AND FOOTWEAR STRATEGIC INVESTMENT PROGRAM AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,36,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2004-03-31,"—I rise to support the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Strategic Investment Program Amendment Bill 2004 and the second reading amendment moved by the opposition. The textile, clothing and footwear industry has been an important part of Tasmanian industry, although it has been declining in recent years. It has been a very big employer, and it is still rather substantial. There are about 1,500 people employed in the Tasmanian TCF industry. It accounts for a large part of the work force in Devonport. Sadly, there have been considerable job losses in the industry over recent years. Sheridan, the Tamar Knitting Mills and Coats Paton have closed in the past ten years. Devonport, a city with a work force of over 5,000 people, has about 10 per cent of its work force employed by the Australian Weaving Mills and Ulster Tascot. There are, of course, many other employees from other businesses that supply these two companies. The TCF industry is therefore a major and central part of the community's economy. 
Blundstone, an Australian icon based in Hobart, is concerned that it may have to relocate offshore because it is being undercut by cheap imported boots. It is a family owned business struggling to remain Australian and to employ local workers in Hobart. It exports Australian boots to South Africa, Europe, Israel, Canada and the United States. I can give a personal assurance that they are very good boots. I lived in them for about five days after the last parliamentary session when my wife and I went on the Federation Peak track. It rained for four of the days, and these boots were marvellous in the mud and slush and for climbing up slippery Moss Ridge. We almost got to the top of Moss Ridge but, because it was raining, it was too bad to go any further. Without those Blundstone boots, I do not know what we would have done. So that is a little advertisement. Without continued support, Australian leather goods and Australian boots may soon become a thing of the past. Last year, Blundstone laid off six staff and replaced them with two contract workers, reportedly in the struggle to remain competitive.
My focus is of course on Tasmania, but I have noticed how many other regional areas around Australia depend on TCF jobs, such as Wangaratta, Bendigo, Geelong and Albury-Wodonga, plus a number of others. Tasmanians living in an island state have particular difficulties, shared no doubt by other regional areas. Loss of TCF jobs in Tasmania is more than just an inconvenience. These workers and their colleagues have particular skills that are difficult to place in the relatively small Tasmanian employment market. They either have to retrain extensively in the hope of finding new employment or uproot their families and leave Tasmania.
TCF workers are often from groups that are relatively marginalised in our society. Over 40 per cent are from non-English-speaking backgrounds and over 70 per cent have no formal qualifications, though they are highly skilled in the TCF industry. More than 50 per cent are over 35 years of age, so they tend to be older workers who would have difficulty finding new jobs or to relocate, as they are more likely to have families. About 60 per cent of employees are women, so traditionally they may not be the main breadwinner and may not be able to relocate to find alternative employment. Their family may just have to struggle to cope with the drop in income if they cannot find another local job.
Outworkers are one group of TCF workers who do not even have the relative security of working in a clothing factory. A Senate committee looked at outworkers in the clothing industry in 1996 and noted that they were becoming more prevalent. The industry was being structured around them in an effort to compete against cheap imports. The Productivity Commission estimates that there are about 25,000 outworkers in Australia—about 40 per cent of total TCF factory based employment and 25 per cent more than factory based clothing employment.
Many outworkers can be described as being in sweated labour. A 2001 report by Dr Christina Cregan of the University of Melbourne found that the average pay rate for a group of surveyed outworkers was just $3.60 per hour. Remember we are talking about a report in 2001. Some were being paid under $1 an hour. Many migrants are so desperate for work that they take these jobs. They do not have the opportunity to search for or train for a better job, in part because they are not eligible for the higher-paying government welfare payments until they have been in Australia for two years. 
Last year the Productivity Commission looked at the plight of outworkers and noted that they were vulnerable to exploitation. The commission also noted that, although governments had implemented legislation to protect outworkers, the reality was that it was not being enforced, either because of the difficulty of doing so in such a dispersed work environment or because of a lack of resources. Outworkers are at even greater risk of extended unemployment if they lose their jobs, difficult though those jobs can be. The great majority have little English and no educational qualifications and have invested significant amounts in sewing equipment. This is the reality for TCF workers. They are from marginalised groups in uncertain employment.
Last year a number of TCF workers visited my office to recount the fears they have for their jobs in the light of the recent Productivity Commission examination of TCF tariffs. They are real people with homes, communities, families and friends nearby, kids at school and bills and mortgages to pay. They are not economic units to be moved to new areas of employment without personal pain and dislocation.
The TCF industry has been constantly improving and becoming more efficient over almost 20 years, kicked off by moves to improve the industry by then Senator John Button. Unfortunately, the strong Australian dollar in recent months is also making it difficult for local industries like TCF. The tight competitive situation and the fact that some textile companies are still shedding jobs—for example, the Australian Weaving Mills in Devonport cut 13 jobs just last November—show that these companies still need support. I understand that the government does provide assistance to TCF companies, mainly in the form of the strategic investment program.

"Ferris, Sen Jeannie",LP,2004-03-31,"—Yesterday, Agriculture Minister Warren Truss released the government's response to the Keniry inquiry, which looked into the conditions and future of the live animal export industry. The response that was announced by Minister Truss set out $11 million worth of initiatives to both improve animal welfare standards and ensure the long-term security of this very important industry to Australia. This announcement and the measures outlined by Minister Truss will give certainty to the 9,000 Australians who work in this industry and whose jobs are dependent on it. It is a $1 billion livestock export trade, and I would like to congratulate Minister Truss tonight on the initiatives that he announced and the reforms that he has proposed for the industry.
I do not think any of us in this chamber will forget the tragic Cormo Express episode and the damage that was done to our international livestock carrier industry. It inflicted terrible damage on the export industry from Australia through the unacceptable on-board livestock mortalities that occurred after the rejection of the consignment by the Saudi authorities. 
To considerably reduce, and hopefully minimise, the likely chance of such an incident ever occurring again, a range of measures have been put in place and were announced yesterday by Minister Truss. These include increased government involvement in the regulatory framework for the industry, including surprise audits and inspections of ships; an industry quality assurance standard; improved risk management procedures and systems management; the investment of $1 million a year in improving animal welfare outcomes in the Middle East; and the establishment of new export protocols with Middle East destinations. I recently visited a live animal export ship down in Port Adelaide, at Outer Harbour. It was loading sheep. It was an old car carrier that had previously taken vehicles to the Middle East. It was certainly a very different ship to the old open deck ships that used to take our livestock. I was very impressed with the way the heat stress model would operate on these ships. When live animals are loaded and leave Australia the temperature in the countries for which they are destined is taken into account. There is a great deal more space around the sheep than on voyages which go to cool climate countries.
Our record on live animal standards is already strong. We now show a declining mortality rate on voyages, down from 0.34 per cent of cattle shipped in 1999 to 0.10 per cent in 2003 and from 1.34 per cent of sheep to 0.99 per cent over the same period. With the Keniry reforms in place I am quite sure that those figures will continue to decline. Key changes that the government has agreed to and that the industry has accepted include a new livestock export code, which will be referenced in legislation and which exporters will need to meet before shipments can be cleared; a new annual licensing arrangement to make sure the exporters meet certain standards and procedures; and the inspection and registration of export feedlots, including increased inspection times in the feedlot before final permits for export are issued. Australian veterinarians will be required on voyages to the Middle East. These vets will report directly to AQIS, will be personally trained in procedures for the voyages and will be held liable in the event that any incorrect information is reported.
Keniry recommended that all animal exports from the southern ports be banned during the winter. Fortunately for South Australia and Victoria, that recommendation—which covered the ports of Port Adelaide and Portland—was not accepted by the government. However, the heat stress model system which I referred to earlier will be adopted to ensure that those voyages contain sheep which have been particularly loaded to take into account the temperatures in the countries for which they are destined. The importance of this decision to Port Adelaide, in my home state of South Australia, is very significant. The opportunity now exists, through giving that certainty to the industry, for the establishment of a port encompassing world's best practice standards. I am sure that my colleagues in Victoria will have the same view about the facility at Portland. The security and confidence that is offered by this decision is significant to both the grazing industry and the exporters themselves, and it cannot be underestimated. Furthermore, the stringent quality assurance systems and the longer preparation and inspection times that are going to be imposed at feedlots under the new standards will further reduce the risks that are going to apply on those ships. 
The trade to Saudi Arabia remains suspended and will not be renewed without a government to government memorandum of understanding so we can ensure that there will never be a repeat of the Cormo Express set of circumstances. I have visited Saudi Arabia and I can say that the feedlots in Riyadh are certainly not what we would want for our animals. But let us not forget that Saudi Arabia is a country where there are 3,000 honour killings a year, where fathers and brothers kill their daughters and their sisters. We should never forget that. When we are talking about the care of animals in Saudi Arabia, we should have a look at how those families treat some of their female children. I think it puts criticism of the feedlots in Riyadh in a different context when you consider 3,000 honour killings occur every year in that country.
A new compulsory research and development levy that is to be introduced, in consultation with the industry, will be matched dollar for dollar by the federal government and will make sure that the very best circumstances apply on these ships when the animals are loaded so that the stock arrives in the very best condition, through the exporter, to the country where they have been sold. 
Minister Truss's announcement has been warmly welcomed by industry. The National Farmers Federation said yesterday that the government's response to the Keniry report will help secure the long-term future of the industry. The Sheepmeat Council, one of the industry bodies that joins with the National Farmers Federation, said:
The Australian Government's much awaited response to the Keniry live export review is a positive outcome ...
That is, for the sheepmeat industry. It helps `sheep meat producers across the country' and it will `enable the ports of Portland and Adelaide to operate all year-round'. That is a very important and quite substantial change from the Keniry recommendations. Mr Ian Feldtmann, President of the Sheepmeat Council, said that the $4 million to be made available over four years to help improve animal welfare and handling practices in importing countries is also very significant. The Cattle Council has also praised the decision, saying:
The Government has demonstrated its commitment to Australian cattle producers who rely on the live export trade by—
the announcement of the—
$11 million funding commitment to help address areas of concern.
The government's response to the Keniry report will deliver improved animal welfare outcomes as well as bringing security to a crucially important industry employing 9,000 Australians. The decisions announced by Minister Truss yesterday represent a massive vote of confidence in the industry as a whole by the federal government. The minister is to be congratulated on the courage that I believe he showed in taking this decision, which reinforces a sense of confidence and security in the industry that has been sadly lacking since the disaster of the Cormo Express.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Trade: Live Animal Exports</title>,Adjournment,38,1
