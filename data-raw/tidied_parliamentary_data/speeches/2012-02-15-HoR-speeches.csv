Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (09:01):  by leave—In the long story of relations among the peoples of our nation—the story of our struggles with each other and of our struggles to reconcile—there have been some good days which we will not forget. Days when a glimpse of a better time came briefly into view. We have cherished them. We cherished 27 May 1967, when Australians voted 'yes' to empower the Commonwealth to bring the resources of the whole nation to bear to address Indigenous disadvantage. Perhaps the greatest was here, four years ago, 13 February 2008, when Kevin Rudd said 'sorry'. Sorry on behalf of all of us, for the 'grief, suffering and loss', for the 'pain, suffering and hurt', for the 'indignity and degradation'. A day we cherished, when we saw our nation as we wish it could always be.


Now we look forward to another such day—to the day when Australia’s Indigenous peoples are recognised in the act which constitutes the Australian Commonwealth. And we look forward to the work that we will do together on all the days that lie between. Every day, our conscience demands we work to Close the Gap. That work, every day, is what this government has done. By embracing the targets of the Closing the Gap campaign, this government deliberately leaves itself nowhere to hide. Closing the Gap is a practical and empirical project and it is a project that should move us deeply, work which will make such a difference in so many individual lives.


We aim to halve the gap in mortality rates for Indigenous children under five by 2018, so more Indigenous babies live; to ensure access to early childhood education for all Indigenous four-year-olds in remote communities by 2013, so more Indigenous children are ready on their first day of school; to halve the gap in literacy and numeracy achievements for children by 2018, so more Indigenous children know the love of books; to halve the gap for Indigenous students in year 12 or equivalent attainment rates by 2020, so more Indigenous young people are ready for life and a job; to halve the gap in employment outcomes between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians by 2018, so more Indigenous adults know the dignity and benefits of work; and we aim to close the life-expectancy gap within a generation—that is, by 2031—so every Indigenous Australian has the chance to grow old.




Measurement Has Improved



Measurement is central to this project of Closing the Gap. Because the Closing the Gap targets are not meant just to challenge us to do more—they are designed to hold us accountable to our ambitions. It is through the annual assessment of the independent COAG Reform Council that is published in June each year and through the annual Closing the Gap report, which the government releases today, that we are brought to book.


The targets we have set are specific and measurable tests of our improvement. Last year I reported that measurement of progress towards these targets, including by the states and territories, also needs to improve. However we can already track progress in reducing under-five-year-old mortality each year. We have effective measures of access to early childhood education and our measurement of achievements in reading, writing and numeracy is sound. Direct measurement of life expectancy and year 12 attainment relies on the Australian census data, which is only available every five years. So we track overall mortality on an annual basis—and this forms a reliable proxy from which we can track improvement in life expectancy. And we track trends in apparent school retention each year, which acts as a guide to year 12 attainment. Our employment target is measured using the respected National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Survey and the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Survey, direct measures of progress which are available every three years—supplemented by the five-yearly census.


But when we began the work of closing the gap, we knew that we needed better information about Indigenous health, education and employment. This is why the 2009-10 budget invested almost $50 million extra over four years, funding new work by national data agencies and the states and territories, to give us data which is more detailed and reliable, more comprehensive and easier to compare—particularly between census years. This year I can report that measurement has improved.


Central to the effort to measure progress is the census—and last year’s was better than any before. Twenty million dollars of that extra funding was allocated to improve census data collection methods. Local engagement managers and mobile teams built early rapport with Indigenous communities. They organised the delivery and collection of census books differently and they developed new ways for people who aren’t literate in English to answer census questions. They worked especially hard in the most remote areas and among the most disadvantaged. Indigenous communities themselves already tell us the 2011 census was an important improvement on the past.


We have improved other measurement besides the census. To improve data on access to early childhood education, the Australian Bureau of Statistics has led the development of the new National Early Childhood Education and Care data collection. Importantly, this collection includes data on early childhood education in early childhood centres. We now have nationally consistent data on smoking during pregnancy and we have agreed data to track the timing of the first antenatal visit—so we will be able to say how many Indigenous women get advice from a health professional at the right times during their pregnancy. New key performance indicators will help us better understand the contribution of Indigenous specific primary health care services.


All this is thankless, detailed, time-consuming work—performed by dedicated professionals in statistical collection and analysis. But because of it, I am confident we can say that we are better placed than ever before to measure effectively our progress to close the gap.




Progress against the Closing the Gap t
argets



Today’s Closing the Gap report shows that the foundations for overcoming Indigenous disadvantage are in place. The report shows that we are seeing progress—we are making gradual gains. The Australian government remains most confident of meeting two of the six targets. The target of halving the infant mortality rates for Indigenous children under five by 2018 is on track. We are also confident we can ensure access to early childhood education for all Indigenous four-year-olds in remote communities by 2013.


For the third, we are also now generally on track to meet the target to halve the gap in reading, writing and numeracy achievement for Indigenous children by 2018. This assessment is based on results from the annual National Assessment Program—Literacy and Numeracy, which most people know as NAPLAN. We can see measurable improvement in the 2011 NAPLAN results. Significant gains occurred between 2010 and 2011 in the percentage of Indigenous students at or above the national minimum standards. For example, year 3 numeracy was up by 7.0 percentage points and year 9 reading was up by 7.7 percentage points. In fact in seven of the eight areas in which we can assess progress in reading and numeracy since 2008 the gap has narrowed. And in six of these eight, the improvement over four years is fast enough that if it continues we will meet the target by 2018. In year 7 and year 9 numeracy progress still needs to accelerate.


We continue to see improvement in two more of the six targets, and with faster improvement over time we believe these can be reached. The report shows that apparent retention rates to year 12 are improving for Indigenous students—up from barely 30 per cent in 1995 to just over 47 per cent in 2010. Faster improvement will be required to halve the gap in year 12 or equivalent attainment rates by 2020. We will need to keep expanding post-school training and education—we need more places. We will need to keep working with Indigenous young people to ensure they find the opportunities which exist in the education and training system.


Faster improvement will also be required to halve the gap in employment outcomes between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians by 2018. Indigenous employment has increased sharply in Australia in recent decades, reflecting a long period of almost uninterrupted economic growth—and an active and engaged approach from corporate Australia. Never before in our nation’s history has business been more prepared to play its part. Just under 90,000 additional jobs were won by Indigenous Australians from 1994 to 2008. The Indigenous unemployment rate fell from 31 per cent in 1994 to 23 per cent in 2002 and to 16.6 per cent in 2008. In urban areas, the majority of Indigenous Australians of working age are employed—this was not the case 20 years ago.


Closing the gap on life expectancy by 2031 remains the most challenging target of all. Progress towards the other health, education and employment targets all provide strong foundations to help us lift life expectancy. And the life expectancy target is the longest term of the six—it is a twenty-five-year target. While the challenge is very large we do know that some progress is being made. In Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory the Indigenous mortality rate declined by 36 per cent from 1991 to 2010—and there was a significant narrowing of the gap in mortality rates with non-Indigenous Australians. We know what the main causes of Indigenous mortality are—chronic disease and accident and injury, so we are working to limit their incidence and reduce the harm they do. Hundreds of extra Indigenous health workers are working to attack scourges like cancer, diabetes, heart disease and mental illness, as well as targeting risk factors for chronic disease such as smoking, poor nutrition and lack of exercise. Four years into a 25-year project, this much is true: health outcomes, employment outcomes, education outcomes are improving; they need to keep improving and to improve more quickly. This much is also true: foundations are in place, work is underway, we can measure encouraging improvement right now. This is our progress towards Closing the Gap.




The work goes on



One of the great myths of Indigenous disadvantage is that it persists despite decades of expensive public responses. The reality is quite the reverse. Report after report has shown that decades of under-investment in services and infrastructure are unquestionably a major cause of disadvantage, especially for the very young. No Australian family, however hard-working, self-respecting or self-reliant, is expected to fix broken sewerage pipes at the end of their street or repair street lighting outside their house. These are things governments are responsible for—the basic, universal services all Australians are entitled to expect. So the Australian government has heard the call to change.


We have delivered billions of dollars of additional investment in the 'building blocks' of better lives. In early childhood and in schools, in health and healthy homes, in economic participation, in safe communities, in leadership and governance. I have seen the difference this is making even in places where problems seem as intractable as they have been in the town camps of Alice Springs.


And so many Indigenous people have heard the call to change too. They have taken on new responsibilities, not only to improve their own circumstances, but also to share the example with their young. I have met the people who are making these changes in their own lives. They know that no Australian government, however active or ambitious, can get any child out of bed for school in the morning or make any parent ask visitors to leave at a reasonable hour so the children in a small house can sleep. These things are the responsibilities of every Australian family.


Another great myth of Indigenous disadvantage is that the nation must choose between 'two reconciliations'—symbolic and practical. That we must choose between a reconciliation which respects the rights and responsibilities of culture and land and a reconciliation which respects the rights and responsibilities to education, health and jobs. This is also quite false. It runs against what we all know to be true in our own lives—that the things of the spirit are inextricably linked with the things of day-to-day life. A life of plenty without respect and acceptance is still a life half-lived—as is a life of poverty with respect and acceptance. Human beings need to nourish and sustain both body and soul. The reconciliation we seek between us is not something which can be sorted or classified like a list of policy priorities. We seek precisely the kind of harmony and concord—a national unity—which can never be whole or complete under conditions of poverty and unfairness. And we seek precisely the kind of practical benefits in people’s lives: better education, employment and health, which can never ultimately work without sharing responsibility and self-respect.


I think of my visit to the Northern Territory during the dry season last year. There, in the spectacularly beautiful Alice Springs Desert Park, I handed back to traditional owners the title to their land under the Aboriginal Land Rights Act. I saw people overwhelmed and emotional about the handover and what it represented. I remember Alice Ngalkin signing the deeds while her friends and family took photos to mark the event. A moment of great symbolic power which I shared with deep respect and which on that day brought me so much closer to the Indigenous people there.


And in the atmosphere of respect which we had built between us, the local Aboriginal elders and I then sat down to talk. And they told me as frankly as anyone could, with both sentiment and deep conviction, what they believed I need to know about the practical problems they face. They spoke about the need to listen and to trust. And they said that the education system had failed Aboriginal people and it is critical to addressing disadvantage. They said that the way the emergency response started in 2007 caused shame and hurt and they wanted to stay with us on the new journey. And they spoke about alcohol and its harms—the need to be tougher. They did not pick sides in some dialectic or debate, but because of the trust we had shared that day, we could speak together in respect about what they knew was wrong and what they knew would work.


And that week, on the Gove Peninsula, I saw the traditional owners of the land and the representatives of a mining giant sign an agreement. Signed before a gathering of thousands of people from all over Arnhem Land and from all around Australia. We all met there for a striking ceremony performed on what was long contested country, where those most potent of all symbols of the struggle for land—the Yirrkala bark petitions—were inscribed in 1963. And we met to celebrate an agreement which secures the future operations of the bauxite mine, alumina refinery and Nhulunbuy township, which delivers Indigenous people real economic benefits from the mining investment boom, with economic development, jobs, better housing and community facilities.


In the Desert Park and on the peninsula—among Australians who treasure progress and respect—I have seen and felt the presence of the reconciled nation we can become. Where secure title to the big tracts of traditional land gives traditional owners a long-term economic future and a share in the jobs and opportunities the land can create. And where secure title to a home in a town or community gives parents the security to raise and educate their children in a safe environment. Where, by saying sorry for the wrongs of the past and by recognising Indigenous people in our Constitution, we build respect between all Australians. And where that respect allows us to speak honestly with each other as we decide, together, what works where. Not to the detriment of basic local service delivery—never accepting the 'soft bigotry of low expectations' or attempting to 'explain away' violence against women. But yes, bound together as individuals and as a nation by shared symbols of respect and practical action—listening to each other properly, about what the best evidence tells us about what will make the greatest difference.


Whether the conversation is between a minister of my cabinet and the National Congress of Australia’s First Peoples, or between a departmental official and a parent who works part time as a local teacher’s aide, we listen to each other—and then we get on with the job. This is the relationship between our people that I seek.




Constitutional 
r
ecognition



Perhaps the ultimate manifestation of respect is constitutional recognition of Indigenous Australians. The proposal before the country now has been many years in the making. Over decades, many ways to recognise Indigenous Australians as our first peoples, to affirm their full and equal citizenship and to remove remaining traces of racial discrimination from our law have been proposed.


In August 1937, William Cooper sent a petition with 1,814 signatures to Prime Minister Joseph Lyons requesting that he forward it to King George VI, seeking direct representation in parliament. In June 1988, the chairs of the northern and central land councils presented the Barunga Statement to Prime Minister Bob Hawke. It called upon the Australian government and people to recognise key Indigenous rights and 'to negotiate a treaty recognising our prior ownership, continued occupation and sovereignty and affirming our human rights and freedoms'. And my party’s national platform has pledged its support to constitutional recognition since 1998.


Then, in October 2007, Prime Minister John Howard raised the hopes of a nation, pledging that:


If re-elected, I will put to the Australian people within 18 months a referendum to formally recognise Indigenous Australians in our Constitution—their history as the first inhabitants of our country, their unique heritage of culture and languages, and their special (though not separate) place within a reconciled, indivisible nation.


It was a gracious and deliberate statement which effectively began the contemporary process that leads to today.


And four years on, the movement for constitutional recognition is strong and growing. It grew through 2008, when the cabinet met in East Arnhem Land and was solemnly petitioned to continue with this process. And in 2010 I announced the appointment of an Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition of Indigenous Australians to do the hands-on work of developing options for constitutional change.


I didn’t send the panel on an easy journey—and they performed mightily. Last month, the co-chairs, Patrick Dodson and Mark Leibler, delivered the panel’s report on Recognising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in the Constitution to the government. I have thanked them publicly already and I do so again here today.


For constitutional change, Australians have to understand and be persuaded of the case for change. This does require all-embracing political bipartisanship. But it requires more. Political bipartisanship, while necessary, is not sufficient. We need more than the consent of the governed to an agreement between parliamentarians—we need a genuine community desire for change.


Our Constitution is our nation’s founding contract—our people rightly guard it with care. Support for constitutional recognition must genuinely have the people’s support. This is what happened in 1967. Yes, bipartisanship—but more. A deep feeling in the Australian community leading to millions of Australian people deciding to say yes to change.


Today, the minister for Indigenous affairs and I are announcing funding for a community conversation, to be sponsored by Reconciliation Australia. To build support for what is already the subject of bipartisan agreement: the principle of constitutional recognition. And to build understanding of the ways in which constitutional recognition might be achieved. The expert panel’s report provides a firm foundation for this discussion.


This is an opportunity for the Australian people to get involved. To get on the You Me Unity website, to learn about what’s in the panel’s report, and what happens next. To find practical information and solid ideas and to discuss them—in their homes and with their neighbours, in their community meetings and in their workplaces, in their trade unions and in their churches.


The government is committed to this change—we are committed to building public support for this change—and in the many conversations which follow in the Australian community, we will take a leading part. It is through the sum of that myriad of conversations, of people listening and speaking with respect, that we will truly know that our people are ready to say yes to this change.




Small 
v
ictories



The day we said sorry was a great day in this nation’s history. The day of constitutional recognition will be another. Closing the gap is an accumulation of all the small victories on all the many days that lie between. The young man, first in his family to learn a trade, with skilled work on his traditional lands. The young woman, first in her family to earn a degree, holding a job in the city. The basic public services that surround them, delivered at the standard every Australian expects. The keys to a couple’s first home—and the life of dignity and pride they live within it, raising children who are ready to take their place in a reconciled nation. The respect shown to them by people in the community where they live. The detailed measurements which tell us this is so.


When more Indigenous children are ready to learn on their first day of school, we will know we are closing the gap. When brilliant Indigenous school leavers are as sought after by the big firms as brilliant Indigenous footballers are sought after by the big clubs, we will know we are closing the gap. When fewer Indigenous men between 35 and 45 die of disease, we will know we are closing the gap. Today, we know we have a long way to go. But we also know we are closing the gap.


I present a copy of the Closing the gap: Prime Minister's report 2012.

"Abbott, Tony, MP",LP,2012-02-15,"



Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (09:31):  I rise with pride to follow the Prime Minister on this occasion. I do congratulate her on a fine speech. May I say that it is on occasions such as this that our parliament is at its best because we are discussing a noble objective on which we are all agreed. So I congratulate the Prime Minister. I congratulate the former Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, for his role and his work. The historic apology was a very significant milestone in our national life and it is appropriate that we remember that on a day such as this. It was gracious of the Prime Minister to also acknowledge her predecessor but one, Prime Minister Howard, and his commitment to the cause of constitutional recognition of Indigenous people. Prime Minister Howard had a long personal journey when it came to Indigenous issues. It was a difficult journey in some ways for him. One of the best speeches he ever gave was to the Sydney Institute in October of 2007, where he spoke of his personal journey on Indigenous issues. We are all on a personal journey when it comes to this subject, but I think I can say this: for quite some time now there has been a new spirit of appreciation and engagement of Aboriginal people on the part of the leaders of our country. When we are dealing with Indigenous issues, we do not think of ourselves anymore as solving problems; we think of ourselves as building a nation. That is what we do today when we consider how we can better and further close the gap.


I want to thank all of the people who have helped me on my personal journey to better understanding and appreciation of Aboriginal issues and Aboriginal people. I particularly want to thank my friend Noel Pearson for the miles that he has walked with me, literally as well as metaphorically, towards this great goal. I thank Warren Mundine. I do not agree with all of Warren Mundine's positions; nevertheless, he is a great Australian who has been very gracious. He has been very appreciative of work that we have done as well as work that his own party has done towards this great goal. I also want to thank people like Mick Gooda and Sue Gordon. I want to particularly thank those two for the support they gave me just a couple of weeks ago when we had a difficult situation that involved both me and the Prime Minister.


I remind the House of what I think was perhaps the most lapidary remark of the former Prime Minister in his apology:


… unless the great symbolism of reconciliation is accompanied by an even greater substance, it is little more than a clanging gong.


It should be a resonant statement, evocative as it is not just of the great issue before us but of our great heritage of love and of reaching out to people. We must always remember that, unless the great symbolism of reconciliation is accompanied by an even greater substance, it is little more than a clanging gong.


The Prime Minister has given us some very encouraging statistics today. There is much to be grateful for. There is much to take satisfaction in. There is much to be proud of in what the Prime Minister has told us today. I do not want to quibble because I know that, were I in her position, I would be recounting similar statistics to the House. They are important, yet so often when we look at the statistics and we hear the statistics there is a nagging sense that they can obscure as much as they reveal. So often the statistics are a record of what government is doing, rather than a record of how people are living. It is excellent and I congratulate the Prime Minister and the government that we are moving towards halving the gap in so many of these areas, but a gap which has been halved is not a gap which has been closed. In the end, it is not good enough merely to halve the gap—we have to close the gap.


It was very encouraging to hear the Prime Minister tell us that access to preschool for all four-year-olds living in remote communities would be achieved next year. Remarkable—wonderful, praiseworthy. But it is one thing for people living in these communities to have access to preschool for their four-year-olds; it is another thing to ensure that all the youngsters are attending preschool. This is the big challenge and it is the real test of whether we are building civil society in the remote Indigenous communities of our country.


So often when we see the reports we know the effort that officials are making. We feel a palpable sense of the goodwill behind these reports and yet we do not get a sense that individual lives are improving and that communities are flourishing. We know there are better resourced schools in remote Aboriginal communities but we cannot be sure that Aboriginal children are really better-reading, better-counting; are really more familiar with what they need to know in order to be first-class Australians in the modern world.


We know that much money is being spent, that much effort has been expended, on providing better housing in remote Indigenous communities. But can we be sure that these houses are more cherished by their current occupants than the poorer houses of a generation ago were cherished then? We know that much good work is being done in the area of Indigenous employment. I thank and acknowledge people such as Andrew 'Twiggy' Forrest and Dick Estens for the work they have done in this area. But still there is not nearly enough Indigenous employment in the real economy as opposed to Indigenous employment in Aboriginal organisations and in the governmental sector.


All of us—every Australian, every human being—wants to be able to think that his or her life has been at least as good as the lives of his or her parents and that the lives of his or her children will be better than the life that he or she has led. How many Aboriginal people can honestly say today that their life has been better than that of their parents? How many Aboriginal people can honestly say, as they look at their kids, that they are confident that they will have a better life—a life of more self-respect, a life of more fulfilment—than they themselves have had? These are the challenges before us.


Again I commend the Prime Minister and all members of this House for the diligence and goodwill that they bring to these issues. But I do think there is still a long journey for all of us to make. The statistics are important and it is good that the statistics are more sophisticated than they were; that ever more effort is being put into their accurate collation. But sometimes I think that the official statistics can overcomplicate things. I have said to this House on previous occasions—it is worth repeating, and I will repeat it whenever I get the opportunity—that there are simpler, easier to collect statistics than those which the Australian Statistician labours over which I think would give us a truer picture of the real state of Indigenous society, particularly in remote communities. How many children are attending school every day? It should be 100 per cent, or near enough to it, and yet we know that it is not. There is no reason why the roll could not be called a couple of times during the school day, and we know there is no reason why, in each Indigenous school right around the country, those statistics could not be published on a month by month basis so that we know exactly what is happening in each school. Exactly what is happening in each school is a microcosm of what is happening in each community.


We know, despite all the good intentions, despite all the declarations, that very many Indigenous people do not attend employment programs. We know this because members of parliament go to Indigenous communities and we see the number of youngsters and adults who plainly are not engaged in school or work in the middle of the day. Why could we not publish on a week by week basis the statistics on precisely how many people have been attending work programs in remote Indigenous communities? Again, that would give us a truer snapshot of the real life of these communities than the more elaborate statistics with which the Statistician busies himself.


Finally, we all know that in happy communities the trauma that presents to the clinic is normally the result of something that might have happened in a football match or something that might have happened while mustering stock. We also know that much of the trauma that presents to clinics in remote areas is the result of various forms of domestic violence. This statistic, too, should be collated on a week by week and month by month basis, and it should be published. These are the statistics that would tell us what is really happening in these communities. I would very much commend to the government this proposal of mine that in addition to the statistics that the Prime Minister referred to these simple, easy to gather statistics on school attendance, on work attendance and on trauma presentation be collected community by community and published on a regular basis.


I know what these communities are like—I have not lived in them, I have not stayed in them as much as I would have liked; nevertheless I have spent enough time in the remote areas of our country to know about them. I know that if there is an all-night party, as there often is, the adults do not get up to go to work and if the adults do not get up to go to work the children do not get up to go to school. If the adults do not work and the children do not learn, we will never close the gap. That is why there is much more that can be done.


We know that by dint of vast efforts by government and superhuman efforts by individuals, better services are being delivered to the Aboriginal communities of our country, but we cannot be sure, as yet, that a better life is being enjoyed by Aboriginal Australians. Real change does not happen in this parliament, although sometimes it might start here and sometimes it might be reflected here. Real change begins in the places where people live. I say again to the parliament what I said this time last year: we should try as far as we can, within the limitations of our official lives, to be more engaged with the real lives of Aboriginal people. I have had the privilege of spending some longer periods of time in some of the remote communities of Cape York, in Coen and in Aurukun, and last year Noel Pearson took me to some of his sacred country and I then spent a couple of days helping with a building project not far from Hopevale.


All of us are different. All of us have different demands on our time but the more this kind of thing can be done, the better it is for policy making and for the quality of government when it comes to Aboriginal people. I say to the parliament that should I become Prime Minister, it is my firm intention, my commitment, to spend at least one week every year in a remote Indigenous community and to do this with officials because it is not enough for the politicians to become more familiar with the real life of these places. The officials, upon whom so much depends, also need to become more familiar with the real life of these places. If it is good enough for the Aboriginal people of Australia to live in these remote communities, it ought to be good enough for the Prime Minister and other members of the government to stay there.


We can never forget the importance of good governance in remote Australia. Some people, such as my friend and distinguished former colleague Fred Chaney, go so far as to say that remote Australia is a local version of a failed state because of the problems of governance in these places. Not only do we have the usual not-always-well-coordinated efforts of state and federal government, but we have extra issues with governance and with land councils, and then we have all of the non-government organisations. They are doing good work, but so often they are falling over themselves when attempting to deal with problems. The result is that in remote areas we often have the most governed but least efficient communities in the country. This is a very serious issue and it does need to be tackled.


At the risk of straying into partisanship, I need to raise today the issue of the wild rivers legislation, which has now been before this House, one way or another, for the best part of three years. The wild rivers bill is a modest bill and I have now put it several times before this parliament. All the wild rivers bill seeks to do is ensure that Queensland wild rivers declarations can only apply with the consent of the traditional Aboriginal owners. I am not against wild rivers declarations. I accept that where the traditional owners want them, they should apply. But if Indigenous people are really to be in control of their own land, if they are to enjoy genuine land rights, then surely this is not too much to ask. Yet this modest bill of mine, which has but a couple of operative clauses and which runs to less than nine pages, has now been subject to no fewer than five inquiries by committees of this House or the other place. This modest bill is so inquired into that you cannot help but conclude that those who control this parliament are not trying to analyse it, they are trying to bury it. I fear that it will be up to a new government in Queensland to rectify the pusillanimity of this House when it comes to restoring Indigenous rights in this important way.


Finally, let me turn to the proposal for constitutional recognition of Indigenous people, which is a bipartisan objective. The coalition has a good history here. Whatever faults we may have in this area, whatever mistakes we may have made in the past, the coalition has a proud history when it comes to efforts to recognise Indigenous people in the Constitution, starting with the proposed preamble that was put to the people back in 1999 and continuing with the former Prime Minister's efforts, which the Prime Minister mentioned earlier today. I devoutly hope that we can bring this to pass, but it does have to be a unifying moment for our country. What we have to try to do is recreate the fervour and the sense of unity that were captured in the 1967 constitutional change.


To succeed, any constitutional change in this area has to be completing our Constitution rather than changing it. People have to sense that it is unfinished business that is being addressed rather than a new constitution that is being created. I applaud the work of the expert committee, with which I have had much discussion, but I do think their recommendations are the first word rather than the last word in what should ultimately be put to the people. Whatever differences the Prime Minister and I might have, whatever differences other members of her front bench and I might have, I will work as constructively as I humanly can, and I know members of the coalition will work as constructively as we humanly can, to try to get a proposal that can bring us together. We will not be taking a lowest-common-denominator approach to this. We will not be asking what is the least that people will accept. We will be trying to adopt a highest-common-factor approach to this. What is the best that can be achieved at this time? What can we achieved that future generations can look back on with pride and say of us: 'This generation has genuinely advanced our country?'


In conclusion, what we need are more meaningful statistics about the real life of the Aboriginal people in this country, more meaningful engagement between Aboriginal people and all levels of government and meaningful action in this parliament to match the marvellous and uplifting words which are so often spoken in this place. That is what will lead to real reconciliation. That is what we need in order to make our country whole. If we do all that, maybe the time will come when we no longer need Closing the Gap statements, because the gap will indeed have been closed and this country will be everything of which it is capable.

Mr COMBET
 (Charlton—Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency and Minister for Industry and Innovation) (09:57):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


The Higher Education Support Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2012 clarifies the application and operation of indexation arrangements in the Higher Education Support Act 2003. It updates the definitions for ‘course of study in dentistry’ and ‘course of study in veterinary science’, and updates the Melbourne College of Divinity’s name in light of its approval to operate under the title MCD University of Divinity.


The bill also allows for technical amendments to the calculation of the voluntary repayment bonus to resolve resounding issues.


There is ambiguity in the act about the application of the indexation provisions to amounts in the act on 1 January 2011. The government is making it clear that indexation should have been applied to amounts in the act on 1 January 2011, and that the amounts that are indexed on 1 January 2012 are the 2011 indexed amounts.


The terms ‘course of study in dentistry’ and ‘course of study in veterinary science’ are used to determine which students are eligible for the higher FEE-HELP limit of $112,132 in 2012.


The bill would amend the definitions for ‘course of study in dentistry’ and ‘course of study in veterinary science’ to clarify that only students undertaking courses of study in dentistry or veterinary science that satisfy the minimum academic requirements for registration as a dentist, veterinary surgeon or veterinary practitioner are eligible for the higher FEE-HELP limit.


The Melbourne College of Divinity has been approved by the Victorian Registration and Qualifications Authority to operate under the name MCD University of Divinity until 31 December 2016.


Students can make a voluntary repayment towards their HELP debt to the tax office at any time. Voluntary repayments of $500 or more currently attract a five per cent bonus on the payment amount.


When calculating the effect of a person making a voluntary repayment of his or her HELP debt, the act provides for a person to obtain a five per cent bonus and includes rounding rules in calculating whether a person has repaid their debt and the amount of debt repaid if it is only a partial repayment.


Currently, the effect of the rounding rules is that:


(a) when making a full repayment, the person benefits from the rounding because the amount of payment required to pay off their debt in full is reduced because the cents are rounded down; and


(b) when making a partial repayment, the person is disadvantaged because the value of the reduction to the outstanding debt due to a payment is rounded down.


The bill amends the act to provide that, when calculating the effect of a person making a partial repayment towards his or her HELP debt, the amount would be rounded up to nearest dollar. The cents would continue to be rounded down to determine the amount required for the full repayment of a person’s HELP debt amount. Effectively, the rounding rules will now always benefit a person making a voluntary repayment.


The bill reflects the government’s continued commitment to improving Australia’s higher education sector and expanding opportunities for Australians to obtain a high-quality higher education.


I commend the bill to the House.

Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth) (10:36):  The Labor government first proposed this change—this reform, as they describe it—in the budget of 2009. It was put up on the basis that the savings achieved were needed in order to address the diminution in Commonwealth revenues arising out of the global financial crisis. However, the savings then stated—$1.9 billion over four years, and the savings are still of a comparable amount at this stage—were at a level that could have been readily achieved from savings in other areas. So, the argument for the reform was always a specious one. As we said at the time, the truth is that these changes are just the latest phase in Labor's unrelenting war against private health insurance. Labor hates private health insurance. It hates it because it encourages self-reliance and because it offers choice, and Australians know that. Australians do not trust the Labor Party on the matter of private health insurance. If anyone doubts that, that is why the Labor Party—the then Leader of the Opposition and subsequently Prime Minister, Mr Rudd; the current Prime Minister, the member for Lalor, Julia Gillard; and the shadow health minister at the time, Nicola Roxon—in the lead up to the 2007 election said again and again that they would not change the private health insurance rebate. At the time, in 2009, when they broke that promise I said that never was an election promise given more emphatically and then broken so brazenly.



Ms Plibersek interjecting—




Mr TURNBULL:
  There have been quite a few broken since then. The Minister for Health has become habituated to breaking election promises and, indeed, it is an enduring feature of this government that it is incapable of keeping an election promise. The truth is that these changes will force people to drop private health insurance cover or choose cheaper cover with more procedures excluded. That follows as night follows day. You put up the price of something—make a good or service more expensive—and people will buy less of it. And the people who will buy less of it are those who feel, because of their youth or their health, that they have less need of it—that is to say, their need of private health insurance is more marginal. The consequence of that is that the pool of revenues in the private insurance sector will be diminished, and that will inevitably put up the cost of private health insurance for all those who are insured, whether they are on high incomes or on low incomes. All Australians with private health insurance will face higher premiums into the future if these changes proceed. It is a matter of great disappointment to me and everyone on this side of the House that a number of the Independents, including the member for Lyne, have decided to support the government in this regard.


As I said in 2009, every Australian knows that the cost of public health is growing, as are the waiting lists for public hospitals. Every Australian knows that as our population ages the need for more self-reliance in the provision of health services becomes greater. A government that was prudent and responsible in its management of this important area of public policy would do everything in its power to encourage Australians to be more self-reliant—take out private health insurance and do more to take care of their own health—where they can afford to do so. We know that every dollar of funding provided for the private health insurance rebate saves $2 of costs that are then paid by private health insurers. The report from 2004 that has been much cited here by Econtech and Harper Associates and Hagan is the reference for that.


We know that private hospitals treat 40 per cent of all patients in Australia—in 2009-10 that was 3½ million patients. They perform the majority of elective surgery in Australia—nearly two-thirds. Twelve million Australians—that is, nearly 53 per cent—have private health insurance cover, and 10.3 million Australians have hospital treatment cover. There will be 2.4 million Australians directly affected by these changes and face immediate increases in premiums of 14, 29 and 43 per cent in their respective income tiers.


All of those insured—all of those taking out private health insurance—will be affected by this because the pool of revenue into private health insurance will be reduced. It is absurd to argue that you can increase the cost of private health insurance and not then reduce the amount of private health insurance that is taken out. Plainly, that is the inevitable consequence—just as if you put up the price of cigarettes by increasing excise, fewer people will buy cigarettes. The impact is on all of those insured because it is a pool. The inescapable fact is that those people who choose to drop their private health insurance or reduce the level of their cover—reduce their contributions—will be those people who make a probably perfectly rational decision that they are unlikely to need private health insurance, and they make a judgment at the margin and reduce their contributions.


Deloitte's analysis has concluded that in the first year 175,000 Australians would be expected to withdraw from private hospital cover and a further 583,000 will downgrade. Over five years they expect that 1.6 million will drop their cover entirely and 4.3 million will downgrade. The government's own private health insurance insurer, Medibank Private, has predicted that 37,000 of their members alone will drop their cover and 92,500 will downgrade. There is no question what the impact of this will be. It will be bad for private health insurance and it will also be bad for the public hospital system because the more pressure that is put on private health insurance, the more expensive it becomes and the less resources that are available for private hospitals and private health insurance, and the more pressure there will be on the public hospital system. Every Australian is a loser out of this; there are no winners.


The government argues, 'Why should there be a tax benefit—a tax concession—for people on high incomes, and why should someone on a lower income be paying tax and therefore assisting, benefiting or supporting someone on a higher income who takes out private health insurance?'


That argument is so specious, because the truth is that most Australians pay tax and most Australians benefit without a means test from the services provided by government, whether it is the ABC, whether it is defence, whether it is education—it is a very long list. The argument therefore is not that this must be means tested because otherwise it would be unjust. On that basis, you would means test every single benefit. The truth is that we have a progressive income tax system and people on higher incomes, quite properly, pay a much higher proportion of tax and therefore the social equity, the income redistribution that is achieved in a society like Australia, is largely effected through that progressive tax system.


The means-testing argument is not one that is universally valid. Of course, there are benefits that are means tested and should be means tested. No-one is suggesting they should not be, but the argument about whether this benefit should be means tested has to be assessed on its consequences. This may be an ideological issue for the Labor Party, but it is not an ideological question of whether all benefits should be means tested. The question is: should this tax concession be means tested? The unarguable evidence, the uncontradicted evidence, is that there will be a reduction in the number of people taking out private health insurance cover and a reduction in the cover they will take out.


The only point of difference is the extent of that reduction. It follows inevitably that any reduction in that contribution to the insurance pool affects every other person that draws on that pool. The truth is that in any insurance pool the people who need the insurance the most benefit from the contributions from those people who for whatever reason—it might be good health or it might be good luck—do not need that insurance cover. If everyone could look into the future and know what their medical circumstances were going to be, and so the only people who took out private health insurance were those who knew they were going to be sick or needed a procedure in a hospital, then the insurance premiums would be impossibly high. The whole system would be unworkable.


That is why the Howard government wisely introduced this rebate and a number of other measures to expand the incentives—a combination of sticks and carrots—to encourage people to take out private health insurance and, above all, to promote a culture of self-reliance. It is absolutely fundamental that in our society we encourage everybody, where they can afford to do so, to be more self-reliant. We cannot afford to allow a situation where the welfare state becomes so all-encompassing and so expensive that citizens lose their own sense of responsibility and self-reliance. You have only to look at some of the fiscal catastrophes in Europe to see what the consequences of that are.


Self-reliance and private health insurance are clear social goods. They are promoted by this policy; they have been proved to work. The consequence of this change will reduce the availability of private health services for all Australians. It will increase the cost of private health insurance for all Australians, regardless of their income, and it will put additional pressure on the public hospital system. That is why the coalition today, as we have done for nearly three years, steadfastly and staunchly oppose it.

Ms PLIBERSEK
 (Sydney—Minister for Health) (10:49):  It is my great pleasure to sum up the debate on the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill and cognate bills. The member for Wentworth is a neighbour of mine and he is someone I like a lot, but I have seldom heard more nonsense from him than I heard today. He was at the despatch box talking about the marvels of self-reliance, yet he cannot explain to me why a waitress living in Darlinghurst should be subsidising the private health insurance of a banker living in Vaucluse or why an apprentice living in Bondi Junction, in his electorate, should be subsidising the private health insurance of a partner in a law firm living at Darling Point. It makes absolutely no sense.


I thank members for their contribution to this debate. We are rightly proud of the health system in Australia. We have a health system that is the envy of the world. Most Australians would say that Medicare, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and other universal features of our health system serve us much better than the user-pays systems of many other nations where they take your credit card details before they take your pulse. That is not to say it is perfect. We inherited from those opposite a shortage of doctors, nurses and specialists and, thanks to the coalition, in many parts of the country it is hard to see a GP or you need to wait too long in emergency departments or to have elective surgery. That is why the health reforms begun by my predecessor—the Attorney-General when she was the Minister for Health and Ageing—are so important. They set a path into the future when all Australian governments will work together to meet our communities' health needs.


We have a health system that is universal, but with that comes an obligation for Australians to contribute. We have an obligation to care for our own health and we have an obligation to contribute through our taxes. But, like all of our tax and transfer systems, the greatest benefits should go to those in greatest need; the greatest contribution should come from those who are most able to contribute. A further feature of our health system is the necessary and desirable balance of its public and private elements. Our public system gives high-quality and accessible care—security for every Australian that, should the worst happen, they will receive the care they need. Our private systems offer choice and flexibility and provide competition and comparison, contributing to continued improvements. The debate we are having today and over the past few days touches on all of these elements. Our universal system relies on every dollar raised being spent in the most appropriate and effective way. It is about making choices. We are currently establishing more than 20 regional cancer centres across Australia, because we know that the outcomes for people with cancer living in the regions are often much poorer than those in the cities. These centres will be beacons of hope for patients and families fighting this disease. When faced with scarce resources, and the choice of whether to invest in lifesaving services or rebates to couples earning over $258,000 a year, we make the choice for regional patients. Those investments will benefit all Australians, but of course they need to be paid for—and that means every dollar going where it is needed most.


The government took a policy of means testing the private health insurance rebate to the 2010 election because it is the fastest-growing component of health spending—and that is unsustainable; over 10 years its real cost will increase more than 50 per cent per person. It is also unsustainable that this benefit continues to go disproportionately to high-income earners. This is a question of fairness. These reforms have been carefully crafted so as to provide a fairer distribution of benefits. Well over 20 million Australians will be entirely unaffected by this change. Government's support for private health insurance needs to be directed to those hardworking Australians who need the most assistance, not higher income earners.


Currently, approximately 14 per cent of single taxpayers who have incomes above $83,000 a year receive about 28 per cent of the total private health insurance rebate paid to singles. Under these new reforms these single taxpayers will receive about 12 per cent of the total private health insurance rebate paid to singles. Similarly, approximately 12 per cent of taxpaying couples who have incomes above $166,000 currently receive approximately 21 per cent of the total private health insurance rebate paid to couples. Under these new reforms these taxpaying couples will receive about nine per cent of the total private health insurance rebate paid to couples.


The member for Dickson, and many of those opposite who have spoken during this debate, have tried to assert that this is somehow a broken promise. This is absolutely, categorically not true—in fact, it is the fulfilment of a promise taken to the 2010 election. Speaker after speaker from the other side has ignored the fact that this was Labor Party policy at the 2010 election. The member for Dickson alleges that these changes will affect those workers and couples who earn less than $50,000 a year—again, categorically untrue and an unfounded scare campaign. He told this parliament, of those who workers and couple who earn less than $50,000 a year, that 'this Labor government seeks to impose an extra financial burden on them if they keep their private health insurance'. This is wrong. Workers earning less than $83,000 per year, and couples and families with an income of $166,000 or less, will see no change in their rebate as a result of these measures. They will retain the current 30 per cent rebate—or higher, if they are older than 65. Only people earning over $129,000 or couples earning over $258,000 will lose the rebate entirely.


Why has it been that the speakers opposite have sought to mislead people, including the most vulnerable Australians, by frightening them? They have claimed that older people will be particularly badly affected by these changes, yet means testing will be applied equally to anyone who can afford to contribute more to their private health insurance regardless of age. Rebates will continue to be higher for older Australians in income ranges that are eligible for  a rebate. The vast majority of older Australians will continue to be eligible for a higher rebate.


Further claims that these changes will lead to a huge impact on public hospitals are simply wrong. For example, some in the opposition—in fact, many speakers—have claimed that we will see up to 1.6 million people drop their private health insurance and become a burden on the public hospital system. But at the same time they also claim that it will be young, healthy people who will drop their insurance—you heard the same from the member for Wentworth—and that those young, healthy people will immediately turn up in our public hospitals. Clearly, this does not make sense. Treasury modelling shows that 99.7 per cent of policy-holders will retain their private health insurance—and that is because those higher income earners who receive a lower rebate will at the same time face an increased tax penalty if they do not have private health insurance. The estimated drop-out rate based on the biennial Ipsos syndicated survey, Healthcare and insurance 2009-2011, are 16,000 and 40,000 people—much closer to the Treasury model. And I note that the estimated drop-out rates are in fact lower than the quarterly growth in membership for private health insurance in both September 2011 and December 2011. The government estimates that 8.7 million Australians with private hospital cover will not be affected by these changes.


We have seen these kinds of claims from the opposition in the past. When the government increased the income threshold for the Medicare levy surcharge in 2008, the member for North Sydney declared that hundreds of thousands of people would abandon their private health insurance. What have we actually seen since that time? Over 800,000 have joined private health insurance.


The opposition's position on these bills seems to be disingenuous at best. If the Leader of the Opposition truly believes, as he said at the Press Club recently, that government should only do for people what they cannot do for themselves, how can he sincerely argue that the best and wisest use of the health dollar is to pay for one-third of the health insurance costs for someone on $500,000 or $1 million a year?


The Leader of the Opposition also refuses to say, as does the shadow health minister, whether he would repeal the means test. I read today that the member for Hinkler has called for it to be reinstated. It has been described as an 'article of faith' for the Liberal Party—and article of faith in a belief that the earnings of working Australians should pay for the private health insurance of even the wealthiest Australians. The Leader of the Opposition is now in a very difficult position, torn between this belief and his huge budget black hole—$70 billion and counting—and, should he follow his instincts and seek to repeal this change, that would be another $2½ billion problem over the next three years for his budget black hole. With the cost rising of this subsidy to higher income earners rising to $100 billion by 2050, he would give us a lasting legacy, a legacy of debt for our children and for their children. A universal system relies on the differing contributions of all Australians according to their ability to pay, but it gives the security that each of us, if we get sick or our elderly parents or kids get sick, will get the appropriate care. These changes are true Labor reforms because they are about fairness. This is the third time that we have brought them before this House because we believe that working Australians should have a health system that is fair. The passage of these bills will mean that the taxes of a bank teller will no longer subsidise the private health insurance of the bank executive or the bank CEO. Labor governments have always fought for the rights of working people to have access to high-quality health care, and we will continue that fight because it is right and because it is what Labor governments do. I commend the bills to the House.

Mrs MARKUS
 (Macquarie) (13:45):  Blue Mountains Legacy is a vitally important organisation providing welfare, pension, advocacy and compassionate assistance to ex-service personnel and their families in the electorate of Macquarie. The Legacy premises at Springwood are used to facilitate meetings and functions and as a hub to provide advice to its members concerning welfare and pension matters. A number of other veterans and ex-service organisations use the premises. Additionally, the DVA uses the premises for information sessions and has previously invested funds for the upgrade of key amenities—specifically, $30,000 for an upgrade of the kitchen.


However, Blue Mountains Legacy is facing the significant challenges of being unable to cover an urgent bill of $40,000 for rental expenses and being unable to ensure that it can secure the lease for its Springwood premises until 2020. Blue Mountains Legacy has applied for rental allocation funding under the BEST grants scheme. While it is technically eligible for the funding, the grandfathering approach the minister and department have taken in only continuing rental allocation funding for current recipients of the program—not for new ones—poses a challenge.


I am extremely dissatisfied with the minister's response to this dire and urgent matter. Without Blue Mountains Legacy obtaining the necessary funding for their rental commitment and to provide security of tenure, vital services for veterans and their families—there are more than 2,500 veterans in the Blue Mountains—will be lost. I implore the minister to reconsider Blue Mountains Legacy's request for rental allocation funding so that the vital services the organisation provides— (Time expired)

Back in 2008, Alcoa delayed this investment due to the impact of the global financial crisis. Alcoa has said that, since a peak in 2011, aluminium prices have fallen by over 27 per cent worldwide. This morning an Alcoa spokesperson said that the Wagerup expansion would not be back on the agenda until the company secured a long-term competitive gas supply. The statement on the Alcoa website—the words of Alcoa, not the Leader of the Opposition's misrepresentation—says:


Alcoa’s Wagerup Refinery (Wagerup Unit 3) expansion plans are currently on hold because of the challenging economic environment and the need to secure energy supplies.


So the misrepresentation engaged in by the Leader of the Opposition is once again calculated to spread false information to the Australian people. Not only is he content to come into this place and use workers as a football to kick around the chamber in pursuit of the opposition's political interests but now today he is making a misrepresentation to the whole nation about this investment.


On the rest of the Leader of the Opposition's assertions, the question of the modelling I have answered before and no amount of re-asking it will change the Leader of the Opposition's misrepresentations as to the truth. Then there is Alcoa and Point Henry. I have dealt with this before in parliament. Once again, repeating a misrepresentation does not make it true. Alcoa has said very clearly that their current review:


… has not been prompted by a future price on carbon. The present situation is the result of low metal prices, a high Australian dollar, and import costs.


During the course of this week and every day the Leader of the Opposition has come into this place and misrepresented the situation of Alcoa. I say to the Leader of the Opposition that that is a shame. It is a shame he is treating workers with that calculated disrespect and today he is spreading that calculated disrespect to the rest of Australia.

 (Lyne) (14:17):  My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport. Will you release a full schedule of works for the completion of the Pacific Highway now that your party has promised at two elections to complete the highway by 2016 and it will now appear in the four-year forward estimates in this year's May budget?

Mr OAKESHOTT
 (Lyne) (14:21):  In light of your answer, Minister, and in light of articles in today's paper that an extra $7 billion is needed to fix the highway, and your reluctance in your answer to release a full works schedule, can you guarantee to the House, again, that 2016 remains the completion date, as agreed between the Commonwealth and the state.



The SPEAKER:  I call the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2012-02-15,"



Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (14:18):  I thank the member for Lyne for his question and for his commitment to his constituents, and other constituents, who use the Pacific Highway. We already have committed some $4.1 billion to the Pacific Highway. More than 1,600 workers are today working on site building the Pacific Highway. This is vital for productivity. It has been identified by Infrastructure Australia as a priority, but it is also vital for safety. Over the last 20 years some 809 people have lost their lives on the Pacific Highway, which is 809 too many. That is why we on this side of the House are absolutely committed to fulfilling the duplication by 2016, which was first promised by the Howard government in 2004. They promised it but did not put any dollars into it. They contributed $1.3 billion over 12 years and during that time the state government committed $2.5 billion.


At that time—when they were in government—they said the Pacific Highway was a state road. They called upon the New South Wales Labor government to do more. The member for Cowper, for example, said in this place: 'It is a state road. New South Wales refused to commit one extra dollar of state government funding to a road they are responsible for.' The state member for Coffs Harbour, Andrew Fraser, who has had a bit to say—inaccurately—in recent months about funding on the Pacific Highway, said this when he was part of the opposition:


The Pacific Highway is a state road. I pay credit to the federal government for increasing the funding arrangement. I damn and condemn this state government. The state government should pour the money in.



Opposition members interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The member for Riverina will be more restrained.




Mr ALBANESE:
  But now, when in government, only yesterday Mr Fraser was saying in the New South Wales parliament that they cannot afford to pay their share. We on this side of the House say: let's end the politics with this issue. Let's have 50-50 funding to deliver on the Pacific Highway. Let's see the member for Cowper and the Leader of the National Party talk to their National Party colleagues in New South Wales and get them to deliver on what they say is their joint commitment to fully duplicate the highway by 2016. That is what is required. We need to do more. We accept that that is the case. But it can only be done in partnership with the New South Wales government. That is the way forward and it is the way to ensure that the full duplication can be completed.



The SPEAKER:  The honourable member for Lyne wishes to ask a supplementary question, which I think is the maiden supplementary question from the cross bench. I will listen to the supplementary and consider it.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2012-02-15,"



Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (14:21):  I thank the member for Lyne for his question, which goes to the heart of what is required. I wrote to the New South Wales roads minister last month and outlined a full schedule of works that makes it possible for the Pacific Highway to be fully duplicated by 2016. It included a plan for preconstruction and a plan for construction by 2016 of all of the remaining sections which are not duplicated. It is achievable. The New South Wales government say they are committed to it, we say we are committed to it and the opposition say they are committed to it in spite of their interjections. What we need to do is go about this in a bipartisan way, in a way that involves both tiers of government, in a way that does not say funding should be taken off one section of the road and put onto another, and in a way that ensures that the road is fully duplicated. I have written to the New South Wales government. They have the schedule. We are prepared to release the schedule, if you like, but I am waiting for the New South Wales government to get back to us to fulfil their obligations that they committed to prior to their election to Macquarie Street government. Certainly, this government is prepared to work very closely with all members up and down the highway. We have had constructive relationships with the New South Wales Deputy Premier, with the New South Wales roads minister and with you— (Time expired)

"Bishop, Julie, MP",LP,2012-02-15,"



Ms JULIE BISHOP
 (Curtin—Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (15:12):  I move:


That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the member for Curtin from moving the following motion forthwith:


That the Prime Minister explain to the House and to the Australian people why she should continue to hold the office of Prime Minister, an office she has debased in the manner in which she came to it, in her handling of the Craig Thomson affair, in the contradictions that riddle her explanation of the role her staff played in the Australia Day riot and in her deception of the Australian people before the 2010 election over the introduction of the carbon tax, gambling reform, means testing the private health insurance rebate and operating an open and transparent government.


The office of Prime Minister comes with great responsibility, and the person who holds that office must have integrity, honesty, competence and good judgment. Standing orders must be suspended because this Prime Minister has so debased the highest office in the land, and her government is in such turmoil as a result, this motion must be debated. The Prime Minister lacks the fundamental qualities that a Prime Minister, the pinnacle of government, demands, and without integrity, without honesty, without competence and without good judgment in the Prime Minister this government cannot function. Standing orders must be suspended to debate this motion.


Cabinet ministers are spending their evenings with Labor backbenchers counting numbers, tallying up the columns of names and not running the country. One of the great burdens that falls upon the shoulders of any Prime Minister is to be the custodian of our parliamentary system and to ensure that the bonds of trust between the parliament and the voting public are not broken. I can assure the member for Griffith that he has the vote of the Chief Government Whip. The Prime Minister has monumentally failed in that task, and that is why standing orders must be suspended.


The Prime Minister betrayed the trust of the former Prime Minister when she was his deputy. The Prime Minister betrayed the trust of the member for Denison. But, most grievously, the Prime Minister has betrayed the trust of the Australian people. The conduct of this Prime Minister makes it clear that she has little regard for the truth and thus that she holds the Australian public in contempt. That is why standing orders must be suspended.


There have been new revelations overnight about this Prime Minister's conduct which require standing orders to be suspended so we can debate my substantive motion. The Prime Minister cannot on the one hand express noble sentiments, such as those in her fine Closing the Gap address this morning, while presiding over a culture within her office so squalid that they saw fit to incite the Aboriginal tent embassy protesters on Australia Day, to attempt to use Aboriginal people in a tawdry, deceitful fashion.




Mr Albanese:
  On a point of order, Mr Speaker: you made a ruling the other day that people actually had to speak to the suspension. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is speaking to the substance of the motion—a motion she has no chance of getting the numbers for.



The SPEAKER:  I have been listening very carefully to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. While at times she almost seems to be leaving the substance of the motion, she does come back to why standing and sessional orders should be suspended. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will continue to address the motion before the chair.




Ms JULIE BISHOP:
  Standing orders must be suspended because of the revelations overnight about the squalid culture in the Prime Minister's office, about how they sought to use Aboriginal people for tawdry, deceitful purposes. That sort of culture has no place in any public office, let alone the office of the Prime Minister. That is why standing orders must be suspended.


To compound the error, this wretched series of events surrounding Australia Day, the Prime Minister gave a press conference—and that is the subject of the motion we propose to debate—to explain how and why this Aboriginal tent embassy protest came about. That public explanation by the Prime Minister now appears to be false. The Prime Minister was given the opportunity in question time today to correct the public record. The Prime Minister has relied in this House on the transcript of Ms Kim Sattler, but there is a contradiction between the transcript the Prime Minister relied upon and the actual words spoken by Ms Sattler. And the Prime Minister has refused to correct the record. That is why standing orders must be suspended—because this Prime Minister must explain to the House and to the Australian people why she has conducted herself in this way, so debasing the high office of Prime Minister.


Take, for example, the fantasy the Prime Minister has invented about her conduct during the overthrow of the former Prime Minister. Standing orders should be suspended to debate the new revelations about that matter. This Prime Minister would have us believe that she was the reluctant candidate, drafted against her will into the challenge that she did not want to mount. This is important and it is why standing orders must be suspended—because the Australian people were deeply unsettled by the unprecedented removal of the former Prime Minister and they have been given no plausible explanation except naked, ruthless ambition. The problem for this Prime Minister is that her own colleagues and ministers are contradicting her version of events—a version of events invented by the Prime Minister and given to the public but which is the opposite of what actually happened. That is why cabinet ministers have been doing the numbers overnight.


Standing orders must be suspended as there are fresh revelations reflecting on the Prime Minister which must be debated. Her office was drafting an acceptance speech for when she became Prime Minister at least two weeks prior to the challenge, yet the Prime Minister wants the public to believe that she knew nothing about the plot or the challenge that she was about to make. The US Secretary of State knew about the challenge two weeks before it occurred. The Australian ambassador in Washington was called in to give assurances to the United States that there would be no destabilisation of the relationship when there was a change of leader.




Mr Slipper:
  The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will return to the substance of the motion.




Ms JULIE BISHOP:
  This is a very serious allegation and that is why standing orders must be suspended—so that this issue of national security can be debated and so the Prime Minister can explain to the House how it is that she did not know her office was in fact drafting her acceptance speech. I wonder if they are now in there drafting her concession speech.


The Prime Minister also said that she did not know that there was polling showing that she was the preferred Prime Minister over the then Prime Minister. Yet we now find from revelations overnight that the very person who was seeking to replace the former Prime Minister was personally campaigning and lobbying other members of her frontbench and backbench with that very same polling which was so damaging to the then Prime Minister and supportive of her campaign for the job. But the Australian people have been told that she did not have any recollection of these momentous events—



The SPEAKER:  The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will return to the substance of the motion.




Ms JULIE BISHOP:
  and that is why standing orders must be suspended—because the truth is slowly and painfully being revealed by the Prime Minister's own colleagues. It is becoming obvious to all that the Prime Minister was up to her eyeballs in the coup to remove the former Prime Minister, and the Prime Minister should simply come into this House and tell the truth. What was her role in the removal of the Prime Minister? Did she know about the polling? She was handing it around. Did she know about the speech? The ambassador in Washington knew and the US Secretary of State knew.


We know that the member for Denison holds in his hands a signed contract with the Prime Minister, the contract which supported the formation of this minority government and allowed this Prime Minister to remain in office. That contract turned to dust with no apology for the monumental deception played upon the member for Denison—and that is why standing orders must be suspended. The Prime Minister led the member for Denison on for months. And then there was the most blatant betrayal of the Australian people—the promise that there would be no carbon tax under a government she led.



These events are themselves serious enough to warrant a suspension of standing orders, a condemnation and censure, but of equal or greater concern is that the Prime Minister believes it is proper conduct to seek to mislead the Australian people with her improbable, implausible, disingenuous, unbelievable explanations and excuses. The devious conduct and personal behaviour of this Prime Minister calls into question her fitness to hold office. (Time expired)



The SPEAKER:  Is the motion seconded?

",HoR,<title>MOTIONS</title>,<title>Prime Minister</title>,MOTIONS,9,1,speech
"Andrews, Kevin, MP",LP,2012-02-15,"



Mr ANDREWS
 (Menzies) (15:22):  I second the motion. Standing orders should be suspended here and now because there is a death stench hanging over the Prime Minister of this nation. The standing orders should be suspended here and now because we have a Prime Minister who is evading question after question when she ought to have the courage to come into this place and face up and answer questions which are in the public interest and about the good government of this nation. That is why standing orders ought to be suspended.


We have seen a progressive pattern of denial from this Prime Minister. For example, take the denial on Four Corners on Monday night, when she was asked whether she knew that a speech was being written by people in her office. A clear enough question: did she know that a speech was being written by people in her office. What was the answer? The answer from the Prime Minister on Four Corners on Monday night was:


… I did not ask for a speech to be prepared …


This is perfection of the non-denial denial. That is what we have from this Prime Minister. She got a direct question, 'Did she know something?' and she said:


… I did not ask for a speech to be prepared …


When she was pressed by the interviewer, Andrew Fowler, she said, 'That's the best answer I can give.'


Anybody in Australia who has been following this debate knows that the reality is that we have the most evasive Prime Minister who has ever occupied that chair in this parliament. It is a disgrace to the office of Prime Minister that we have such a cowardly person in it and that is why standing orders need to be suspended. This is such a cowardly person that she will not come into this chamber and face up to the questions that are being legitimately asked about the administration of her office and therefore the good government of this country.


When it comes to these issues about what actually occurred, there are only two possible explanations—and remember, this was the most important issue that was running that day. The first explanation is that before all this occurred it was totally hidden from the Prime Minister. It was the most important issue of the day. She was going to the Lobby restaurant, something that would occupy not only her advisers but her chief of staff and her communications director—her media advisers—and somehow all of those people in her office hid this from the Prime Minister. We know from what has been slowly forced out over the days since then is that these people knew about what was happening.


Standing orders should be suspended because either all the senior people in the Prime Minister's office were out on a frolic of their own, totally unknown by the Prime Minister, or the Prime Minister actually knew what was going on. These are legitimate questions and that is why standing orders should be suspended. These are legitimate questions that should be answered in this parliament. They should be answered in front of the people of Australia who watch and listen to these proceedings in question time each day. Yet what do we have? Day after day, we see total evasion by the Prime Minister.



Mr Albanese interjecting—




Mr ANDREWS:
  The Leader of the House complains about another move to suspend standing orders. We would not have to do this if we had a government who had the courage to come in here and answer the questions. So do not give us this nonsense, leader of the opposition—Leader of the House, I mean. He maybe leader of the opposition one day, but we do not know about that. But what we do know is that this total evasion, which is going on day after day, is demeaning the office of Prime Minister.


In this country we now have a Prime Minister whose credibility has been totally shredded not only over this issue but over the abandonment of the promise that she made to the member for Denison and a whole series of other issues. That is why standing orders should be suspended on this occasion: so that this Prime Minister can answer the questions that are being asked. If the government think that by running away from this, by evading it, the questions are not going to continue to be asked then they are sadly mistaken. These are legitimate questions that demand legitimate answers, rather than the cowardly behaviour and performance that we continue to have from this Prime Minister.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2012-02-15,"



Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (15:27):  There is some irony in the Deputy Leader of the Opposition contributing to this debate given the content of her speech. She gave a speech about loyalty. She knows; she has been loyal to all three leaders she has been deputy to—Brendan Nelson, Malcolm Turnbull and Tony Abbott, and I am sure there will be more to come. We also heard about loyalty from the Leader of the Opposition. Ask Peter Reith about loyalty from the Leader of the Opposition, who put in him in a ballot, asked him to run and then ratted on him in the ballot—on TV. And he has the hide to come in here and run lectures about loyalty.


This suspension of standing orders is the 39th attempted suspension of standing orders from those opposite. That in itself tells you why we should not suspend standing orders. The suspension of standing orders or a censure resolution is a mechanism available under parliamentary procedures for serious issues on serious occasions, not to be used every single day, as those opposite do, because, quite frankly, they cannot get their act together to get a decent question time pack out of their tactics committee. We know that that is the case because their tactics committee is bigger than their frontbench, and we know that they have 32 on their frontbench because two of them are currently scrambling around hoping they will make the top 30, given the legislation put forward to provide salaries for 30 shadow ministers not the 32 under the Howard government legislation. What we have seen here today is a bid by the member for Menzies to make the top 30. What we have seen from the member for Mackellar is the raising of points of order to see if she can make the top 30. We know that those opposite have got an ambitious backbench. We know that the member for Higgins and the member for Mayo and all of the others are scrambling to get into that top 30—they are hanging on. It is extraordinary that we have had from those opposite a suggestion to suspend standing orders on matters that are erroneous.


What we see from those opposite, day after day in debates on legislation, is an attempt to scare workers and their families. We know what the CEO of Alcoa has said about Point Henry and about the future of that plant. But there is no factory and there is no work site—particularly in Queanbeyan, for the member for Eden-Monaro—that the Leader of the Opposition is not prepared to go to and run a scare campaign.


This parliament should be about serious issues. We had it this morning with the private health insurance legislation, this afternoon we will be debating the ABCC legislation and we have question time available to people. The most serious thing that has happened today was about righting a historic wrong: the Closing the Gap statement by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. Both of them are sincerely committed to making a difference when it comes to Indigenous Australians, as is the parliament as a whole. But what we saw today after the Closing the Gap statement, when the member for Franklin was on her feet answering a question about Indigenous employment, was an ongoing chant from a senior member of the opposition of 'Boring!'



The SPEAKER:  The Leader of the House will resume his seat. The honourable member for Menzies, presumably on a point of order—




Mr Andrews:
  Mr Speaker, I rise to draw your attention to the motion.



The SPEAKER: The Leader of the House will direct himself to the motion before the chair.




Mr ALBANESE:
  I am directing my remarks to the sorts of issues that we should be discussing in this parliament rather than moving these daily suspensions of standing orders. Question time is continually interrupted by those opposite to move suspensions of standing orders. We heard a question about the Maldives yesterday from the shadow minister for foreign affairs, who has moved this motion, attempting to make a joke of what is a very serious international issue. This is from the party that a few weeks ago were making jokes about the Costa Concordia disaster—they thought that was an appropriate comment to make on radio in Adelaide. That is the sort of moral standard that we get from those opposite.



The SPEAKER:  The Leader of the House will resume his seat. I call on the honourable member for Cowper on a point of order.




Mr Hartsuyker:
  Mr Speaker, this is a motion for the suspension of standing orders and I would ask you to draw the speaker back to the topic.



The SPEAKER:  The Leader of the House is referring to the motion. I think what he is talking about are the issues that the parliament should be talking about and which it could talk about if the motion for suspension of standing orders is not carried. The leader has the call.




Mr ALBANESE:
  There is a little green book called the House of Representatives Standing and Sessional Orders and there is a big book called the House of Representatives Practice. I suggest that just once some of their senior people have a look at them because I am perfectly relevant in talking about what this parliament should be discussing. Those opposite want to have a discussion about honesty and issues relating to the concerns they have which are all just about politics. You never hear from those opposite a concern about the economy, a genuine concern about jobs and employment, a genuine concern about fairness and equity, a genuine concern about the policy debates before the parliament. We saw it today with the passing of the private health insurance legislation. Those opposite now have to declare whether they will repeal that legislation and therefore add to their $70 billion black hole. My attention is drawn to an op-ed piece by the now Leader of the Opposition, who had this to say in the Australian on 24 July 2009:


Opposition, by contrast, tends to be a permanent debating society because even the most final decisions can sometimes be revisited in office.


There you have their principle in writing—you know you cannot trust him unless it is in writing—'Don't worry about anything that is said.'



The SPEAKER:  The Leader of the House will return to the substance of the motion.




Mr ALBANESE:
  I certainly will, Mr Speaker, because these are the sorts of issues that we could be discussing in alternate circumstances. So far today, those opposite have made three attempts to shut me down in the debate. They had 10 minutes and they had five minutes but they cannot cop 10 minutes in reply. When it comes to a one-on-one debate, anyone on this side versus anyone on that side, they lose. In any debate there is simply no substance from those opposite. We know that they choose to oppose no matter what issue is before us. They come in here and try to assassinate the Prime Minister's character. Their only policy position is to talk down the economy and to talk down Australia, except when they are overseas and then the Leader of the Opposition acknowledges that Australia is the envy of the world. We are not going to cop lectures from someone who is prepared to make jokes about the Italian cruise liner or from someone who was prepared to bag Bernie Banton, the asbestos campaigner, when he was on his death bed.




Mr Hartsuyker:
  Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. This speech is irrelevant to the subject of the motion before the House.



The SPEAKER:  The Leader of the House has the call and will be completely relevant in the 35 seconds he has left.




Mr ALBANESE:
  Then there was the great comment about John Brogden when the Leader of the Opposition said, 'If we did that, we'd be as dead as the former Liberal leader's political prospects.' We are not going to cop lectures from those opposite, who have no morals, no political strategy and no economic policy for the nation. What we see in here—



The SPEAKER:  Order! The Leader of the House will withdraw the statement that members opposite have no morals.




Mr ALBANESE:
  I withdraw, Mr Speaker. (Time expired)



The SPEAKER:  The question before the chair is that the motion for suspension of standing and sessional orders moved by the Hon. the Deputy Leader of the Opposition be agreed to.

The SPEAKER
 (15:47):  Would the member for Petrie resume her seat just for the moment. I ask the minister who is jacketless to leave the chamber—the minister will remain unnamed in Hansard. I ask honourable members to sit down or leave the chamber so that the due courtesies can be extended to the honourable member for Petrie, who has a question to me.

Mrs D'ATH
 (Petrie) (15:48):  Mr Speaker, my question to you relates to the appropriate use of iPads in this chamber. I should say that I have no objection with iPads being available in this chamber—they assist members in fulfilling their various duties as elected members. However, this morning when the Prime Minister was making a statement on the Closing The Gap report I was in the gallery with one of my schools. The school students asked me why a member was playing solitaire on their iPad in the chamber. I believe that type of contact and use of iPads is disorderly in this chamber.

The SPEAKER
 (15:49):  I advise the member for Petrie that while the playing of solitaire might not be a good use of time in the chamber, although some might say it is, it might not necessarily be a good thing for members to have people see them play solitaire. I do commend to the honourable member the contents of page 158 of House of Representatives Practice as it refers to the use of computers. Essentially, text messaging is permitted and notebook computers may be used for emails. I probably do not think that playing solitaire is beyond the standing orders, but I do not think it is necessarily a good use of technology in the House of Representatives of the Australian parliament. People who do play solitaire are obviously judged by those who can see them playing it. I imagine also that the result of the game would be obvious to those watching.

The SPEAKER
 (15:00):  I have received letters from the honourable member for Dunkley and the honourable member for Fraser proposing that definite matters of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion today. As required by standing order 46, I have selected the matter which, in my opinion, is the more urgent and important; that is, that proposed by the honourable member for Dunkley, namely:


The adverse impact of the carbon tax on the business sector


I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places.

"Billson, Bruce, MP",LP,2012-02-15,"



Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley) (15:51):  The adverse impact of a carbon tax on the business sector is undoubtedly the most compelling issue facing employers and those who are worrying about their financial security and the broader health and wellbeing of the Australian economy. It was not enough for the Australian public's confidence in the democratic process to be assaulted by the Prime Minister with her promise that 'there will be no carbon tax under a government' followed by her introduction of the very tax she had promised not to introduce. In addition to the damage to the public's confidence in the democratic process we are now seeing damage to the confidence of Australian consumers and damage to the Australian economy. I am sure we will hear from members opposite, who will say, 'Oh, there are the Libs and the Nats again talking about the business sector.'




Mr Ian Macfarlane:
  And the LNP.




Mr BILLSON:
  And the LNP. It is an interesting point to emphasise that the business sector is the one that is providing the bulk of the jobs in the Australian economy. If we are not interested in the health and welfare of the business sector, we are not interested in the livelihoods of Australian families and the security and prospects of Australian businesses. But that is why the carbon tax is such a crucial issue for that important part of our community. We are talking about the mums and dads who run small businesses and family enterprises. We are talking about the employees who give of their skills and talents day in and day out in a workplace where those organisations have the spectre of the world's largest carbon tax hanging over their heads, threatening their survival.


It is interesting to remind those who are listening that this carbon tax is like no other carbon tax that any other economy is facing. This carbon tax will generate revenue some 18 times the amount that is raised in Europe. Eighteen times the amount of financial burden on our economy is being imposed by this Gillard Labor government's carbon tax. It is worth remembering that the population of Europe is some 22 times the size of the Australian population. Here we have a tax 18 times the size in terms of its burden, impact and harm on the Australian economy compared to Europe, and yet Europe has 22 times the number of people. Put simply, the Australian carbon tax amounts to $400 per capita—$400 for everyone in the Australian continent—whereas the European carbon tax amounts to $1 each. We have a 400 times greater impact on the Australian economy through this carbon tax than is faced over in Europe, and the government is trying to tell the Australian public, 'Don't worry. It's happening in Europe. Everything will be okay.' But we know the Australian public have no confidence in what the government says. There is much evidence to justify their suspicions about these kinds of assurances.


Let us look at what people are actually doing. At the present time Australian households are saving 13 per cent of their disposable household income, where just 18 months ago it was negative one per cent. People were actually adding to their personal debt. Thirteen per cent of household income is being saved. It is being saved because people are concerned and anxious. They are not convinced by what the government says and there is evidence, argument, insight and concern being raised day after day by those who create wealth and opportunity in this country that this government just continues to ignore.


While you see the coalition go on about hope, reward and opportunity, this government is about hardship, risk, redistribution of wealth and obfuscation on the impact of its actions. That is the contrast that the Australian public is seeing. You do not have to go back too far to see the research. Interestingly, in the lead-up to the Queensland election the Queensland Chamber of Commerce and Industry surveyed 1,000 businesses in Queensland. Yesterday the Prime Minister tried to accuse the opposition of somehow creating and nurturing concern and anxiety. The message for the Prime Minister is that she has done plenty of that without any help from the opposition. Her government has created a great degree of uncertainty and concern about one particular issue, and that is the carbon tax. Have a look at the data: 94.6 per cent of businesses surveyed in Queensland are concerned about the carbon tax. That is an enormous proportion of those in the business community, not prompted or cajoled by the coalition but who of their own volition identified the carbon tax as a leading concern about their economic future, the vitality and viability of their businesses and the opportunity for them to succeed, to get ahead and to create job opportunities for those in their workforce.


But that is not all. In fact, this polling calls on whoever is the next Queensland government to do all they can to take the fight to Canberra to see that this carbon tax is not introduced. They call it a 'tax trap'. They recognise that it will have an enormous detrimental impact on the Australian economy and also particularly on Queensland. It does not matter what region those survey results come from; it has carbon tax or higher energy costs as the biggest issue. It does not matter what sector of the economy those businesses come from. Again, their biggest concern is the carbon tax and increasing energy prices. The size of the business does not matter. This is still the biggest concern. This is why this survey report is calling on the government to scrap the implementation of the carbon tax, so that Queensland businesses have half a chance of finding their way through the murk, mist and smokescreen that is this government to try to forge a better future for themselves and their communities and to get ahead in this country.


Also in that survey, 84.3 per cent of those surveyed are calling on whoever is the next state government in Queensland to urge the federal government to dump this dodgy tax. There is only one way that will happen and that is if there is an LNP result in Queensland because, as sure as night follows day, the state Labor Party will be in a headlock controlled by Canberra to make sure everyone is singing from the same hymn book. That singing ignores any of the messages coming from those people having to make big decisions about the future of our economy. We have seen it day after day and we all have felt the pain and the uncertainty about job losses in major employers, particularly in the energy intensive manufacturing area of our economy. We see that every day. Every day that is highly visible and we know the concerns of those people.


I want to put on the table tonight something that is also happening every day but that is far less visible though still very raw in the Australian economy—and that is what is happening in the small business space. Small businesses and family enterprises are having to look at an employee who has been on their team or staff for years, knowing they have family and obligations—and they know this because they are a small business with a very personal relationship with and interest in the wellbeing of that person—and tell them that they do not have any more work for them, that they have to reduce their hours or that they have to wind back the opportunities for extra income from extra work. That is happening and it does not get attention. It does not get the attention that it deserves but it is happening right across the Australian continent. This is a very difficult environment that does not hit the headlines. The government come in with their own stories about what is happening with big employers with major layoffs. They do not even try to turn their minds to what is happening in terms of the atrophy in the economy of the small business and family enterprise sector—the 300,000 jobs that have been lost since this government was elected and the 14,500 fewer employees of small businesses we now have under Labor.


The constant message is that the carbon tax is going to make the difficult economic situation even worse. There is a reason why the government does not want to talk about that—and that is because the government has airbrushed the experience and the impact of small business out of its policy-making process. This carbon tax is designed to offer no direct compensation to small business—none whatsoever. While you have got all these carve-outs and compensation arrangements that will see this carbon tax actually cost the budget more than it is going to bring in, there is nothing in there for the small business community. They are told to suck it up. They are told to just absorb it or pass it on to their consumers. Does anyone know a consumer that is just itching for a price rise? Has everyone ignored the fact that there are cost-of-living pressures in every Australian household? Cost-of-living pressures in business are cost-of-input pressures, and the small business community are being told by this tawdry government: 'Suck up the impact or pass it on.'


When there is an opportunity for Minister Combet to address this issue directly, he ridicules the concern. I have pointed out that 19 out of 20 businesses in Queensland are horrified about this carbon tax, but apparently it is 'She'll be right; don't worry.' It is like the political equivalent of a flesh wound—when all of these businesses are terrified about the impact. When Minister Combet spoke at the Press Club, he ridiculed the concerns of the small business community. He said: 'Oh, it's all overstated. There's nothing to be worried about.' He went on to say that the electricity costs will only be a microscopic increase. But no-one believes him, and there has been no modelling done on the impact on individual small businesses in terms of their type, their supply chain, the energy that they use, the energy that is embedded in their inputs and the ability of the business to absorb that additional cost. No analysis has been done on that whatsoever. Yet Minister Combet stood up before the Australian National Press Club and said to the small business community: 'Hey, you've got no reason to be worried.' He said:


A dry cleaner is not competing against dry cleaners in China.


What a genius contribution that is! He went on to say:


Drivers cannot get their cars serviced in India.


He was trying to make the clumsy point that, whilst the countries with which we compete in many markets might not have a carbon tax, you cannot take your car over to them.




Mr Tony Smith:
  People won't get them serviced!




Mr BILLSON:
  I thank my friend and colleague. What people will do is they will delay activity in those areas. You go and talk to any mechanic around Australia. Those scheduled services are not being done in quite the same way they were in the past. People are waiting till their car needs a repair before they go to the mechanic. You go and ask anybody who installs LPG, an investment that has a long-run benefit. But there is no need to do it right now—and people are simply not doing it. This government has created a hibernation climate for these small businesses, because the consumers they rely upon are anxious about their future, uncertain about the impact of a carbon tax and absolutely clear that you cannot trust the government about what they are saying the impact will be. So what does the dry-cleaner do? He does not get to see the customer quite so often. If people can put off that extra visit to the dry-cleaner, they will. If there is some other way—a hand wash perhaps, for a cardigan or a vest—they will use that, but they will not go to the dry-cleaners.


This is happening right across our economy. This is why the small business community need a government that partners with them rather than punishes them. This is why we need the small business minister and ministers with responsibility for policies that have a profound impact on the viability and the future of small businesses to give a damn about what is happening in the small business community. They are copping it every which way from this government, and this is undermining employment in small businesses and it is undermining the very viability of those small businesses.


You might hear the government say: 'We're going to give this little bit of help to this particular big industry.' Why? It is a big industry, it has got the ear of the big government, and the big unions are in there cheering for it. Well, we are here to reaffirm our support for the small businesses that are not organised into unions, that do not have the ear of this government. They can count on the coalition to partner with them in terms of their prosperity and their opportunities into the future.


Let us have a look at what is actually playing out here. You will probably hear from those opposite: 'We've got all these compensation plans. It will all be just fine. It will all be peachy. Just ignore everything that is said by anybody who runs a business. Just ignore all of the analysis that's done. Ignore all the research and ignore all the impact work that's been done'—the research the government should have done but could not be bothered getting off its backside to do.


You stand condemned for your indifference to the impact of your policies on the men and women in small business who are the backbone of our economy. They know what you know. They know that you do not care. They are not looking for you to do anything for them, because that would be the first time. What they are hoping for is a chance at their future, a chance not to get this dagger in their heart of a carbon tax that is a ridiculously implemented proposition that is nothing like anything else that is going on in the world and that will have a very profound impact on small businesses and family enterprises. They cannot rock up to their suppliers and say: 'Hey, I'm a big business. If you want to keep working with me, you just go and absorb that cost.' They do not have that market power. They cannot go to their energy company and say: 'You want to put your prices up by 10 per cent? No, no. I don't think we'll cop that, because we're a big business.' They cannot do that.


So often, small business are price takers. So often, what they can afford to charge depends on what the import alternative might be. So often, they are at the pointy end of that difficult conversation between a consumer and someone providing the goods and services who has to say: 'This will cost this much.' They have to look in the eyes of those anxious consumers, who are uncertain about the competence of this government and wary about having confidence in the economy when the government cannot seem to manage its own affairs, let alone those of the nation. They have to be there when the decision is made: 'Maybe I'll just put that off.'


They cannot run off to somebody and say, 'Gee, business is a bit grim. Oh, well, we'll just work a little bit slower. There's always scope that the boss will throw in more money.' They are the boss. They are the last person to be paid. They are the ones who come in on the weekend, looking for those opportunities. They are the ones who turn up for this nation. They drive innovation in this country. They create wealth and opportunity, and this Gillard government does not give a hoot about them.


I am interested to hear what the Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency has got to say. He was at a business conference in the Isaacs electorate with SEMMA. He visited them and tried to explain the carbon tax. When someone explained the punishing impact of the carbon tax on their energy-intensive business, he just dismissed it: 'Oh, that's not much money. It might make you broke, but that's tough. That's a bad choice for the business.' This is a bad government. (Time expired)

"Dreyfus, Mark, MP",ALP,2012-02-15,"



Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Cabinet Secretary and Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (16:06):  I am always happy to speak on a matter of public importance that raises the government's plan for a clean energy future, because it is such a good plan. It is important to talk about the opportunities that will become available to Australian business as the economy transforms. I know that the member for Dunkley is interested, which is why he is staying to hear some details of the government's clean energy future plan—



An opposition member:  He's got nothing!




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  The member for Dunkley was heard in silence!




Mr DREYFUS:
  None of that would be apparent to anyone who was listening to the speech that we have just heard from the member for Dunkley because he did not actually go to any of the aspects of pricing carbon, any of the aspects of the actual Clean Energy Future plan. We have a plan which will cut pollution. It will drive investment in clean energy technologies and it will drive investment in infrastructure like solar, gas or wind. It will help build the clean energy future that future generations deserve. It will help our children and it will help our grandchildren. It is, of course, disappointing to have this important debate raised in the way that it has been, as—so we have heard from the member for Dunkley—a risk to the economy or as a risk to business. It is astounding to see the degree to which those on the other side of this chamber have wilfully perpetuated their own ignorance. They have deliberately ignored the benefits of the Clean Energy Future plan for what can only be described as reasons of base political expediency. It is shameful to see them engage in what can only be described as an all-out scare campaign for months and months and months, claiming that our policy will have a negative impact on the economy. Nothing could be further from the truth.


Let me make this clear: our policy will help Australia take part in the global economy of the future. It will reduce our emissions and position Australia business for the development of the global low-carbon economy. It is not our policy that represents a grave risk to the Australian economy. Rather, it is the opportunistic, false and deliberately misleading campaign by those opposite—indeed, what I would describe as the grubbiest opposition in the history of Federation—that represents a risk to Australian business. It is a risk because it reduces business and consumer confidence. It is a risk because it undercuts certainty. It is what we have come to expect from this opposition: the talking down of the Australian economy. It is no wonder that some Australians at least are concerned about the pricing of carbon because of the way this opposition has misrepresented the government's plan, the way in which this opposition has represented the effects of pricing carbon and, indeed, the way this opposition continues to talk down the Australian economy. And, worse than this, it is the ongoing economic ineptitude of this opposition that, should they ever be elected to govern—and I hope that day never comes—which actually represents the biggest risk to the Australian economy and the biggest risk to Australian business.


I say 'ongoing' because it has been for many, many months, going right back to the last election, that we have seen the economic ineptitude of this opposition demonstrated. I would go right back to an observation made by one of Australia's most respected journalists just after the last election. Writing in the Australian Financial Review on 3 September 2010, Laura Tingle said this:


There are two possible explanations for how an opposition presenting itself as an alternative government could end up with an $11 billion hole in the cost of its election commitments. One is that they are liars, the other is that they are clunkheads. Actually, there is a third explanation: they are liars and clunkheads. But whatever the combination, they are not fit to govern.


Nothing has changed since 3 September 2010. Nothing has changed since the opposition were caught out over the costings that they took to the Australian people at the time of the last election. They were caught out over an $11 billion hole in their costings produced by accountants who were later found to be guilty of professional misconduct. Nothing has changed except that they are now looking for cuts of $70 billion, not for cuts of $11 billion, and there is no explanation to the Australian people as to how they are going to produce those.


Labor governments represent working families. We know that the best way to look after those working families is to manage the economy for jobs and growth. As a result of our stimulus during the global financial crisis—which those opposite opposed—Australia stands out around the industrialised world. We have low unemployment, we have solid growth, we have moderate inflation and we have massive business investment and low public debt. Our policy to move towards a clean energy future will not hurt the economy. Rather, it has been designed to ensure that we can continue to manage the economy in the interests of working families.


Let me recap on what is at stake here and why the government must act on climate change and why we have put a price on carbon. There is clear consensus among climate scientists that climate change is real and will have significant future impacts if no action is taken to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. It is clearly in Australia's national interest to continue to work towards the international goal of limiting warming to below two degrees. To do this, it is imperative that we play a responsible role in international action and that we do so by taking strong action at home—which is something those opposite continually forget. That means we must actually reduce our emissions of carbon pollution into the atmosphere. Labor has a plan which is in line with expert opinion: a broadly based carbon price which directly creates incentives for businesses throughout the economy to reduce emissions and for all consumers to use energy more wisely. We are putting a price on carbon because we know this is the cheapest and most effective way to transition to a clean energy future.


A low-carbon global economy is coming and it is up to us to decide whether we help Australian businesses to take advantage of this or simply bury our heads in the sand. The Clean Energy Future Plan is one of the most significant industry and innovation policies that this nation has ever seen. Over $15 billion will be invested in creating the jobs of tomorrow, most notably in manufacturing. Those opposite would have our industries stand still as our overseas competitors reduce their pollution intensity and get a head start in competing in the low-carbon global economy.


And because we are the Labor Party, a party that represents working people, we are making sure that low- and middle-income earners receive assistance as we make these changes. Our tax cuts and increased payments through benefits and pensions are targeted at those who need them most. Labor will make sure that pensioners, low- and middle-income earners and families doing it tough are looked after. The rest of the world is acting, and if one needs any demonstration of that one has only to look at the agreement reached to go forward that was made at Durban last year. So the rest of the world is acting and our economy and our environment will be badly damaged unless Australia acts too. You would have to say that all of those opposite in the Liberal Party are in some kind of alternative universe, where they have wilfully divorced themselves from reality. We know that many of those opposite like to pretend that climate change is not happening. It is a bit like how they like to pretend when they talk about the economy that the global financial crisis did not happen.


Back to climate change, they ignore the facts and the overwhelming weight of evidence from the scientific community that climate change is happening. Those opposite have cobbled together a policy—their so-called direct action policy—which they have no intention of ever pursuing, if they ever hold office. No-one should be fooled by this. This policy is not designed to reduce emissions; it is a policy that is only designed to give an appearance of action—just a fig-leaf appearance that the opposition do actually care about taking action on climate change. This so-called direct action plan—if you can call it a plan at all—involves the purchase of abatement of emissions at taxpayers' expense.


It has been tried before and it has been found to be ineffective and very expensive. In fact, what the member for Dunkley should have faced up to when he spoke earlier was the analysis of the opposition's policies and its direct action plan by the department of climate change, which was provided in response to a question raised at Senate additional estimates, in February 2010.


The analysis found that the plan would be unlikely to achieve more than 40 million tonnes of abatement in 2020, that it could not achieve the level of abatement at the costs claimed by the coalition and that an average cost of carbon of $50 per tonne in 2020 would be the minimum realistic average cost for such a program. That of course is well above the cost of the carbon price that the government has brought in.


Families would be worse off under the plan that has been advanced by the opposition. You would have to pay $1,300 more in taxes and that money would be given by a coalition government straight to the big polluters. We have been debating this matter for years and it is time that the opposition put aside the mindless negativity that we have become accustomed to and let the rest of the country get on with it.


I have very briefly advanced reasons regarding the hopelessness of the opposition's direct action plan. That was why John Howard—the leading light of the conservative political class in this country—thought that a direct action response was inadequate and why he went to the election in 2007 with an emissions trading plan. We need an explanation as to why it is that those opposite have abandoned the policies that their former Prime Minister, John Howard, took to the 2007 election.


I just want to talk a little bit more about the absolutely shameful scare campaign that we are seeing from the opposition. We have had another instalment here today from the member for Dunkley. Australian consumers are already cautious in the wake of economic turmoil overseas. The last thing they need is the relentless, baseless and totally unprincipled scare campaign that is being run by those opposite at a time when global economic uncertainty is impacting on the savings of all Australians and when we have the Leader of the Opposition running around the country making patently false statements about the impact of the government's carbon price.


We heard that the coal industry is doomed, only to read of record takeovers in the next day's newspapers. We note that there is investment of $80 billion in the coal industry in the pipeline, with 87 new mines either under construction or awaiting approval. We heard from the opposition that the steel industry will be wiped out, only to hear that the industry is comfortable with the government's Clean Energy Plan. We heard endless statements about 'unimaginable price impacts'—that is the sort of language that those opposite use—on businesses and consumers when, in reality, these impacts will be modest and when nine out of 10 households will receive assistance in the form of tax cuts or increased payments in pensions and benefits.


Throughout this unprecedented scare campaign, the Leader of the Opposition has made it perfectly clear that he values his career over and above the wellbeing of those very Australians whom he claims to be fighting for. He has made it clear that he will say and do anything to get a headline. It is not possible that he is so economically illiterate that he believes what he is saying. Perhaps it is.


Just last week a report by the Australian National Audit Office was tabled in parliament. The complete lack of concern by the opposition about facts when it comes to climate change and the carbon price now stands exposed. Last July Mr Abbott wrote to the Auditor-General asserting—and then immediately told the newspapers about his assertions—that there were factual inaccuracies in the government's campaign. That assertion was accompanied by banner headlines, which asserted these supposed inaccuracies in the government's advertising campaign. Last week, the report tabled by the Australian National Audit Office, found that all of the factual statements in the government's 'clean energy future' advertising campaign were supported by the evidence. That means that the opposition leader has, once again, been caught out misleading the public, as we have grown accustomed to in this campaign on the carbon price. The report showed, in direct terms, with a line-by-line analysis of the advertising, that the opposition leader's complaints had no substance. It showed that the opposition leader stands totally discredited in relation to just about everything that he has said about the carbon price, because it showed that the facts are that the carbon price will apply to around 500 of the largest polluters, that more than half of the revenue will be used to provide households with tax cuts, increases in family payments and higher pensions and benefits and that nine out of 10 households will receive assistance. Those were the things that the Leader of the Opposition attacked, and they have been endorsed and verified by the Auditor-General in the report tabled last week. (Time expired)

"Mirabella, Sophie, MP",LP,2012-02-15,"



Mrs MIRABELLA
 (Indi) (16:21):  It does not please me to follow such a disappointingly woeful and sleep-inducing performance from a particularly unconvincing parliamentary secretary. He did talk about being divorced from reality. Let me inform the House of an example of what it means to be divorced from reality when we talk about the carbon tax.


The member for Isaacs occasionally speaks to some of the manufacturers in his electorate—and he has got a lot of them. He attended a meeting last year where he was asked a question by an entrepreneur, a businessperson who invests in manufacturing and who at the moment is experiencing wafer-thin profit margins, if any at all. The member for Isaacs, who is at the table, turns his back, of course, like he turns his back on those hardworking businesses and the people they employ in his own electorate. This businessperson said to the member for Isaacs, 'A carbon tax will increase my electricity bill and a carbon tax will make it very difficult for my business to be viable,' and he went on and explained that. What did the member for Isaacs—that great entrepreneur, with experience in running a business and putting all his money at risk to have a go in the free market—say? He said words to the effect of, 'Well, maybe you're in the wrong business.' So we have got a parliamentary secretary in the area of climate change and now industry—which is quite irrational—saying, 'We are going to impose all these additional government taxes and charges on you, including the carbon tax, and if you cannot be competitive because of those additional costs we have imposed upon you, well, you run a bad business model.' It is pathetic. That, my friend from Isaacs, is—




Mr Dreyfus:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, on a point of order, this is a patently false account of what I said at a meeting not attended by the member for Indi, patently false—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The parliamentary secretary will resume his seat. He has other opportunities for this in the House. I will caution the member for Indi to not continue to reflect upon another member.




Mrs Mirabella:
  To assist any member interested in this particular matter, I do have the video available; I am getting it converted to be available on YouTube for everyone to see an accurate and correct reflection of events.


The government espouses all these benefits of the carbon tax. It is such a ridiculous proposition. If the carbon tax is so good for the jobs of tomorrow, then why don't you double it? Then we will have even more jobs! That is how illogical this actually is. The government talks about compensation for industry. Well, you only provide compensation when you injure someone. This carbon tax is intended to injure business, is intended to injure industry.


It is particularly heinous because what we have done in this parliament is pass a tax before the rest of the world has done so. It is insane, absolutely insane, to penalise Australian businesses, to put extra lead in their saddlebags when they try to export overseas, competing against businesses that do not have the costs of a carbon tax imposed upon them. It is insane to penalise our businesses that compete with imported products, because those products are not exposed to a carbon tax. There is no other country that has a carbon tax of this nature, one that is intended to increase, to go up and up and up. This is why, fundamentally, the carbon tax is bad; it is disastrous for business, particularly in the manufacturing sphere, particularly for energy intensive businesses, because it goes to the heart of the competitiveness of those businesses. And there is no answer. As Graham Kraehe from BlueScope said, any compensation is 'like putting a bandaid on a bullet wound'.


This is affecting all sorts of industries. The food and grocery manufacturers, who employ over 300,000 Australians, are labouring under extraordinary pressure. They have said that a carbon tax will be bad for Australian manufacturers. Kate Carnell, the recent Chief Executive of the Australian Food and Grocery Council, said:


For Julia Gillard to say that food companies who aren’t in the top 1000 emitters won’t be affected by carbon tax is simply wrong.


Further, she said:


Products requiring the most energy to manufacture would see the biggest cost increases such as baked goods, dairy sugar and paper products like nappies.


The Labor Party bleat and try to label us on this side as scaremongers because we merely oppose the carbon tax. Do they say the same thing about a whole list of industries and businesses who have condemned the carbon tax? Let us look at other trade exposed industries. We saw economic modelling showing that there would be a forced closure of eight coalmines and that $22 billion of exports would be forgone. We have seen Treasury's own modelling of the carbon tax show that the aluminium industry would be cut by more than a half by 2050. We have seen the shelved expansion of the refinery in Western Australia and we have seen the situation in Geelong, where the car industry is also affected. We saw independent modelling regarding the impact of the carbon tax on the car industry—an extra $460 million over 10 years. If this carbon tax is so great, why are all these industries saying, in one way or another, that a carbon tax is going to make them less competitive and that a carbon tax will make a difficult situation much, much worse?


There are some further words of wisdom from Graham Kraehe, a great Australian with over 40 years experience in manufacturing. I hear some members on the other side laughing. Well, colleagues on the other side of the House, you actually do need business people to run businesses, to employ people and to increase the living standards and the economy of this nation. He has asked a very simple question: why is the government prepared to sacrifice a key sector of the Australian economy by introducing a carbon tax on Australian manufacturers, with little impact on world CO2 generation? What is being proposed is a system that will tax Australian made goods but will give importers of those same goods a competitive advantage, with no comparable tax payable.


It could not have been said more eloquently and concisely. We see this right across the board. We see the pressure on the furniture, cabinet and joinery makers, who employ 137,000 people. They say that a carbon tax will further erode our competitive position, with no real effect on climate change. We see an impact on the tourism industry of $731 million. The government claims, bleats, that the carbon tax is good for Australian businesses and is setting us up for the future, but it is setting us up for failure. It is setting us up for more job losses, and they know it. That is why they are sneaking behind closed doors trying to keep certain businesses and industries sweet by saying, 'Look here, we'll throw you a bit more compensation money to make up for the injury we are causing you.' That is no way to run a government or an economy and it is no way to plan for the difficult economic months and years we have ahead. This government should stop listening to those lunatic greens and start listening to the people who make this country great: those businesses that employ great Australians.

"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,2012-02-15,"



Mr FITZGIBBON
 (Hunter—Chief Government Whip) (16:31):  I think those last few words from the member for Indi said it all about her contribution—all bluster, filling us all with complete falsehoods. When you have no argument the typical approach is to start telling those fibs. It was a shocking speech.


I have just come from a meeting—it is a busy time of the afternoon for the Chief Government Whip, but I wanted to speak on this matter of public importance for some very good reasons. One of those reasons concerns the nature of my electorate, which is well known to have a substantial coal mining industry, a substantial power generation industry and a substantial aluminium industry. This gives me the opportunity to correct some of the falsehoods being promoted largely by the member for Indi, but no doubt as well by the member for Dunkley.


The amazing thing about this debate is the total absence of any capacity at all on the part of the opposition to deal with some of the realities. We heard lots about the carbon price mechanism. We heard lots about alleged impacts on businesses. But we heard nothing about climate change and the need for governments to act. It is worth reminding ourselves that both the government and the opposition in this place have the same climate change policy. We are both committed to acting on climate change. Indeed, the opposition's carbon reduction targets are the same as those of the government. Yet I did not hear the member for Dunkley—I will stand corrected if needed—mention the opposition's policy at all. I certainly did not hear the member for Indi mention the opposition's policy. She blustered about the alleged impact on business but did not say anything about her own policy to reduce carbon emissions and the impact that might have on businesses. Direct Action will of course have an impact, just as our policy has impacts. But there are big differences. Their policy is to tax Australian families—more money—and use that money to fund carbon reduction programs within business, which will transfer wealth from families to big business to let them off the hook in terms of the efforts they must make to address climate change.


I am challenging those on the other side who have not yet spoken but will make a contribution to this debate to start talking about their own policy, how it is gong to work and what impact it is going to have on Australian families. I will take it that, if none of them gets up and talks about their policy this evening, they no longer have one. We will be able to have a real debate in this place about climate change and carbon reduction and whether they are not opposed to doing anything at all. We welcome that debate, because we believe the scientific evidence is in and that it is overwhelming. We are concerned about a whole range of issues in environmental terms, including the Pacific islands that will no longer exist once sea levels rise to certain levels. Let us have that debate. If they are still committed to reducing carbon pollution let them get up in this place and explain how they intend to achieve it.


At least the member for Dunkley devoted some time to business, and small business in particular, and I welcome that because we have been combatants on these issues in the past. It surprised me, though, that he did not go to the core issue—that is, the environmental issues—because he has a history in this. I have a speech here from right back in 1999 in which he devoted quite a bit of time in this place to talking about the need to make small businesses more efficient and reduce their environmental impact. He also spoke about the initiatives his government was taking. He referred to dry cleaners in particular. I was reminded of his speech when he used it in his own address just this afternoon. I am disappointed that the member for Dunkley was previously so dedicated to helping businesses to reduce their pollution footprint, yet he has now thrown that out of the window. I think the dry cleaning industry would be very disappointed indeed.


But let us think about these alleged impacts on business. Take two of the government's biggest policies and achievements in this place—the mining tax and the carbon price. It delivers small business tax breaks—immediate write-offs of up to $5,000. They must be against this. It gives us infrastructure funding in the regions, where small businesses operate. You come to my region and you will know that one of the big issues for small business is basic community physical infrastructure, including road networks. It gives a company tax rate reduction. Is that not going to help big business? What about personal tax rates. What about the raising of the tax-free threshold. Is that not going to help people in unincorporated businesses, sole traders and partnerships? Are they not going to get a tax break? The estimated power price rise for a small business is about $5 a week. These same small businesses are getting multiple tax breaks. The member for Dunkley does not acknowledge any of this. They talk about the downside, as they see it, of this policy but they cannot be taken seriously if they are not prepared to talk about the upside, including the exemption of petrol from the scheme. We all know how important fuel costs are to both small and large businesses. You hear none of that from them.


The big challenge for business in my electorate is the skills shortage. That is why we are investing literally billions of dollars in addressing that issue, through productivity, placement programs, trades training centres, increased TAFE funding and the Education Investment Fund. These are all things they oppose over on that side of the chamber. When I was representing the small business constituency I used to have a little phrase that I would use on almost every occasion when addressing them. It was, 'The best three things a government can do for business, and small business in particular, is to grow the economy, keep interest rates low and get out of the way.' That is exactly what this government has been doing. We have been growing the economy in the face of a global recession. We are the envy of the world. What more would you want to do for business than that? Wouldn't they just love to have our economy in Europe? Interest rates are still at historical lows, and we are reducing red tape on small business in this country.


The member for Indi again repeated these claims that we are losing jobs in the coalmining industry. If you came to my electorate and said that—and I would love to see the member for Indi do it—they would laugh at her. They know it is simply not true. We do know that there was some coal industry modelling which suggested that under the carbon price the industry might not grow in job terms as fast over the next decade as it might have otherwise. The opposition have misused that data and turned it into a job losses proposition. But before they say, 'Jobs will not grow as fast,' that is a good thing in mining regions because the businesses that the member for Dunkley and the member for Indi were talking about cannot get people to work in their businesses. So this is a rebalancing of the model. They would be laughed at if they came to the Hunter electorate and made that statement.


I will quickly finish on something local and close to my heart, and that is the aluminium industry. The aluminium industry is in trouble globally. Smelters right around the world are closing or are planning to close. Why is this happening? It is happening because aluminium prices are at record lows, particularly here in Australia because the Australian dollar is so high and input costs are rising. They would have you believe on the other side that they have got a solution to those problems. Of course they have not. And they would have you believe that it has something to do with the carbon price. Well we would be having a conversation about Hydro Aluminium in my electorate with or without a carbon price. Those on the other side understand that but they want to perpetrate this lie on the Australian community, including my own community, because they think there are votes in it. They would be better placed talking to the New South Wales government—their mates; and the member for Dunkley talked about state elections—about finally giving Hydro a decent electricity supply contract and the certainty that goes with it.

"Christensen, George, MP",Nats,2012-02-15,"



Mr CHRISTENSEN
 (Dawson) (16:41):  As much as the government would have us believe otherwise, the carbon tax will have an impact on business—it absolutely will. While it will be a negative impact on most, for others it will absolutely devastate them. There was a time when, despite all the noise that they make, the government actually accepted that there would be impacts. They once accepted that fact. I could go back to the grand architect, when the Labor Party paid Professor Ross Garnaut to do a report for them, and this was the forerunner of it. He said in that report:


… imposing a carbon price in Australia ahead of similar carbon constraints in our trade competitors—



Mr Champion interjecting—




Mr CHRISTENSEN:
  If you will be quiet mate you will learn something. He said that it could result:


… could result in some movement of emissions intensive, trade-exposed industries from Australia to other countries that impose less of a carbon constraint.


That is from the guy who came up with the policy for this government. But look, your Prime Minister actually admitted it—that is, your current one; she might not be that next week. She said, 'It has price impacts.' It is meant to have price impacts, that is the whole point. Remember that one—'price impacts'? There was a reason why she admitted that there would be impacts. The government had put out so much spin that the carbon tax would not hurt anyone that people were starting to ask the question: 'What is the point of it. Why are we having this thing if there is no impact?' You know, 'If you put a price on something, then people will use less of it'—another quote from the Prime Minister.


This Prime Minister, this Labor Party—this Labor-Greens alliance, I should say, and the motley crew of Independents—think that by increasing the cost of electricity that is going to solve everything. Let us go through some of the impacts on jobs and the impacts on businesses that this carbon tax will have. We have had a lot of talk about Alcoa and the government is desperate to say that there are going to be no impacts on Alcoa. It is a shame that the last member who spoke, who has aluminium in his electorate, is not here to listen to this. Alcoa has shelved a $3 billion expansion of a refinery in WA. An Alcoa spokesman said that the company would not return to the project until it understood the full impact of the $23 a tonne carbon tax. I quote further from Alan Cransberg of Alcoa, who said:


I don't think there's anybody in the world who's going to put billions of dollars into the ground without understanding what are the rules for an ETS or a carbon tax.


You want to look further at Alcoa's statements. Its director of government relations, Tim McAuliffe, spells it out for the government:


Smelters use an enormous amount of power and the way the carbon pricing mechanism is structured, it assumes you will get carbon pass-through effectively at one tonne of carbon for every megawatt hour. You can't get power in Victoria at that intensity.


I could go on to quote Deutsche Bank analyst Tim Jordan, who did an analysis of the Point Henry plant. He assumed that Point Henry operated at the average carbon intensity for Australian industry and he said the carbon price would add about $4 million to the smelter's costs in 2013. For all of the government's bleating and saying that they are going to help the workers at Alcoa and they are going to help the aluminium industry, they are not going to do anything of the sort. This was the plan all along. It is because of one thing: they are in bed with Bob Brown. Here was Bob Brown the other day saying:


… this is an industry which I don't think has been investing wisely and the market does come into play, as indeed it is doing with the logging industry in Tasmania at the moment.


This guy wants the aluminium industry shut down. The Greens have got a written agreement, a written alliance. He helped draft this carbon tax, the one that they have all signed up to.


Let us go on to other parts of the aluminium industry. The Chairman of Rusal Australia, John Hannagan, said:


Whatever anyone says about the carbon tax, it does have an impact. It does have a significant impact.


The system being put in place for the carbon tax is really based on, I think, a very flawed assumption that our competitors are going to have similar or more aggressive carbon or energy policies attached to them.


I could talk about Norsk Hydro with their plant at Kurri Kurri and reports that 2,000 of their jobs could disappear. That is in the member for Hunter's electorate, and he stood up here saying there would be no impact. The Chief Executive of the Federation of Automotive Products Manufacturers, Richard Reilly, said that continuing government help would be needed. But then he went on to say, 'We are going to be impacted by a carbon tax and our competitors overseas won't.' It is a bit of a case of Julia giveth but the carbon tax taketh away.


There are jobs that are going to go in abattoirs around the region, and all of this was known from the start. I go back to what Professor Garnaut said:


… imposing a carbon price in Australia ahead of similar constraints in our trade competitors … could result in some movement of emissions-intensive, trade-exposed industries from Australia to other countries that impose less of a carbon constraint.


Let us have a look at what other countries are doing. The Labor and Greens government are proposing $23 a tonne. The member for Herbert wants to see comparable schemes. In New Zealand the spot permits under its emissions-trading scheme actually rose by two per cent in the last fortnight to about A$6.38 a tonne. In Europe they are hoping for help this year because the prices have slumped to record lows. Guess how much—to $8.45 a tonne. The government was spruiking that China is now on board with carbon taxing, but it is putting in $1.59 a tonne. That is $1.59 compared with $23 a tonne. You guys have got to be kidding. Ross Garnaut, the government's own advisor, said that Australian industries would be destroyed if there was not comparable carbon pricing around the world. The chickens are coming home to roost.


I could also talk about what small businesses are saying about this. Here is a document that over 70 chambers of commerce from Queensland have signed and sent to Julia Gillard on 21 June. It said:


A carbon tax will flow through the economy affecting the price of all goods and services and increasing costs for all businesses including those without a direct carbon price liability. Trade exposed and small and medium-sized businesses have limited liability to pass these costs onto their customers and as such are at even greater risk of reduced business competiveness and viability.


They begged the Prime Minister not to bring this in. I am particularly concerned, because Mackay is ground zero for the carbon tax. I have the mining industry in my electorate. I have the tourism industry in my electorate. I have agriculture, particularly sugar, in my electorate. All these industries will suffer under the carbon tax. Deloitte said that Mackay was going to be the hardest hit region in the hardest hit state.


The last speaker wanted to know what we were going to do. I will give the members opposite a tip, a titbit, a heads up. When the election is finally called the Leader of the Opposition is going to stand up and is going to say, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead,' and the Australian people will believe him because we will mean it. We will remove the carbon tax that you introduced, that the Australian people are going to have to pay, that small business is going to have to suffer and that people are going to lose their jobs over. I say: shame, shame, shame to the government for bending over to the Greens and forcing this tax on the Australian people.

"Ripoll, Bernie, MP",ALP,2012-02-15,"



Mr RIPOLL
 (Oxley) (16:51):  Can I say: hooray for the opposition! After nearly 12 years of debate in this House, 35 parliamentary inquiries and countless, almost infinite, number of words spoken on climate change, I have changed my mind—I am convinced! I have just heard the convincing words that we do not need to change. In fact, not only am I convinced, but climate change has ceased—that is it! It is all done; it is all said. Methinks climate change is fixed!


The reality is that this MPI is just like every other MPI, every other bit of political claptrap that we have heard from the opposition. They come in here actually misleading people on what the facts are, on what they will do and on the impact of what we are trying to do, shirking their responsibilities in terms of the national interest and what is happening globally. Instead, they are interested in one thing, and we see it in here repeatedly, day after day: the political game, the political advantage. But, unfortunately for the opposition, you can play that game—you just have to introduce some facts. That has to be the bottom line for any debate: there at least has to be some facts you can underpin your argument with. You cannot come in here and not even make an argument but just read out other people's comments. There are plenty of other people's comments, but unfortunately they do not underpin the science, the facts or what this government is actually trying to do after more than 10 years of debate in this House, under consecutive governments, and 35 different parliamentary inquiries.


I think the debate has been had, and I think we have actually passed the legislation. It is actually going to happen. Finally, there is a government with the courage to stand up and make it happen. And guess what? It is going to happen: we will take action, we will do something about climate change and about our competitive position in the world. Because if we do not do something, let me assure you there are 30 other countries doing something right now. You have a choice. You can either get with the program, get on board with what the rest of the world is doing, or end up in the ludicrous position that, for example, China find themselves in right now, where they refuse to pay the carbon price for flying their aircraft into Europe or the United States because they are going to be slugged with a penalty as they do not have a carbon price system. So they are now in this ludicrous position of having to make a decision: do they no longer fly their aircraft into Europe or the United States because they do not want to pay the penalty? Do we really believe in Australia that we are going to do the same thing? I do not think so.


What we are doing is really clear; it is really simple. The 500 largest companies in this country have for more than 100 years been allowed to pollute the environment, the air and our rivers. If anyone does not believe me, have a think about it: where would big industry always set up their factories? Next to a river. Why was that? Because that was the natural sewer; that was where you dumped all the chemicals, the rubbish—the whole lot. But then we woke up one day and we said: there is actually a cost to doing that—a cost to society, to the environment and to us individually. So smart governments over the years introduced laws that said you cannot just dump all of your pollutants and rubbish into the river. And guess what? Then we woke up to air pollution. We said, 'You can't just dump it all into the air, you can't just dump it all into the environment; you have to do something.' And the same principle applies here. The 500 biggest polluters are now going to have to do one of two things: either clean up what they are spewing into the environment or pay a penalty for doing so where maybe they cannot do that as effectively. So what we are going to do is put an incentive in place so that these polluters do not do that any longer.


From the revenue that is raised from the carbon tax we are going to do two things, which are very simple again. First, we are going to compensate average families and households—nine out of 10 households in Australia will get some compensation—because we understand that there is a cost and we are honest about it: because there is a cost, certain things will go up in price. But, let me tell you, it is a very small price. There have been a lot of issues made about, for example, how much a kilo of meat, say rump steak, will be under a carbon price. There has been some really good work done on this. It equates to just 1or 2 cents. When we take into account the normal fluctuations in given prices between different shops and outlets, and inflation, it is not a big burden to pay. But we will compensate families.


The other part of the revenue that comes from the carbon price will go to something that I think is just as important, if not more important—as it is going to be the job creator, the future generator of jobs in this country—because it is about productivity, it is about innovation, it is about competitiveness. And that is because we are going to invest in R&D. We are going to invest in the future. We are going to make sure that, unlike the last 30 years, the next 30 years are going to be about future industries. And you can do that at the same time that you support existing jobs. I think that is a bit lost on the opposition. For them it is black and white, all or nothing. On this side we can actually walk and chew gum at the same time. We can be in a position where we are planning for the future and also supporting existing jobs.


If we are going to talk about existing jobs in the aluminium industry, let us be honest about what is happening in the aluminium industry. We may live on an island but we are not in isolation from the rest of the world. What happens in Australia is not just linked to domestic markets; it is linked to global markets. There is a curious fact. Countries that have already introduced carbon pricing, carbon taxes, on the most polluting industries—of which we all accept aluminium is one—for example, Germany, have seen their aluminium industry grow. It has grown in size, in profitability—it has grown across the board. Why is that? Because the Germans understood that, if their economy was going to thrive and grow into the future, they needed to make the change, they needed to make the investments.


There is one other little thing that really sets this off, and that is demand. There is a high demand for aluminium right across the planet. Unfortunately, Australia has two things working against us right now. First there is a high Australian dollar, at around 106/107 US cents, which is unfortunate for our exporters and for the aluminium industry. It is also unfortunate, as a matter of fact, that the price of aluminium has reduced sharply in recent years, which is putting  a lot of pressure on our industry. So we have accepted all of those things and we are actually working with the industry.


But, while I say all of that, you have to remember: this is before a carbon price comes in, this is before there is a carbon tax, this is before anything that the opposition is talking about has taken place. So we have already accepted the fact that there is some pain and some change—we have called them 'growing pains' in different sectors—but we are going to help and we are going to assist and we are going to do it through a number of packages. We are going to make sure we do not lose our manufacturing sector; that we do not lose our aluminium smelting sector; and that we support, underpin and invest in those jobs. And we have actually done something concrete about it—not just drafted a plan. We have actually put money on the table; we have passed legislation.


What is curious, though, is that the other side talk about supporting jobs but they come in here and vote against jobs. They vote against the support packages. They vote against those workers, whom they are trying to frighten and scare—those families who are looking at their own industries and sectors and are unsure about where the future may take them. I would be unsure, too, if I continually heard on the radio members of the opposition, the shadow Treasurer and others, basically pooh-poohing their sector, carrying on like it is the end of the world and there will not be an aluminium smelting sector in Australia or any other manufacturing, when that is just not the case. This MPI is completely meaningless, except for the fact that it is a cheap political point-scoring exercise, because we have already passed all the legislation that needs to be passed. The opposition should now get on with the reality of life—start supporting industry, start supporting the legislation that we bring into this House that will actually support jobs, make sure that we have a strong and growth focused manufacturing sector by supporting the proposals that we are putting forward and make sure that they do not go out there and frighten industry and frighten workers. The opposition has made all sorts of baseless claims about jobs. I say baseless because there are no facts attached. They talk about jobs going because of the carbon price, but it has not come in yet. What is the cause of what is happening out in industry? I think it is pretty clear to everybody what it is.


The coalition say they have a plan. I will be brief when listing their plan because it is not very complicated and it does very little. They call it the Direct Action Plan. It is really simple: they will directly charge consumers and every taxpayer $1,300 on average per household. That is the exact amount under the opposition's plan, which will cost around $13 billion in 2020. We are doing the opposite. We are saying that those who pollute ought to pay the price and those who will be impacted by it should be compensated. That is our plan. That is what we are going to do. That is what has been passed by the parliament and that is what will happen. People will be compensated for any extra costs they incur and it will mean that Australia will move on to a clean energy future, to jobs for the future and to industries for the future, industries that will survive under our plan.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2012-02-15,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (17:01):  Let me at the outset take issue with the member for Oxley, who talked about compensation for the carbon tax. Why start talking about compensation if the carbon tax is such a good thing? The carbon tax is not going to do one thing for the environment. It is not going to decrease sea levels. It is not going to reduce global temperatures. If the carbon tax is such a good thing, why isn't every other country in the Western world doing it? The President of the United States of America, Barack Obama, did not make a commitment to a carbon tax when he came here. Why would he? America is in financial uncertainty at the moment. Europe is in meltdown. Carbon taxes are not on the radars or the agendas of those countries.


The member for Oxley talked about the 500 biggest polluters that are going to be hit with a carbon tax. Labor denigrates the biggest polluters but they should be praising them because these so-called biggest polluters are in fact our biggest companies. They are producing things. They are making things. They are mining companies. They are abattoirs. They are doing a great job by making and producing things and moreover employing Australians, including many Australians in regional areas. It was only last week that we had the representatives from the abattoir industry here talking with members of parliament. They are deeply concerned about a carbon tax that they know is going to cost jobs and production. If the abattoirs go over 25,000 tonnes of emissions, they are going to have to reduce that so that they come in under that level and do not have to pay a carbon tax. They can do that either by stopping work or by reducing their throughput. Why would an abattoir want to close its doors and lay people off? Why would an abattoir want to put less stock through when people are hungry? That is what is going to happen under a carbon tax.


I know the carbon tax is going to hit Regional Express airlines, based at Wagga Wagga, very severely. The airline industry is already squeezed by low return rates and low profits and the carbon tax is going to be a big hit on Regional Express. Regional Express is a linkage for people in metropolitan areas to come to regional Australia. It is also a vital link for people in regional Australia to go to metropolitan areas for all sorts of things, many of which are related to business and also health issues. Unfortunately, we do not always have the health services and the specialists available in regional areas. These people need to be able to get on aeroplanes to go to Sydney, Melbourne and other areas to consult specialists and this is going to have a big impact on them through the additional price that they are going to have to pay on their tickets. Perhaps less viable routes might even be looked at by Regional Express and other airlines. This is all due to the carbon tax or is certainly not helped by it at the very least.


The next election will be a referendum on the carbon tax. The last one should have been. It could have been if the Prime Minister, five days out from the election, had not said, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' Had the Prime Minister been truthful and said, 'Yes, I will contemplate putting in a carbon tax' or 'Yes, unequivocally there will be a carbon tax under a government I lead' then maybe the vote would have been different. But the Labor Party was elected with the help of the regional Independents, the sell-out Independents, and the one Green member of the House of Representatives and on 24 February last year the Prime Minister announced that her government would introduce a carbon tax. As she announced it the Greens leader, the quasi Prime Minister, Senator Bob Brown, stood there front and centre, taking all the glory and the kudos for the fact that a carbon tax would be introduced. Let me tell you that the Greens are no friends of business. Certainly the Greens are no friends of regional Australia. They have shown that time and again. The next election will be a vote on the carbon tax. The 72 members of parliament who betrayed their communities by voting for the carbon tax will be condemned at the next election.


Earlier in this matter of public importance discussion the member for Hunter said that people in his electorate, the coalminers and aluminium smelter workers, would laugh at the member for Indi for the comments that she made and the fact that she said that there would be job losses as a result of the carbon tax. He said they would laugh. Certainly no-one is laughing who has a job at the moment but perhaps will not have a job under the carbon tax. They certainly will not be laughing at the member for Hunter. In fact, they will be angry, just as people right across Australia are angry, that the Prime Minister went back on her word. They are angry that the Prime Minister's Labor people and the sell-out Independents and the Green voted in favour of a carbon tax that they were promised would not occur. The Prime Minister and the Labor government had no mandate for this legislation. Now it is in; unfortunately it is coming like a steam train, like a train wreck, on 1 July.


The coalition will continue to fight this carbon tax. If elected, the coalition will repeal this carbon tax as the first order of business in the 44th Parliament. The opposition leader has said that. We have said time and again that we will repeal it, and we will. We will continue to fight the good fight against the carbon tax because we know in our heart of hearts that it is bad policy. Indeed, the member for Makin knows in his heart of hearts, and other members opposite know in their heart of hearts, that it is bad policy too. But to form government the Prime Minister has gone back on her word, as she has done in relation to the carbon tax and so many other things, including this morning the private health insurance rebate. She has gone back on her word and introduced things that she said unequivocally she would not introduce. If Labor attempts to block the scrapping of the carbon tax, we will go to a double dissolution election. That is on the record. Australians are already facing substantial cost-of-living pressures and the carbon tax will only have a very disadvantageous impact there.


I know that in my own electorate of Riverina small businesses are very worried at the moment, not just because of the carbon tax but also because of the fact that water security is not there anymore. Fly over Griffith at the moment and, in contrast to a few short years ago, you see lush fields of green everywhere as the farmers are actively engaged in what they do best: food production. For the benefit of the House, farmers are people who till the soil to grow the food we eat. This year is the Australian Year of the Farmer. Farmers did not need a carbon tax to be foisted upon them in this their special year. It is an important year.


Soon, the Murray-Darling Basin Authority will announce its plan. This follows previous ill-informed and misguided attempts in the authority's guide and then in its draft. A farmer at Griffith has made sure anyone flying overhead sees what he thinks of the authority's efforts to date. Hanwood's Steve Graham has ploughed 'Jam the Plan' into his paddock in letters large enough to see from the air. He said it is important to remind people that Griffith is not going to back down and that a united front is needed to ensure that this vibrant regional community not only survives but thrives into the future. That is the case with all communities in regional Australia, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott. I know that in your seat of Maranoa people do not want to just survive, they do not want to just hang on. They want to thrive. They deserve to thrive. They grow the food to feed this nation and to feed other nations as well.


Mr Graham summed up the crux of the water issue when he said that people have a right to sell their water but that the third-party impact has locals worried. They are also worried about a carbon tax. And, as he added, the more water that is sold out of the area—out of any irrigation area—the higher the user fees faced by irrigators. The water issue is about food security, home-grown food availability, reasonable grocery costs and the sustaining of regional Australia. Grocery costs are going to go up and up under a carbon tax. Small businesses which are operating at the moment but which cannot compete with the big duopoly will see their costs go up and up. Their power costs are going to go up. Unfortunately, these days people are fighting cost-of-living pressures. They are extremely worried about the fact that they may not be able to fill their car as often as they used to. When those sorts of things happen parents stop taking their kids to sport and they stop taking their kids to the movies, and it has an impact upon the whole community. This carbon tax is not only going to have an impact on small business; it extends throughout the community and is going to have a huge impact on families. A bad water plan is not going to benefit the environment, and I and my Nationals colleagues will not in any way support any plan which will harm the people we represent. We certainly do not support a bad carbon tax. (Time expired)

Mr RUDD
 (Griffith—Minister for Foreign Affairs) (17:12):  by leave—I last updated this House on the situation in Syria one week ago. I regret to inform the House that what is happening in Syria is a crisis that continues to worsen, but international action is in fact strengthening.




Latest developments



The regime has been emboldened by lack of action by the United Nations Security Council. The attacks in Homs are ongoing. And a humanitarian crisis of tragic proportions is unfolding.


On 12 February, at a session of the UN General Assembly convened to discuss the humanitarian situation in Syria, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said that tens of thousands had been arrested and 18,000 people are estimated to be held in arbitrary detention. The crisis has generated some 25,000 refugees, and 70,000 internally displaced persons, as I advised the House most recently. The HRC also went on to say:


The failure of the Security Council to agree on firm collective action appears to have emboldened the Syrian government to plan an all-out assault in an effort to crush resistance with overwhelming force.


Furthermore, the HRC stated through its commissioner:


I am particularly appalled by the ongoing violence in Homs.


The High Commissioner for Refugees confirmed that deaths and injuries are rising but that keeping track of the numbers of fatalities had become 'almost impossible'.


US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has said:


It is deplorable that the regime has escalated violence in cities across the country, including using artillery and tank fire against innocent civilians. We stand with the Syrian people and we are looking for a peaceful resolution.


It is impossible for the international community to stand by and watch this violence continue to unfold without appropriate action.


Here in Australia, last week I called in the Syrian Charge, Mr Jawdat Ali, to underline the Australian government's grave concerns about the worsening crisis in Syria and the ongoing bloodshed. I underlined that the Assad regime had lost its legitimacy fundamentally when it started deploying arms against its own people and that it was time for Assad to leave. I said this view was now virtually universal—as demonstrated not only by the UN Security Council vote, where 13 of the council's 15 members voted in support of the proposed resolution, but more importantly by the collective position of the Arab League itself. Evidence of violence, including the recent loss of life in Homs, is indisputable. It constitutes a growing tragedy. I told the chargé that the growing evidence of human rights abuses, possible war crimes and crimes against humanity, and torture and arbitrary detention was unacceptable to the international community. I told him that the message of the Australian government and people to the government of Syria was clear—Assad must find an exit strategy before the situation in Syria degenerates further and more lives are lost. The bloodshed must come to an end and there must be a peaceful, Syrian led political solution to this crisis. I also asked that the views of the government of Australia be conveyed directly to the Syrian government in Damascus, including to the foreign minister and to President Assad.




Arab League



The Arab League has been actively pursuing efforts to bring peace to Syria and to end the bloodshed—despite the lack of support on the part of some members of the UN Security Council. Members of the Arab League most recently met on 12 February in Cairo to discuss next steps. A resolution was adopted at this meeting:


calling for the UNSC to create a joint peacekeeping force for Syria;


calling for the UNSC to adopt a resolution providing for an immediate cease-fire in Syria, protection of civilians and overseeing a humanitarian effort for victims of the violence;


demanding that regime forces lift the siege on neighbourhoods and villages and pull troops and their heavy weapons back to their barracks;


calling for a halt to all diplomatic contact with Syria and for referring officials responsible for crimes against the Syrian people to international criminal tribunals;


agreeing to step up economic sanctions; and


agreeing to provide the Syrian opposition with financial and political support.


I have signalled in the past, including in this place, Australia's strong support for the efforts of the Arab League. It has shown resolve and leadership to end the appalling bloodshed in Syria and to help lift the hand of oppression currently being held over the Syrian people by the Syrian regime. We owe it to the people of Syria and, through an act of solidarity with the Arab League, to likewise maintain our resolve and support as responsible members of the international community.




Friends of Syria



Last week I informed the House of Australia's prospective support for a possible international grouping of like-minded countries to gather in support of Syria. Since that time there has been progress. Australian embassies and high commissions around the world have been in contact with other countries conveying Australia's support for this important initiative. I am pleased to update the House that Tunisia now plans to host a Friends of Syria meeting on Friday, 24 February in its capital, Tunis. Australia plans to attend. The goals of this meeting are important:


galvanise and coordinate international support for the people of Syria;


encourage the provision of humanitarian assistance to the people of Syria;


provide diplomatic support to the members of the Arab League;


increase pressure on certain members of the UN Security Council to take action; and


strengthen the voice of the international community for an end to this bloodshed.


This I argue is fundamentally important given the failure of the UNSC to pass the most recent resolution before it.




United Nations



It remains to be seen how the UNSC decides to respond to the Arab League's call for help. The full membership of the UNSC must accept its responsibility to the people of Syria by listening to the unified voice of the world's Arab leaders. Russia and China need to reconsider their commitment to the Syrian people. Australia fully supports the UN General Assembly's efforts to bring forward a resolution on Syria this week. A General Assembly resolution has just been tabled by the government of Egypt, with the vote expected this week. Australia will co-sponsor this resolution with the government of Egypt. It reflects the resolution rejected by the UNSC calling for the Syrian government to end violence and to abide by the Arab League peace plan. Further action in the UNSC remains a possibility.


The Arab League secretary general, with whom I have spoken within the last week or so, has maintained the view that despite the pressure on Syria, such as through sanctions, a parallel political track must continue. But the time for Assad to act and to take his opportunity to seek a peaceful, political resolution is now. Australia was one of the first countries to call for the situation in Syria to be referred to the International Criminal Court. Assad has the chance now to take the initiative himself to stand aside to allow an orderly process of reform and to initiate a process of inclusive dialogue; otherwise, the implications for Assad personally are dire.




Consular



Throughout this crisis, since protests began in March 2011, the Australian government has been closely monitoring impacts for our consular obligations. Our travel advice has been simply 'Do no travel', our highest level since April 2001. We urge Australians in Syria to depart now by commercial means while it is still possible to do so. There are 110 Australians registered as being in Syria, although there could be up to 300 actually in the country at any one time. We have been in repeated contact with registered Australians to remind them of the travel advice, and to confirm their safety.




Iran



Elsewhere in the Middle East, a different emerging crisis is attracting the increasing attention and concern of the international community. Here I refer to Iran's nuclear ambitions and the grave threat that it poses to regional and international stability. This threat is unacceptable for the peace and stability of the international community. The Iranian regime has continued to defy both its IAEA obligations and numerous UNSC resolutions. The conclusions of the International Atomic Energy Agency in its November 2011 report are absolutely clear. We are deeply concerned by Iran's decision to begin enrichment to near 20 per cent at its underground facility at Fordow near Qom. This is contrary to Iran's obligations under multiple UNSC and IAEA resolutions—and it takes Iran closer to having the capacity to produce weapons-grade uranium. So this clearly adds to our concern, and that of the region, that Iran is undertaking nuclear weapons related activities.


Australia stands side by side with our partners in Europe and the US in strengthening our sanctions to underline to Tehran the need to comply with its international obligations and return to the negotiating table. Iran must immediately address international concerns regarding its nuclear program, take steps required by UNSC and IAEA and engage constructively with the international community. These are concerns that we have directly and repeatedly outlined to the government of Iran. The ball is in Iran's court to demonstrate that its nuclear program is purely for peaceful purposes.


Let us have a look at some examples of where Iran has not met its international obligations. Both the IAEA and UNSC require Iran to suspend enrichment activities. But Iran continues to enrich uranium at Natanz and has recently commenced enrichment at a new underground facility at Qom. The UNSC requires Iran to suspend heavy-water related activities. But Iran continues to build the Arak heavy-water reactor, which is ideally suited to produce plutonium. Both the IAEA and UNSC require Iran to ratify and implement fully a safeguards additional protocol within the IAEA. Iran has failed to do so. On 11 February President Ahmadinejad announced Iran would soon unveil new nuclear achievements, and insisted Iran would never give up its uranium enrichment process. We are deeply concerned about the risk of escalation and miscalculation through actions and rhetoric such as Iran's threats to close the Straits of Hormuz, and its conduct of military exercises. The IAEA requires Iran to fully cooperate with the IAEA in resolving issues associated with nuclear weapons related activities. But Iran continues to claim there are no such activities and to argue that activities not involving actual nuclear material are outside the mandate of the IAEA.




International diplomatic efforts



The international community, with strong support from the government of Australia, has been doing what it can to encourage Iran to return to the negotiating table, to comply with international obligations and to be fully transparent about its nuclear program. Talks with the P5+1 in Istanbul in January last year collapsed after Iran refused to discuss confidence-building measures unless, from their perspective, preconditions were met which the international community deemed to be unacceptable. The P5+1 said afterwards that the door to dialogue remained open. The choice remained in Iran's hands.


Later, in July 2011, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, who was recently in Australia, put forward a step-by-step approach under which Iran could address questions about its nuclear program, and the international community could, as a result, ease sanctions. In October 2011, EU foreign policy head Catherine Ashton sent a letter to Iran, requesting a resumption of talks. Iran, so far, has not responded formally. Most recently, the press reported that, on 18 January 2012, Iranian foreign minister Ali Akbar Salehi said Iran was ready to restart talks in Turkey with the P5+1; that is, the UN Security Council five nuclear weapon states plus Germany. These talks have not yet begun.




Australian Government's response



There has been a substantial strengthening of EU, US, Canadian and Australian targeted financial sanctions and sanctions on the energy and petrochemical sectors to increase pressure on Iran to comply with its international obligations. Australia has robust sanctions in place to underline to Iran the need to comply with relevant UNSC and IAEA resolutions. Australia's trade with Iran has declined steeply in recent years as a result of the sanctions that we have imposed. As I said in January, Australia will implement additional sanctions parallel to those announced by the EU on 23 January, including the oil embargo.


The international community must give Iran a consistent message that its current refusal to comply with UNSC resolutions, and refusal to cooperate with the IAEA, is unacceptable. Australia remains committed to seeking a resolution of the Iran nuclear issue through diplomatic negotiation, and we urge Iran to follow through on its announced readiness to restart talks with the P5+1. While Iran continues to state it is prepared to participate in fresh talks, we are yet to see this lead to any meaningful substantive negotiations.


The peace, security and stability of the region, and more broadly, depend on such negotiations being conducted and being concluded successfully. I will be conveying this message to Tehran through Australia's Ambassador to Iran.


I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the member for Curtin to speak for 13½ minutes.


Leave granted.




Mr RUDD:
  I move:


That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent Ms J I Bishop (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) speaking in reply to the ministerial statement for a period not exceeding 13½ minutes.


Question agreed to.

",HoR,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Syria and Iran</title>,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,13,1,speech
"Bishop, Julie, MP",LP,2012-02-15,"



Ms JULIE BISHOP
 (Curtin—Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (17:26):  I thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs for facilitating, via this ministerial statement, this opportunity to speak again to the House on the issue of Syria and also Iran. Since speaking on this issue previously I have had the opportunity to meet with the Syrian charge in my office and to express to him directly the views of the coalition, as articulated in my response to the ministerial statement last week.


The world is rightly aghast at the ongoing violence in Syria. Ongoing reports of indiscriminate killing of unarmed civilians, including women and children, are abhorrent. There is a solution to this crisis. President Assad can order his troops to stop shooting and shelling the Syrian people. He does not need a United Nations Security Council resolution or, indeed, a General Assembly resolution to end the violence. He can step aside and allow a civilian government to form.


However, the situation may have approached or gone beyond the point where a negotiated settlement is possible, due to the ongoing brutality of the Assad regime as it seeks to cling to power. There has been a serious escalation of the conflict in recent days, with the bombing of security compounds in the city of Aleppo and reports of 28 people killed. In the fog of this war the Assad regime has claimed the blasts were the work of so-called opposition terrorists, while opposition groups blame the regime itself. There have been further reports suggesting that al-Qaeda played a role in the attacks, although the truth may never be known. In addition, a senior military officer within the regime were shot dead outside his Damascus residence over the weekend, in a major breakdown of security within the regime's stronghold. This must have sent shock waves through an already volatile regime.


Given the dire situation facing Syria, it is deeply troubling that Syria's al-Assad regime has 'categorically rejected' a resolution of the Arab League which would have allowed for the deployment of a peacekeeping mission to end the cycle of violence in the country. After voting with China to veto a United Nations Security Council resolution on Syria, Russia has once again undermined international efforts to put pressure on the regime. The European Union nations supported the Arab League plan, while Russia is reportedly of the view that peacekeepers should only be deployed after the violence has stopped. The Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, has reportedly made the claim that the main stumbling blocks to a ceasefire are the opposition groups in Syria, which he claims are out of control. While peacekeepers would generally only be deployed after a ceasefire has been brokered, this would arguably be much easier to achieve if there were a united effort to isolate the regime. This would require Russia and, in particular, Iran to halt all forms of support and supplies of arms.


The Arab League has continued to show commendable leadership on this issue with its decision to suspend economic links with the Syrian regime. The fact that the regime fears a ceasefire appears to be indicative of its weakness, in that it fears any lessening of pressure on the Syrian people. This could confirm the assessment of Syrian military defector General Mustafa Ahmad al-Sheikh, who has claimed that the regime is close to collapse and has said:


The situation is now very dangerous and threatens to explode across the whole region, like a nuclear reaction.


China has continued to take a conciliatory line, with foreign ministry representative Liu Weimin reportedly saying:


China hopes all relevant parties can keep dialogue and communication to play a positive and constructive role in politically resolving the Syrian issue and easing the country's tension.


United Kingdom Foreign Secretary William Hague has also expressed concern about the deployment of Western forces to Syria, but did not rule out supporting a peacekeeping mission involving Arab League nations. He said:


I don't see the way forward in Syria as being Western boots on the ground, in any form, including in peacekeeping form, but of course if such a concept could be made viable we will be supporting it in all the usual ways.


While Russia has played the highly questionable role of spoiler in many efforts to achieve peace, the actions of Iran are more disturbing, with reports that hundreds of elite troops are on the ground in Syria.


There is no way to know precisely whether these forces are directly involved in the crackdown on civilians, however it is safe to assume that they are providing logistical support at the very least. One thing is certain and that is that these forces are not working to bring peace to the nation and are acting in support of a regime that has lost all legitimacy to rule. These Iranian forces must be immediately withdrawn from Syria. Similarly, Russia must halt all arms sales and any other forms of economic cooperation with the regime.


One complicating factor in recent days has been the attempted intervention of al-Qaeda, whose leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, has released a video message in support of the uprising. The motivation of al-Qaeda is not clear, but we can safely assume it is not in support of the eventual formation of a democratic civilian government. It may be that al-Qaeda merely sees the opportunity to sow the seeds of chaos in the hope that it spreads beyond the borders of Syria and leads to an environment of greater lawlessness within which al-Qaeda can flourish.


The solution to this violence is in the bloodied hands of President Assad, who must call a halt to the attacks and allow for the formation of a civilian government. In recent days, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay, has described the situation in Syria as 'deplorable' and said the government had failed in one of its primary obligations, which is to protect its own people. The commissioner said:


I am very distressed that the continued ruthless repression and deliberate stirring of sectarian tensions might soon plunge Syria into civil war. The longer the international community fails to take action, the more the civilian population will suffer from countless atrocities.


While the situation in Syria adds to regional instability, Iran has been accused overnight of being behind attempted killings of Israeli diplomats in the Indian city of New Delhi and the capital of Georgia, Tbilisi. If true, this represents a serious escalation of the tensions between Iran and Israel. Israel has publicly accused Iran of orchestrating the attacks either through its proxy Hezbollah or directly through its own agents. Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is reportedly of the view:


Iran is behind these attacks. It is the biggest exporter of terror in the world.


Minister of Foreign Affairs Lieberman said overnight that Israel will not tolerate such attacks on its diplomats.


While US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has condemned the attacks, the United States has not yet, at the time of speaking, identified Iran as the suspected culprit. Iran has denied any involvement. The attack in New Delhi has left a 42-year-old female diplomat in a critical condition and reportedly involved the attachment of a magnetic bomb to the outside of her vehicle. The attack in Georgia failed when the bomb was detected on the car before it detonated and was defused.


The use of a magnetic bomb appears to be direct payback for the reported use of similar devices to assassinate Iranian scientists working on Iran's nuclear program. Tensions are rising rapidly in response to Iran's nuclear program as well as suspicions that it will lead to the development of a nuclear weapon. United States Secretary of Defence Leon Panetta recently said that he believed Israel would attack Iran, possibly within a couple of months. For Israelis, this is a question of their very survival, with the Iranian leadership regularly talking about wiping Israel off the map and worse.


Iran's defence strategy has been to try and convince the United States and Israel that an attack would cost more than either nation is prepared to pay. The key issue at present is the threat that Iran will close the Strait of Hormuz to traffic for oil tankers, which would have serious implications for the global economy, with about one-third of seaborne traded oil passing through the strait. There are questions about Iran's ability to close the strait for any significant length of time, particularly with the United States Fifth Fleet based in the Persian Gulf at Bahrain. However, Iran claims to have large stockpiles of shipping mines and has developed a range of missiles that could be used against shipping traffic. Iran has conducted extensive naval exercises in the Persian Gulf to showcase its fleet of smaller fast boats equipped with torpedoes that could be used to threaten the larger US warships.


While Iran would lack the ability to sustain open conflict against the United States for any length of time, there are fears that it has the capability to severely disrupt global oil supplies at a time when the world economy is particularly fragile. During recent discussions I have had with a number of international experts on strategic issues, concern was raised with me about the potential for an Israeli air strike against Iran's nuclear facilities. The concern was described as 'stepping onto the ladder of escalation' that could yield unpredictable results.


The solution to these growing tensions lies with the government of Iran. It must comply with all requests of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which last November called for a progress report on compliance by next month. The IAEA board of governors also agreed to a resolution titled 'Implementation of the NPT Safeguards Agreement and relevant provisions of the UN Security Council Resolutions in the Islamic Republic of Iran'. This resolution called on Iran to comply with all its obligations to the IAEA and to the conditions imposed by United Nations Security Council resolutions. While the IAEA board of governors continues to support a diplomatic solution to the problem of Iran's noncompliance, it is clear from the statements of Secretary Panetta that the United States believes the time is fast approaching when Israel may decide to launch a strike against Iran.


The situation has not been helped by Iranian President Ahmadinejad, who said this week that he would be announcing further nuclear developments in coming days and weeks. That makes the issue of Iran's compliance critical to not only Iran and Israel but also the rest of the world. The coalition joins with the government in urging the Iranian leadership to meet all its obligations. It is imperative that Iran prove that its nuclear activities are only for peaceful and civilian purposes. That will require it to be open and transparent with IAEA inspectors to ensure it can adequately explain all its nuclear activities.


Australia has continued to play its role with the international community to bring pressure to bear on the Iranian regime. A range of sanctions have been imposed since 2006, consistent with the requirements of the United Nations Security Council, but a range of autonomous sanctions have also been imposed. A comprehensive range of sanctions relate to arms sales, financial transactions, dealings with certain Iranian companies, travel bans and more.


Iran's typical response has been belligerence, with threats to close the Strait of Hormuz and threats against Israel. The international community is motivated by the urgent need to find a peaceful resolution to this brewing crisis. The implications of military conflict are too terrible to contemplate and it is important that the international community continues to be united in its condemnation of Iran's provocative behaviour and united in efforts to ensure that Iran complies with their international obligations.

"Marino, Nola, MP",LP,2012-02-15,"



Ms MARINO
 (Forrest—Opposition Whip) (17:38):  I rise to speak on the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2011. In spite of its title, this bill is not aimed at achieving sound reform, jobs growth or productivity improvements in an industry that is extremely important not only in my electorate of Forrest but right around the nation. The coalition are proud to support Australians who have a go, who take a risk, who invest and who employ people in small, medium and larger businesses. We believe that every Australian, whether an employer or an employee, deserves to be able go to their workplace and operate in a safe and lawful environment.


However, in direct contrast, the Labor government, as indicated by this bill, does not believe that Australian business owners should have the right to run their own businesses. I suppose that is not really surprising. One only has to examine the power structure of the Labor Party to see who pulls the strings. When the current Prime Minister arbitrarily axed the previous Prime Minister, current union leaders boasted about their role in that axing. This is a very long way, unfortunately, from the historical union representation that has a long and originally proud history in this country of raising the standards for Australian workers. But this proud history has been corrupted by the politics of union leaders and Labor Party ambition. What started as a great push for workers' rights two centuries ago has become a fight for left-wing factional power and a platform for political rather than social ambition. That is the sad inheritance of the modern Labor Party and one of the main reasons that the union membership has plummeted in recent times.


According to figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the proportion of employees who were trade union members in their main job decreased from 20 per cent in August 2009 to 18 per cent in August 2010. This represents a fall of 47,300. For the majority of the 20th century, however, at least 40 per cent of workers were covered by unions and some 20 years ago the figure was one in every two workers. However, instead of looking after the interests of those workers, a number of unions have been looking after an elitist left-wing level of union leaders and their political ambitions.


Of course, not all unions have gone down this path and a number remain that genuinely have the interests of their members at heart. An example is the police union in my home state of Western Australia, which has a long history of member advocacy as its primary goal. Sadly, for some unions, this is no longer the case. As we look into history, the building industry specifically deserves very careful attention. I refer to the BLF, the Builders Labourers Federation.


It took a royal commission to expose what this front-line union had become. The Winneke royal commission identified major problems with the actions of the BLF and as a result it was deregistered by the Hawke Labor government in 1986—this was a Labor government and a Labor leader deregistering the BLF. Members might think that, following the Winneke royal commission and the deregistration of the BLF in 1986, the construction sector unions would have altered their practices and the union would return to the role of looking after building workers in an open, honest and accountable manner. But how wrong those members would be.


The 2003 building industry royal commission, conducted by the Hon. THR Cole, found that despite a corrupt history no lessons had been learned and no change was in evidence. The Cole Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry, 2001-03, was established by the Australian government to inquire into and report upon alleged misconduct in the building and construction industry in Australia. The commission articulated a case that the industry was characterised by lawlessness in the conduct of industrial relations. Our Parliamentary Library report on the Cole commission stated that:


The industry was described by the Royal Commission as being characterised by widespread disregard for the rule of law. It found widespread use of inappropriate industrial pressure, disregard for enterprise bargaining and the freedom of association laws leading to unlawful strikes, as well as widespread use of 'inappropriate' payments. Thus:


31 individuals were referred for possible criminal prosecution


392 instances of unlawful conduct committed by individuals, unions and employers, which include 30 findings of unlawful conduct by employers mainly for strike pay breaches and freedom of association breaches, (i.e. that the employer agreed to a 'no ticket no start' policy operating at a site), and


25 different types of unlawful conduct and 90 types of inappropriate conduct.


The construction industry in Western Australia specifically was described by the royal commission as being 'marred by unlawful and inappropriate conduct' with 'a culture of fear, intimidation, coercion and industrial unrest'. The royal commission made 230 findings of unlawful conduct in WA, the majority of which were against CFMEU officials and organisers for intimidation and threats of violence, breaches of FOA, secondary boycott and right-of-entry provisions, trespass and interference. CFMEU officials Kevin Reynolds and Joe McDonald are cited as repeat offenders. Sadly the BLF is not the only example of union focus shifting from looking after employees to seeking political power. However, it is probably only the most obvious.


Here we are again debating industrial relations in the building industry. The bill before us is cloaked in Labor spin as one that targets the protection of workers. But we know the reality—that this bill is about union power over business owners and managers. We know that the Labor government does not believe that Australian business owners should have the right or freedom to run their own businesses. This is the real reason we are here and the real reason that Labor members are vocal in their support—not because they are looking after the interests of workers but because they are looking after, or appear to be looking after, the political interests of union leaders. After all, preselections are on the line. BLF secretary David Hanna was quoted in the Australian on 16 December 2011:


Workers will continue to take whatever action, be it legal or illegal, to get their message across.


No wonder members of the building and construction industry are concerned about the consequences of what is contained in this bill and what effect this will have on their ability to run their businesses and do the jobs they are there to do. This industry is important right across Australia. It employs one million Australians and contributes 10 per cent to our GDP. So any impacts will be felt right across our economy. What we saw in that statement may well be what is ahead, as a result of measures contained in this bill.


As I said when I started this speech, every Australian, whether they are an employer or an employee, deserves to be able to go to their workplace and operate in a safe and lawful environment. I fear that members opposite do not support this. The Labor government is repeatedly punishing the people who have a go, who invest their own money, who borrow against their homes and who employ millions of Australians and are helping others to get ahead. There is now a widespread belief that this Labor government is anti-business. I am concerned that they will sacrifice hardworking business owners through policies like the ones in this bill, for the express purpose of enhancing the power of union leaders and definitely not with the aim of achieving sound reform, jobs growth, productivity improvements and economic growth.

Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (17:49):  I welcome the opportunity to speak briefly on the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2011. I have just listened to the member for Forrest. It is very easy to paint a one-sided view of a situation, as she has just done. I am sure workers in the construction industry around Australia would willingly come into this place and tell a story different from the one we have just heard from the member for Forrest. I am well aware that, in the Cole royal commission, their view was that their voice had not been properly heard. I am not in a position to judge that one way or the other but I am in a position to make the comment on their behalf that they felt they did not get a fair hearing. From the transcripts which are available, I believe the record will show that they are probably correct.


I come back to some of the very issues related to this bill, to that commission and to the new legislation, which touch upon the very reasons this legislation is good legislation and the reasons this government believes in fairness for workers and industry across this country. I make this comment with respect to the comments by the member for Forrest and others when they talk about the influence of some of the unions, making allegations as to corruption or similar by people involved in them. It takes two parties to get involved in corrupt activity. It is not simply a one-sided affair. Yet when you look at the record, it appears that the focus is always towards one group only and that is the workers.


I believe the extraordinary attack on workers' rights by the Howard government was a key factor in the ultimate downfall of the Howard government and in Prime Minister Howard's loss of his own seat. Like Prime Minister Stanley Bruce before him, who lost his seat in 1929, Prime Minister Howard had turned his back on Australian workers. Peter Reith's waterfront debacle of the late 1990s, the Work Choices legislation and the establishment of the Office of the Australian Building and Construction Commission were part of a warped ideology to turn back the clock on fair working conditions that had been hard won over decades of struggles and to destroy unions. It is as simple as that. Those attacks were un-Australian and Australians knew it. The members opposite know that as well. That is why they will not mention the term Work Choices any more. Their leader wants the term 'dead, buried and cremated', at least in name; I do not believe in substance.


Australians are pretty easygoing people, but they believe in a fair go. The ABCC legislation was everything but that. It was legislation that was not only an assault on workers' conditions but an assault on human rights—human rights which Australia has agreed to as a signatory to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Australians have fought and died for the freedoms and fairness that Work Choices, the ABCC and the waterfront events sought to take away from them. When the ABCC was established in 2005, following the Cole royal commission, it was intended to intimidate and break organised labour in Australia.


The Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2011 creates the Office of the Fair Work Building Industry Inspectorate to regulate the building and construction industry. This new agency will replace the Office of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner. It renames the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005 as the Fair Work (Building Industry) Act 2011 and either repeals or amends many of the BCII Act's provisions. The bill implements key recommendations of the Transition to Fair Work Australia for the building and construction industry report by the Hon. Murray Wilcox QC. It is interesting that the member for Forrest referred to the Cole royal commission but made no reference to the report by the Hon. Murray Wilcox, who also makes some very pertinent comments regarding the ABCC legislation. Conveniently, they were left out.


With the exception of minor non-policy changes such as the inclusion of changes resulting from amendments to the Acts Interpretation Act, the bill is the same as that introduced during the previous parliament. The bill removes existing higher penalties for building industry participants for breaches of industrial law and introduces safeguards in relation to the power to compulsorily obtain information and documents. The bill creates the office of Independent Assessor, who may, on application by stakeholders, determine that compulsory information-gathering powers will not apply to a project. The new regulator will also provide information, advice and assistance to all building industry participants regarding their rights and obligations under law, as well as seek to improve the standard of occupational health and safety in the building and construction industry. The bill includes a three-year sunset provision for the compulsory information-gathering powers. A review will occur prior to the sunset of compulsory information-gathering powers. I note that the bill does not impact on the provisions that establish the Office of the Federal Safety Commissioner and the Occupational Health And Safety Accreditation Scheme.


Criticism of the former Howard government's ABCC has not just come from the labour movement in Australia and the wider Australian community. There has also been international condemnation of the coercive powers of the ABCC and its targeting of building unions. The International Labour Organisation, the United Nations body charged with looking after workers' rights, has raised its concerns on a number of occasions. The ILO's Committee of Experts is an eminent body of labour jurists. Early last year, this committee circulated the following statement:


… the manner in which the ABCC carries out its activities seems to have led to the exclusion of workers in the building and construction industry from the protection that the labour inspection system ought to secure for these workers under the applicable laws …


The ILO's concerns were very well illustrated by the Ark Tribe case in South Australia. I am reasonably familiar with that case because I followed it from day one. The Ark Tribe trial was pivotal in further raising community awareness of the ABCC's potential to encroach on the industrial and human rights of Australian workers.


In 2008, Ark Tribe attended a safety meeting at a construction site in Adelaide. At that meeting, ongoing safety concerns at the site were discussed by workers and a union investigation into conditions was carried out before workers returned to their work. The ABCC then summoned Ark Tribe to a meeting in order to determine the legality of workers' actions. When Ark Tribe refused to attend, prosecutors for the ABCC commenced legal proceedings against him. Ark Tribe was not a union official or a union delegate. A large protest was held when court proceedings took place. Several hundred people were present for the first day of the trial on 15 June 2010, including prominent international civil rights campaigners Gerry Conlon and Paddy Hill. Industrial rights are, after all, civil rights—that is, human rights.


On 24 November 2010, Ark Tribe was cleared of the charges against him—charges which should never have been laid. Ark Tribe should never have been subjected to the intimidation and injustice which he had been put through. I am pleased to see that the courts came to the same conclusion and cleared him of those charges.


In 2007, the government made a commitment that, if elected, it would replace the ABCC with a new body to provide a balanced framework for cooperative and productive workplace relations in the building and construction industry.


The construction industry contains unique challenges for both employers and employees. Nobody denies that. Too many Australians die on building and construction sites each and every year and hundreds more are injured, and that has been the case for decades and decades. Building workers have been exposed workplace dangers associated with unsafe work practices, unsafe worksites and unsafe building materials. Poor scaffolding, working from heights, the danger of structural collapse, exposure to dust, asbestos, hazardous chemicals and even extreme weather conditions have taken their toll on the lives of construction workers and on their families for decades and decades. Indeed, much of Australia has literally been built on the blood, sweat and tears of construction workers. Labor supports a strong building industry regulator to ensure lawful conduct by all parties. But it does not support laws that deny workers basic rights, like being represented by a lawyer of their choice.


The context for changes was further developed late last year when Qantas Airways grounded its fleet. In the future we may well reflect on this incident as an important moment for industrial relations in Australia. Currently, if Qantas's action is held to be illegal industrial action under the Fair Work Act, the maximum fine it would face would be one-third of the maximum fine the CFMEU could face for taking illegal industrial action on building sites. Where is the fairness in that? The widespread public criticism of Qantas's action suggests that our industrial relations body should be designed to achieve greater conciliation instead of having coercive or litigious functions.


In conclusion, I have tried to summarise the importance of this bill, and I know that there is still some concern with it in respect of the coercive powers. I also know that those powers have been limited to the extent that there have to be certain processes before they can be applied. I believe that a reasonable balance has been struck in respect to them. However, I believe that this bill corrects an injustice that currently exists in Australian industrial laws, whereby some people are treated as lesser than other people—in other words, there is currently discrimination in the laws that apply to workers in this country, and this bill seeks to rectify that. I commend the bill to the House.

"Tehan, Dan, MP",LP,2012-02-15,"



Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon) (18:01):  I rise to oppose the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2011, and I take issue with the previous speaker. The bill is not about trying to outlaw organised labour in this country. It is about trying to deal with illegal activity by organised labour in this country, and in particular in the building industry.


The bill will do three things: it is going to hurt Australia's productivity; it is going to set up a new body that, sadly, will be a toothless tiger; and, it will give more power to the new workplace relations minister, which is like putting a kid in charge of the candy store, or, to put it another way, like putting a factional boss in charge of determining the Labor leadership—it will be a debacle.


Let us turn to the issue of productivity. The ABCC has been a tough cop on the beat, but it has required a tough cop on the beat to deal with the issues identified by a royal commission. The inquiry that led to the formation of the ABCC was not a normal one—it was a royal commission. Since the ABCC was set up we have seen building and construction industry productivity increase by 10 per cent; it has provided an annual economic welfare gain of $5.5 billion per year; it has reduced inflation by 1.2 per cent and increased GDP by 1.5 per cent; and the number of working days lost annually per 1,000 employees in the construction industry has fallen from 224 in 2004 to 24 in 2006. At the same time, building costs have fallen by 20 to 25 per cent and long project delays have been dramatically reduced.


At a time when the Australian economy is struggling, due to the incompetence of this Labor government, the last thing we need is another step in the direction of lessening Australia's productivity. That is what this bill will do. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry summed it up quite nicely in the letter they wrote to the secretary of the Senate Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Committee when this bill was being looked at. They took the opportunity to thank the committee for having the inquiry and noted:


The outcome of the Bill is a matter of particular significance, not just for the building and construction sector, but for the broader Australian economy. Approximately one million Australians work in the building and construction industry. Their output contributes around 10% of Australia's GDP.


This issue is dealing with 10 per cent of Australia's GDP. You want to harm the productivity in 10 per cent of Australia's GDP. This decision will lead to long-term consequences for the Australian community. You should think again about having kowtowed to the Greens and having agreed to go down this path.


This was emphasised by the minister in his second reading speech on 3 November 2011 when he indicated:


The building and construction industry remains a critical sector of our economy, with immediate and direct impact on jobs, growth and productivity. This was particularly so during the global economic recession, during which the government's Nation Building and Jobs Plan ensured that the Australian economy remained one of the strongest in the developed world.


The minister continued:


The government understands that the industry contains unique challenges for both employers and employees, and as a result we have always supported a strong building industry regulator to ensure lawful conduct by all parties.




The minister then went on for a few more paragraphs detailing why the industry is so important.



However, the only effective response has come from the establishment of the Australian Building and Construction Commission. This concerns dealing with the illegal activities that have existed in this industry. It has had a dramatic impact on the industry and on the sorts of behaviour and attitudes we have referred to. The impact has been quantified in a range of different ways, in particular by significant reductions in lost time in the industry and big improvements in productivity and efficiency, estimated at more than $5.5 billion per annum.


The decision taken by the Howard government to set up the ABCC was not a liked one. To have a royal commission look into an industry requires a lot of evidence that something drastic needs to occur. That is exactly what the Cole royal commission found. What has been the result of the Cole royal commission? We have seen the ABCC set up and we have seen huge productivity increases come out of the sector. But we should not now say to ourselves, 'Okay, the job is done,' because the evidence is still there that it is not. There have been productivity increases, but all the alarm bells are there. If we reduce the amount of regulation in the industry at the moment then the illegal activity will grow once again, and, sadly, we are seeing examples of that in Victoria, and we have seen it in the last few years. Just when we are getting on top of this issue, what does this Labor government want to do? It wants to step in and put at risk all the gains that we have made.


Getting to the second point, what they are replacing the ABCC with is a toothless tiger. I will turn to what the Australian Industry Group had to say about this.



A government member:  Who have you got?




Mr TEHAN:
  We have got ACCI; we have got the Australia Industry Group. What I am trying to do here is give a balanced perspective.



Government members interjecting—




Mr TEHAN:
  All right, so we should not have business in Australia, should we?




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr KJ Thomson
):  Order! Members on my right will cease interjecting. The member for Wannon has the call.




Mr TEHAN:
  I am happy to listen to those interjecting from the other side that we should just have the union bosses ruling the country. They have done a great job with their factional people here in this parliament, haven't they! Look at the unholy mess they have got us in at the moment. We have got a Prime Minister who cannot be trusted, we have got the Minister for Foreign Affairs trying to seek her job and we have got a factional impasse because no-one knows who should lead the country.



Government members interjecting—




Mr TEHAN:
  That is right. We should just let the big union bosses rule everything! What we are trying to do here is make sure that illegal activity by organised labour does not get out of control, especially in the building and construction industry. What are you going to replace the ABCC with? Sadly, a toothless tiger. The AiG says:


The compulsory examination powers are needed at the present time as much as ever. While the reforms introduced after the Royal Commission addressed the unlawful and inappropriate conduct that permeated the industry, industrial unrest and disputation has been steadily increasing in the industry and damaging and unproductive industrial relations practices have been creeping back onto building and construction sites across Australia.


They go on to quote the foreword to the annual report of the ABCC for the financial year ending 30 June 2011, in which the ABC Commissioner, Leigh Johns, identified that:




During 2010-11, unlawful industrial disputes, the traditional ‘bread-and-butter’ work of the ABCC, continued to occur at levels that underscored the need for strong enforcement of workplace laws. The pernicious effects of unlawful industrial action are unacceptable, particularly so on projects of social and national significance like the Monash Freeway, the Melbourne Markets relocation, Gold Coast University Hospital or the Wonthaggi Desalination Plant.



One only has to look at the record days lost on the desalinisation plant in Victoria to see why the ABCC needs to remain and needs to continue to do its job.


The new body that has been established within Fair Work Australia to replace the incredibly successful Office of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner is not an independent body. So not only will it be toothless but it is not an independent body. It is controlled by the minister. And who is our new minister? Where does he come from? How independent will he be? How objective will he be? We have got the kid back in control of the candy store. That is what this bill will do. What we will see is a complete imbalance in the way these issues are dealt with. The sad fact is that ultimately that will lead to a productivity decline in this country. That is the last thing that we need at the moment. Our manufacturing sector is about to get hit by one of the biggest hits to their productivity that you could imagine—the carbon tax. This is especially so in the state of Victoria because it is going to impact on power, which is the competitive advantage that our industries and especially our manufacturers in Victoria have over our international competitors. Combine that now with this bill.


Those opposite, and I have been listening to their speeches as they have gone on, have said that all this will do is redress an imbalance. Yet no-one has been through and systematically examined what the Cole royal commission found—the intimidation and the thuggery, and the fact that if there was not some sort of body set up with powers to deal directly with it that none of this would stop. Even though we have had the ABCC there, we have still seen examples of this occurring. So why won't the government allow it to finish its job? Why don't they make sure that it has all been stamped out? It is illegal activity that we are trying to get rid of here. It is not, as those opposite say, designed to get rid of organised labour in this country. It is designed to get rid of the illegal activity. Those on the other side should be supporting the work that the ABCC is doing, because the more we can do to stamp out this type of activity the better it will be across the nation for organised labour in general. The coalition strongly opposes the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2011. In many ways the title of the bill is a complete misnomer. Sadly, at a time when we should be looking to do everything we can to increase the productivity of this nation, it will do the exact opposite. It will set up a body which they have deliberately given no teeth to. Basically, it will become an irrelevant bureaucracy—another one created by the government. Not only that; it gives power not to an independent body but back to the minister and, as we know, the new minister is going to find it very difficult to be independent and objective. He will be dealing with his union mates and he will be conflicted in trying to continue to stamp out illegal activity. I would hope the starting point that we can all agree on when it comes to this bill would be that there is no place for illegal activity anywhere in the Australian economy and in particular the building and construction industry.

"Jones, Stephen, MP",ALP,2012-02-15,"



Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (18:16):  My contribution to this debate on the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2011 will be brief. I have to observe that the contributions from those on the other side have been really revealing about what lies in their hearts and their obsessions when it comes to industrial relations. The bill has a long history, dating back to at least 2001, when in the lead-up to an election the then Prime Minister, John Howard, established the Cole Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry, whose singular purpose was to demonise the union movement in general and the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union in particular. The government never really made any secret that this was its singular objective in commissioning the Cole royal commission. Unfortunately, the government's real objective was to ensure that the evidence would be horrifying and that it would assist it in moving through its next raft of industrial relations changes after the 2001 election. Unfortunately for the government, the evidence before the commission was at times unhelpful to that cause.


The evidence before the commission found that by world standards we have a very efficient construction industry, and in some respects we are leading by way of world's best practice.



Ms O'Dwyer interjecting—




Mr STEPHEN JONES:
  My friend in the chamber makes the observation that there were no convictions arising out of the royal commission. It did find that there was corruption in the industry and a significant amount of corruption by certain employers within the industry. It was a tough and rough industry and from time to time some practices went on that would be condemned by all members of this House. But to say that poor practice was solely the result of union activity is a complete furphy and a misrepresentation of any of the evidence that was put before the Cole royal commission.


It also found—and this never got much attention and certainly never got any action from the Howard government—that there were systemic breaches and systemic failures in adhering to occupational health and safety standards and regulations within the building industry. If the Howard government had put as much energy into chasing that rabbit down that hole, then there would probably be a few more workers in this industry and workplaces who had not suffered the terrible injuries that occur on an all too often basis within the building and construction industry.


The debate in this chamber today shows the obsession of the Liberal Party and the coalition with harsh industrial relations laws, union bashing and their love of Work Choices. Whilst they have attempted to put them in the closet from time to time, when debates like this come before the House they cannot help themselves. We have seen that from the frantic, if not hysterical, debate from the member for Wannon. What is absolutely astounding is that the loudest voices and the most ill-informed comments, I wager, have come most often from those members of the House who have never been anywhere near a building site and who do not know what it is like to work in the building and construction industry—which, as I have said, is a tough industry.


I am pleased to be speaking in favour of the legislation before this House, but I will make one qualification to that. The legislation abolishes the Australian Building and Construction Commission and absorbs those functions into the functions of Fair Work Australia. It ensures that there will still be a tough cop on the beat. It ensures that there will still be strong regulatory arrangements in the building and construction industry, extending beyond the obsessions of those on the other side but going directly to issues of health and safety and to issues of employer breaches and scams that regularly affect subcontractors within the industry. The legislation ensures these practices are wiped out as well.


If I have a reservation, it stems from my background in the law. My concern is that the bill does not yet deal with the issue of compelled evidence. I understand that this is the result of commitments that we made in the lead-up to the 2010 election and, as a member of this place and this party, I stand squarely behind the policy commitments and the provisions of this bill. But I do raise the reservation—and it stems from hundreds of years of legal practice—that courts should be very wary indeed about accepting the probity and the availability of compelled evidence. If we have learnt anything over hundreds of years of legal practice, there are deep concerns within the legal community of accepting the probative value of compelled evidence. I am hoping that some time in the future, with the experience of the new functions being absorbed within Fair Work Australia, and improved practices within the building and construction industry, we may be able to revisit this matter in this place in the interests of all. I commend the legislation to the House.

"O'Dwyer, Kelly, MP",LP,2012-02-15,"



Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins) (18:22):  The Prime Minister made a number of promises to the Australian people before the 2007 and 2010 elections. She promised that she would be economically prudent, and yet her Treasurer has delivered four deficits of more than $167 billion in total and a gross debt ceiling of $250 billion. She promised not to introduce a carbon tax only days before the election and then broke that promise. She promised that that no Australian worker would be worse off as a result of her industrial relations laws and that her reforms would not have a negative impact on productivity or our nation's economy—another broken promise. The government's changes have wound back the industrial relations clock, not just to a time before Work Choices but to a time before Hawke and Keating. The Prime Minister also promised that she would have a 'tough cop on the beat' in the building and construction industry. Today, I rise to speak on the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2011 that is before this House. This bill breaks that last promise, the latest broken promise in a long list of the Prime Minister's broken promises.


When the Prime Minister brought in her Fair Work Act she said it would 'increase productivity'. We hear from the Prime Minister and Treasurer on a repeated basis that productivity is the key to this nation's prosperity and that we must increase our productivity to ensure that our nation grows. We on this side of the chamber agree with this. Productivity-enhancing reform is, as the Chairman of the Productivity Commission has so rightly stated, 'the mainstay of economic progress'. No doubt we will hear again from the other side of the chamber that this legislation is also supposedly 'productivity enhancing'. Yet nothing could be further from the truth.


In the September quarter we saw that that GDP per hour worked was lower than in the last quarter of the coalition government. This is a decline, not simply a slowing in the rate of growth. The coalition government delivered an increase of more than 25 per cent in GDP per hours worked in our 11 years. The Labor-Greens government has seen a fall in GDP per hours worked in less than four years. Annual productivity growth has gone from on average 1.2 per cent during our time in government to -0.9 per cent during the Labor-Greens government.


A tough cop on the beat is critical in the construction and building industry. The Office of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner is that tough cop on the beat. It was born out of the Cole royal commission which, 10 years ago, investigated the lawlessness, thuggery, intimidation and corruption that existed as part of the entrenched culture on construction sites—a culture that saw itself as above the law and, in the words of the commission 'flagrantly' breached the law without any thought of consequence. Examples brought before the commission ranged from unlawful entry of sites by union officials to violence, obstruction of building sites and payments by builders to the unions for industrial peace. One such example in WA saw a builder pay more than $1.5 million for so-called casual tickets to WA's CFMEU. When the Cole commission followed the money trail it could only trace $500,000—the rest of the money to the CFMEU simply disappeared. These examples were commonplace and have more in common with organised crime than a 21st century construction industry. This culture significantly increases the cost of building and the flow-on economic effects are enormous.


In the time that the ABCC has been operating the benefits of a strong watchdog for the construction industry are clear. According to research undertaken by KPMG Econtech, since the inception of the ABCC productivity in the sector has risen by 10 per cent, there has been an economic welfare gain of $5.5 billion per year, inflation has been reduced by 1.2 per cent, GDP has increased by 1.5 per cent and it has helped facilitate significant reductions in days lost through industrial action.


Significantly, the powers of the ABCC have led to successful court action, with more than $2.5 in penalties imposed by the courts in the last financial year. Most recently, two unions and a number of union officials have been fined more than $1.3 million by the courts for obstruction, violence and intimidation on the Westgate Bridge project. Yet this Labor-Greens government plans to unwind these economic and workplace reforms by shifting power away from the independent umpire back to the unions. The legislation before this House will make a eunuch of the ABCC and will guarantee three things:  a decrease in productivity; that the unions dictate the terms on which the construction industry operates; and a return of the old school practices of delay, intimidation and union payoffs for industrial peace and increased costs.


Like everyone in this chamber I meet regularly with people from different industries. At a recent meeting I was told by several builders that they had been coerced into 'advertising' in a union magazine. They told me this was standard practice so as to avoid their sites being shut down through guerrilla tactics or equipment failing to turn up. This, they considered, was  a cost of doing business.


The abolition of the ABCC in its current form will ensure that some of the more nefarious activities will return in force. I wish to highlight five key ways in which this legislation will damage the construction industry. Firstly, the bill strips power from the ABCC's replacement body, the Building Industry Inspectorate, by enshrining in law that the minister has the power to issue directions as to how, where and when it should go about performing its functions. Given the serious unanswered questions about potential government interference in the Craig Thomson saga, this is a retrograde step.


Secondly, by lifting the test for what is a 'lawful' strike we will start to see an increase in trivial strikes action, the kind of strikes that were rampant at the Wonthaggi desalination plant.


Thirdly, reducing the penalty for unlawful strikes will remove the disincentive for unlawful industrial action. We can see through the Westgate Bridge case that there is a need for tough penalties for those who do not comply with the law, with over $1.3 million of fines being ordered by the ABCC. In that case, workers needed to be moved by an ex-army troop carrier in and out of the site to ensure their safety. We should never forget employers are also entitled to their rights, including their right to conduct business without the threat of intimidation or reprisal. Employees are also entitled to their rights—the right to a safe workplace free from threats and intimidation. The unions would have us believe that the right of unions to go about their business should be paramount, but it is not. Rights are not a one-way street.


The increase in red tape for compulsory information-gathering powers and a sunset clause after five years will see these powers used rarely, if at all, and a return to retribution actions taken against anyone who speaks out about the culture on construction sites. The fact that the sunset clause will not even be reviewed before being removed indicates that the real motivations behind these changes are to silence critics of union thuggery, violence and intimidation. Reduction of building inspectorate powers to investigate by allowing such powers to be switched off means that the building inspectorate will not have the freedom and independence to investigate all complaints.


Make no mistake; this legislation is simply to allow the Prime Minister to pander to the union leaders that installed her and nothing to do with making Australia a better or more prosperous nation. The union campaign in support of the election of this Labor government in 2007 amounted to more than $36,430,588 in direct donations and political expenditure. In 2010 it amounted to $24,578,719. The Greens member for Melbourne, Adam Bandt, received more than $360,000 across both elections as a direct donation from the CFMEU, ETU and AMWU. Labor and the Greens are not interested in maintaining law and order on work sites and improving the economic welfare of the nation but are instead keen, through this legislation, to pay back their union masters.


While I do not doubt that Labor will continue to receive the hard earned money of union members, such as those from the Health Services Union, the Greens pretend that they are on a higher moral plane. If the member for Melbourne and the Greens leader, Bob Brown, were true to their high-minded rhetoric and so-called high standards regarding political donations, they ought to hand this money back. But I bet they will not. The Greens simply set standards for others, never for themselves.




Mr Bandt:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: it cannot be parliamentary conduct in this place to allege someone has received sums of money that they have not received.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  I must admit I have only just arrived in the chair. I will just say to the member for Higgins that, if she is going to make an allegation about someone, she should do it by a substantive motion.




Ms O'DWYER:
  The member for Melbourne can correct the record after question time if he feels that he has been misrepresented. I will continue. The Greens simply set standards for others, never for themselves. The leader of the Greens and the member for Melbourne talk about rights, but will not ensure the rights of workers to be free from thuggery and intimidation on building and construction sites.


The coalition has a proud record of increasing the productivity of the nation whilst maintaining world's-best-practice working conditions. I stand by our record of productivity gains on the waterfront. I stand by the productivity gains that the ABCC was making in the construction industry. The unions and their political wing, the Labor Party, will consistently cry foul that any productivity gain equates to a reduction in labour standards. But I defy anyone in this chamber to name one other country that has working and wage conditions at the standard Australia has. We truly are the lucky country.


I do not stand alone in pointing out the flaws in the government's plan to abolish the ABCC. It is not just this side of the chamber that has been sounding the warning bell on what this bill would mean for industrial disputation and increased cost in the construction industry. The government's favourite business adviser, the CEO of the Australian Industry Group, Heather Ridout, warned:


Unless a strong, well-resourced regulator and strong legislation is maintained, the risks associated with industrial lawlessness will again be priced into construction contracts, at great cost to project owners, including governments, and the Australian community,


Let me interpret that statement for the benefit of the House: the abolition of the ABCC will be a throwback to the old days of union militancy, industry disruption, kickbacks and intimidation in the construction industry.


Construction managers are also expressing concern over the fact that the abolition of the ABCC will have a particular impact on small to medium firms that cannot defend themselves from the aggressive actions of the more militant unions. Gerry Hanssen from Perth based construction firm Hanssen Pty Ltd has warned that, should the ABCC be abolished, the corruption and standover tactics will be 'back in a flash'.


As with the Treasurer's comments in relation to productivity, the government know how to talk the talk but so rarely do they walk the walk. In the time since the Prime Minister introduced the Fair Work Act, union activism and industrial disputation has increased. In the June 2011 quarter, working days lost due to disputation jumped from 19,700 in the previous quarter to 66,200. In the September quarter it increased again to a staggering 101,300 days. That is a 500 per cent increase in two quarters. This should concern all in this chamber and everyone who simply wants to contribute to building a stronger economy and a better nation. John Mullen, CEO of port operator Asciano Ltd, has cautioned that, 'In the current industrial climate, the country is going backwards.' These are all very dire predictions of where this country is heading and the abolition of the ABCC is a giant leap in that direction.


The government's response to any analysis or criticism of its Fair Work Act is to mount a scare campaign, flogging again the dead horse of Work Choices. But this is wearing thin, like so much of the government's rhetoric. It is plain that the industrial relations system in this country has gone backwards and unless the government starts to address the concerns that are raised by businesses, both big and small, and their employees, there will be ever-increasing industrial action, unrest at the workplace and decreased productivity. The best way the government can start to address this issue is by abandoning this legislation and keeping the ABCC with its full powers.

"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2012-02-15,"



Ms HALL
 (Shortland—Government Whip) (18:36):  It is easy to see that the member for Higgins is a strong advocate for Work Choices. If there is any reason that we should doubt the sincerity of those on the other side of this House, it is the contribution by the member for Higgins. Firstly, she made a point of saying that there will be no review, and it is in the legislation that there will be a review. That is not being completely up-front or honest with the people of Australia or with this House. She also made a statement that the member for Melbourne received a highly inflated amount of money from unions. Not true. Is it right that a person can come into this House and make statements that really are not true?


I believe this legislation is overdue. It will repeal the excesses of the Howard government's extreme industrial relations agenda. The Howard government's agenda was to crush unions and remove the right of workers, and the ABCC was the draconian body it established to do that in the construction industry. The ABCC legislation was the brainchild of Peter Reith, the industrial relations minister who used dogs and armed guards on the wharves of Australia in his government's efforts to crush the MUA.


The Labor government appreciates the role unions play in protecting the rights of workers in Australia, just as we appreciate the role employers play. Both parties are important. On this side of the House we know that unions provide protection for workers just as employer bodies protect the rights of employers. It is about balance—both sides make an enormous contribution.


I have listened to speakers on the other side of the House talk about increases in productivity: 10 per cent, the previous speaker said. Productivity increase is important. But over the same period of time there has been over a four per cent increase in the rate of death on construction sites. Is productivity to be gained at the price of lives? That is the question I have for the member for Higgins, who has now left the chamber. The Howard government did not recognise that there was a need for balance, and that is why it introduced its Work Choices law—which the member for Higgins is so supportive of—which attacked all workers' rights and was harsh and oppressive. It was the zealots in this parliament who sought to squash workers in the building industry and take away their basic rights.


The Howard government's ABCC saw workers like Ark Tribe dragged before the courts with a strong prospect of being imprisoned, simply because he refused to attend an interview in what was nothing more than an inquisition, whilst employers were given a slap over the wrist for breaching occupational health and safety laws. So it was really a double standard that was created under the ABCC. We had an increase in unsafe practices in workplaces, an increase in deaths and injuries. Everyone in this parliament knows that the construction industry is one of the four most dangerous industries, along with agriculture, forestry and mining. When you have a dangerous industry you really need to make sure that occupational health and safety laws are adhered to. Under the ABCC, safety practices were allowed to deteriorate. More workers were injured as a consequence. We on this side of the House realise that you need a balanced approach, and the changes we have before us today are about balance. However, on the other side of the chamber they only listen to the employers. They make no mention of safety; it is all about productivity. If they do mention safety they mention it not for the workers but as a way of denigrating workers in the construction industry. On this side of the House we value safety, we value workers and we value employers.


I will need to shorten my contribution to this debate to ensure that everybody has an opportunity to speak. I would like to briefly put before the House that this legislation is at the heart of the Labor Party's new workplace relations system. We understand that there are unique challenges within the construction industry and we think that this will balance those issues. The ABCC needs to be replaced. Any body that is as oppressive as the ABCC, any body that looks at only one side of the equation and any body that has led to workers ending up in court with the prospect of being jailed simply because they do not attend an interview is not a fair body. We are about fairness—we are about making sure that both employers' and workers' rights are respected.


The position that has been adopted by the government and incorporated in the legislation has been examined by independent legal expert Murray Wilcox QC, and his recommendations have been taken into account in the development of the legislation. There is a sunset clause that will come into play after three years, allowing time for the legislation to take effect. The opposition are not at all interested in a fair workplace. They are not interested in a workplace that has appropriate regulations, where all parties in the building industry have rights. They are interested in work sites in an industry in which it is a one-sided equation, where only the employers—the big companies—have a say; they are the only ones who have a right to be heard. Whilst we respect and appreciate the role that builders and employers play in the construction industry, we know that the construction industry is a very important part of our economy. We want to see it thrive. In my own electorate, it is a very important industry. But we also know that workers in that industry need protection. We know that, in any industry, laws that are so draconian that they are oppressive—in the way that those introduced by the Howard government, which established the ABCC, are—are bad laws.


You only have to come to this chamber and listen to members on the other side of the House distorting facts, not being totally truthful about what the legislation includes and not really portraying the true picture. To have a strong industry, a vibrant industry, you have to respect your workers. You have to have work sites that are safe. If you have an industry that knows it does not have to value its workers, if you have a construction industry where safety can be bypassed and if you have an industry in which workers are constantly in fear of retribution if they speak up, then you do not have things working properly. In saying that, I acknowledge that there are some very good employers who do not cut any corners.


I will leave my contribution there. I recommend and support the legislation before the parliament today and I will be very pleased to see the end of the ABCC.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2012-02-15,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (18:46):  There was a good reason the coalition established the Australian Building and Construction Commission in 2005. As with most things the Howard government did, it was based on solid evidence, a community and industry need, as well as on facts. That was the way of the Howard administration: clear, careful and considered policies thought through and implemented in the national interest.


In the past four-and-a-bit years, and certainly since the current Prime Minister took over, we have seen the complete opposite. Ill-conceived, knee-jerk decision making at the behest of minorities are anything but in the national interest. The Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2011 falls into this typical Labor category. The coalition strongly opposes this bill. We believe that every Australian, whether an employer or an employee, deserves to be able to go to their workplace and operate in an atmosphere where basic law and order is enforced. That goes without saying, and I take exception to the member for Shortland having a go at the coalition, saying that we do not believe in fairness or in safety. Those issues are paramount. We do not distort facts and we do not betray people.


The bill abolishes the body that ensures that law and order is enforced in the building and construction industry. We know why Labor is so keen to bring about an end to the ABCC, and that is because they are beholden to their union mates. They are beholden to the union hierarchy who use hard earned union fees to go on to work sites and into workplaces, close down productivity and put red tape and bureaucracy in front of employers.




Mr Laurie Ferguson:
  Why would they do that?




Mr McCORMACK:
  You can yell all you like but this is a fact. I was speaking to a Wagga Wagga builder tonight and he said: 'We don't need the thuggery of unions on our work sites. Unions are fine but everything should be in moderation. We want to be able to get on with doing what we do best and that is building homes, constructing buildings and doing it with good productivity and the ability to hire apprentices.' But this bill will not enable that productivity and will not enable builders to continue to hire workers in the sorts of ways that they are with the construction commission in place as it is now.


The commission was introduced in 2005 in response to the Cole royal commission, which found that the building and construction industry was rife with a complete disregard for the law. It catalogued more than 100 types of unlawful and inappropriate conduct. In today's workplaces and in this day and age we cannot have that. The member opposite might want that but the building industry cannot afford it and the national interest does not need it. The commission also found that existing regulatory bodies had insufficient powers and resources to enforce the law. That is why the Howard government introduced the Australian Building and Construction Commission. But Labor would demolish all that; the Prime Minister would demolish all that.


It is so interesting that the Prime Minister wants to do that. We have heard only today how the Prime Minister, when she was the shadow minister for health, said that insurance rebates were part of the family's budget, yet today we see the private health insurance rebate thrown straight out the window. When the Prime Minister was the education minister she took away independent youth allowance. And now the Prime Minister and the Labor Party want to take away the Australian Building and Construction Commission, which is doing its job and doing a very good job.


This bill will strip away the protections that enable workers to work in a safe and lawful environment. The replacement agency will, unfortunately, be a toothless tiger which will again roll out the red carpet to lawlessness, thuggery and violence. The new body that has been established within Fair Work Australia to replace the very successful office of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner will not be, and is not, an independent body. It is controlled by the minister. It is not going to be what we would call a strong cop on the beat.


We need to have measures in place that enable fairness and safety. That is why we have the Australian Building and Construction Commission. It is doing its job; it is doing a good job. There are examples upon examples of what happened prior to 2005, before the coalition took the tough decision to return the building and construction industry to law and order. In August 2001, the Howard government established the Cole royal commission to look into what was in fact happening in the building industry. Commissioner Cole reported in March 2003, and the report catalogued, as I said, more than 100 different types of unlawful conduct in that sector. The Cole royal commission examples included payments being made to the CFMEU in Western Australia of more than $1½ million for so-called casual tickets, which is basically money paid in return for industrial peace on sites where not all workers were members of the union. What a disgrace! The Cole commission found that, of the $1½ million that had been paid, only $500,000 could be traced. So $1 million of this money paid to the CFMEU had just disappeared. That would be of no surprise to those opposite because money that is in the budget for all sorts of things just disappears. This is a government with—




Mr Laurie Ferguson:
  You weren't too vocal on the Wheat Board.




Mr McCORMACK:
  You mention the Wheat Board. We will not start about the Wheat Board, because let me tell you that has been an absolute disaster. You can speak to any wheat grower in my electorate of Riverina and they will tell you how bad the wheat situation is going following deregulation. I would not start on that if I were you.


If you want to take a sneak peek at what is about to be unleashed, have a look at the Wonthaggi desalination plant in Victoria. I am a little bit dubious about desalination plants at the best of times, because we have more water than we need, but we tend to want to turn sea water back into fresh water so we can use it. Every time I go to Sydney it rains, but we have no policies to build new dams. Every time I go to Sydney it rains, it pours out to the ocean, and at the desalination plant put there at the behest of the Labor government they try to turn it back into useable water. Go-slows at Wonthaggi desalination plant have delayed the project by up to four months. It lost 193 days due to industrial action—this was an example that the Cole royal commission came up with. This is what happens when the cop on the beat is not doing his job or does not have the powers to be able to do his job. Imagine this replicated right across the country.


Regional Australia is doing it tough enough, and builders in regional Australia are doing it tough enough, because investment is on hold. In the city of Griffith in my electorate of Riverina, since the Murray-Darling Basin Authority brought out its infamous and ill-fated guide to the Basin Plan, a company which had sold 62 homes in the 12 months leading up to the release of that report in October 2010 has not sold or built one house since. The builders of that company have had either to shift or to move town, or they are just out of a job.


It is tough enough for the building industry, and this is replicated right across regional Australia, yet builders in those towns who are actually working on homes and buildings for businesses are once more going to be at the behest of unions. They are going to be at the behest of union bosses—these thugs who are going to come onto their worksites and tell them what to do and how to do it. There will be stop work meetings, and you can see it happening all over again. The CFMEU will be up to its old tricks, with a weakened regulator still in place. Just imagine what is going to happen on building sites when the construction police tie up the hands of employers and companies to the point where it will be, 'Hammers and screwdrivers down!' We are going to be seeing union thuggery at its worst in this country again.


This bill is a ploy by the Prime Minister to bring the unions and the Labor Left onside to save her leadership—nothing more, nothing less. Employers right across my electorate of Riverina are worried about this. They have written letters to me. Workers are going to be worried about it, too—



Mr Neumann interjecting—




Mr McCORMACK:
  You can complain all you like, but workers are worried about it, too. Workers in regional Australia just want a job. They just want a job as an apprentice, they just want a job on a working site, and they want to be paid fairly. They want fair conditions. They want safe conditions. That is imperative, and that is possible under the current commission. What they do not want is to always be told to put down tools. They do not want some union thug telling them that they cannot do this and they cannot do that.


In most places, as even the member for Shortland admitted, many employers are very good employers in very good companies. A lot of them are family owned and they treat their workers like their own. You are going to get bad workers in any environment, and bad employers too—that is just the nature of the beast—but the ABCC is doing its job. It is doing a good regulatory job and it is stopping those unions from having their way with companies, bringing down productivity and putting in place negative factors which would stop otherwise reputable companies and employers from hiring people.


That is why the coalition is dead against the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2011. Even the wording of the bill is a little bit like the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill this morning, with the word 'fairness' in it. Here we have the word 'improvement' and the phrase 'transition to fair work' in the name of the bill. It is almost editorialising at its worst. That bill was not about fairness in private health insurance, just like this bill is not about improvement. This is a bill which shows that the Prime Minister is beholden to the Greens. It shows that the Prime Minister is beholden to the unions, who we know pay her way and pay Labor's way to keeping their flimsy government intact.


This bill is not in the national interest. If it were in the national interest, then it would have been done many years ago. It is not in the national interest; it is only in the unions' interest. That is why the coalition opposes the bill and that is why it should not be passed.

Mr LAURIE FERGUSON
 (Werriwa) (18:58):  What we have seen in this debate on the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill is the facade being ripped away from the coalition's cultivated attempt to give an impression that they have changed their attitude since they lost power in this country in the area of industrial relations. We have had all the leaks from the Leader of the Opposition, all of the backgrounding that he was the most doubtful person in the cabinet, he was the one who did not want to go as far as John Howard, he was always a moderate and he knew that they might lose the blue-collar support that had been garnished during the Howard period. But what we have seen in the contributions today from all those opposite is that same attitude of class war politics in this country.


The member for Higgins, while supposedly interested in the fate of the workers, said there should not have been any deficit spending, that we should have let the building industry go to the floor, that we should have not made sure that building material companies were supported and that we should have ensured that people could finish their apprenticeships, that people could have traineeships and that there could be spending on consumption by workers still in employment. We have had quotes, too, from Marius Kloppers and Toyota's management, as though they have no self-interest in this debate. We have had contributions saying that it is all right that this body, which is supposedly so perfect, has failed to gain a prosecution during the whole period it has been running—a situation where Terence Cole, not to put too fine a point on it—

Ms MARINO
 (Forrest—Opposition Whip) (17:38):  I rise to speak on the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2011. In spite of its title, this bill is not aimed at achieving sound reform, jobs growth or productivity improvements in an industry that is extremely important not only in my electorate of Forrest but right around the nation. The coalition are proud to support Australians who have a go, who take a risk, who invest and who employ people in small, medium and larger businesses. We believe that every Australian, whether an employer or an employee, deserves to be able go to their workplace and operate in a safe and lawful environment.


However, in direct contrast, the Labor government, as indicated by this bill, does not believe that Australian business owners should have the right to run their own businesses. I suppose that is not really surprising. One only has to examine the power structure of the Labor Party to see who pulls the strings. When the current Prime Minister arbitrarily axed the previous Prime Minister, current union leaders boasted about their role in that axing. This is a very long way, unfortunately, from the historical union representation that has a long and originally proud history in this country of raising the standards for Australian workers. But this proud history has been corrupted by the politics of union leaders and Labor Party ambition. What started as a great push for workers' rights two centuries ago has become a fight for left-wing factional power and a platform for political rather than social ambition. That is the sad inheritance of the modern Labor Party and one of the main reasons that the union membership has plummeted in recent times.


According to figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the proportion of employees who were trade union members in their main job decreased from 20 per cent in August 2009 to 18 per cent in August 2010. This represents a fall of 47,300. For the majority of the 20th century, however, at least 40 per cent of workers were covered by unions and some 20 years ago the figure was one in every two workers. However, instead of looking after the interests of those workers, a number of unions have been looking after an elitist left-wing level of union leaders and their political ambitions.


Of course, not all unions have gone down this path and a number remain that genuinely have the interests of their members at heart. An example is the police union in my home state of Western Australia, which has a long history of member advocacy as its primary goal. Sadly, for some unions, this is no longer the case. As we look into history, the building industry specifically deserves very careful attention. I refer to the BLF, the Builders Labourers Federation.


It took a royal commission to expose what this front-line union had become. The Winneke royal commission identified major problems with the actions of the BLF and as a result it was deregistered by the Hawke Labor government in 1986—this was a Labor government and a Labor leader deregistering the BLF. Members might think that, following the Winneke royal commission and the deregistration of the BLF in 1986, the construction sector unions would have altered their practices and the union would return to the role of looking after building workers in an open, honest and accountable manner. But how wrong those members would be.


The 2003 building industry royal commission, conducted by the Hon. THR Cole, found that despite a corrupt history no lessons had been learned and no change was in evidence. The Cole Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry, 2001-03, was established by the Australian government to inquire into and report upon alleged misconduct in the building and construction industry in Australia. The commission articulated a case that the industry was characterised by lawlessness in the conduct of industrial relations. Our Parliamentary Library report on the Cole commission stated that:


The industry was described by the Royal Commission as being characterised by widespread disregard for the rule of law. It found widespread use of inappropriate industrial pressure, disregard for enterprise bargaining and the freedom of association laws leading to unlawful strikes, as well as widespread use of 'inappropriate' payments. Thus:


31 individuals were referred for possible criminal prosecution


392 instances of unlawful conduct committed by individuals, unions and employers, which include 30 findings of unlawful conduct by employers mainly for strike pay breaches and freedom of association breaches, (i.e. that the employer agreed to a 'no ticket no start' policy operating at a site), and


25 different types of unlawful conduct and 90 types of inappropriate conduct.


The construction industry in Western Australia specifically was described by the royal commission as being 'marred by unlawful and inappropriate conduct' with 'a culture of fear, intimidation, coercion and industrial unrest'. The royal commission made 230 findings of unlawful conduct in WA, the majority of which were against CFMEU officials and organisers for intimidation and threats of violence, breaches of FOA, secondary boycott and right-of-entry provisions, trespass and interference. CFMEU officials Kevin Reynolds and Joe McDonald are cited as repeat offenders. Sadly the BLF is not the only example of union focus shifting from looking after employees to seeking political power. However, it is probably only the most obvious.


Here we are again debating industrial relations in the building industry. The bill before us is cloaked in Labor spin as one that targets the protection of workers. But we know the reality—that this bill is about union power over business owners and managers. We know that the Labor government does not believe that Australian business owners should have the right or freedom to run their own businesses. This is the real reason we are here and the real reason that Labor members are vocal in their support—not because they are looking after the interests of workers but because they are looking after, or appear to be looking after, the political interests of union leaders. After all, preselections are on the line. BLF secretary David Hanna was quoted in the Australian on 16 December 2011:


Workers will continue to take whatever action, be it legal or illegal, to get their message across.


No wonder members of the building and construction industry are concerned about the consequences of what is contained in this bill and what effect this will have on their ability to run their businesses and do the jobs they are there to do. This industry is important right across Australia. It employs one million Australians and contributes 10 per cent to our GDP. So any impacts will be felt right across our economy. What we saw in that statement may well be what is ahead, as a result of measures contained in this bill.


As I said when I started this speech, every Australian, whether they are an employer or an employee, deserves to be able to go to their workplace and operate in a safe and lawful environment. I fear that members opposite do not support this. The Labor government is repeatedly punishing the people who have a go, who invest their own money, who borrow against their homes and who employ millions of Australians and are helping others to get ahead. There is now a widespread belief that this Labor government is anti-business. I am concerned that they will sacrifice hardworking business owners through policies like the ones in this bill, for the express purpose of enhancing the power of union leaders and definitely not with the aim of achieving sound reform, jobs growth, productivity improvements and economic growth.

Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (17:49):  I welcome the opportunity to speak briefly on the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2011. I have just listened to the member for Forrest. It is very easy to paint a one-sided view of a situation, as she has just done. I am sure workers in the construction industry around Australia would willingly come into this place and tell a story different from the one we have just heard from the member for Forrest. I am well aware that, in the Cole royal commission, their view was that their voice had not been properly heard. I am not in a position to judge that one way or the other but I am in a position to make the comment on their behalf that they felt they did not get a fair hearing. From the transcripts which are available, I believe the record will show that they are probably correct.


I come back to some of the very issues related to this bill, to that commission and to the new legislation, which touch upon the very reasons this legislation is good legislation and the reasons this government believes in fairness for workers and industry across this country. I make this comment with respect to the comments by the member for Forrest and others when they talk about the influence of some of the unions, making allegations as to corruption or similar by people involved in them. It takes two parties to get involved in corrupt activity. It is not simply a one-sided affair. Yet when you look at the record, it appears that the focus is always towards one group only and that is the workers.


I believe the extraordinary attack on workers' rights by the Howard government was a key factor in the ultimate downfall of the Howard government and in Prime Minister Howard's loss of his own seat. Like Prime Minister Stanley Bruce before him, who lost his seat in 1929, Prime Minister Howard had turned his back on Australian workers. Peter Reith's waterfront debacle of the late 1990s, the Work Choices legislation and the establishment of the Office of the Australian Building and Construction Commission were part of a warped ideology to turn back the clock on fair working conditions that had been hard won over decades of struggles and to destroy unions. It is as simple as that. Those attacks were un-Australian and Australians knew it. The members opposite know that as well. That is why they will not mention the term Work Choices any more. Their leader wants the term 'dead, buried and cremated', at least in name; I do not believe in substance.


Australians are pretty easygoing people, but they believe in a fair go. The ABCC legislation was everything but that. It was legislation that was not only an assault on workers' conditions but an assault on human rights—human rights which Australia has agreed to as a signatory to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Australians have fought and died for the freedoms and fairness that Work Choices, the ABCC and the waterfront events sought to take away from them. When the ABCC was established in 2005, following the Cole royal commission, it was intended to intimidate and break organised labour in Australia.


The Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2011 creates the Office of the Fair Work Building Industry Inspectorate to regulate the building and construction industry. This new agency will replace the Office of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner. It renames the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005 as the Fair Work (Building Industry) Act 2011 and either repeals or amends many of the BCII Act's provisions. The bill implements key recommendations of the Transition to Fair Work Australia for the building and construction industry report by the Hon. Murray Wilcox QC. It is interesting that the member for Forrest referred to the Cole royal commission but made no reference to the report by the Hon. Murray Wilcox, who also makes some very pertinent comments regarding the ABCC legislation. Conveniently, they were left out.


With the exception of minor non-policy changes such as the inclusion of changes resulting from amendments to the Acts Interpretation Act, the bill is the same as that introduced during the previous parliament. The bill removes existing higher penalties for building industry participants for breaches of industrial law and introduces safeguards in relation to the power to compulsorily obtain information and documents. The bill creates the office of Independent Assessor, who may, on application by stakeholders, determine that compulsory information-gathering powers will not apply to a project. The new regulator will also provide information, advice and assistance to all building industry participants regarding their rights and obligations under law, as well as seek to improve the standard of occupational health and safety in the building and construction industry. The bill includes a three-year sunset provision for the compulsory information-gathering powers. A review will occur prior to the sunset of compulsory information-gathering powers. I note that the bill does not impact on the provisions that establish the Office of the Federal Safety Commissioner and the Occupational Health And Safety Accreditation Scheme.


Criticism of the former Howard government's ABCC has not just come from the labour movement in Australia and the wider Australian community. There has also been international condemnation of the coercive powers of the ABCC and its targeting of building unions. The International Labour Organisation, the United Nations body charged with looking after workers' rights, has raised its concerns on a number of occasions. The ILO's Committee of Experts is an eminent body of labour jurists. Early last year, this committee circulated the following statement:


… the manner in which the ABCC carries out its activities seems to have led to the exclusion of workers in the building and construction industry from the protection that the labour inspection system ought to secure for these workers under the applicable laws …


The ILO's concerns were very well illustrated by the Ark Tribe case in South Australia. I am reasonably familiar with that case because I followed it from day one. The Ark Tribe trial was pivotal in further raising community awareness of the ABCC's potential to encroach on the industrial and human rights of Australian workers.


In 2008, Ark Tribe attended a safety meeting at a construction site in Adelaide. At that meeting, ongoing safety concerns at the site were discussed by workers and a union investigation into conditions was carried out before workers returned to their work. The ABCC then summoned Ark Tribe to a meeting in order to determine the legality of workers' actions. When Ark Tribe refused to attend, prosecutors for the ABCC commenced legal proceedings against him. Ark Tribe was not a union official or a union delegate. A large protest was held when court proceedings took place. Several hundred people were present for the first day of the trial on 15 June 2010, including prominent international civil rights campaigners Gerry Conlon and Paddy Hill. Industrial rights are, after all, civil rights—that is, human rights.


On 24 November 2010, Ark Tribe was cleared of the charges against him—charges which should never have been laid. Ark Tribe should never have been subjected to the intimidation and injustice which he had been put through. I am pleased to see that the courts came to the same conclusion and cleared him of those charges.


In 2007, the government made a commitment that, if elected, it would replace the ABCC with a new body to provide a balanced framework for cooperative and productive workplace relations in the building and construction industry.


The construction industry contains unique challenges for both employers and employees. Nobody denies that. Too many Australians die on building and construction sites each and every year and hundreds more are injured, and that has been the case for decades and decades. Building workers have been exposed workplace dangers associated with unsafe work practices, unsafe worksites and unsafe building materials. Poor scaffolding, working from heights, the danger of structural collapse, exposure to dust, asbestos, hazardous chemicals and even extreme weather conditions have taken their toll on the lives of construction workers and on their families for decades and decades. Indeed, much of Australia has literally been built on the blood, sweat and tears of construction workers. Labor supports a strong building industry regulator to ensure lawful conduct by all parties. But it does not support laws that deny workers basic rights, like being represented by a lawyer of their choice.


The context for changes was further developed late last year when Qantas Airways grounded its fleet. In the future we may well reflect on this incident as an important moment for industrial relations in Australia. Currently, if Qantas's action is held to be illegal industrial action under the Fair Work Act, the maximum fine it would face would be one-third of the maximum fine the CFMEU could face for taking illegal industrial action on building sites. Where is the fairness in that? The widespread public criticism of Qantas's action suggests that our industrial relations body should be designed to achieve greater conciliation instead of having coercive or litigious functions.


In conclusion, I have tried to summarise the importance of this bill, and I know that there is still some concern with it in respect of the coercive powers. I also know that those powers have been limited to the extent that there have to be certain processes before they can be applied. I believe that a reasonable balance has been struck in respect to them. However, I believe that this bill corrects an injustice that currently exists in Australian industrial laws, whereby some people are treated as lesser than other people—in other words, there is currently discrimination in the laws that apply to workers in this country, and this bill seeks to rectify that. I commend the bill to the House.

"Tehan, Dan, MP",LP,2012-02-15,"



Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon) (18:01):  I rise to oppose the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2011, and I take issue with the previous speaker. The bill is not about trying to outlaw organised labour in this country. It is about trying to deal with illegal activity by organised labour in this country, and in particular in the building industry.


The bill will do three things: it is going to hurt Australia's productivity; it is going to set up a new body that, sadly, will be a toothless tiger; and, it will give more power to the new workplace relations minister, which is like putting a kid in charge of the candy store, or, to put it another way, like putting a factional boss in charge of determining the Labor leadership—it will be a debacle.


Let us turn to the issue of productivity. The ABCC has been a tough cop on the beat, but it has required a tough cop on the beat to deal with the issues identified by a royal commission. The inquiry that led to the formation of the ABCC was not a normal one—it was a royal commission. Since the ABCC was set up we have seen building and construction industry productivity increase by 10 per cent; it has provided an annual economic welfare gain of $5.5 billion per year; it has reduced inflation by 1.2 per cent and increased GDP by 1.5 per cent; and the number of working days lost annually per 1,000 employees in the construction industry has fallen from 224 in 2004 to 24 in 2006. At the same time, building costs have fallen by 20 to 25 per cent and long project delays have been dramatically reduced.


At a time when the Australian economy is struggling, due to the incompetence of this Labor government, the last thing we need is another step in the direction of lessening Australia's productivity. That is what this bill will do. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry summed it up quite nicely in the letter they wrote to the secretary of the Senate Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Committee when this bill was being looked at. They took the opportunity to thank the committee for having the inquiry and noted:


The outcome of the Bill is a matter of particular significance, not just for the building and construction sector, but for the broader Australian economy. Approximately one million Australians work in the building and construction industry. Their output contributes around 10% of Australia's GDP.


This issue is dealing with 10 per cent of Australia's GDP. You want to harm the productivity in 10 per cent of Australia's GDP. This decision will lead to long-term consequences for the Australian community. You should think again about having kowtowed to the Greens and having agreed to go down this path.


This was emphasised by the minister in his second reading speech on 3 November 2011 when he indicated:


The building and construction industry remains a critical sector of our economy, with immediate and direct impact on jobs, growth and productivity. This was particularly so during the global economic recession, during which the government's Nation Building and Jobs Plan ensured that the Australian economy remained one of the strongest in the developed world.


The minister continued:


The government understands that the industry contains unique challenges for both employers and employees, and as a result we have always supported a strong building industry regulator to ensure lawful conduct by all parties.




The minister then went on for a few more paragraphs detailing why the industry is so important.



However, the only effective response has come from the establishment of the Australian Building and Construction Commission. This concerns dealing with the illegal activities that have existed in this industry. It has had a dramatic impact on the industry and on the sorts of behaviour and attitudes we have referred to. The impact has been quantified in a range of different ways, in particular by significant reductions in lost time in the industry and big improvements in productivity and efficiency, estimated at more than $5.5 billion per annum.


The decision taken by the Howard government to set up the ABCC was not a liked one. To have a royal commission look into an industry requires a lot of evidence that something drastic needs to occur. That is exactly what the Cole royal commission found. What has been the result of the Cole royal commission? We have seen the ABCC set up and we have seen huge productivity increases come out of the sector. But we should not now say to ourselves, 'Okay, the job is done,' because the evidence is still there that it is not. There have been productivity increases, but all the alarm bells are there. If we reduce the amount of regulation in the industry at the moment then the illegal activity will grow once again, and, sadly, we are seeing examples of that in Victoria, and we have seen it in the last few years. Just when we are getting on top of this issue, what does this Labor government want to do? It wants to step in and put at risk all the gains that we have made.


Getting to the second point, what they are replacing the ABCC with is a toothless tiger. I will turn to what the Australian Industry Group had to say about this.



A government member:  Who have you got?




Mr TEHAN:
  We have got ACCI; we have got the Australia Industry Group. What I am trying to do here is give a balanced perspective.



Government members interjecting—




Mr TEHAN:
  All right, so we should not have business in Australia, should we?




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr KJ Thomson
):  Order! Members on my right will cease interjecting. The member for Wannon has the call.




Mr TEHAN:
  I am happy to listen to those interjecting from the other side that we should just have the union bosses ruling the country. They have done a great job with their factional people here in this parliament, haven't they! Look at the unholy mess they have got us in at the moment. We have got a Prime Minister who cannot be trusted, we have got the Minister for Foreign Affairs trying to seek her job and we have got a factional impasse because no-one knows who should lead the country.



Government members interjecting—




Mr TEHAN:
  That is right. We should just let the big union bosses rule everything! What we are trying to do here is make sure that illegal activity by organised labour does not get out of control, especially in the building and construction industry. What are you going to replace the ABCC with? Sadly, a toothless tiger. The AiG says:


The compulsory examination powers are needed at the present time as much as ever. While the reforms introduced after the Royal Commission addressed the unlawful and inappropriate conduct that permeated the industry, industrial unrest and disputation has been steadily increasing in the industry and damaging and unproductive industrial relations practices have been creeping back onto building and construction sites across Australia.


They go on to quote the foreword to the annual report of the ABCC for the financial year ending 30 June 2011, in which the ABC Commissioner, Leigh Johns, identified that:




During 2010-11, unlawful industrial disputes, the traditional ‘bread-and-butter’ work of the ABCC, continued to occur at levels that underscored the need for strong enforcement of workplace laws. The pernicious effects of unlawful industrial action are unacceptable, particularly so on projects of social and national significance like the Monash Freeway, the Melbourne Markets relocation, Gold Coast University Hospital or the Wonthaggi Desalination Plant.



One only has to look at the record days lost on the desalinisation plant in Victoria to see why the ABCC needs to remain and needs to continue to do its job.


The new body that has been established within Fair Work Australia to replace the incredibly successful Office of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner is not an independent body. So not only will it be toothless but it is not an independent body. It is controlled by the minister. And who is our new minister? Where does he come from? How independent will he be? How objective will he be? We have got the kid back in control of the candy store. That is what this bill will do. What we will see is a complete imbalance in the way these issues are dealt with. The sad fact is that ultimately that will lead to a productivity decline in this country. That is the last thing that we need at the moment. Our manufacturing sector is about to get hit by one of the biggest hits to their productivity that you could imagine—the carbon tax. This is especially so in the state of Victoria because it is going to impact on power, which is the competitive advantage that our industries and especially our manufacturers in Victoria have over our international competitors. Combine that now with this bill.


Those opposite, and I have been listening to their speeches as they have gone on, have said that all this will do is redress an imbalance. Yet no-one has been through and systematically examined what the Cole royal commission found—the intimidation and the thuggery, and the fact that if there was not some sort of body set up with powers to deal directly with it that none of this would stop. Even though we have had the ABCC there, we have still seen examples of this occurring. So why won't the government allow it to finish its job? Why don't they make sure that it has all been stamped out? It is illegal activity that we are trying to get rid of here. It is not, as those opposite say, designed to get rid of organised labour in this country. It is designed to get rid of the illegal activity. Those on the other side should be supporting the work that the ABCC is doing, because the more we can do to stamp out this type of activity the better it will be across the nation for organised labour in general. The coalition strongly opposes the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2011. In many ways the title of the bill is a complete misnomer. Sadly, at a time when we should be looking to do everything we can to increase the productivity of this nation, it will do the exact opposite. It will set up a body which they have deliberately given no teeth to. Basically, it will become an irrelevant bureaucracy—another one created by the government. Not only that; it gives power not to an independent body but back to the minister and, as we know, the new minister is going to find it very difficult to be independent and objective. He will be dealing with his union mates and he will be conflicted in trying to continue to stamp out illegal activity. I would hope the starting point that we can all agree on when it comes to this bill would be that there is no place for illegal activity anywhere in the Australian economy and in particular the building and construction industry.

"Jones, Stephen, MP",ALP,2012-02-15,"



Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (18:16):  My contribution to this debate on the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2011 will be brief. I have to observe that the contributions from those on the other side have been really revealing about what lies in their hearts and their obsessions when it comes to industrial relations. The bill has a long history, dating back to at least 2001, when in the lead-up to an election the then Prime Minister, John Howard, established the Cole Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry, whose singular purpose was to demonise the union movement in general and the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union in particular. The government never really made any secret that this was its singular objective in commissioning the Cole royal commission. Unfortunately, the government's real objective was to ensure that the evidence would be horrifying and that it would assist it in moving through its next raft of industrial relations changes after the 2001 election. Unfortunately for the government, the evidence before the commission was at times unhelpful to that cause.


The evidence before the commission found that by world standards we have a very efficient construction industry, and in some respects we are leading by way of world's best practice.



Ms O'Dwyer interjecting—




Mr STEPHEN JONES:
  My friend in the chamber makes the observation that there were no convictions arising out of the royal commission. It did find that there was corruption in the industry and a significant amount of corruption by certain employers within the industry. It was a tough and rough industry and from time to time some practices went on that would be condemned by all members of this House. But to say that poor practice was solely the result of union activity is a complete furphy and a misrepresentation of any of the evidence that was put before the Cole royal commission.


It also found—and this never got much attention and certainly never got any action from the Howard government—that there were systemic breaches and systemic failures in adhering to occupational health and safety standards and regulations within the building industry. If the Howard government had put as much energy into chasing that rabbit down that hole, then there would probably be a few more workers in this industry and workplaces who had not suffered the terrible injuries that occur on an all too often basis within the building and construction industry.


The debate in this chamber today shows the obsession of the Liberal Party and the coalition with harsh industrial relations laws, union bashing and their love of Work Choices. Whilst they have attempted to put them in the closet from time to time, when debates like this come before the House they cannot help themselves. We have seen that from the frantic, if not hysterical, debate from the member for Wannon. What is absolutely astounding is that the loudest voices and the most ill-informed comments, I wager, have come most often from those members of the House who have never been anywhere near a building site and who do not know what it is like to work in the building and construction industry—which, as I have said, is a tough industry.


I am pleased to be speaking in favour of the legislation before this House, but I will make one qualification to that. The legislation abolishes the Australian Building and Construction Commission and absorbs those functions into the functions of Fair Work Australia. It ensures that there will still be a tough cop on the beat. It ensures that there will still be strong regulatory arrangements in the building and construction industry, extending beyond the obsessions of those on the other side but going directly to issues of health and safety and to issues of employer breaches and scams that regularly affect subcontractors within the industry. The legislation ensures these practices are wiped out as well.


If I have a reservation, it stems from my background in the law. My concern is that the bill does not yet deal with the issue of compelled evidence. I understand that this is the result of commitments that we made in the lead-up to the 2010 election and, as a member of this place and this party, I stand squarely behind the policy commitments and the provisions of this bill. But I do raise the reservation—and it stems from hundreds of years of legal practice—that courts should be very wary indeed about accepting the probity and the availability of compelled evidence. If we have learnt anything over hundreds of years of legal practice, there are deep concerns within the legal community of accepting the probative value of compelled evidence. I am hoping that some time in the future, with the experience of the new functions being absorbed within Fair Work Australia, and improved practices within the building and construction industry, we may be able to revisit this matter in this place in the interests of all. I commend the legislation to the House.

"O'Dwyer, Kelly, MP",LP,2012-02-15,"



Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins) (18:22):  The Prime Minister made a number of promises to the Australian people before the 2007 and 2010 elections. She promised that she would be economically prudent, and yet her Treasurer has delivered four deficits of more than $167 billion in total and a gross debt ceiling of $250 billion. She promised not to introduce a carbon tax only days before the election and then broke that promise. She promised that that no Australian worker would be worse off as a result of her industrial relations laws and that her reforms would not have a negative impact on productivity or our nation's economy—another broken promise. The government's changes have wound back the industrial relations clock, not just to a time before Work Choices but to a time before Hawke and Keating. The Prime Minister also promised that she would have a 'tough cop on the beat' in the building and construction industry. Today, I rise to speak on the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2011 that is before this House. This bill breaks that last promise, the latest broken promise in a long list of the Prime Minister's broken promises.


When the Prime Minister brought in her Fair Work Act she said it would 'increase productivity'. We hear from the Prime Minister and Treasurer on a repeated basis that productivity is the key to this nation's prosperity and that we must increase our productivity to ensure that our nation grows. We on this side of the chamber agree with this. Productivity-enhancing reform is, as the Chairman of the Productivity Commission has so rightly stated, 'the mainstay of economic progress'. No doubt we will hear again from the other side of the chamber that this legislation is also supposedly 'productivity enhancing'. Yet nothing could be further from the truth.


In the September quarter we saw that that GDP per hour worked was lower than in the last quarter of the coalition government. This is a decline, not simply a slowing in the rate of growth. The coalition government delivered an increase of more than 25 per cent in GDP per hours worked in our 11 years. The Labor-Greens government has seen a fall in GDP per hours worked in less than four years. Annual productivity growth has gone from on average 1.2 per cent during our time in government to -0.9 per cent during the Labor-Greens government.


A tough cop on the beat is critical in the construction and building industry. The Office of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner is that tough cop on the beat. It was born out of the Cole royal commission which, 10 years ago, investigated the lawlessness, thuggery, intimidation and corruption that existed as part of the entrenched culture on construction sites—a culture that saw itself as above the law and, in the words of the commission 'flagrantly' breached the law without any thought of consequence. Examples brought before the commission ranged from unlawful entry of sites by union officials to violence, obstruction of building sites and payments by builders to the unions for industrial peace. One such example in WA saw a builder pay more than $1.5 million for so-called casual tickets to WA's CFMEU. When the Cole commission followed the money trail it could only trace $500,000—the rest of the money to the CFMEU simply disappeared. These examples were commonplace and have more in common with organised crime than a 21st century construction industry. This culture significantly increases the cost of building and the flow-on economic effects are enormous.


In the time that the ABCC has been operating the benefits of a strong watchdog for the construction industry are clear. According to research undertaken by KPMG Econtech, since the inception of the ABCC productivity in the sector has risen by 10 per cent, there has been an economic welfare gain of $5.5 billion per year, inflation has been reduced by 1.2 per cent, GDP has increased by 1.5 per cent and it has helped facilitate significant reductions in days lost through industrial action.


Significantly, the powers of the ABCC have led to successful court action, with more than $2.5 in penalties imposed by the courts in the last financial year. Most recently, two unions and a number of union officials have been fined more than $1.3 million by the courts for obstruction, violence and intimidation on the Westgate Bridge project. Yet this Labor-Greens government plans to unwind these economic and workplace reforms by shifting power away from the independent umpire back to the unions. The legislation before this House will make a eunuch of the ABCC and will guarantee three things:  a decrease in productivity; that the unions dictate the terms on which the construction industry operates; and a return of the old school practices of delay, intimidation and union payoffs for industrial peace and increased costs.


Like everyone in this chamber I meet regularly with people from different industries. At a recent meeting I was told by several builders that they had been coerced into 'advertising' in a union magazine. They told me this was standard practice so as to avoid their sites being shut down through guerrilla tactics or equipment failing to turn up. This, they considered, was  a cost of doing business.


The abolition of the ABCC in its current form will ensure that some of the more nefarious activities will return in force. I wish to highlight five key ways in which this legislation will damage the construction industry. Firstly, the bill strips power from the ABCC's replacement body, the Building Industry Inspectorate, by enshrining in law that the minister has the power to issue directions as to how, where and when it should go about performing its functions. Given the serious unanswered questions about potential government interference in the Craig Thomson saga, this is a retrograde step.


Secondly, by lifting the test for what is a 'lawful' strike we will start to see an increase in trivial strikes action, the kind of strikes that were rampant at the Wonthaggi desalination plant.


Thirdly, reducing the penalty for unlawful strikes will remove the disincentive for unlawful industrial action. We can see through the Westgate Bridge case that there is a need for tough penalties for those who do not comply with the law, with over $1.3 million of fines being ordered by the ABCC. In that case, workers needed to be moved by an ex-army troop carrier in and out of the site to ensure their safety. We should never forget employers are also entitled to their rights, including their right to conduct business without the threat of intimidation or reprisal. Employees are also entitled to their rights—the right to a safe workplace free from threats and intimidation. The unions would have us believe that the right of unions to go about their business should be paramount, but it is not. Rights are not a one-way street.


The increase in red tape for compulsory information-gathering powers and a sunset clause after five years will see these powers used rarely, if at all, and a return to retribution actions taken against anyone who speaks out about the culture on construction sites. The fact that the sunset clause will not even be reviewed before being removed indicates that the real motivations behind these changes are to silence critics of union thuggery, violence and intimidation. Reduction of building inspectorate powers to investigate by allowing such powers to be switched off means that the building inspectorate will not have the freedom and independence to investigate all complaints.


Make no mistake; this legislation is simply to allow the Prime Minister to pander to the union leaders that installed her and nothing to do with making Australia a better or more prosperous nation. The union campaign in support of the election of this Labor government in 2007 amounted to more than $36,430,588 in direct donations and political expenditure. In 2010 it amounted to $24,578,719. The Greens member for Melbourne, Adam Bandt, received more than $360,000 across both elections as a direct donation from the CFMEU, ETU and AMWU. Labor and the Greens are not interested in maintaining law and order on work sites and improving the economic welfare of the nation but are instead keen, through this legislation, to pay back their union masters.


While I do not doubt that Labor will continue to receive the hard earned money of union members, such as those from the Health Services Union, the Greens pretend that they are on a higher moral plane. If the member for Melbourne and the Greens leader, Bob Brown, were true to their high-minded rhetoric and so-called high standards regarding political donations, they ought to hand this money back. But I bet they will not. The Greens simply set standards for others, never for themselves.




Mr Bandt:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: it cannot be parliamentary conduct in this place to allege someone has received sums of money that they have not received.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  I must admit I have only just arrived in the chair. I will just say to the member for Higgins that, if she is going to make an allegation about someone, she should do it by a substantive motion.




Ms O'DWYER:
  The member for Melbourne can correct the record after question time if he feels that he has been misrepresented. I will continue. The Greens simply set standards for others, never for themselves. The leader of the Greens and the member for Melbourne talk about rights, but will not ensure the rights of workers to be free from thuggery and intimidation on building and construction sites.


The coalition has a proud record of increasing the productivity of the nation whilst maintaining world's-best-practice working conditions. I stand by our record of productivity gains on the waterfront. I stand by the productivity gains that the ABCC was making in the construction industry. The unions and their political wing, the Labor Party, will consistently cry foul that any productivity gain equates to a reduction in labour standards. But I defy anyone in this chamber to name one other country that has working and wage conditions at the standard Australia has. We truly are the lucky country.


I do not stand alone in pointing out the flaws in the government's plan to abolish the ABCC. It is not just this side of the chamber that has been sounding the warning bell on what this bill would mean for industrial disputation and increased cost in the construction industry. The government's favourite business adviser, the CEO of the Australian Industry Group, Heather Ridout, warned:


Unless a strong, well-resourced regulator and strong legislation is maintained, the risks associated with industrial lawlessness will again be priced into construction contracts, at great cost to project owners, including governments, and the Australian community,


Let me interpret that statement for the benefit of the House: the abolition of the ABCC will be a throwback to the old days of union militancy, industry disruption, kickbacks and intimidation in the construction industry.


Construction managers are also expressing concern over the fact that the abolition of the ABCC will have a particular impact on small to medium firms that cannot defend themselves from the aggressive actions of the more militant unions. Gerry Hanssen from Perth based construction firm Hanssen Pty Ltd has warned that, should the ABCC be abolished, the corruption and standover tactics will be 'back in a flash'.


As with the Treasurer's comments in relation to productivity, the government know how to talk the talk but so rarely do they walk the walk. In the time since the Prime Minister introduced the Fair Work Act, union activism and industrial disputation has increased. In the June 2011 quarter, working days lost due to disputation jumped from 19,700 in the previous quarter to 66,200. In the September quarter it increased again to a staggering 101,300 days. That is a 500 per cent increase in two quarters. This should concern all in this chamber and everyone who simply wants to contribute to building a stronger economy and a better nation. John Mullen, CEO of port operator Asciano Ltd, has cautioned that, 'In the current industrial climate, the country is going backwards.' These are all very dire predictions of where this country is heading and the abolition of the ABCC is a giant leap in that direction.


The government's response to any analysis or criticism of its Fair Work Act is to mount a scare campaign, flogging again the dead horse of Work Choices. But this is wearing thin, like so much of the government's rhetoric. It is plain that the industrial relations system in this country has gone backwards and unless the government starts to address the concerns that are raised by businesses, both big and small, and their employees, there will be ever-increasing industrial action, unrest at the workplace and decreased productivity. The best way the government can start to address this issue is by abandoning this legislation and keeping the ABCC with its full powers.

"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2012-02-15,"



Ms HALL
 (Shortland—Government Whip) (18:36):  It is easy to see that the member for Higgins is a strong advocate for Work Choices. If there is any reason that we should doubt the sincerity of those on the other side of this House, it is the contribution by the member for Higgins. Firstly, she made a point of saying that there will be no review, and it is in the legislation that there will be a review. That is not being completely up-front or honest with the people of Australia or with this House. She also made a statement that the member for Melbourne received a highly inflated amount of money from unions. Not true. Is it right that a person can come into this House and make statements that really are not true?


I believe this legislation is overdue. It will repeal the excesses of the Howard government's extreme industrial relations agenda. The Howard government's agenda was to crush unions and remove the right of workers, and the ABCC was the draconian body it established to do that in the construction industry. The ABCC legislation was the brainchild of Peter Reith, the industrial relations minister who used dogs and armed guards on the wharves of Australia in his government's efforts to crush the MUA.


The Labor government appreciates the role unions play in protecting the rights of workers in Australia, just as we appreciate the role employers play. Both parties are important. On this side of the House we know that unions provide protection for workers just as employer bodies protect the rights of employers. It is about balance—both sides make an enormous contribution.


I have listened to speakers on the other side of the House talk about increases in productivity: 10 per cent, the previous speaker said. Productivity increase is important. But over the same period of time there has been over a four per cent increase in the rate of death on construction sites. Is productivity to be gained at the price of lives? That is the question I have for the member for Higgins, who has now left the chamber. The Howard government did not recognise that there was a need for balance, and that is why it introduced its Work Choices law—which the member for Higgins is so supportive of—which attacked all workers' rights and was harsh and oppressive. It was the zealots in this parliament who sought to squash workers in the building industry and take away their basic rights.


The Howard government's ABCC saw workers like Ark Tribe dragged before the courts with a strong prospect of being imprisoned, simply because he refused to attend an interview in what was nothing more than an inquisition, whilst employers were given a slap over the wrist for breaching occupational health and safety laws. So it was really a double standard that was created under the ABCC. We had an increase in unsafe practices in workplaces, an increase in deaths and injuries. Everyone in this parliament knows that the construction industry is one of the four most dangerous industries, along with agriculture, forestry and mining. When you have a dangerous industry you really need to make sure that occupational health and safety laws are adhered to. Under the ABCC, safety practices were allowed to deteriorate. More workers were injured as a consequence. We on this side of the House realise that you need a balanced approach, and the changes we have before us today are about balance. However, on the other side of the chamber they only listen to the employers. They make no mention of safety; it is all about productivity. If they do mention safety they mention it not for the workers but as a way of denigrating workers in the construction industry. On this side of the House we value safety, we value workers and we value employers.


I will need to shorten my contribution to this debate to ensure that everybody has an opportunity to speak. I would like to briefly put before the House that this legislation is at the heart of the Labor Party's new workplace relations system. We understand that there are unique challenges within the construction industry and we think that this will balance those issues. The ABCC needs to be replaced. Any body that is as oppressive as the ABCC, any body that looks at only one side of the equation and any body that has led to workers ending up in court with the prospect of being jailed simply because they do not attend an interview is not a fair body. We are about fairness—we are about making sure that both employers' and workers' rights are respected.


The position that has been adopted by the government and incorporated in the legislation has been examined by independent legal expert Murray Wilcox QC, and his recommendations have been taken into account in the development of the legislation. There is a sunset clause that will come into play after three years, allowing time for the legislation to take effect. The opposition are not at all interested in a fair workplace. They are not interested in a workplace that has appropriate regulations, where all parties in the building industry have rights. They are interested in work sites in an industry in which it is a one-sided equation, where only the employers—the big companies—have a say; they are the only ones who have a right to be heard. Whilst we respect and appreciate the role that builders and employers play in the construction industry, we know that the construction industry is a very important part of our economy. We want to see it thrive. In my own electorate, it is a very important industry. But we also know that workers in that industry need protection. We know that, in any industry, laws that are so draconian that they are oppressive—in the way that those introduced by the Howard government, which established the ABCC, are—are bad laws.


You only have to come to this chamber and listen to members on the other side of the House distorting facts, not being totally truthful about what the legislation includes and not really portraying the true picture. To have a strong industry, a vibrant industry, you have to respect your workers. You have to have work sites that are safe. If you have an industry that knows it does not have to value its workers, if you have a construction industry where safety can be bypassed and if you have an industry in which workers are constantly in fear of retribution if they speak up, then you do not have things working properly. In saying that, I acknowledge that there are some very good employers who do not cut any corners.


I will leave my contribution there. I recommend and support the legislation before the parliament today and I will be very pleased to see the end of the ABCC.

Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (18:46):  There was a good reason the coalition established the Australian Building and Construction Commission in 2005. As with most things the Howard government did, it was based on solid evidence, a community and industry need, as well as on facts. That was the way of the Howard administration: clear, careful and considered policies thought through and implemented in the national interest.


In the past four-and-a-bit years, and certainly since the current Prime Minister took over, we have seen the complete opposite. Ill-conceived, knee-jerk decision making at the behest of minorities are anything but in the national interest. The Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2011 falls into this typical Labor category. The coalition strongly opposes this bill. We believe that every Australian, whether an employer or an employee, deserves to be able to go to their workplace and operate in an atmosphere where basic law and order is enforced. That goes without saying, and I take exception to the member for Shortland having a go at the coalition, saying that we do not believe in fairness or in safety. Those issues are paramount. We do not distort facts and we do not betray people.


The bill abolishes the body that ensures that law and order is enforced in the building and construction industry. We know why Labor is so keen to bring about an end to the ABCC, and that is because they are beholden to their union mates. They are beholden to the union hierarchy who use hard earned union fees to go on to work sites and into workplaces, close down productivity and put red tape and bureaucracy in front of employers.




Mr Laurie Ferguson:
  Why would they do that?




Mr McCORMACK:
  You can yell all you like but this is a fact. I was speaking to a Wagga Wagga builder tonight and he said: 'We don't need the thuggery of unions on our work sites. Unions are fine but everything should be in moderation. We want to be able to get on with doing what we do best and that is building homes, constructing buildings and doing it with good productivity and the ability to hire apprentices.' But this bill will not enable that productivity and will not enable builders to continue to hire workers in the sorts of ways that they are with the construction commission in place as it is now.


The commission was introduced in 2005 in response to the Cole royal commission, which found that the building and construction industry was rife with a complete disregard for the law. It catalogued more than 100 types of unlawful and inappropriate conduct. In today's workplaces and in this day and age we cannot have that. The member opposite might want that but the building industry cannot afford it and the national interest does not need it. The commission also found that existing regulatory bodies had insufficient powers and resources to enforce the law. That is why the Howard government introduced the Australian Building and Construction Commission. But Labor would demolish all that; the Prime Minister would demolish all that.


It is so interesting that the Prime Minister wants to do that. We have heard only today how the Prime Minister, when she was the shadow minister for health, said that insurance rebates were part of the family's budget, yet today we see the private health insurance rebate thrown straight out the window. When the Prime Minister was the education minister she took away independent youth allowance. And now the Prime Minister and the Labor Party want to take away the Australian Building and Construction Commission, which is doing its job and doing a very good job.


This bill will strip away the protections that enable workers to work in a safe and lawful environment. The replacement agency will, unfortunately, be a toothless tiger which will again roll out the red carpet to lawlessness, thuggery and violence. The new body that has been established within Fair Work Australia to replace the very successful office of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner will not be, and is not, an independent body. It is controlled by the minister. It is not going to be what we would call a strong cop on the beat.


We need to have measures in place that enable fairness and safety. That is why we have the Australian Building and Construction Commission. It is doing its job; it is doing a good job. There are examples upon examples of what happened prior to 2005, before the coalition took the tough decision to return the building and construction industry to law and order. In August 2001, the Howard government established the Cole royal commission to look into what was in fact happening in the building industry. Commissioner Cole reported in March 2003, and the report catalogued, as I said, more than 100 different types of unlawful conduct in that sector. The Cole royal commission examples included payments being made to the CFMEU in Western Australia of more than $1½ million for so-called casual tickets, which is basically money paid in return for industrial peace on sites where not all workers were members of the union. What a disgrace! The Cole commission found that, of the $1½ million that had been paid, only $500,000 could be traced. So $1 million of this money paid to the CFMEU had just disappeared. That would be of no surprise to those opposite because money that is in the budget for all sorts of things just disappears. This is a government with—




Mr Laurie Ferguson:
  You weren't too vocal on the Wheat Board.




Mr McCORMACK:
  You mention the Wheat Board. We will not start about the Wheat Board, because let me tell you that has been an absolute disaster. You can speak to any wheat grower in my electorate of Riverina and they will tell you how bad the wheat situation is going following deregulation. I would not start on that if I were you.


If you want to take a sneak peek at what is about to be unleashed, have a look at the Wonthaggi desalination plant in Victoria. I am a little bit dubious about desalination plants at the best of times, because we have more water than we need, but we tend to want to turn sea water back into fresh water so we can use it. Every time I go to Sydney it rains, but we have no policies to build new dams. Every time I go to Sydney it rains, it pours out to the ocean, and at the desalination plant put there at the behest of the Labor government they try to turn it back into useable water. Go-slows at Wonthaggi desalination plant have delayed the project by up to four months. It lost 193 days due to industrial action—this was an example that the Cole royal commission came up with. This is what happens when the cop on the beat is not doing his job or does not have the powers to be able to do his job. Imagine this replicated right across the country.


Regional Australia is doing it tough enough, and builders in regional Australia are doing it tough enough, because investment is on hold. In the city of Griffith in my electorate of Riverina, since the Murray-Darling Basin Authority brought out its infamous and ill-fated guide to the Basin Plan, a company which had sold 62 homes in the 12 months leading up to the release of that report in October 2010 has not sold or built one house since. The builders of that company have had either to shift or to move town, or they are just out of a job.


It is tough enough for the building industry, and this is replicated right across regional Australia, yet builders in those towns who are actually working on homes and buildings for businesses are once more going to be at the behest of unions. They are going to be at the behest of union bosses—these thugs who are going to come onto their worksites and tell them what to do and how to do it. There will be stop work meetings, and you can see it happening all over again. The CFMEU will be up to its old tricks, with a weakened regulator still in place. Just imagine what is going to happen on building sites when the construction police tie up the hands of employers and companies to the point where it will be, 'Hammers and screwdrivers down!' We are going to be seeing union thuggery at its worst in this country again.


This bill is a ploy by the Prime Minister to bring the unions and the Labor Left onside to save her leadership—nothing more, nothing less. Employers right across my electorate of Riverina are worried about this. They have written letters to me. Workers are going to be worried about it, too—



Mr Neumann interjecting—




Mr McCORMACK:
  You can complain all you like, but workers are worried about it, too. Workers in regional Australia just want a job. They just want a job as an apprentice, they just want a job on a working site, and they want to be paid fairly. They want fair conditions. They want safe conditions. That is imperative, and that is possible under the current commission. What they do not want is to always be told to put down tools. They do not want some union thug telling them that they cannot do this and they cannot do that.


In most places, as even the member for Shortland admitted, many employers are very good employers in very good companies. A lot of them are family owned and they treat their workers like their own. You are going to get bad workers in any environment, and bad employers too—that is just the nature of the beast—but the ABCC is doing its job. It is doing a good regulatory job and it is stopping those unions from having their way with companies, bringing down productivity and putting in place negative factors which would stop otherwise reputable companies and employers from hiring people.


That is why the coalition is dead against the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2011. Even the wording of the bill is a little bit like the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill this morning, with the word 'fairness' in it. Here we have the word 'improvement' and the phrase 'transition to fair work' in the name of the bill. It is almost editorialising at its worst. That bill was not about fairness in private health insurance, just like this bill is not about improvement. This is a bill which shows that the Prime Minister is beholden to the Greens. It shows that the Prime Minister is beholden to the unions, who we know pay her way and pay Labor's way to keeping their flimsy government intact.


This bill is not in the national interest. If it were in the national interest, then it would have been done many years ago. It is not in the national interest; it is only in the unions' interest. That is why the coalition opposes the bill and that is why it should not be passed.

Mr LAURIE FERGUSON
 (Werriwa) (18:58):  What we have seen in this debate on the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill is the facade being ripped away from the coalition's cultivated attempt to give an impression that they have changed their attitude since they lost power in this country in the area of industrial relations. We have had all the leaks from the Leader of the Opposition, all of the backgrounding that he was the most doubtful person in the cabinet, he was the one who did not want to go as far as John Howard, he was always a moderate and he knew that they might lose the blue-collar support that had been garnished during the Howard period. But what we have seen in the contributions today from all those opposite is that same attitude of class war politics in this country.


The member for Higgins, while supposedly interested in the fate of the workers, said there should not have been any deficit spending, that we should have let the building industry go to the floor, that we should have not made sure that building material companies were supported and that we should have ensured that people could finish their apprenticeships, that people could have traineeships and that there could be spending on consumption by workers still in employment. We have had quotes, too, from Marius Kloppers and Toyota's management, as though they have no self-interest in this debate. We have had contributions saying that it is all right that this body, which is supposedly so perfect, has failed to gain a prosecution during the whole period it has been running—a situation where Terence Cole, not to put too fine a point on it—

Mr MORRISON
 (Cook) (19:00):  Seventy years ago today, more than 15,000 Australians, predominantly from the 8th Division AIF, went to hell as Singapore fell to the Japanese and another horrific chapter began in our nation's history, as well as for our allies and the people of Singapore. The indelible scars of these horrific times remain with us to this day and serve as a reminder of what we must never forget.


The Australian prisoners were taken to Thailand, Burma, Borneo, Japan, Manchuria, Indochina, Formosa and Korea. In total, 22,376 Australians were ultimately taken prisoner by the Japanese in South-East Asia during World War II—8,031 of these Australians never came home. These figures are often rounded, but I think it is important in this place that we remember and record our gratitude for the service and sacrifice of each and every one of these great Australians for the love of their country. Our POWs were starved and they fell victim to diseases such as cholera, malaria, dysentery and beriberi and died agonising deaths. They were humiliated, they were force-marched and they were press-ganged into terrible labour. They were beaten, they were beheaded and they were bayoneted. They were shot and they were murdered with a brutality that I cannot imagine, I cannot comprehend and I cannot bear to think about. But think about it today we must and remember it this day we must, especially in this place, and every day we can—because it was their captivity which was the price of our freedom.


After 68 days of a Japanese onslaught along the Malaysian peninsula, the allies were trapped on Singapore Island. Beset by heavy fighting, they surrendered at the old Ford motor factory in Singapore. The unthinkable had happened; the impregnable fortress had fallen. Prime Minister Curtin told the nation:


The fall of Singapore opens the battle for Australia.


Last year, I had the solemn privilege to join 12 young Australians, the member for Blaxland and the member for Lyne as we visited the old Ford motor factory, the allied bunker, the Changi War Museum and the Kranji War Cemetery in Singapore. We then walked the Sandakan Death March in Borneo in the footsteps of more than 1,000 POWs who started their POW journey in Singapore 70 years ago this day. Only six returned.


As our mateship trek concluded in Ranau, where the member for Lyne's grandfather was murdered, I recall only too well the eerie contrast between the peaceful greenery of the jungle gorge in which we solemnly stood and the reverberating clamour of silent voices that cried still—the voices of the victims of Australia's greatest ever military atrocity. While they took up their fight in captivity, others took up the fight on the battlefield. Whether it was the 39th Battalion 'chocos' storming into a firestorm at Kokoda, the hell of the Buna and Gona campaigns, victory at Milne Bay, the defence of Wau, the taking of Lae or our landing at Balikpapan, battles were fought and won, blood was spilt and treasure lost. Heroes rose to the occasion—Ted Kenna at Wewak, Bruce Kingsbury at Isurava, Tom 'Diver' Derrick at Sattelberg in New Guinea—but none more significant in our remembrance than 'Weary' Dunlop in those POW camps.


We remember those they fought alongside on those fateful days in Singapore. We ought not forget the fierce and oppressive yoke that fell upon the people of Singapore for almost four years of Japanese occupation. Tens of thousands of lives were lost in mass executions, but the hardship did not cease with the end of the war. Singapore rose once again, however—a testimony to the leadership and strength of our friends and allies who overcame adversity to achieve self-confidence, security and prosperity. That a nation could rebound as quickly and significantly as it did is truly remarkable—to become a thriving economy, a key player and leader in our region and, importantly, a great friend of Australia.


On this 70th anniversary we think of them too—of the camaraderie we shared at a time of great darkness and of the national friendships which have flourished in the 70 years which have passed since. Our shared stories of adversity in the terrible chapter which began for both our nations 70 years ago today remain an enduring reminder of the strength of the human spirit. As we remember the fall of Singapore today, as we remember those 8,031 Australians who died at the hands of their captors in the most terrible of circumstances, may we say on this solemn day, 'Lest we forget.'

Mr COULTON
 (Parkes—The Nationals Chief Whip) (09:30):  I rise this morning to speak about the crisis that is unfolding across northern New South Wales and more widely across regional Australia at the moment. This crisis is the poor state of local and regional roads. The poor condition of the roads has probably been hidden over the period of the 10-year drought. They were passable for use during that time, even though the gravel had been denuded and they were mainly on black soil. Another reason why the poor state of the roads was hidden is that to avoid getting on the financial watch list they hid the true figures about their roads. As a result, I believe that there is about a $6 billion deficit now in the condition of local roads.


Everything that we purchase on a supermarket shelf starts its life on a local road. The two major economic drivers that kept this country out of recession in the global financial crisis, mining and agriculture, rely on a local road network. That is why the councils of Gwydir and Moree have formed the Australian Rural Roads Group. They now have over 100 members, including the largest agriculture-producing councils in Australia. They firmly believe that, as well as vehicle traffic, the value and amount of produce that is delivered on these roads should be taken into account and that there should be a strategic approach in putting in local road networks so that this produce can make its way to the markets.



At the moment, we have farmers in dire financial stress because they have the grain from last year's harvest in storage on farm but cannot meet contractual agreements with flour millers, feedlots and the like. We have cattle producers that have regular contracts with supermarkets and abattoirs who cannot meet those contractual agreements because they cannot travel on these roads. This is not just an issue of people getting their children to school and getting to work, as important as those basic things that most people in metropolitan areas take for granted are. This is an issue that is affecting the productivity of our country. It is having a severe effect on the bottom line and restricting our ability to earn export dollars. (Time expired)

Mr MORRISON
 (Cook) (10:01):  It is Groundhog Day. It is February, appropriation bills are back before the House and once again the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship has been standing before the parliament and asking for more money. The minister for immigration is indeed the Oliver Twist of Australian politics. Every year he turns up and says, 'Please, sir, can I have some more?' And this time he is asking again for more. This year the ask is $330 million. Last year, on recurrent, the ask was $295 million and with capital included it was $511 million and the year before that it was $85.7 million. Every February this government, despite revealing blow-outs in budget year after year after year—so even after those blow-outs—has to come back and ask for yet more funds time and time again.


The blow-out this year in the appropriation bills is intended to deal with two principal problems. The first one is a further blow-out in the 2011-12 budget, which was already blown out at the time of the original budget to the tune of over a billion dollars a year from less than $100 million a year for asylum seeker costs when the Howard government left office. But it is also to deal with a further blow-out last year. So not only did they get this year's budget wrong yet again and have had to ask for more money; they have even had a blow-out in the expenses from last year of over $100 million. So once again this minister has come to this House and said, 'Please, sir, can I have some more?'


Well, as is the practice with money bills, I suppose the government is going to get what it wants yet again and once again taxpayers are going to have to shell out hundreds of millions of dollars for this government's border protection failures. This is a government that has blown out the Department of Immigration and Citizenship's budget to record levels. This is a government that in 2011-12 will cost taxpayers, for that department, $2.73 billion. That is the bill for expenses for this year for the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. This is a billion dollars more than the $1.69 billion it cost in 2007-08. That is why the government is asking for more money today as part of the debate on these bills. Also, DIAC's annual reports show that not only has there been this increase in cost but there has been a very significant increase in the size of the department itself. As to the number of permanent staff employed by DIAC between 2007 and 30 June 2011, there were 1,192 additional staff. So that is 1,192 additional officers within DIAC since this government came to office—an increase of 15 per cent over the last four years. During the same period the number of the highest paid senior executives, so the SE Service within DIAC, had also increased by 24 per cent. The median income for these positions in 2011 was between $180,000 and $210,000. This is a department that has gone completely out of control with costs and with the size of government. There is one simple reason for this: four years ago the government abolished the proven measures of the Howard government on border protection. Let us go through what the result has been. The minister has questioned figures relating to the blow-outs in the government's costs on border protection. I am happy to inform the minister by quoting from the government's own budget papers. Three years ago, in the budget estimates of 2009-10 and the additional estimates of 2009-10, there was a $207.5 million increase—a blow-out of the estimates of 2009-10 over the original budget of 2009-10. In the following year, in the 2010-11 budget they were $793.5 million over what they had said in the previous additional estimates, and when the next additional estimates came around the blow-out from the previous statement was $472 million. But they were just getting warmed up.


Strangely enough, after the election the additional estimates in 2010-11 showed a further blow-out over the budget estimates of 2010-11 of $1.5 billion. But they are still going, because in the additional estimates released last week the additional cost for asylum seeker management, netting off what they returned to the budget after the failed Malaysian people swap—so after they had put all that money back—was $866 million. That is a blow-out over the course of these last three years, from statement to statement, of $3.868 billion. That is the cost of this government's border protection failure—just under $3.9 billion.


When Senate estimates convened this week there were a lot of questions asked about the government decision to abolish the Pacific solution and temporary protection visas. The departmental secretary was asked whether he had advised the government of the potential cost implications of what he later described in his evidence as a major shift in policy. Once again, the secretary declined to answer this question. The only thing we can draw from the experience of the last three years is that the cost implications of that change in policy have so far been $3.9 billion.


This is a direct result of the change in government policy. In evidence, the secretary made it very clear that the reason for the blow-out in their total costs was the massive increase in costs related to the arrival of illegal boats to Australia. That is not in dispute. Under further questioning, Senator Lundy finally admitted that the increase in costs was a result of the change in policy. She coughed that up.



Mr Husic interjecting—




Mr MORRISON:
  She was so keen to interject during Senate estimates with Senator Cash that she finally admitted what everybody in this country knows—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  Order! The member for Chifley needs to remember my hearing is in question here. The more you yell, the louder he gets. The member for Cook has the call.




Mr MORRISON:
  What everyone now knows—the Labor Party and the government have finally admitted it—is that the decision to get rid of the Howard government's proven border protection policies has cost Australian taxpayers dearly. It is revealed here in the government's own figures—almost $4 billion in total. I am quite sure they are going to eclipse that $4 billion mark by the time we get to May because, as surely as night follows day, this minister for immigration always turns up asking for more money. When we left office there were just four people in detention who had arrived in Australia illegally by boat. Today that figure is more than 6,000. Back in 2007, early 2008, either the government completely ignored the advice of the secretary of the department of immigration that this significant change in policy would have these consequences or, frankly, the secretary never gave that advice. I do not know what is worse. This government is always parading itself around saying it always takes advice. Well, either the department of immigration did not advise this, and have been proved to be hopelessly wrong on the experience of these figures, or the advice was ignored by the minister at the time and by Prime Minister Rudd and Prime Minister Gillard following that. The Prime Minister has completed the job of removing every brick in the wall that John Howard built for border protection in this country. They have removed every brick in the wall. They either ignored that advice or that advice was never given. What it shows is that we have a crisis on our borders that this government is incapable of solving.


The government are not upfront about these costs. At the end of November last year they said the change in the forward estimates would be $197 million. After all the changes that they talked about, when their people-swap fell over through their own incompetence—when it fell over in the High Court, when it fell over in the parliament—and when they embraced the policies of the Greens and rejected the proven policies of the coalition, they said that the net impact of all of this to the budget would be $197 million. That is what the Treasurer told the country and that is what the minister for immigration told the country. Yet in these figures today we see that the actual net cost over the forward estimates is $750 million plus. In just 2½ months this mob blew out their own budget and their own estimates by almost 300 per cent. They cannot keep up with their border blowouts. They cannot possibly keep up with them because they have no idea what is happening out there on our borders and the costs just keep mounting up and up.


There are 6½ thousand more beds in our detention network today, announced by this government over the last four years, than there were four years ago. This government has spent more money on putting more beds in detention centres than they have on putting beds in public hospitals. On a day where this parliament is going to drive more people into public hospitals, this government's only record on putting beds in place in this country is in detention centres, at a cost of almost $500 million in capital over the last four years.


This government has a record of deceit when it comes to this issue also, because before the last election they said they were not going to expand the detention network in Australia. When they were challenged on that they said they were not going to expand it. What does the record show? Since the last election they have announced more than 4½ thousand beds in our detention network. Their budget has blown out in this area by $2.9 billion since the last election.


The government want to be trusted now that next year they are going to achieve $400 million in savings in this area, when every single time they have presented a budget and at additional estimates the costs have just gone up and up and up. Now they want the Australian people to believe it is all going to be fixed next year, despite the fact that by the end of next financial year, according to their own evidence at estimates, another 7½ thousand people will have turned up in boats and there will be just under 6,000 people in the detention network.


To achieve the figures in their budget they have to do the following—and they know this: they will have to visa out of the system by the end of next year another 5,000 people with permanent protection visas. They will have to grant another 5,000 permanent protection visas. That will reduce the number of visas given to offshore humanitarian entrants and refugee entrants by that amount—by another 5,000. That is going to be the humanitarian cost of this government's border protection failures. Those who are duly awaiting their time and their place will lose that opportunity because 5,000 people who turn up in a boat over the next 18 months are going to get their visa. In addition to that, they have to issue another 1,800 bridging visas for people who they expect to be in the system. We will see how that goes. That is what their figures rely on; they will not meet them and we will be back in this place a year from now. The only plan of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, who today wants to be the Treasurer—that is his exit plan from this portfolio—is not to stop the boats; it is to make Kevin Rudd Prime Minister so he can be Treasurer. And, based on these figures, if he does to our finances what he has done to the immigration portfolio heaven help us! Our finances will be in a worse state than our borders if this minister for immigration ever becomes Treasurer, which is his ambition.


This is a government that has no plan on this issue other than to blame the opposition, embrace the Greens and reject the proven policies of the coalition. That is its plan. Its plan is simply to blame the opposition for its own failures, which have delivered almost $4 billion in budget blowouts, have resulted in more than 15,000 people turning up on its watch and have seen our immigration network go from just four people in detention—you could almost put them in a phone box—to over 6,000 people, who are now costing taxpayers around $1.2 billion every single year.


I think that there is no issue that says more about this government's incompetence and their denial than this issue. This is a government that has completely lost the plot on this issue. They have no plan to fix it other than simply to blame the opposition and to carp and whinge. Today this government could implement Nauru. It could be done at a fraction of the cost of what the government says. (Time expired)

Mr MURPHY
 (Reid) (10:16):  I rise this morning to support the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2011-2012 and the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2011-2012, because they will provide funding over four years to establish a Clean Energy Regulator to administer the carbon-pricing mechanism. The regulatory functions under the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting System, the renewable energy target and the Carbon Farming Initiative will also be brought under the Clean Energy Regulator.


The responsibilities of the regulator will include assessing emissions data to determine each entity's liability; operating the Australian National Registry of Emissions Units; monitoring, facilitating and enforcing compliance with the carbon-pricing mechanism; allocating fixed-price and auction permits; applying legislative rules to determine eligibility for assistance in the form of freely allocated permits; and providing education on the carbon-pricing mechanism. And as you know, Deputy Speaker, the government will also provide further funding over four years for the Department of Finance and Deregulation to conduct gateway reviews of the establishment and operation of the regulator.


The bills also provide funds to the Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities to support the management of extractive industry activities, especially coal seam gas and major coalmining developments. These initiatives aim to build scientific evidence and understanding of the impacts on water resources of coal seam gas extraction and large coalmines.


The New South Wales government has already taken the scientific evidence for granted on coal seam gas extraction but, like its Liberal counterpart in Victoria, seems intent on standing in the way of businesspeople who want to develop wind power to feed into the electricity grid. Despite the lack of any evidence to support any harmful effects of wind farming, the New South Wales government has given the power of veto to anyone living within two kilometres of a proposed wind farm. These governments seem to have been unduly influenced by climate change deniers and sceptics, in particular the Australian Landscape Guardians, whose stated philosophy is to safeguard the landscape from 'inappropriate development'.


In an article published on the Independent Australia website on 24 July last year, investigative journalist Sandi Keane assembled some of the publicly available information on the opaque Landscape Guardians. They are modelled on the British Coastal Guardians and Country Guardians, who are associated with the nuclear power industry in the United Kingdom. In their opposition to wind farms, the Landscape Guardians do not mention the landscape but have discovered a previously unheard of medical condition that they call 'wind turbine syndrome'. They claim that wind farms cause sleep problems, headaches, dizziness, nausea, exhaustion, anxiety, anger, irritability, depression, tinnitus and concentration problems, and, astonishingly, they cause children to refuse to go to school. It's the truth!


The Landscape Guardians have set up a front called the Waubra Foundation, which is not based at Waubra but opposes the Waubra wind farm. Its so-called medical director, Sarah Laurie, a non-practising, unregistered doctor living in South Australia, claims that infrasound from wind turbines causes these problems. Most of my constituents at times suffer from almost all of these symptoms, although there is no wind farm anywhere near my inner-city electorate. Simon Chapman, Professor in Public Health at the University of Sydney, says that these symptoms are experienced by millions of Australians.


It is important to note that the Waubra Foundation is a powerful, well-resourced and growing anti-wind-power lobby group. Peter Mitchell, founder and Chairman of the Waubra Foundation, helped set up and fund the Australian Landscape Guardians. He is also spokesman for the Western Plains Landscape Guardians. Another director, Kathy Russell, is Vice-President of the Australian Landscape Guardians, Vice-President of the Victorian Landscape Guardians and spokesperson for the Western Plains, Mount Pollock Landscape Guardians and the Barrabool Hills Landscape Guardians. Yet another director, tycoon Tony Hodgson—as the Murdoch press calls him—helped fund the campaign against the Collector wind farm in New South Wales, just up the road from Canberra, and he is involved with the Booroowa Landscape Guardians to stop a $400 million wind farm proposed near Rugby and Booroowa in the south of the state. The Hon. Dr Michael Wooldridge, the former Howard government minister, is also a director.


Sandi Keane found that the foundation has no physical address in Waubra and indeed appears to have no local Waubra residents on its board. The address is a post-office box in South Melbourne, the same address as that of the Australian Landscape Guardians and Peter Mitchell.


The Landscape Guardians are well-known climate sceptics and deniers linked to the Liberal Party and the Institute of Public Affairs. They have a particularly close association with the IPA's Australian Environment Foundation, which is more interested in logging trees than conserving them. The Institute of Public Affairs has been giving its opinion on climate change for decades now on behalf of its supporters—Billiton; Western Mining; Caltex; Esso Australia, a subsidiary of Exxon; Shell; and Woodside Petroleum—and it also receives funding from Rupert Murdoch's News Ltd.


While the Waubra Foundation appears unconcerned about the landscape of wind farms, its only agenda is the so-called 'infrasound problems' caused by wind turbines. Peter Mitchell successfully objected to the number of turbines proposed for the Stockyard Hill wind farm near Beaufort in Victoria. He also successfully had them removed from the ridge that he could see from his property. Sandi Keane found also that Peter Mitchell has interests in the fossil fuel industry. These include as founding chairman of the Moonie Oil Company Ltd and chairman or director of similar companies including Clyde Petroleum plc, Avalon Energy Inc., North Flinders Mines Ltd and Paringa Mining & Exploration plc, most now delisted on the Australian Stock Exchange.


According to Lowell Resources Funds Management Pty Ltd, Mitchell's experience is derived from over 25 years involvement in companies that explored for, developed and financed gold, uranium, coal and base metal mines, oil and gas fields and pipeline systems in Australia and overseas. He has been chairman of Lowell Pty Ltd, the ultimate parent company of both Lowell Capital Ltd and Lowell Resources Funds Management Pty Ltd, a specialist fund investing in emerging mining and energy companies, since taken over by Future Corporation Australia Ltd.


Paul Miskelly, who represents both the Australian Landscape Guardians and the Taralga Landscape Guardians, worked for the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, ANSTO, for 32 years and gives talks on nuclear power. Climate scepticism is the stock in trade of the Landscape Guardians. Randall Bell, president of the Victorian Landscape Guardians, said in the Melbourne Age on 3 July 2010 that claims the earth is warming are scientifically unreliable and that the idea of man-made climate change is headed for the Y2K dustbin. But we do not see the Landscape Guardians campaigning alongside Lock the Gate, the New South Wales Farmers Federation and the Greens to halt the destruction of some of the best agricultural land in New South Wales and Queensland by coal seam gas miners. We do not see them campaigning in Victoria against Premier Ted Baillieu's decision to reopen Victoria to brown coal mining. Farmers on the best agricultural land in Gippsland now face losing their farms to dirty, inefficient brown coal mining. Is an open-cut mine a preferable landscape to a wind farm, where food can continue to be grown?


As with the Landscape Guardians, there is no information about funding or sponsorship of the Waubra Foundation. Yet money seems to be no object for its websites, campaigners, advertising, travel and media monitoring.


As I said earlier, in the Boorowa area a $300 million wind farm is being proposed. At Rye Park the Epuron energy company wants to build 80 to 110 turbines, which will generate power for 90,000 homes. But, as Sandi Keane found, there is someone with a property near Yass whose influence on governments and public opinion is huge. Besieged media boss Rupert Murdoch owns Cavan, a substantial rural property in the grazing country nearby. No other media group in Australia has run a more distorted and dishonest scare campaign about wind farms than the Murdoch group. The district of Yass has in the planning stages a larger proportion of wind farms than elsewhere in Australia. These are planned at Bango, 25 km north of Yass; Birrema, 30 km west of Yass; Rye Park, 25 km north-east of Yass; and the Yass Valley itself. There are wind farms at Caroll's Ridge, Conroy's Gap, Coppabella Hills and Marilba Hills.


In 2010 Family First's own climate change sceptic, Senator Steve Fielding, initiated a Senate inquiry into so-called turbine sickness. The report was released last year. The Senate inquiry found no proof of a direct link between wind farms and the so-called wind turbine syndrome. The submission of the National Health and Medical Research Council concluded that there is no published scientific evidence to support adverse effects of wind turbines on health.


Professor Peter Seligman of the Melbourne Energy Institute also gave evidence to the inquiry. Professor Seligman spent most of his working life working on the cochlear implant. He has a PhD in electronic engineering. He understands infrasound better than most. He told Sandi Keane that the level of infrasound at the beach is far higher than that from wind farms. Beyond 360 metres the level of infrasound emitted from a wind farm, typically between one and 20 cycles per second, is below the ambient levels near a beach and below that in the central business district of any city. On the other hand, we are all subjected to far higher internally self-generated natural infrasound levels, which clearly are not a problem.


The Victorian Department of Health indicated that it had examined both peer-reviewed and validated scientific research and concluded that 'the weight of evidence indicated that there are no direct health effects from noise.'


Dr Sarah Laurie's evidence included evidence from Nina Pierpont, an American general practitioner who claims to be an authority on wind turbine syndrome. Pierpont is the author of a self-published book containing descriptions of the health problems of merely 10 families—that is, 38 people—in five different countries who once lived near wind turbines and who are convinced that turbines made them sick. Medical experts in Australia have said that, given that there are about 100,000 turbines around the world, her sample is too small to have any scientific value. There were no scientific controls, and the symptoms described were common in any community. Dr Laurie also tried to appeal against a proposed wind farm at Allandale East in South Australia. Her appeal failed on the basis of the same evidence from the medical community. Gary Wittert, a professor of medicine at the University of Adelaide, said there was no credible evidence that wind turbines have adverse effects on health. A recent parliamentary inquiry into wind farms in New South Wales dismissed Pierpoint's study, particularly since her findings were not published in a peer reviewed journal. In its submission to the Senate inquiry the group Doctors for the Environment also agreed 'there is no convincing evidence in the scientific literature of direct physiological effects occurring at sound levels commonly associated with modern wind turbines'. The building of the Waubra wind farm provided an injection of $58.4 million to the local economy through the economic activity associated with 160 local jobs. Ongoing employment from those jobs at Waubra adds a further $7.79 million each year to the local economy. These figures have been generated by the City of Ballarat using REMPLAN modelling.


Kate Redwood, a director of Hepburn Wind, said the strategy used to get community support in Daylesford included monitoring noise at those houses within two kilometres of the turbines. This successful strategy has led to the formation of a new organisation called Embark, which offers advice on the management of community projects. As a result of the Senate inquiry, public health authorities will keep up the monitoring and the wind industry will continue to improve its modelling and community relations. I commend the bills to the House.

Mr EWEN JONES
 (Herbert) (10:31):  Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker, and congratulations on your elevation to the panel. I see a great career there for you! I welcome the opportunity to speak on the appropriation bills. There are a wide range of things in Townsville that I think the government should be looking at. I would like to start with education. I declare an interest in that my wife is an early childhood teacher. Nonetheless, I feel that my comments will be very pertinent.


When it comes to education we must make sure that the foundation and the building blocks are there. When you build a house you do not start with the roof; you start with the foundations. Early childhood education is where we should be spending the money. Too often we see aid time being taken away from teachers and actual teaching time being reduced. We should be making sure that children have activity based education with outcomes as opposed to desk learning. Funds should be allocated so that the teachers can teach and are taught what to do.


One thing I will say—and this will be a common theme—is that I have a forklift drivers licence but you certainly would not want me loading your truck. There is a difference between having a qualification and being qualified. There is a difference between having a degree in education and being a teacher. A friend of mine, Pat Ernst, is a very good rugby league coach. He says the longest distance any coach will ever see is that between the coach's lips and the players ears and into his brain so that he understand it. Therefore it goes with teaching that, if we can get these building blocks in, if we can get the play based mechanisms through and concentrate on early childhood, the rest will come.


I worry a great deal about the money being spent on NAPLAN and the My School website. After an initial burst of glory the My School website is now something that is not going to be referred to. I worry that, with NAPLAN, we are seeing teachers in the grades that are not subject to those tests practising for the next year's tests. I worry about what is happening in primary schools and high schools. Where are sport, art, music, play and everything else? I would like to see teachers given the opportunity to use their environment and their resources as best fits them. Teaching arithmetic in Mt Isa can be very different from teaching arithmetic in the inner suburbs of Sydney or Melbourne. They should be allowed to do that. So long as the outcome is that two plus two equals four in every instance, we should be okay with that.


On higher education and research, I am very lucky to have in my electorate James Cook University, the only university in Australia which has higher education in a tropical environment at its core. One of the projects about which I would question this government's support for renewable energy is the James Cook University algae project. With this algae project it is completely feasible that we could have a coal fired power station with zero emissions by integrating an algae plant into the design of a world's best practice coal fired power station. Therefore, we would have the cheapest form of power available, being a coal fired power station, and zero emissions. I just cannot see the downside to it. In the Galilee Basin you would be able to build something like this at places like Prairie or Torrens Creek, which would feed into the north-west minerals province and allow things like the Kennedy wind farm, which I will touch on later, to feed into a national grid. Remember that the national grid only goes to Woodstock, which is basically 50 kilometres away from Townsville. That is the extent of the national grid into western Queensland.


The CSIRO scientists at the ATSIP building in Townsville are looking into the science of using fresh water. If we are to make the north-west province of Queensland—the Mitchell grass plains west of Townsville—the food bowl, we must listen to the science. I was happy in the end that our scientists were given their 3½ per cent pay rise, but it was disappointing that they had to go cap in hand to stop-work meetings to make a point that this research is valuable. If we are to be the smart generation and tap into this Asian century, it must be driven by the science. Places like James Cook University and CSIRO are exactly the places we should be focusing on.


Our medical school is turning out first-class medical graduates. Tropical medical training is taking people with a degree and turning them into general practitioners. I would like to congratulate the government on the funding that they have provided to tropical medical training. In the future as this program and this organisation become even more important, with the numbers coming through, I do believe that more money and attention should be given, especially in regional Australia, to the training and assistance given to international medical graduates, as they still make up a large number of our medical practitioners. They should be helped as they play such a key role in places where Australian GPs do not go.


In relation to James Cook University I would like to push the government even further. They have not committed to the Australian institute of tropical health and medicine. This is a vital piece of infrastructure in the tropical world. Papua New Guinea is just at the top of Australia—it is a short boat ride. We have a ward at the Thursday Island Hospital dedicated to people with drug resistant tuberculosis and malaria. From there it is only a quick trip to the mainland of Australia. We saw our first Australians become the most susceptible to the H1N1 or bird flu viruses. Once these things come to the mainland we may see catastrophic events. Let us hope the situation is under control in Papua New Guinea. But if there were to be a breakdown of law and order we would see a great influx of people coming across the Torres Strait into Australia, and with that will come the need for health care. There are things we have to do for the tropical world. With around half the population living in the tropical world, the work that this organisation should be doing should be supported.


I would also like to push the government to support Youth with a Mission. Ken Mulligan has been in this House and spoken to members on both sides. YWAM take a boat as far as they can into the remote provinces of Papua New Guinea, where they provide quality dental care, eye surgery, GP visits for people who have never seen a doctor and dental visits for people who have never seen a dentist. That should be supported.


The Australian Institute of Marine Science has been granted great funding to produce an ocean simulator. This will be world-leading research. It is not in my electorate but it all goes through Townsville. We will have PhD students and researchers coming from all over the world to use this fantastic facility. The Australian Institute of Marine Science is also leading the world in farming and breeding lobsters. This is an incredibly difficult thing. We now have them up to wriggler stage and we are seeing the fruits of that. When we are talking about food security, especially in the tropical world, where we are seeing seas being fished out, this must be supported.


Ian Poiner, the recent CEO of the Australian Institute of Marine Science, organised the first-ever audit of Australia's fish stocks, and he still thinks we only know about 10 to 20 per cent of what is in our seas. John Gunn is the new CEO of the Australian Institute of Marine Science. We are talking about letters, and other members of this House will have received these, in relation to protecting the Coral Sea and making it a marine park. It takes 38 hours from Townsville, from the Australian Institute of Marine Science, under full steam to get to this place in the world that they want to turn into a park. But the operational funding for the Australian Institute of Marine Science continues to shrink. So if we want this research done and if we want these things protected we must make sure the operational funding is connected.


Townsville is a very proud defence city. We have now welcomed 3RAR to Townsville, making the readily-deployable forces even greater in Townsville. Berth 10 at Townsville port is under construction. There is bipartisan support for berthing of the landing helicopter dock vessel and for readily-deployables in times of emergency. We saw during last year's Cyclone Yasi that roads were cut and the naval fleet was out of order and we could not get troops quickly enough to places like Tully and Cardwell, which were severely affected. I would like to see an LHD there—and we are getting two, one based in Townsville permanently and one based in Exmouth permanently—and in that way it is at the pointy end of where we can organise all these things to be. It would also give Townsville properly the perfect three-force representation. With the air force facility at Garbutt I would like to see an increased presence and training opportunities there. We have the MHR90 simulator going in there. But there are real problems there and I would like the defence department and the ministers involved in defence to look at the structure of payments here. I have been contacted by the guys at Kookaburra Concrete. They have done the flooring for this, for an organisation that won the tender and is based in South Australia. This organisation has gone into administration over a failed project in South Australia, leaving our guys, our subcontractors in Townsville, very exposed. We all know when it comes to the administration and liquidation of companies that there are real issues. We do have to make sure that these people are taken care of.


As for renewable energy, the Kennedy wind farm, outside Richmond and Hughenden along the Flinders Highway, will bring good power at around $45 per megawatt hour—but they will produce this power and there is nowhere for it to go. I would like to see support for a powerline, be it by CopperString or somebody else, for something like this, which is about renewable energy, to feed into a national grid.


I would like to restate for the record the coalition's support for fair indexation for DFRDB pensions. It is our policy now, it was our policy leading up to 2010 and it is our policy going into the future. I would like to call on the government to recognise the folly of this and that it has gone on since the Whitlam era. We have had more than enough time to fix this, and we have not addressed it. They are not asking for anything extra. They are asking for what is fair.


I would also like to come out and state very clearly for the record that I support the National Disability Insurance Scheme. But we must make sure of how we are going to pay for it. It may get me in trouble with Scott Stidson and Garth Brimelow at home and all the people at Cootharinga in Townsville but we have to get it right and we cannot afford to have people fall through the gaps because we have acted too quickly. Therefore I would like to see as much bipartisanship on this as possible, working towards making sure that everyone will be covered by this so that everyone is brought along and, more importantly than that, so that we are bringing along people who are not actually affected by it at the moment to make them understand what we are trying to do. If someone has a work accident and is put in a wheelchair, as Garth has been, that person is covered, but if you are driving on the weekend and you have an accident—or if you fall off your own balcony—and you are then in a wheelchair for the rest of your life you get nothing. That is what we are trying to cover. These are the sorts of things that we must do. It must be paid for and it must have broad community support. The Every Person Counts campaign is just the start of the conversation. We have to explain to everyone what we are trying to do and why it matters.


I would like to echo the statements in the House today about closing the gap and I would like to echo the words of the Leader of the Opposition in the main chamber this morning. In my electorate is the community of Palm Island, where we have 95 per cent unemployment, yet QBuild, the Queensland government organisation, send tradesmen over to build small houses. The houses are poorly built and poorly designed, and they do not care. We have tradesmen on Palm Island who cannot get jobs. We have 95 per cent unemployment and it has been that way all the way through.


Truancy are education are major issues on Palm Island. If they do not learn to read and write, they will be doomed to repeat the cycle of poor outcomes we are currently experiencing. Too many young people are in jail now because they started as a 16- or 17-year-old driving unlicensed cars and they could not pass the test. They become part of the system and get arrested; sooner or later they are going to end up in jail. If they do not want to do this, if they do not want to end up there, parental and personal responsibility is required to make sure that they do get to school. As the Leader of the Opposition said this morning, truancy is a real issue and we have to make sure that these people are going to school. I have spoken at schools to Indigenous groups and Indigenous students and quite often they say they were not at school that day or that week when they were asked if they had a question for me. This cannot be let go.


Education is the key to everything. I never want to try to simplify the situation. It is a very deep and complicated issue, but we have to know that education is the key. I would like to really push it on everyone, especially on Palm Island, that getting your kids to school—from the mayor's children down, whoever the mayor should be after the last next election—is the key to everyone having a better outcome on Palm Island and in Townsville.

Ms SMYTH
 (La Trobe) (10:46):  I am very pleased to be able to speak on the appropriations legislation before us today because this legislation is a very clear way of seeing what the priorities of the government are and what they have been since coming to office. It is particularly important to look at the appropriations that we are considering today, and those that have been made since the government came to office, in the context of the very many challenges that the Australian nation has faced during that time and the way that the government has navigated the nation through them. The spending priorities that are set are a pretty clear reflection of the kinds of priorities a government has for the nation.


It is very interesting in that context to reflect on some of the contributions made by members in this debate, and in broader debates throughout this place, particularly since the commencement of this parliamentary year. I am thinking particularly of those opposite who have contributed to the debate and have largely forgotten, it seems, about two of the very significant things that have impacted upon our economic circumstances and our fortunes generally, namely, the global financial crisis and the significant natural disasters that our country has faced. In the midst of all of these very difficult circumstances for individuals and for our country, this government has consistently shown that it prioritises jobs and that it will support the kinds of social reforms that Labor has always stood for. This includes things like supporting people on a pension, ensuring that families have an opportunity to get a decent level of financial support to be able to look after their children well and provide for their futures and ensuring that our country gets the kind of health and education commitments that it needs in order to become a better country and that its citizens need so that they have a very good quality of life and good prospects in the future. It is extraordinary that some of the comments of those opposite have revealed how little regard they have for such very significant events as the global financial crisis. Indeed, as recently as yesterday, we heard the member for Goldstein speaking in the House during the matter of public importance and mentioning the GFC as some sort of by-line, some sort of anecdote in history, just a blip—




Mr Husic:
   The Asian economic crisis was more important apparently.




Ms SMYTH:
  Indeed. He has actually referred to the government's response as 'a panic reaction to the global financial crisis'. This is understating something that the world is continuing to deal with the aftermath of on a daily basis. A panic reaction! So, while this government was committing funding and making appropriations for the protection of jobs in our country, while this government was committing funds to a stimulus package which has been lauded around the world by countries which would far prefer to be in our circumstances today, we see the economic luminaries of the Liberal Party referring to the government's stimulus spend as a panic reaction to the global financial crisis. It really is quite extraordinary. It comes in the context of all of these 'woulda, shoulda, coulda' commitments that we hear from the Liberals so very regularly. If these guys had been in government, quite clearly our unemployment figures would be double what they are now, quite clearly we would be facing extraordinarily dark financial circumstances. I realise that those members opposite continue to look incredulous about the global financial crisis because it is, in their view, a mere byway in history. But we take it seriously and, strangely enough, economists around the world take it quite seriously and I imagine they would not refer to our response to it as a panic reaction.


Once again, appropriations—what you choose as a government to commit the Australian people's resources to—really do reflect one's priorities, and there could not be a starker example of our priorities for jobs, for the growth of this country, for economic stability and economic security than our response to the global financial crisis. So it bears repeating, and repeat it I certainly will, happily.


We do not hear quite so much from those opposite about the detail of what they might have done had they been in office. There are many reasons for that. One is that they are still not entirely sure about where they would take the country on the question of the surplus, should they ever get the opportunity to come to office. So in the context of an appropriations debate it is very interesting to think about what their priorities might be. It is in fact difficult to get a read on most of them because we do not know day to day what any member of their frontbench and all the people behind them might think about a surplus, might think about our future economic prosperity. We still do not have a complete figure on the extent of the black hole. We think it is about $70 billion, but again that changes depending on who you are speaking to and who has pulled out the abacus on any given day on the opposition benches. Most recently and most pertinently in the context of the current debate on the private health insurance rebate means test, we are still not clear what they are intending to do on that—they might repeal it, they might wind it back—or whether their words on this are as hollow as their words on every other significant debate in this country, whether they will actually stand by their bluff and bluster or whether they are just going to go very quietly on it after the debate has concluded in this place.


It has been very interesting to reflect on some of the things that have come up in the context of this appropriations debate and other significant economic debates which occasionally those opposite choose to engage in, depending on their feel at the time. But the things that we are seeking to get on with and the things that we have made appropriations for and will continue to make appropriations for are around the education of our nation, the development of skills and training for young people in our nation, to provide for lifelong learning, to ensure that our children have the skills that they need for future career development but also to ensure the future economic prosperity of our country. I was delighted at the end of last year to have announced in my electorate a commitment by this government to two new trade training centres. We know that, when we came to government, those opposite had so badly underfunded skills and training in this country that electorates like mine really had very little in the way of skills and infrastructure investment. It was enormously pleasing to have been able to visit both of the schools that will be sites for the trade training centres. The first of the schools that I visited was Belgrave Heights Christian College, which has been given a commitment of $1.2 million for a new trade training centre to be built there. That will enable children and young adults from the area to develop skills in hospitality. This is a facility that is going to be able to be used—and I know that the school is very willing for it to be made available for this—by students from right around the hills area. In the hills area there is a great deal of interest in this trade training facility.


The reason this government has committed money to this—the reason we have committed so much to skills and training in electorates such as mine—is we know that a person who leaves school before finishing year 12 will earn around 20 per cent below average earnings. That is the reason this government, through its appropriations and through its policy approach since coming to office, has invested and is investing in trade training. It is for the future.


Unfortunately, we tend not to see terribly much from those opposite on this. We know that they defunded skills and training while they were in office. Belgrave Heights Christian College was also the beneficiary of a very significant BER investment. They are delighted with this government's investment in the school and the benefit for the surrounding community. The principal, Andy Callow, was incredibly enthusiastic about the opportunities available to students at his school. He very generously has extended those opportunities to students at other schools in the area.


The second of the trade training centres—which are, as all of us on this side know, part of a national program to invest in trade training right around the country—to be established in my electorate will be at Hillcrest Christian College at the southern end of my electorate. This will benefit students from areas such as Clyde, Officer, Berwick, Beaconsfield and surrounding areas in the south-east of Melbourne. I was delighted to be able to visit that school. The centre is going to provide skills in the equine industry and that is particularly appropriate for the part of the world in which it is located. I was pleased to be able to speak to the principal, Daniel Pampuch, to get a very good understanding of the kinds of skills that will be on offer for students right around the southern part of my electorate.


These are serious and practical commitments, things that stand to benefit many students into the future. They are just two of the commitments that I could mention. Approximately 61 schools in my electorate have benefited from the BER program. Around 118 projects have been completed or are underway. Those projects involve the commitment of around $110 million in my electorate alone. Schools know the priority that this government puts on education. They know that there are practical and real commitments being made, commitments that were never made under the 'woulda, shoulda, coulda' years of the Howard government. We hear the revisionist commitment to education that those opposite supposedly now have, but we all know better. Virtually all of my schools, it is fair to say, also know better.


These are the things that we are doing in education. We have made very significant commitments to things like the National Solar Schools Program, which schools in my electorate have benefited from. There is an enormous range of things happening right around the country and in my electorate in education that I have mentioned in this place previously and that I will continue to extol the virtues of both here and elsewhere.


Government investment in another key areas has, as so many Australians know, created enormous practical changes, and that is the commitment of this government in health. My electorate has been the beneficiary of some of the appropriations made by this government in health in each year it has been in office. Nationally, the government's commitment to hospital funding has seen an increase of $20 billion since 2008. That is no mean feat, and it is certainly no mean feat in the context of an opposition which maintains its commitment to cut spending in health on things like GP superclinics and a whole variety of other things that this government has done to make practical health improvements for a constituency such as mine. We know that when those opposite were in office they slashed the health budget by $1 billion. Indeed, the Leader of the Opposition was principally responsible for that piece of policy work.


In my electorate, I want to focus on the commitment to mental health investment that this government has made. Nationally, this government has committed to $2.2 billion in early intervention and care in mental health. I am very pleased to say that my electorate will be the beneficiary of a regional headspace unit, which will offer support and assistance to so many young people in what is one of the fastest growing areas of Melbourne and one of the fastest growing areas of our country.

"Entsch, Warren, MP",LP,2012-02-15,"



Mr ENTSCH
 (Leichhardt—Chief Opposition Whip) (11:39):  I rise today to speak on Appropriation Bill (No.3) 2011-12 and Appropriation Bill (No.4) 20011-12. I am particularly concerned because the purpose of these bills is to continue to raise additional revenue. We see major blow-outs in a broad range of areas. I think immigration is a classic example, where there is an additional $330 million to cover last year's underestimations. We are now looking at a $1 billion fee in relation to a failed policy. Prior to 2007 this issue had been comprehensively addressed by a government that I was very proud to be in.


I do apologise for my tardiness. My legs slowed me down a little. We have just come back from a vote in the House and in my view we are going to see a very significant winding back of private health insurance in this country. That in itself is going to force a lot more people to either exit private health insurance because it will become unaffordable or, at the very least, reduce their cover. In doing so, it is going to put a massive impost on regional hospitals. As I spoke about last night, in Cairns they are already bursting at the seams and do not have the capacity because of underfunding and gross mismanagement by the state government and the politicisation of the health bureaucracy, which has seen some appalling decisions. It is struggling to cope. When you have a look at that and then you have a look at the money that has been squandered over the last few years, you have to despair at the money that was lost—$2.4 billion on pink batts—and at the lives that were lost, including one up in my region. We are familiar with the other fiascos. The school building program up in our area was a joke quite frankly.


But there are other impacts. Last year I raised the issue of the flooding of six communities in the outer islands of the Torres Strait. After not getting any satisfaction or any interest from the government, I made a decision to put up a private member's motion. As that private member's motion was going through, I was a little surprised but also pleased that I was approached by Simon Crean's office asking me to delay the voting until August. From the advice I received from his office, the government was of the view that they would support the building of these walls with a $22 million investment. Rather than play politics with it, I agreed to hold it over. His problem was that he did not want to take the money out of the Regional Development Australia Fund. He wanted to find, in their words, another bucket of money. I agreed to that in the interests of having the matter resolved, appreciating that about a third of the Saibai Island cemetery had already been washed out into the sea, that there was $1 billion worth of infrastructure on these six islands that needed to be protected and that there were some serious health risks in relation to the inundation of water during the king tide period.


The vote eventually went through in August and I wrote a letter to Minister Crean thanking him for his cooperation and consideration with regard to the urgent needs of the Torres Strait Island communities and asking if he could give me a time frame for when the money would be available to start addressing these concerns. I should have been suspicious when there was a delay in his response. Eventually I got that response. I got it just before the Christmas break. I had gone around and seen the minister. At that point, he started umming and ahing—he was surrounded by department officials—and he said he would have a letter to me shortly.


Just before Christmas, I got a Christmas present from Simon Crean. Basically, he wrote to me and said: 'This is not a problem of the government; this is something that has to go back to local government. It's a state government, local government problem. We give financial assistance grants to the Torres Strait council for $6 million a year. Let them fix the problem.' This is in direct contradiction to the commitment that was given. I actually have an email from one of his senior staff members apologising to me for the deceit and for the misleading arrangement that they made. At every opportunity I get, I will continue to remind the Torres Strait Islander people of the deceit by Minister Crean—I think it was him more than his office because I actually have an apology from one of his former staff.


Sadly, because of that deceit, we have now seen the king tides hit again. We have seen more of the cemeteries—people's families—being washed out to sea, never to be recovered. I was amazed to find that this same government, at the same time, committed $328.2 million to micro Pacific nations to assist them in dealing with climate change. That money goes through the UN. Guess what that is going for? We see all of the problem at the moment about leadership. This is buying a position through the UN for none other than Mr K Rudd. They do not realise that the islands in the Torres Strait are in the Pacific. They do not realise that the islands in the Torres Strait are actually part of Australia. And these islands are having massive damage every year in king tides. It is totally fixable. They could do it over two years with $22 million.




Mr Tehan:
  22?




Mr ENTSCH:
  22. Do you know what the problem with the Torres Strait Islanders is? They do not have a vote on the UN. We wonder, if we were to get them a vote, how quickly the government would be racing out there to get things fixed. You know: another vote with the UN; another way of getting rid of a thorn in the side of this government.


At every opportunity, I will continue to raise this. I think it is absolutely appalling that $328 million of taxpayers' money can go over to those microcountries but we cannot afford to save Australian communities suffering from the same challenges. It is just absolutely appalling.


While I am on that subject, I will talk about some other issues that we are facing too. We remember quite clearly the building revolution that we had in the stimulus package. How great was that? That was going to really make things happen. Of course, it was another example of wasted opportunities and a continued, building deficit, which facilitates the requirement that we have now for raising more money to pay for misjudgments or miscalculations in funding. In spending the money on those school halls, they had another layer of bureaucracy. They should have invested in more practical infrastructure.


In my electorate of Leichhardt, for example, schools are notoriously lacking in basic facilities. I am not referring to schools in remote communities here, which have been traditionally neglected by state governments, or even city schools. In some cases, only the threat of strike action by teachers and protests by parents have forced the issue of funding. Trinity Beach State School, which is in the northern suburbs in Cairns, was so run down that parents threatened to take their kids out of school unless basic issues such as covered play areas, rusted gutters, drainpipes, poor drainage and leaky, smelly toilet blocks were fixed. The state government only started to put money into those after parents shamed them into doing it.


The sad part about it is that the stimulus packages that we have heard so much about in recent years certainly failed to equip schools with much-needed facilities. I think that, again, it is another indictment of seriously failed policies, which at some stage we are going to have to address. Another area I would like to mention is our banks. There have been a lot of issues about banks in recent times and a lot of concerns about the dominance of the major four. Recently we had the decision from ANZ to independently raise interest rates. And, of course, the others all followed because they are very keen to get their snouts in the trough and take as much as they can from their mortgage holders. The greed of these banks, in their pursuit of increased profits at the expense of their customers, is most evident.


Another thing the big four banks are doing is changing their loan-to-valuation ratios. In my area, where we have been doing it tough for the last four or five years, they have been adjusting their loan-to-valuation ratios. They used to be around 70 to 80 per cent but they are now dropping them to around 60 to 65 per cent. At the expense of their borrowers, the banks are getting their valuers to go in and revalue the properties. The banks are telling the valuers what price they expect and they are bringing the value down by about 20 per cent. The valuers have got no choice; if they do not do it they have got no work. So they are doing this. And the borrowers are charged for the privilege. The banks come back to the borrower and say: 'Your valuation has dropped by 20 per cent and we've adjusted the loan-to-valuation ratio. We know you've made every payment that has ever been required of you but you now need to put in X amount of dollars to fix that adjustment. If you don't, you must sell any other real estate or property you have or we're going to come in and take back your property.' This is the sort of thing that is happening. It puts huge pressure on many businesses in the area. It is quite frightening to see and I think we need to be very vigilant with this. I think it is about time we had some sort of inquiry into the practices of the big banks.


But there is an alternative. There is a little bank in Cairns that has been going for 112 years. It is called the Cairns Penny Savings and Loans. I declare an interest here. I actually use it as my preferred bank. It is totally based in Cairns. We have got Peter Phillips and his team. They are all local people in that bank. There is a local board with all local people. The bank was originally established in 1899 by a group of locals who noted that banking in those days was aimed at the more lucrative trading cycles and tended to overlook the needs of local residents. What has changed in 112 years!


This bank has been an outstanding success in our region. Not only are their interest rates very competitive but they have the trust of the customers. You can walk in and talk to them anytime. They do not have all these undisclosed fees for services that continue to escalate in the big banks. They have not had to wind back these fees—as we see some of the big banks doing because they have been subject to a whole range of criticism because people just cannot afford it anymore—as they have never had them in the first place.


The Treasurer says you can walk away from the big banks. But we need to be looking at ways we can establish more of these wonderful little institutions like the Penny Savings and Loans. That will be real competition to the greedy big four and it will get community banking, and trust, back into our communities. That is the sort of thing that will actually make a difference. With all these inquiries and everything, the big fellas will still find ways around it. But if we find ways of making it easier to establish these little community banks I think you will find it will make a profound difference for our communities. (Time expired)

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2012-02-15,"



Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (11:54):  I rise today to speak about investment, something that the Gillard Labor government is not afraid to make—particularly when it comes to Canberra and the people here who strive to make this town the best capital city in the world. The government is committed to delivering a strong clean energy future for Australia, improving our economy and returning the budget to surplus in 2012-13.


The 2011-12 budget delivered some great things for Canberra. Our nation's capital saw investment of $82.2 million for roads, $30.6 million for the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, $33.9 million for the Australian War Memorial and $1.7 million for a new exhibition on World War I, $6.1 million in base funding for the High Court, $2 million for the completion of the National Gallery of Australia building and $2.1 million for Australian Disability Enterprises to support the work of Koomarri.


Koomarri is based in my electorate. It provides a great service to disabled Canberrans and to the carers and parents of those disabled Canberrans. I attended an event late last year where I met with a number of carers and their disabled children, some of whom are quite profoundly disabled. One of the key or fundamental messages I got from the conversations I had with those parents—who were quite often in tears and very distressed and concerned about what is going to happen to their children if they pass on or if they become ill at some stage—was, 'Bring on the National Disability Insurance Scheme.' These people want the National Disability Insurance Scheme. They see the value of it, and the sooner they can get it the better. It was very strong and profound message. Many of these parents were in tears because they are terribly worried about what is going to happen to their children. Some of the children were in their early 20s. Their parents were a bit older—in their late 50s and 60s—and they were concerned about what is going to happen to their children if they get ill and eventually do pass away. The message from them was, 'Please—we love the National Disability Insurance Scheme and we want it to come along as soon as possible.'


Canberra, and the indeed the nation, has also undoubtedly benefited from a range of investments in health, training, infrastructure, small business and families. I would like to outline some of the achievements we have made in those areas today. Better health and a better health system will always be a Labor priority. We were the ones who introduced Medicare. A universal health system is in the Labor DNA. It is fundamental to Labor's identity. In the ACT, the federal government has invested $67 million in a range of health reforms, including $8.3 million to expand the capacity of public hospital emergency departments, $26 million in capital and recurrent funding to deliver 21 subacute beds, $6.8 million to boost elective surgery capacity at the Canberra Hospital and $7.5 million in flexible capital funding.


In the past 12 months I have been out to the Canberra Hospital on a number of occasions with the former minister for health and the ACT Chief Minister, and had a number of tours of the great new facilities that are being built and expanded out there. The Canberra Hospital in Woden, which is in my electorate, is a great institution and very much loved by Canberrans. Canberrans have a great sense of ownership of the Canberra Hospital. They also have a very keen interest in its future. The Canberra Hospital services about 30 per cent of the region—so it is not just a hospital for Canberra, it is a hospital for the capital region. Through our investments, and also the investments of the ACT government, we are seeing it ever expanding, ever growing, and ever providing better health services for the people of Canberra.


Among the funding that we have provided to the Canberra Hospital and to health in the region is funding for 24 regional cancer centres around Australia to bring services closer to patients. I was pleased last year to be joined by the previous minister, Nicola Roxon, to turn the first sod on a fantastic new regional cancer centre to support and treat people from the ACT and our region—that 30 per cent in the region that are battling cancer. This centre will provide support to half a million people in the region. It will be a wonderful support to them and their families, and I am very much looking forward to watching this cancer centre being built over the next 12 months and coming years. It will provide a much needed facility to Canberrans and also to people in the region. It will also provide an opportunity for people in the region to stay in Canberra to get the support that they need when they are battling cancer or coming up to be diagnosed with potential cancer. As we all know from our own personal experiences and the experiences of people in our electorates, it can be very challenging and confronting if you are diagnosed with cancer and then to have to go through that journey of travelling interstate or intraregion to get your treatment can also be very challenging and often quite lonely. This cancer centre will provide much needed support and respite for those cancer sufferers and for their families. It is a very welcome initiative. I was proud that the Gillard government contributed some $30 million to this $46 million project.


But Labor's investment in health goes beyond Canberra. For a start, we have invested $2.2 billion in mental health, which includes 30 new headspace centres to bring the national total to 90 and provide nationwide coverage, up to 12 additional youth psychosis centres, 40 more family support services, 425 more personal helpers and mentors, and $344 million for new support services for the severely mentally ill and the National Mental Health Commission. I am very much looking forward to speaking tonight in the adjournment debate on post-traumatic stress disorder and what is happening in this space and the range of support mechanisms that are set up to deal with this disorder. It is one of those things that does afflict many people and can often be quite invisible. So I am looking forward to bringing people's attention to that in the adjournment debate tonight. There is also another $3 billion to improve hospitals and cancer facilities throughout Australia. I mentioned what was happening in Canberra but that applies right across the nation.


The Gillard Labor government is also investing $53 million to help improve access to public dental services. This investment is important because in 2007 Labor inherited a health shambles: six in 10 Australians were living with doctor shortages, public hospitals were run into the ground and bulkbilling was in national decline. Since then, Labor has worked to turn this Liberal shambles around. We increased capital works with $1.8 billion to build and rebuild 63 hospitals and health centres. We funded more doctors and nurses and boosted Medicare rebates to help bulkbilling grow. We delivered national health reform one year ago this week, ending the state and federal blame game in health. We have delivered more money, more beds, less waste and less waiting for public hospitals nationwide. There has also been our investment in nurses. We are training an extra 1,000 nurses every year and an extra 5,500 doctors over 10 years. We have increased public hospital funding by 50 per cent and reached agreement with states and territories on funding future public hospital growth via an extra 1,300 federally funded hospital beds and a further 13,000 residential aged care places. We are doing more to ensure there is fairness in our health system. This will be done through a means test of the private health insurance rebate, which looks on track. It has been passed today. So a household on $1,000 does not subsidise the insurance of one on $500,000.


The Gillard Labor government's commitment to health just goes on and on. We are also equipping 120 hospitals with new elective surgery equipment and/or operating theatres. We are investing in new community health programs, including plain packaging of tobacco products, tough new restrictions on tobacco advertising and subsidised nicotine replacement therapies. We are investing in the after-hours GP helpline for 24-hour day access to expert health advice. These are just some of the latest investments in health. This is because only Labor cares about delivering world-class health care for all Australians and only Labor can be trusted to keep our health and our public hospital system strong. I look forward to seeing even more investment in the health services that will be possible with the introduction of the means test for the private health insurance rebate.


I turn now to infrastructure, which is a fundamental framework for us to enhance productivity and to grow this nation. In terms of infrastructure, the Gillard Labor government has invested $1.1 million to fix local black spots on top of the $82 million for road infrastructure this financial year—this is just in the Canberra context. There was also the announcement by Minister Albanese of $144 million in funding for the Majura Parkway. That is perhaps the most welcome announcement of all, as it delivers something that has been needed for many years. The ACT government will co-fund that. It is very welcome news. We have the Tuggeranong Parkway and Gungahlin Drive linking one side of the city from north to south. But we now need to have the other side of the city linked from north to south, and the Majura Parkway will allow that to happen.


Investment in infrastructure and roads in Canberra has included $200 million for new roads and for the maintenance of Edison and Glebe Parks. We have had $32,000 for signage and line-marking improvements in Tuggeranong in my electorate. We have had over $240,000 for signage and intersection improvements for the intersections of Mugga Lane and Long Gully Road in Symonston.


In addition to that, we have made an $18.5 million investment in the Monaro Highway. The ACT government has also provided about $2 million for that. I am very much looking forward to that coming on line. That will finally, after 40 years, make the Monaro Highway a dual carriageway the whole way. We have been waiting 40 years for this to happen. At the moment, the upgrade is causing a bit of inconvenience for my constituents who work in Fyshwick. But it is a welcome development. I am very much looking forward to going out there and getting an update on progress in the near future. Thanks to both federal and ACT Labor we are seeing that huge enhancement occur after waiting for 40 years. It is a great development.


I could go on and on about the support that is being delivered to community organisations. I would just like to mention one, though—the investment that we have made in the Canberra Rape Crisis Centre, which last year received more calls than ever before. The Rape Crisis Centre is in my electorate and it does incredibly important work. I am a very strong supporter of it. Last year, we had Minister Ellis out there speaking to the workers, who do a fantastic job in providing support to men and women in Canberra. The Governor-General officially opened their beautiful new premises in Weston Creek. I am very proud of that investment and very proud of the fabulous work that the Canberra Rape Crisis Centre does.


When it comes to skills training, we have also made record investments in that area. The dignity of work is something that our government wants to help all Australians realise. I know that there are many employment initiatives in electorates across the country to get people into work and help them stay there. Better education, training and infrastructure are top priorities for the Gillard Labor government. I am always proud to tell my constituents how we have doubled investment in school education, upgraded facilities at every school and provided more information for parents than ever before. I mentioned this last night. I have nearly finished all the official openings of the projects funded through our significant Building the Education Revolution investment.


Each primary school across my electorate received between $1.5 million and about $3.5 million and all the parents, students and staff in those school communities are absolutely overjoyed at the investment that we have made. In many ways, they cannot believe their luck in many ways, because they would never have been able to raise that sort of money through sausage sizzles or fetes. It would not have been possible. It is beyond their wildest dreams. Not one person I have met at those schools does not think that the BER is the greatest of investments.


We have also created 130,000 new training places and are encouraging apprentices to stay in their training and to get a skilled job by investing $100 million in a mentoring program, $100 million in new apprenticeship models that deliver high-quality skills quickly and $30 million to help mature age workers formalise their trade skills.


The Gillard Labor government has made significant investments in Canberra in education, health, infrastructure and community organisations—the list goes on and on. I am particularly proud of what we are doing here in Canberra. The feedback that I am getting from the community is that they love what we are doing here. I am very proud to represent the Gillard Labor government in Canberra and am very proud of the investment that we are making. (Time expired)

Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon) (12:09):  I rise today to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2011-2012 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2011-2012. When talking about the overall economic performance of the Gillard government there are three issues that come top of mind. The first one is the issue of trust and credibility—the issue of the truth. The second one is waste—and we have seen a lot of waste. The third one is the carbon tax and what it is going to do to the already increasing cost of living being felt in communities across the country.


Trust in government is vital and trust in the Prime Minister is vital. Yet sadly what we are seeing day by day is that our Prime Minister cannot be trusted. We saw it with the promise that there would be no carbon tax under a government she led, which was made before the last election and then was immediately disavowed after the election. We have seen it rear its ugly head with what happened on Australia Day. As 7.30 highlighted last night, we now once again cannot believe the version of events that we are getting from the Prime Minister on this issue. We have seen it with the private health insurance bills, the commitments that were made before the 2007 election and what was done immediately after to renege on those commitments.


Trust in government is very important for overall economic health. If you cannot trust what the Prime Minister and the government are saying then the overall sovereign risk increases. We now have companies, small businesses and individuals—farmers and manufacturers; people in all sectors of our economy—unable to believe what this government tells them. That means that the investment decisions that they would like to make are being put off, because they do not know whether this government will go back on its word and make a decision that will harm that long-term investment if they go forward with those investment decisions.


The best thing that we can do to improve sovereign risk in this country is to go to an election. People are fed up with their being told one thing and then the government doing another. It has got to the stage where lack of trust is eroding people's confidence in this government. It is time for the government to recognise this and to realise that it is damaging the nation and increasing sovereign risk, meaning that investment in all sectors across the country is being curtailed. No-one has the confidence to believe what the government is saying, even when it is looking them in the eye. They are worried that it will do something else. That is sad.


This was personified in the Prime Minister's appearance on Four Corners. I do not think that we have ever seen anything shiftier in political history in Australia than her answers to the two questions that were put to her about whether she had seen the polling that was being handed around to destabilise Kevin Rudd and whether a speech was being prepared in her office two weeks before Kevin Rudd was rolled. If you cannot have confidence in the words of the Prime Minister, it harms in every way people's ability to look and say, 'Okay, what is the level of sovereign risk in this country?' Australia has always been seen as a safe place to put investment.


I now turn to the question of waste. You have all seen today just another example of how this government treats the taxpayer with utter contempt. On the front page of today's Australianwe have the $700 Labor Party set-top box. We then have the $19 set-top box, which you can get down at your local discount store. The $19 set-top box versus the $700 Labor set-top box. On the front page of the Australianis pictured one of my constituents, who made this very valid comment which I think stands true for a lot of the spending problems this government has. She said:


I think their idea might have been well intended, but you wonder if they thought it through.


I will just repeat that, because I am hoping that the Labor members who are here today might just take this into account the next time they think of one of their wonderful ideas: 'I think their idea might have been well intended, but you wonder if they thought it through.' That is the $700 Labor set-top box versus the $19 set-top box that you can get from your local discount store. It is gross waste.


Let us turn to the BER. Once again it would be fair to say that the idea might have been well intended, but you wonder if they thought it through. Sadly, they did not. I have seen in my electorate example after example of waste and more waste. There is a little school, which I will not name because the school is still dealing with the BER issue, in one of the areas of socioeconomic disadvantage in my electorate. There is a school principal who is doing outstanding work in trying to educate those students. They had a roof which needed replacing because it was leaking. An amount of $1.2 million was spent on giving the school a new roof. The first time that it rained, the principal had to get up with a hammer because the rain was pouring so badly into one of the classrooms. She had to get up on a ladder herself and get a hammer and fix a hole in the roof to make sure that damage was not done to all the inside carpet and from rain running down the walls and ripping all the paint off the walls. So it was $1.2 million to fix the problem and the problem was made worse.




Mr Neumann:
  Whose fault's that?




Mr TEHAN:
  Yes, whose problem was that? It had nothing to do with the federal government that allocated the money! No; you just gave the money and then you wiped your hands. You do not care what happens to that taxpayers' money.




Mr Neumann:
  Oh, rubbish; that's nonsense.




Mr TEHAN:
  Why are you laughing then?



Mr Neumann interjecting—




Mr TEHAN:
  You are laughing at this; you do not care what happens to the—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Murphy
):  Order! The member for Wannon will not respond to the interjections, and the member for Blair will desist from interjecting.




Mr TEHAN:
  What happened in that school is an absolute disgrace. You should come down and talk to the principal about it, and then you would see firsthand what happened to that $1.2 million. That program was rushed out. I go back to my constituent who was on the front page of the Australian today, who said, 'I think their idea might have been well intended, but you wonder if they thought it through.' And they did not.


Just think about what could have been done with the money that was wasted. When we talk about employment, when we talk about job creation, think about what could have been done with that money. For instance, what about if you had thought: 'Okay, we've got a couple of billion dollars here; maybe we should go to state governments. One idea which might be quite a good one is, ''Let's work towards the reduction of payroll tax.''' If you understand business in the community, you will understand that payroll tax is one of the biggest disincentives to employing people. That would have been a very constructive way, a way which structurally would have changed the employment market in this country and led to more job creation. That is just one idea. The member for Blair asked me for one—there it is, right on the plate. Think about it; it would be a very good way to go about it.


The third issue is one that is about to hit the community and businesses across my electorate and across the country. It will add to the cost of living. It is the carbon tax. It is not too late to say that the carbon tax is the wrong policy at the wrong time. If you will face up to that you can save this country from immeasurable damage from this insidious tax.


I have an aluminium smelter in Portland in my electorate. It is a very good investment by Alcoa. It provides incredibly important jobs and, not only that, those jobs feed into the local community and provide jobs there as well. The carbon tax will add a $40 million cost to smeltering for Alcoa in the state of Victoria. That is the figure that was announced by the company in Senate estimates. At this time, when a review has just been announced of the 600 workers' jobs at Point Henry, and the company has come out and stated that the carbon tax is going to be a $40 million hit to its bottom line, why would you progress with it? Surely you would step back and say, given the climate for manufacturing at the moment, that this is not the right tax for the right time. You would admit, 'We got it wrong.' I would go back to my constituents and say, 'Maybe the idea was well intended, but I wonder whether we have thought this through properly.'


It is not just big manufacturing; it is small manufacturing. With a company like Gason in my electorate, which manufactures equipment which leads to a reduction in carbon emissions from soy, what are they getting for producing this equipment?




Mr Stephen Jones:
  Carbon farming!




Mr TEHAN:
  Carbon farming does nothing for them. Understand the issue—they are a manufacturer. Carbon farming does nothing for them. You do not understand your issue. What do they get for producing carbon-reduction equipment? They get a carbon tax. How is that fair? The carbon tax will add to the cost of living, and understand that the cost of living is increasing. We see it with insurance premiums, with people's electricity bills and with the cost of child care—another policy where once again this government's intentions might have been okay but they did not think through what the ultimate result of their policy would be.


I welcome the opportunity today to talk on these two appropriation bills and to raise the three key points that I have raised. The first was about the issue of trust and, sadly—I know the members sitting opposite saw it—that Four Corners show once and for all detailed that we have a Prime Minister and therefore a government which cannot be trusted. The second point I have highlighted is that we continue to see waste upon waste upon waste. Labor's $700 set-top box is just another example of this, especially when you realise that for $19 at the local discount store you can get a set-top box. The third issue is what the carbon tax is going to do to manufacturing—both small and large—in this country and, also, to the cost of living, to what it is going to do to increase people's electricity bills and to what it is going to do to a range of issues in driving up overall costs. It is an insidious tax and the government should just admit that it was an idea that might have been well intended but they never thought it through. (Time expired)

Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (12:24):  This government's record on economic management has resulted in lower taxes, stronger growth, lower interest rates, lower unemployment and inflation in a low band. This government's economic management is the envy of the OECD. This government's economic management has seen a stimulus which has retained jobs. About 250,000 people would have been thrown on the scrap heap if those opposite had followed what they thought was the New Zealand model, and we would have seen unemployment rates in excess of seven per cent in this country. The rate is about 5.2 per cent.


Those opposite have said no to my electorate and no to the country—no to Blair, no to Ipswich and no to Somerset. There is not a road-funding bill that has been passed through this House in the last four years since I have been elected that those opposite have not opposed. There has not been a health-funding bill that those opposite have opposed that has not made an impact on my electorate. There has not been a bill in relation to education that has made a positive impact on my electorate that those opposite have not opposed. There has not been a regional development infrastructure funding commitment and execution in my electorate that those opposite have not opposed. Time and again they have opposed every single thing. They say no to Ipswich, no to Somerset and no to Queensland.


What we have done with respect to road funding in my home state, doubling the funding to $8.5 billion, those opposite failed to do. We have increased the funding for rail 10 times and doubled the road funding—$36 billion for road, rail and ports. Those opposite should stand condemned with respect to road funding in South-East Queensland in particular.


They have opposed, for three elections in a row, the most important road-funding commitment that this government has made, the Ipswich Motorway. It will be completed by the middle of or late this year. The Ipswich Motorway links Brisbane to Ipswich and goes on, linking from there to the Warrego and Cunningham highways, to western Queensland, Toowoomba, the Darling Downs, the Lockyer Valley, the Brisbane Valley et cetera. That is where we get the minerals through—on those roads. That is where farmers take their produce to the Rocklea markets and on to the ports. That is where mums and dads drive through. We have done the Ipswich Motorway against the opposition of those opposite. All the mayors in South-East Queensland supported it. Even Campbell Newman, the alternative Premier of Queensland, supported it. Those opposite opposed it.


They opposed the funding for the Blacksoil Interchange—again, one of the magnificent seven projects that we were urged to do by the mayors of South-East Queensland. We put in $54 million, and the state Labor government has just closed the tender. Those opposite opposed it for 11½ years. They opposed the Dinmore to Goodna section of the Ipswich Motorway, doing nothing on the Blacksoil Interchange for 11½ years.


Let us look at road funding. Those opposite gave such little amounts. For example, let us talk about the Somerset Regional Council. Under Roads to Recovery from 2005-06 to 2008-09, the total amount that the Somerset Regional Council received under those opposite—and this is the local council with the largest area in South-East Queensland—was only $714,468. That council has the largest area of the councils in South-East Queensland, and it got $714,000. We increased it to $3.266 million in local road funding from 2009-10 to 2013-14.


For Ipswich City Council again we did that. We increased it from $5.9 million to $6.55 million. Even in the electorate of the member for Groom, the road funding increased from $3.9 million to $14.9 million, with those opposite opposing all funding for roads. Brisbane City Council got the same. Road funding was massively increased for South-East Queensland, with those opposite opposing it time and time again.


The member for Wannon talks about waste. Is the road funding in South-East Queensland a waste? One in seven Australians lives in South-East Queensland. Is that a waste? Yet they opposed the funding for it. They should stand condemned for that. It is ridiculous to oppose that


What about regional infrastructure in that area? They opposed all the regional infrastructure in that area in my electorate. They opposed the funding for the Ipswich civic centre upgrade. They opposed the funding for the Ipswich Baptist Church community hall upgrade. They opposed the funding for the aquatic facilities and also for the River Heart Parklands on the Bremer River in my electorate. They opposed the corporate centre in the north Ipswich football area, where the Ipswich Jets play every week. They opposed the funding for the Fernvale Indoor Sports Centre, the skate parks at Esk and the skate part at Kilcoy. They opposed the funding for the Somerset Civic Centre—$2 million under Regional Development Australia funding. They say no to every regional infrastructure fund in my electorate. They also opposed the road funding.


Let's talk about health funding. They opposed the GP superclinic in Ipswich, which was so influential and helpful during the flood. They opposed the funding of the Medicare Locals program and for the health and hospital networks. They also opposed the funding we put into the Ipswich general hospital and they opposed the rehabilitation, geriatric and palliative care funding that we provided.


They opposed the BER in my electorate. The member for Wannon talks about the BER and that it is all a waste. Tell the people of Esk, the people of Fernvale and the people of Patrick Estate in my electorate who used those BER halls and sheds as the place they went to to shelter from the flood. That helped them to rebuild their homes and their communities. Those opposite say that is a waste. The BER projects provided jobs and vital infrastructure. In my seat, I cannot find one community that does not think the BER was a good thing for their school community. BER has been so important.


They opposed the trade training centres. They opposed the Ipswich trade training centre at St Edmund's. They have a fantastic facility there that is linked to Ipswich Girls Grammar School and Ipswich Grammar School. That project was $3 million. Those opposite also opposed all the computers in schools. They would rip up that program. They criticised us for not delivering them fast enough and then went to the last election with a policy opposed to it. They opposed the funding for the trade training centre at St Peter Claver College. They opposed the funding for the trade training centre at Ipswich State High School which is linked to other schools in Ipswich and the lower Somerset. They opposed the language learning centres and the science laboratories at places like St Peter Claver College and Ipswich State High School.


They cannot find a school funding project that they would not oppose in the BER. The Leader of the Opposition actually belled the cat on this because he does not want certain people to be educated well. He only wants the right people to be educated well. That is what he said: only the right people. They opposed all the BER funding. Those opposite do not want to fund areas of social and economic disadvantage. Only Labor governments provide for the Ipswich and Somerset region. Only Labor governments provide the road funding in that area.


Think of all the national school partnerships. Think of all the things in the 20 schools in the Ipswich and the Somerset region that are taking part. I have seen the advantage that has been provided in real working-class areas like One Mile and Leichhardt. I have seen the pride in the schools there and their pride in the extra facilities they have received. I have seen the improvements in literacy and numeracy in those schools. To have seen the great things that have been done in those schools is fantastic. I have 64 schools in my electorate and five more have recently opened. We have invested in those schools. Also, we have provided additional funding for chaplains in those schools. They helped so much during the flood. We are rolling out more chaplaincy services in those areas and I know that they will be warmly appreciated.


With respect to funding in my electorate, all those opposite can do is say no. On this side, we know how important these projects are. I was not intending to do this, but I want to go through this because the member for Wannon talked about waste and the BER. When I got elected in 2007, I was approached by the community at Brassall State School, the third biggest primary school in my electorate, about the need for a new school hall. The P&C president, Shelly McDonald, came and talked to me about it. She said that the previous member for Blair could not get them funding. They kept on asking for it all the time. We rolled out that funding under the BER and the Prime Minister was with me when we opened that school hall at Brassall State School on 21 July last year. Peter Doyle was the principal then. That school lost all of its computers owing to flooding. It had buildings demolished because they were flooded. There was not a piece of paper left as a result of the flood. It was entirely trashed. All credit goes to Peter Doyle and the whole school community for rebuilding the school and having the kids back on time. That school hall was a symbol of the pride of that school. They were so happy that day to see that school hall officially opened by the Prime Minister. Does the member for Wannon think that was a waste?


What about the new facilities for St Joseph's? St Joseph's Primary School in North Ipswich was the flood evacuation centre for the people of Brassall and North Ipswich during the flood in January 2011. I was there and opened the new facilities at that school. They received $2.625 million for a new library, new classrooms and other improvements. The people of Brassall and North Ipswich suffered in the flood. I saw the happiness, the joy, the enthusiasm, the pride and the self-respect of the people and the whole Catholic community in North Ipswich and Brassall on the day that was opened. Does the member for Wannon think that was a waste? I do not think it was.


What about Esk? That was where the SES and the rural fire brigade stayed. That is where people bunked as the waters from Redbank Creek flooded through the CBD of Esk and through people's houses. Esk Caravan Park was destroyed. People went to that hall. Without that hall there was nothing in Esk and no place to go. Was that a waste of money? Do not tell the people of Esk that was a waste of money because it certainly was not. The new library and the new hall are an important part of the education of the children there.


What about the heritage in my home city of Ipswich? We have seen refurbishments, a new multipurpose hall and a new gym, in one of the oldest schools in Ipswich, Ipswich Central State School—my dad's old school. It got $3.2 million. I know that is one of Ipswich's oldest schools and it is important. What about poor Karalee, where hundreds and hundreds of homes were flooded in January 2011? A grant of $3 million effectively gave them their own civic centre at the Karalee State School—a new performing arts and resources centre. I know that is so important for that area. I saw the happiness on the young people's faces as they performed on that Saturday afternoon when we opened it. Karalee was badly hit during the flood. Was the funding there wasted? I say it was not.


What about the new kitchen gardens at WoodLinks State School and Lowood State School? We gave them $60,000 grants under the Stephanie Alexander Kitchen Garden Foundation. Was that a waste? I think not, and the people do not believe that either. What about Claremont Special School and Ipswich West Special School? After I got elected Ipswich West Special School approached me because they needed a hydrotherapy complex—a pool for their kids with severe disabilities. They had not been able to get the money under the coalition. For over 20 years Peter Davis was the principal there and he could not convince coalition members in the federal government to give him the money. They would not do it. We provided that funding. We did it for them and now they have got a hydrotherapy complex there under the BER. Was that waste? I think not.


I could go on and on and on. Those opposite stand condemned for their refusal to invest in health, education, community and road infrastructure in South-East Queensland. They say one thing down here and they visit all those schools and facilities back in their electorates and want to take the credit for it. We have seen their websites and their newsletters.


This appropriation bill is in the spirit of this Labor government. It wants to make a difference in the lives of people through the length and breadth of this country. I commend the legislation to the House.

Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley) (12:40):  My contribution today is about Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2011-2012 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2011-2012. They represent an implementation of the MYEFO—the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook—adjustments that were made in a few short months after the government laid out its 2011-2012 budget. It is interesting that the shelf life of that budget was so short and that we are here discussing substantial variations in the form of these appropriation bills.


I will not itemise all the areas of expenditure, other than to note that some of the leading items include a substantial amount of money related to the carbon tax: funds that are aiming to soften the impact, to ease the burden and to relieve some of the pain that is inherently acknowledged in these budget appropriations. All those adjustments, the soft landing and making sure that the hurt is a little bit less would not be necessary if it were not for the implementation of the carbon tax. That is the one that was promised not to happen. This would not be a discussion that we had to have if the Prime Minister had honoured her undertaking: 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.'


So in these appropriations across a number of portfolios there is a substantial amount of money to deal with transitional assistance for the carbon price and the job support package, recognising the vulnerability, the risk and the harm to important sectors of our economy. There is also some money that is designed to help households to meet the additional costs of the carbon tax, and money for setting up the bureaucratic infrastructure that sits around the measure that the government promised it would not implement but now is.


It is an interesting document in that it says a lot about where the government is, but it also gives us an insight into what is actually going on at the moment. There is quite a remarkable political Ponzi scheme being played out in this nation's parliament. You have heard government members talk about what a fantastic job they do in spending bucketloads of money. No-one is saying that they cannot spend money. I have not heard anybody that I have met suggest that this government cannot spend money. It knows how to spend money like no other government before. It knows how to spray it around and defer the responsibility for financing that spending onto subsequent generations.


In the few short years since the Rudd-Gillard government was elected, the Commonwealth outlays have grown by almost $100 billion. In the last year of the Howard government, if my recollection serves me well, I think the federal budget was about $270 billion. It is now up at $360 billion. That is an incredible uplift in government expenditure. Then the government has the hide to come out and say, 'Oh, but we are not the highest-taxing government,' on a very spurious set of data analysis. What it does not talk about is the deferred tax that is debt. Debt is simply tax deferred for subsequent generations to pay. Again, just as no-one contests the ability of this Labor government to spend money, it is unrivalled in its ability to accumulate debt and to record record deficits.


But the political Ponzi scheme sees the economic harm and the financial responsibility transferred on to subsequent years and to subsequent generations, as if it does not matter. It is an intergenerational theft of their opportunities to choose the priorities and the expenditure profile when it comes time for the subsequent generation to manage and to lead this nation and to shape its economy. In effect, it is actually stealing those opportunities, claiming them today and then being able to come into this chamber, as we have heard Labor members do, spruiking about all the money they have sprayed around everywhere. There is an infinite number of worthwhile things that you can do with other people's money, and the government has proven its capacity to make some inroads into that infinite range of possibilities. But there comes a day when you have to account for it. I have touched on how this political Ponzi scheme is sucking resources out of current and future generations to finance this extraordinary expenditure. Today, we as a nation will borrow another $100 million dollars, and this is at a time when the government boasts about the economy being at trend growth and the terms of trade being as good as they have been for a century and half. Yet we are still proving to be incapable of paying our way.


If, under the Gillard and Rudd administrations, the Commonwealth of Australia were a corporation, Gillard and Rudd would have lots of 'please explain's from the economic regulators in Australia. They would have lots of calls from ASIC to explain how their accounting tricks could be justified against the prudent and good practice that the corporate world needs to meet, but because they are the government they are not held to that same level of account. If the Stock Exchange were a corporate entity, it would be wondering how some of the assertions that have been put out into the marketplace could be made at all, given there is no evidence to substantiate those claims. We see this in the way that the government, after having accumulated extraordinary deficits, has almost overnight contrived a surplus for political advantage. It has been engineered for one budget, one year. Expenditure has been pulled forward into this financial year and then pushed back outside the target year to create a wafer-thin surplus for 2012-13. So we see how in this budget and in these appropriation bills the already enormous deficit which was going to be inflicted on this nation is getting worse. Where expenditure can be pulled forward into this financial year it has been and where other expenditures have been able to be deferred they have been put out past 2012-13. And this is while the government seeks to achieve some kind of political goal that it has set itself in light of the fact that the broader Australian public is quite dubious about this government's economic management, competence and capability.


So these additional expenditures come on the back of quite an extraordinary series of deficits. These are the four biggest deficits in our nation's history. Remember: these deficits have been arrived at—and I am drawing from the Labor government's own rhetoric—at a time when the economy seems to be going well. Any hardship is dismissed as growing pains and the trend growth that we are on now should enable us to pay our way, but we are failing miserably as a nation to fund our expenditures. The four biggest deficits in Australian history have a cumulative total of $167 billion, and that is supposed to be praiseworthy in the eyes of the Labor government and its members.


If the Prime Minister were the chief executive officer of a corporation and she received a bonus—whether it be a substantial payment or some political kudos—derived from a contrived financial outcome, everyone would look quite curiously at that. In fact, if the government were in the corporate world, the corporate world would be highly critical that high-flying executives were manipulating the fortunes of its company and massaging its finances to create some arithmetic outcome for which they would hope to be rewarded. If that happened in the corporate world there would be outrage.


When this government was going through its post-neoliberalism, former Prime Minister Rudd was trying to say that all things that had helped make this country great and grow our economy were all of sudden quite evil and that we needed a bigger government in every boardroom, in every economic decision and in every household of the country. One of the things he said at that time was that corporate executives were running companies to try to achieve certain financial KPIs so that they would be highly rewarded. Isn't it odd that here we are some years down the track—we no longer have Prime Minister Rudd; we have Prime Minister Gillard—and Prime Minister Gillard is presiding over a Commonwealth corporation, the Commonwealth of Australia, and is doing the very things that former Prime Minister Rudd was so highly critical of when he was Prime Minister. We have a contrived financial picture. We have a completely incredible set of assertions sitting behind one year's financial outcome where the CEO—in this case, the Prime Minister—wants to be lauded and praised for this contrived one-year financial outcome. I am not certain it will even happen, despite all the fiscal gymnastics, transactional shuffling and political Ponzi arrangements that the government is overseeing. We are still yet to see whether there will be a surplus as the Prime Minister and Treasurer have promised on the back of, dare I say, some very poor form. If past performance is a guide to future performance then it is very hard to believe the government will actually create a surplus, even as it creates this cynical fiscal strategy to contrive a budget outcome for 2012-13. There has been no discussion about how it will unwind these Ponzi arrangements that impose cost vulnerability on subsequent generations just so the government can try to look good in the short term.


The shadow finance minister has quite rightly touched on one of the glaring problems with the budget strategy that the government is proposing—and that is the imposition of a carbon tax. It is a particular gift to impose a new tax and have a net detrimental impact on the budget position, but that is what the government has done as it tries to massage the introduction of this tax. This tax is not only causing direct costs, which are canvassed in these bills; it is also causing enormous concern in the business community. You wonder where this trend of growth that the government relies upon to have some kind of credibility, albeit fairly spurious, with these numbers will end up after the carbon tax is introduced.


I sought to ask the Prime Minister about the concerns that are widely held in the business community, particularly in the small business community, about the impact of the carbon tax. She dismissed that concern and that question. She dismissed the anxiety and the fear that is out there amongst the business community, where they know that this is going to be detrimental to their interests, to the interests of employees and to the prosperity they bring to their communities. She tried to suggest that it was somehow a contrivance of the opposition, which I found quite remarkable. In survey after survey the message is consistent. In your great state of Queensland, Mr Deputy Speaker, just a couple of days ago the Chamber of Commerce and Industry released its report. Almost without exception across every region in Queensland the carbon tax was either No. 1 or No. 2 on the list of big concerns. Regionally, it was a concern. The carbon tax was only ever displaced by concerns about energy costs, which of course will go up with the carbon tax. So those interwoven concerns are the pinnacle of the anxieties, uncertainties and lack of confidence in the business community, and yet the government tries to talk it away as if it does not matter. If you look across the survey results, it does not even matter what size the business is: carbon tax concerns or concerns about the cost of energy are still at the pinnacle of concerns. Yet the government tries to swat this away as if it does not matter.


I am genuinely concerned because I look into the eyes of people in small business and family enterprises who are contending with a very difficult economic climate, despite the boast to the contrary of the government. I feel their concerns because I am there with them as they express very sincerely their anxieties about the future. They know cost-of-living pressures mean that consumers are not interested in price increases. They see that their input costs, not only their direct energy costs but all of the other input costs in their business, that have carbon costs embedded in them will be pushing up the cost of doing business. But there is no customer appetite to see those costs passed on. Whenever these issues get raised, Minister Combet, such as in his Press Club speech, swats them away with arrogant indifference—'You cannot get your car serviced in India, and you cannot get your dry-cleaning done in China.' That is of no comfort whatsoever to the small business community. In the communities that I represent, the mechanics are saying that people are not getting their regular scheduled service; they are only coming in when there is a need for a repair. The drycleaners are saying that people are less inclined to make use of their services. They have less frequent dry-cleaning of the articles that require it, and consumers are looking at other options for how to keep their clothing clean, such as washing by hand and the like.


This carbon tax hangs as a dagger over the small business community and it is eating away at the credibility of the budget and the economic scenario in this country. That is why these measures and the carbon tax should be deferred until the Australian public have a chance to cast their vote on just how well things are going for our nation.

Mr MORRISON
 (Cook) (10:01):  It is Groundhog Day. It is February, appropriation bills are back before the House and once again the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship has been standing before the parliament and asking for more money. The minister for immigration is indeed the Oliver Twist of Australian politics. Every year he turns up and says, 'Please, sir, can I have some more?' And this time he is asking again for more. This year the ask is $330 million. Last year, on recurrent, the ask was $295 million and with capital included it was $511 million and the year before that it was $85.7 million. Every February this government, despite revealing blow-outs in budget year after year after year—so even after those blow-outs—has to come back and ask for yet more funds time and time again.


The blow-out this year in the appropriation bills is intended to deal with two principal problems. The first one is a further blow-out in the 2011-12 budget, which was already blown out at the time of the original budget to the tune of over a billion dollars a year from less than $100 million a year for asylum seeker costs when the Howard government left office. But it is also to deal with a further blow-out last year. So not only did they get this year's budget wrong yet again and have had to ask for more money; they have even had a blow-out in the expenses from last year of over $100 million. So once again this minister has come to this House and said, 'Please, sir, can I have some more?'


Well, as is the practice with money bills, I suppose the government is going to get what it wants yet again and once again taxpayers are going to have to shell out hundreds of millions of dollars for this government's border protection failures. This is a government that has blown out the Department of Immigration and Citizenship's budget to record levels. This is a government that in 2011-12 will cost taxpayers, for that department, $2.73 billion. That is the bill for expenses for this year for the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. This is a billion dollars more than the $1.69 billion it cost in 2007-08. That is why the government is asking for more money today as part of the debate on these bills. Also, DIAC's annual reports show that not only has there been this increase in cost but there has been a very significant increase in the size of the department itself. As to the number of permanent staff employed by DIAC between 2007 and 30 June 2011, there were 1,192 additional staff. So that is 1,192 additional officers within DIAC since this government came to office—an increase of 15 per cent over the last four years. During the same period the number of the highest paid senior executives, so the SE Service within DIAC, had also increased by 24 per cent. The median income for these positions in 2011 was between $180,000 and $210,000. This is a department that has gone completely out of control with costs and with the size of government. There is one simple reason for this: four years ago the government abolished the proven measures of the Howard government on border protection. Let us go through what the result has been. The minister has questioned figures relating to the blow-outs in the government's costs on border protection. I am happy to inform the minister by quoting from the government's own budget papers. Three years ago, in the budget estimates of 2009-10 and the additional estimates of 2009-10, there was a $207.5 million increase—a blow-out of the estimates of 2009-10 over the original budget of 2009-10. In the following year, in the 2010-11 budget they were $793.5 million over what they had said in the previous additional estimates, and when the next additional estimates came around the blow-out from the previous statement was $472 million. But they were just getting warmed up.


Strangely enough, after the election the additional estimates in 2010-11 showed a further blow-out over the budget estimates of 2010-11 of $1.5 billion. But they are still going, because in the additional estimates released last week the additional cost for asylum seeker management, netting off what they returned to the budget after the failed Malaysian people swap—so after they had put all that money back—was $866 million. That is a blow-out over the course of these last three years, from statement to statement, of $3.868 billion. That is the cost of this government's border protection failure—just under $3.9 billion.


When Senate estimates convened this week there were a lot of questions asked about the government decision to abolish the Pacific solution and temporary protection visas. The departmental secretary was asked whether he had advised the government of the potential cost implications of what he later described in his evidence as a major shift in policy. Once again, the secretary declined to answer this question. The only thing we can draw from the experience of the last three years is that the cost implications of that change in policy have so far been $3.9 billion.


This is a direct result of the change in government policy. In evidence, the secretary made it very clear that the reason for the blow-out in their total costs was the massive increase in costs related to the arrival of illegal boats to Australia. That is not in dispute. Under further questioning, Senator Lundy finally admitted that the increase in costs was a result of the change in policy. She coughed that up.



Mr Husic interjecting—




Mr MORRISON:
  She was so keen to interject during Senate estimates with Senator Cash that she finally admitted what everybody in this country knows—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  Order! The member for Chifley needs to remember my hearing is in question here. The more you yell, the louder he gets. The member for Cook has the call.




Mr MORRISON:
  What everyone now knows—the Labor Party and the government have finally admitted it—is that the decision to get rid of the Howard government's proven border protection policies has cost Australian taxpayers dearly. It is revealed here in the government's own figures—almost $4 billion in total. I am quite sure they are going to eclipse that $4 billion mark by the time we get to May because, as surely as night follows day, this minister for immigration always turns up asking for more money. When we left office there were just four people in detention who had arrived in Australia illegally by boat. Today that figure is more than 6,000. Back in 2007, early 2008, either the government completely ignored the advice of the secretary of the department of immigration that this significant change in policy would have these consequences or, frankly, the secretary never gave that advice. I do not know what is worse. This government is always parading itself around saying it always takes advice. Well, either the department of immigration did not advise this, and have been proved to be hopelessly wrong on the experience of these figures, or the advice was ignored by the minister at the time and by Prime Minister Rudd and Prime Minister Gillard following that. The Prime Minister has completed the job of removing every brick in the wall that John Howard built for border protection in this country. They have removed every brick in the wall. They either ignored that advice or that advice was never given. What it shows is that we have a crisis on our borders that this government is incapable of solving.


The government are not upfront about these costs. At the end of November last year they said the change in the forward estimates would be $197 million. After all the changes that they talked about, when their people-swap fell over through their own incompetence—when it fell over in the High Court, when it fell over in the parliament—and when they embraced the policies of the Greens and rejected the proven policies of the coalition, they said that the net impact of all of this to the budget would be $197 million. That is what the Treasurer told the country and that is what the minister for immigration told the country. Yet in these figures today we see that the actual net cost over the forward estimates is $750 million plus. In just 2½ months this mob blew out their own budget and their own estimates by almost 300 per cent. They cannot keep up with their border blowouts. They cannot possibly keep up with them because they have no idea what is happening out there on our borders and the costs just keep mounting up and up.


There are 6½ thousand more beds in our detention network today, announced by this government over the last four years, than there were four years ago. This government has spent more money on putting more beds in detention centres than they have on putting beds in public hospitals. On a day where this parliament is going to drive more people into public hospitals, this government's only record on putting beds in place in this country is in detention centres, at a cost of almost $500 million in capital over the last four years.


This government has a record of deceit when it comes to this issue also, because before the last election they said they were not going to expand the detention network in Australia. When they were challenged on that they said they were not going to expand it. What does the record show? Since the last election they have announced more than 4½ thousand beds in our detention network. Their budget has blown out in this area by $2.9 billion since the last election.


The government want to be trusted now that next year they are going to achieve $400 million in savings in this area, when every single time they have presented a budget and at additional estimates the costs have just gone up and up and up. Now they want the Australian people to believe it is all going to be fixed next year, despite the fact that by the end of next financial year, according to their own evidence at estimates, another 7½ thousand people will have turned up in boats and there will be just under 6,000 people in the detention network.


To achieve the figures in their budget they have to do the following—and they know this: they will have to visa out of the system by the end of next year another 5,000 people with permanent protection visas. They will have to grant another 5,000 permanent protection visas. That will reduce the number of visas given to offshore humanitarian entrants and refugee entrants by that amount—by another 5,000. That is going to be the humanitarian cost of this government's border protection failures. Those who are duly awaiting their time and their place will lose that opportunity because 5,000 people who turn up in a boat over the next 18 months are going to get their visa. In addition to that, they have to issue another 1,800 bridging visas for people who they expect to be in the system. We will see how that goes. That is what their figures rely on; they will not meet them and we will be back in this place a year from now. The only plan of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, who today wants to be the Treasurer—that is his exit plan from this portfolio—is not to stop the boats; it is to make Kevin Rudd Prime Minister so he can be Treasurer. And, based on these figures, if he does to our finances what he has done to the immigration portfolio heaven help us! Our finances will be in a worse state than our borders if this minister for immigration ever becomes Treasurer, which is his ambition.


This is a government that has no plan on this issue other than to blame the opposition, embrace the Greens and reject the proven policies of the coalition. That is its plan. Its plan is simply to blame the opposition for its own failures, which have delivered almost $4 billion in budget blowouts, have resulted in more than 15,000 people turning up on its watch and have seen our immigration network go from just four people in detention—you could almost put them in a phone box—to over 6,000 people, who are now costing taxpayers around $1.2 billion every single year.


I think that there is no issue that says more about this government's incompetence and their denial than this issue. This is a government that has completely lost the plot on this issue. They have no plan to fix it other than simply to blame the opposition and to carp and whinge. Today this government could implement Nauru. It could be done at a fraction of the cost of what the government says. (Time expired)

"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,2012-02-15,"



Mr MURPHY
 (Reid) (10:16):  I rise this morning to support the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2011-2012 and the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2011-2012, because they will provide funding over four years to establish a Clean Energy Regulator to administer the carbon-pricing mechanism. The regulatory functions under the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting System, the renewable energy target and the Carbon Farming Initiative will also be brought under the Clean Energy Regulator.


The responsibilities of the regulator will include assessing emissions data to determine each entity's liability; operating the Australian National Registry of Emissions Units; monitoring, facilitating and enforcing compliance with the carbon-pricing mechanism; allocating fixed-price and auction permits; applying legislative rules to determine eligibility for assistance in the form of freely allocated permits; and providing education on the carbon-pricing mechanism. And as you know, Deputy Speaker, the government will also provide further funding over four years for the Department of Finance and Deregulation to conduct gateway reviews of the establishment and operation of the regulator.


The bills also provide funds to the Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities to support the management of extractive industry activities, especially coal seam gas and major coalmining developments. These initiatives aim to build scientific evidence and understanding of the impacts on water resources of coal seam gas extraction and large coalmines.


The New South Wales government has already taken the scientific evidence for granted on coal seam gas extraction but, like its Liberal counterpart in Victoria, seems intent on standing in the way of businesspeople who want to develop wind power to feed into the electricity grid. Despite the lack of any evidence to support any harmful effects of wind farming, the New South Wales government has given the power of veto to anyone living within two kilometres of a proposed wind farm. These governments seem to have been unduly influenced by climate change deniers and sceptics, in particular the Australian Landscape Guardians, whose stated philosophy is to safeguard the landscape from 'inappropriate development'.


In an article published on the Independent Australia website on 24 July last year, investigative journalist Sandi Keane assembled some of the publicly available information on the opaque Landscape Guardians. They are modelled on the British Coastal Guardians and Country Guardians, who are associated with the nuclear power industry in the United Kingdom. In their opposition to wind farms, the Landscape Guardians do not mention the landscape but have discovered a previously unheard of medical condition that they call 'wind turbine syndrome'. They claim that wind farms cause sleep problems, headaches, dizziness, nausea, exhaustion, anxiety, anger, irritability, depression, tinnitus and concentration problems, and, astonishingly, they cause children to refuse to go to school. It's the truth!


The Landscape Guardians have set up a front called the Waubra Foundation, which is not based at Waubra but opposes the Waubra wind farm. Its so-called medical director, Sarah Laurie, a non-practising, unregistered doctor living in South Australia, claims that infrasound from wind turbines causes these problems. Most of my constituents at times suffer from almost all of these symptoms, although there is no wind farm anywhere near my inner-city electorate. Simon Chapman, Professor in Public Health at the University of Sydney, says that these symptoms are experienced by millions of Australians.


It is important to note that the Waubra Foundation is a powerful, well-resourced and growing anti-wind-power lobby group. Peter Mitchell, founder and Chairman of the Waubra Foundation, helped set up and fund the Australian Landscape Guardians. He is also spokesman for the Western Plains Landscape Guardians. Another director, Kathy Russell, is Vice-President of the Australian Landscape Guardians, Vice-President of the Victorian Landscape Guardians and spokesperson for the Western Plains, Mount Pollock Landscape Guardians and the Barrabool Hills Landscape Guardians. Yet another director, tycoon Tony Hodgson—as the Murdoch press calls him—helped fund the campaign against the Collector wind farm in New South Wales, just up the road from Canberra, and he is involved with the Booroowa Landscape Guardians to stop a $400 million wind farm proposed near Rugby and Booroowa in the south of the state. The Hon. Dr Michael Wooldridge, the former Howard government minister, is also a director.


Sandi Keane found that the foundation has no physical address in Waubra and indeed appears to have no local Waubra residents on its board. The address is a post-office box in South Melbourne, the same address as that of the Australian Landscape Guardians and Peter Mitchell.


The Landscape Guardians are well-known climate sceptics and deniers linked to the Liberal Party and the Institute of Public Affairs. They have a particularly close association with the IPA's Australian Environment Foundation, which is more interested in logging trees than conserving them. The Institute of Public Affairs has been giving its opinion on climate change for decades now on behalf of its supporters—Billiton; Western Mining; Caltex; Esso Australia, a subsidiary of Exxon; Shell; and Woodside Petroleum—and it also receives funding from Rupert Murdoch's News Ltd.


While the Waubra Foundation appears unconcerned about the landscape of wind farms, its only agenda is the so-called 'infrasound problems' caused by wind turbines. Peter Mitchell successfully objected to the number of turbines proposed for the Stockyard Hill wind farm near Beaufort in Victoria. He also successfully had them removed from the ridge that he could see from his property. Sandi Keane found also that Peter Mitchell has interests in the fossil fuel industry. These include as founding chairman of the Moonie Oil Company Ltd and chairman or director of similar companies including Clyde Petroleum plc, Avalon Energy Inc., North Flinders Mines Ltd and Paringa Mining & Exploration plc, most now delisted on the Australian Stock Exchange.


According to Lowell Resources Funds Management Pty Ltd, Mitchell's experience is derived from over 25 years involvement in companies that explored for, developed and financed gold, uranium, coal and base metal mines, oil and gas fields and pipeline systems in Australia and overseas. He has been chairman of Lowell Pty Ltd, the ultimate parent company of both Lowell Capital Ltd and Lowell Resources Funds Management Pty Ltd, a specialist fund investing in emerging mining and energy companies, since taken over by Future Corporation Australia Ltd.


Paul Miskelly, who represents both the Australian Landscape Guardians and the Taralga Landscape Guardians, worked for the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, ANSTO, for 32 years and gives talks on nuclear power. Climate scepticism is the stock in trade of the Landscape Guardians. Randall Bell, president of the Victorian Landscape Guardians, said in the Melbourne Age on 3 July 2010 that claims the earth is warming are scientifically unreliable and that the idea of man-made climate change is headed for the Y2K dustbin. But we do not see the Landscape Guardians campaigning alongside Lock the Gate, the New South Wales Farmers Federation and the Greens to halt the destruction of some of the best agricultural land in New South Wales and Queensland by coal seam gas miners. We do not see them campaigning in Victoria against Premier Ted Baillieu's decision to reopen Victoria to brown coal mining. Farmers on the best agricultural land in Gippsland now face losing their farms to dirty, inefficient brown coal mining. Is an open-cut mine a preferable landscape to a wind farm, where food can continue to be grown?


As with the Landscape Guardians, there is no information about funding or sponsorship of the Waubra Foundation. Yet money seems to be no object for its websites, campaigners, advertising, travel and media monitoring.


As I said earlier, in the Boorowa area a $300 million wind farm is being proposed. At Rye Park the Epuron energy company wants to build 80 to 110 turbines, which will generate power for 90,000 homes. But, as Sandi Keane found, there is someone with a property near Yass whose influence on governments and public opinion is huge. Besieged media boss Rupert Murdoch owns Cavan, a substantial rural property in the grazing country nearby. No other media group in Australia has run a more distorted and dishonest scare campaign about wind farms than the Murdoch group. The district of Yass has in the planning stages a larger proportion of wind farms than elsewhere in Australia. These are planned at Bango, 25 km north of Yass; Birrema, 30 km west of Yass; Rye Park, 25 km north-east of Yass; and the Yass Valley itself. There are wind farms at Caroll's Ridge, Conroy's Gap, Coppabella Hills and Marilba Hills.


In 2010 Family First's own climate change sceptic, Senator Steve Fielding, initiated a Senate inquiry into so-called turbine sickness. The report was released last year. The Senate inquiry found no proof of a direct link between wind farms and the so-called wind turbine syndrome. The submission of the National Health and Medical Research Council concluded that there is no published scientific evidence to support adverse effects of wind turbines on health.


Professor Peter Seligman of the Melbourne Energy Institute also gave evidence to the inquiry. Professor Seligman spent most of his working life working on the cochlear implant. He has a PhD in electronic engineering. He understands infrasound better than most. He told Sandi Keane that the level of infrasound at the beach is far higher than that from wind farms. Beyond 360 metres the level of infrasound emitted from a wind farm, typically between one and 20 cycles per second, is below the ambient levels near a beach and below that in the central business district of any city. On the other hand, we are all subjected to far higher internally self-generated natural infrasound levels, which clearly are not a problem.


The Victorian Department of Health indicated that it had examined both peer-reviewed and validated scientific research and concluded that 'the weight of evidence indicated that there are no direct health effects from noise.'


Dr Sarah Laurie's evidence included evidence from Nina Pierpont, an American general practitioner who claims to be an authority on wind turbine syndrome. Pierpont is the author of a self-published book containing descriptions of the health problems of merely 10 families—that is, 38 people—in five different countries who once lived near wind turbines and who are convinced that turbines made them sick. Medical experts in Australia have said that, given that there are about 100,000 turbines around the world, her sample is too small to have any scientific value. There were no scientific controls, and the symptoms described were common in any community. Dr Laurie also tried to appeal against a proposed wind farm at Allandale East in South Australia. Her appeal failed on the basis of the same evidence from the medical community. Gary Wittert, a professor of medicine at the University of Adelaide, said there was no credible evidence that wind turbines have adverse effects on health. A recent parliamentary inquiry into wind farms in New South Wales dismissed Pierpoint's study, particularly since her findings were not published in a peer reviewed journal. In its submission to the Senate inquiry the group Doctors for the Environment also agreed 'there is no convincing evidence in the scientific literature of direct physiological effects occurring at sound levels commonly associated with modern wind turbines'. The building of the Waubra wind farm provided an injection of $58.4 million to the local economy through the economic activity associated with 160 local jobs. Ongoing employment from those jobs at Waubra adds a further $7.79 million each year to the local economy. These figures have been generated by the City of Ballarat using REMPLAN modelling.


Kate Redwood, a director of Hepburn Wind, said the strategy used to get community support in Daylesford included monitoring noise at those houses within two kilometres of the turbines. This successful strategy has led to the formation of a new organisation called Embark, which offers advice on the management of community projects. As a result of the Senate inquiry, public health authorities will keep up the monitoring and the wind industry will continue to improve its modelling and community relations. I commend the bills to the House.

"Jones, Ewen, MP",LP,2012-02-15,"



Mr EWEN JONES
 (Herbert) (10:31):  Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker, and congratulations on your elevation to the panel. I see a great career there for you! I welcome the opportunity to speak on the appropriation bills. There are a wide range of things in Townsville that I think the government should be looking at. I would like to start with education. I declare an interest in that my wife is an early childhood teacher. Nonetheless, I feel that my comments will be very pertinent.


When it comes to education we must make sure that the foundation and the building blocks are there. When you build a house you do not start with the roof; you start with the foundations. Early childhood education is where we should be spending the money. Too often we see aid time being taken away from teachers and actual teaching time being reduced. We should be making sure that children have activity based education with outcomes as opposed to desk learning. Funds should be allocated so that the teachers can teach and are taught what to do.


One thing I will say—and this will be a common theme—is that I have a forklift drivers licence but you certainly would not want me loading your truck. There is a difference between having a qualification and being qualified. There is a difference between having a degree in education and being a teacher. A friend of mine, Pat Ernst, is a very good rugby league coach. He says the longest distance any coach will ever see is that between the coach's lips and the players ears and into his brain so that he understand it. Therefore it goes with teaching that, if we can get these building blocks in, if we can get the play based mechanisms through and concentrate on early childhood, the rest will come.


I worry a great deal about the money being spent on NAPLAN and the My School website. After an initial burst of glory the My School website is now something that is not going to be referred to. I worry that, with NAPLAN, we are seeing teachers in the grades that are not subject to those tests practising for the next year's tests. I worry about what is happening in primary schools and high schools. Where are sport, art, music, play and everything else? I would like to see teachers given the opportunity to use their environment and their resources as best fits them. Teaching arithmetic in Mt Isa can be very different from teaching arithmetic in the inner suburbs of Sydney or Melbourne. They should be allowed to do that. So long as the outcome is that two plus two equals four in every instance, we should be okay with that.


On higher education and research, I am very lucky to have in my electorate James Cook University, the only university in Australia which has higher education in a tropical environment at its core. One of the projects about which I would question this government's support for renewable energy is the James Cook University algae project. With this algae project it is completely feasible that we could have a coal fired power station with zero emissions by integrating an algae plant into the design of a world's best practice coal fired power station. Therefore, we would have the cheapest form of power available, being a coal fired power station, and zero emissions. I just cannot see the downside to it. In the Galilee Basin you would be able to build something like this at places like Prairie or Torrens Creek, which would feed into the north-west minerals province and allow things like the Kennedy wind farm, which I will touch on later, to feed into a national grid. Remember that the national grid only goes to Woodstock, which is basically 50 kilometres away from Townsville. That is the extent of the national grid into western Queensland.


The CSIRO scientists at the ATSIP building in Townsville are looking into the science of using fresh water. If we are to make the north-west province of Queensland—the Mitchell grass plains west of Townsville—the food bowl, we must listen to the science. I was happy in the end that our scientists were given their 3½ per cent pay rise, but it was disappointing that they had to go cap in hand to stop-work meetings to make a point that this research is valuable. If we are to be the smart generation and tap into this Asian century, it must be driven by the science. Places like James Cook University and CSIRO are exactly the places we should be focusing on.


Our medical school is turning out first-class medical graduates. Tropical medical training is taking people with a degree and turning them into general practitioners. I would like to congratulate the government on the funding that they have provided to tropical medical training. In the future as this program and this organisation become even more important, with the numbers coming through, I do believe that more money and attention should be given, especially in regional Australia, to the training and assistance given to international medical graduates, as they still make up a large number of our medical practitioners. They should be helped as they play such a key role in places where Australian GPs do not go.


In relation to James Cook University I would like to push the government even further. They have not committed to the Australian institute of tropical health and medicine. This is a vital piece of infrastructure in the tropical world. Papua New Guinea is just at the top of Australia—it is a short boat ride. We have a ward at the Thursday Island Hospital dedicated to people with drug resistant tuberculosis and malaria. From there it is only a quick trip to the mainland of Australia. We saw our first Australians become the most susceptible to the H1N1 or bird flu viruses. Once these things come to the mainland we may see catastrophic events. Let us hope the situation is under control in Papua New Guinea. But if there were to be a breakdown of law and order we would see a great influx of people coming across the Torres Strait into Australia, and with that will come the need for health care. There are things we have to do for the tropical world. With around half the population living in the tropical world, the work that this organisation should be doing should be supported.


I would also like to push the government to support Youth with a Mission. Ken Mulligan has been in this House and spoken to members on both sides. YWAM take a boat as far as they can into the remote provinces of Papua New Guinea, where they provide quality dental care, eye surgery, GP visits for people who have never seen a doctor and dental visits for people who have never seen a dentist. That should be supported.


The Australian Institute of Marine Science has been granted great funding to produce an ocean simulator. This will be world-leading research. It is not in my electorate but it all goes through Townsville. We will have PhD students and researchers coming from all over the world to use this fantastic facility. The Australian Institute of Marine Science is also leading the world in farming and breeding lobsters. This is an incredibly difficult thing. We now have them up to wriggler stage and we are seeing the fruits of that. When we are talking about food security, especially in the tropical world, where we are seeing seas being fished out, this must be supported.


Ian Poiner, the recent CEO of the Australian Institute of Marine Science, organised the first-ever audit of Australia's fish stocks, and he still thinks we only know about 10 to 20 per cent of what is in our seas. John Gunn is the new CEO of the Australian Institute of Marine Science. We are talking about letters, and other members of this House will have received these, in relation to protecting the Coral Sea and making it a marine park. It takes 38 hours from Townsville, from the Australian Institute of Marine Science, under full steam to get to this place in the world that they want to turn into a park. But the operational funding for the Australian Institute of Marine Science continues to shrink. So if we want this research done and if we want these things protected we must make sure the operational funding is connected.


Townsville is a very proud defence city. We have now welcomed 3RAR to Townsville, making the readily-deployable forces even greater in Townsville. Berth 10 at Townsville port is under construction. There is bipartisan support for berthing of the landing helicopter dock vessel and for readily-deployables in times of emergency. We saw during last year's Cyclone Yasi that roads were cut and the naval fleet was out of order and we could not get troops quickly enough to places like Tully and Cardwell, which were severely affected. I would like to see an LHD there—and we are getting two, one based in Townsville permanently and one based in Exmouth permanently—and in that way it is at the pointy end of where we can organise all these things to be. It would also give Townsville properly the perfect three-force representation. With the air force facility at Garbutt I would like to see an increased presence and training opportunities there. We have the MHR90 simulator going in there. But there are real problems there and I would like the defence department and the ministers involved in defence to look at the structure of payments here. I have been contacted by the guys at Kookaburra Concrete. They have done the flooring for this, for an organisation that won the tender and is based in South Australia. This organisation has gone into administration over a failed project in South Australia, leaving our guys, our subcontractors in Townsville, very exposed. We all know when it comes to the administration and liquidation of companies that there are real issues. We do have to make sure that these people are taken care of.


As for renewable energy, the Kennedy wind farm, outside Richmond and Hughenden along the Flinders Highway, will bring good power at around $45 per megawatt hour—but they will produce this power and there is nowhere for it to go. I would like to see support for a powerline, be it by CopperString or somebody else, for something like this, which is about renewable energy, to feed into a national grid.


I would like to restate for the record the coalition's support for fair indexation for DFRDB pensions. It is our policy now, it was our policy leading up to 2010 and it is our policy going into the future. I would like to call on the government to recognise the folly of this and that it has gone on since the Whitlam era. We have had more than enough time to fix this, and we have not addressed it. They are not asking for anything extra. They are asking for what is fair.


I would also like to come out and state very clearly for the record that I support the National Disability Insurance Scheme. But we must make sure of how we are going to pay for it. It may get me in trouble with Scott Stidson and Garth Brimelow at home and all the people at Cootharinga in Townsville but we have to get it right and we cannot afford to have people fall through the gaps because we have acted too quickly. Therefore I would like to see as much bipartisanship on this as possible, working towards making sure that everyone will be covered by this so that everyone is brought along and, more importantly than that, so that we are bringing along people who are not actually affected by it at the moment to make them understand what we are trying to do. If someone has a work accident and is put in a wheelchair, as Garth has been, that person is covered, but if you are driving on the weekend and you have an accident—or if you fall off your own balcony—and you are then in a wheelchair for the rest of your life you get nothing. That is what we are trying to cover. These are the sorts of things that we must do. It must be paid for and it must have broad community support. The Every Person Counts campaign is just the start of the conversation. We have to explain to everyone what we are trying to do and why it matters.


I would like to echo the statements in the House today about closing the gap and I would like to echo the words of the Leader of the Opposition in the main chamber this morning. In my electorate is the community of Palm Island, where we have 95 per cent unemployment, yet QBuild, the Queensland government organisation, send tradesmen over to build small houses. The houses are poorly built and poorly designed, and they do not care. We have tradesmen on Palm Island who cannot get jobs. We have 95 per cent unemployment and it has been that way all the way through.


Truancy are education are major issues on Palm Island. If they do not learn to read and write, they will be doomed to repeat the cycle of poor outcomes we are currently experiencing. Too many young people are in jail now because they started as a 16- or 17-year-old driving unlicensed cars and they could not pass the test. They become part of the system and get arrested; sooner or later they are going to end up in jail. If they do not want to do this, if they do not want to end up there, parental and personal responsibility is required to make sure that they do get to school. As the Leader of the Opposition said this morning, truancy is a real issue and we have to make sure that these people are going to school. I have spoken at schools to Indigenous groups and Indigenous students and quite often they say they were not at school that day or that week when they were asked if they had a question for me. This cannot be let go.


Education is the key to everything. I never want to try to simplify the situation. It is a very deep and complicated issue, but we have to know that education is the key. I would like to really push it on everyone, especially on Palm Island, that getting your kids to school—from the mayor's children down, whoever the mayor should be after the last next election—is the key to everyone having a better outcome on Palm Island and in Townsville.

"Smyth, Laura, MP",ALP,2012-02-15,"



Ms SMYTH
 (La Trobe) (10:46):  I am very pleased to be able to speak on the appropriations legislation before us today because this legislation is a very clear way of seeing what the priorities of the government are and what they have been since coming to office. It is particularly important to look at the appropriations that we are considering today, and those that have been made since the government came to office, in the context of the very many challenges that the Australian nation has faced during that time and the way that the government has navigated the nation through them. The spending priorities that are set are a pretty clear reflection of the kinds of priorities a government has for the nation.


It is very interesting in that context to reflect on some of the contributions made by members in this debate, and in broader debates throughout this place, particularly since the commencement of this parliamentary year. I am thinking particularly of those opposite who have contributed to the debate and have largely forgotten, it seems, about two of the very significant things that have impacted upon our economic circumstances and our fortunes generally, namely, the global financial crisis and the significant natural disasters that our country has faced. In the midst of all of these very difficult circumstances for individuals and for our country, this government has consistently shown that it prioritises jobs and that it will support the kinds of social reforms that Labor has always stood for. This includes things like supporting people on a pension, ensuring that families have an opportunity to get a decent level of financial support to be able to look after their children well and provide for their futures and ensuring that our country gets the kind of health and education commitments that it needs in order to become a better country and that its citizens need so that they have a very good quality of life and good prospects in the future. It is extraordinary that some of the comments of those opposite have revealed how little regard they have for such very significant events as the global financial crisis. Indeed, as recently as yesterday, we heard the member for Goldstein speaking in the House during the matter of public importance and mentioning the GFC as some sort of by-line, some sort of anecdote in history, just a blip—




Mr Husic:
   The Asian economic crisis was more important apparently.




Ms SMYTH:
  Indeed. He has actually referred to the government's response as 'a panic reaction to the global financial crisis'. This is understating something that the world is continuing to deal with the aftermath of on a daily basis. A panic reaction! So, while this government was committing funding and making appropriations for the protection of jobs in our country, while this government was committing funds to a stimulus package which has been lauded around the world by countries which would far prefer to be in our circumstances today, we see the economic luminaries of the Liberal Party referring to the government's stimulus spend as a panic reaction to the global financial crisis. It really is quite extraordinary. It comes in the context of all of these 'woulda, shoulda, coulda' commitments that we hear from the Liberals so very regularly. If these guys had been in government, quite clearly our unemployment figures would be double what they are now, quite clearly we would be facing extraordinarily dark financial circumstances. I realise that those members opposite continue to look incredulous about the global financial crisis because it is, in their view, a mere byway in history. But we take it seriously and, strangely enough, economists around the world take it quite seriously and I imagine they would not refer to our response to it as a panic reaction.


Once again, appropriations—what you choose as a government to commit the Australian people's resources to—really do reflect one's priorities, and there could not be a starker example of our priorities for jobs, for the growth of this country, for economic stability and economic security than our response to the global financial crisis. So it bears repeating, and repeat it I certainly will, happily.


We do not hear quite so much from those opposite about the detail of what they might have done had they been in office. There are many reasons for that. One is that they are still not entirely sure about where they would take the country on the question of the surplus, should they ever get the opportunity to come to office. So in the context of an appropriations debate it is very interesting to think about what their priorities might be. It is in fact difficult to get a read on most of them because we do not know day to day what any member of their frontbench and all the people behind them might think about a surplus, might think about our future economic prosperity. We still do not have a complete figure on the extent of the black hole. We think it is about $70 billion, but again that changes depending on who you are speaking to and who has pulled out the abacus on any given day on the opposition benches. Most recently and most pertinently in the context of the current debate on the private health insurance rebate means test, we are still not clear what they are intending to do on that—they might repeal it, they might wind it back—or whether their words on this are as hollow as their words on every other significant debate in this country, whether they will actually stand by their bluff and bluster or whether they are just going to go very quietly on it after the debate has concluded in this place.


It has been very interesting to reflect on some of the things that have come up in the context of this appropriations debate and other significant economic debates which occasionally those opposite choose to engage in, depending on their feel at the time. But the things that we are seeking to get on with and the things that we have made appropriations for and will continue to make appropriations for are around the education of our nation, the development of skills and training for young people in our nation, to provide for lifelong learning, to ensure that our children have the skills that they need for future career development but also to ensure the future economic prosperity of our country. I was delighted at the end of last year to have announced in my electorate a commitment by this government to two new trade training centres. We know that, when we came to government, those opposite had so badly underfunded skills and training in this country that electorates like mine really had very little in the way of skills and infrastructure investment. It was enormously pleasing to have been able to visit both of the schools that will be sites for the trade training centres. The first of the schools that I visited was Belgrave Heights Christian College, which has been given a commitment of $1.2 million for a new trade training centre to be built there. That will enable children and young adults from the area to develop skills in hospitality. This is a facility that is going to be able to be used—and I know that the school is very willing for it to be made available for this—by students from right around the hills area. In the hills area there is a great deal of interest in this trade training facility.


The reason this government has committed money to this—the reason we have committed so much to skills and training in electorates such as mine—is we know that a person who leaves school before finishing year 12 will earn around 20 per cent below average earnings. That is the reason this government, through its appropriations and through its policy approach since coming to office, has invested and is investing in trade training. It is for the future.


Unfortunately, we tend not to see terribly much from those opposite on this. We know that they defunded skills and training while they were in office. Belgrave Heights Christian College was also the beneficiary of a very significant BER investment. They are delighted with this government's investment in the school and the benefit for the surrounding community. The principal, Andy Callow, was incredibly enthusiastic about the opportunities available to students at his school. He very generously has extended those opportunities to students at other schools in the area.


The second of the trade training centres—which are, as all of us on this side know, part of a national program to invest in trade training right around the country—to be established in my electorate will be at Hillcrest Christian College at the southern end of my electorate. This will benefit students from areas such as Clyde, Officer, Berwick, Beaconsfield and surrounding areas in the south-east of Melbourne. I was delighted to be able to visit that school. The centre is going to provide skills in the equine industry and that is particularly appropriate for the part of the world in which it is located. I was pleased to be able to speak to the principal, Daniel Pampuch, to get a very good understanding of the kinds of skills that will be on offer for students right around the southern part of my electorate.


These are serious and practical commitments, things that stand to benefit many students into the future. They are just two of the commitments that I could mention. Approximately 61 schools in my electorate have benefited from the BER program. Around 118 projects have been completed or are underway. Those projects involve the commitment of around $110 million in my electorate alone. Schools know the priority that this government puts on education. They know that there are practical and real commitments being made, commitments that were never made under the 'woulda, shoulda, coulda' years of the Howard government. We hear the revisionist commitment to education that those opposite supposedly now have, but we all know better. Virtually all of my schools, it is fair to say, also know better.


These are the things that we are doing in education. We have made very significant commitments to things like the National Solar Schools Program, which schools in my electorate have benefited from. There is an enormous range of things happening right around the country and in my electorate in education that I have mentioned in this place previously and that I will continue to extol the virtues of both here and elsewhere.


Government investment in another key areas has, as so many Australians know, created enormous practical changes, and that is the commitment of this government in health. My electorate has been the beneficiary of some of the appropriations made by this government in health in each year it has been in office. Nationally, the government's commitment to hospital funding has seen an increase of $20 billion since 2008. That is no mean feat, and it is certainly no mean feat in the context of an opposition which maintains its commitment to cut spending in health on things like GP superclinics and a whole variety of other things that this government has done to make practical health improvements for a constituency such as mine. We know that when those opposite were in office they slashed the health budget by $1 billion. Indeed, the Leader of the Opposition was principally responsible for that piece of policy work.


In my electorate, I want to focus on the commitment to mental health investment that this government has made. Nationally, this government has committed to $2.2 billion in early intervention and care in mental health. I am very pleased to say that my electorate will be the beneficiary of a regional headspace unit, which will offer support and assistance to so many young people in what is one of the fastest growing areas of Melbourne and one of the fastest growing areas of our country.

"Entsch, Warren, MP",LP,2012-02-15,"



Mr ENTSCH
 (Leichhardt—Chief Opposition Whip) (11:39):  I rise today to speak on Appropriation Bill (No.3) 2011-12 and Appropriation Bill (No.4) 20011-12. I am particularly concerned because the purpose of these bills is to continue to raise additional revenue. We see major blow-outs in a broad range of areas. I think immigration is a classic example, where there is an additional $330 million to cover last year's underestimations. We are now looking at a $1 billion fee in relation to a failed policy. Prior to 2007 this issue had been comprehensively addressed by a government that I was very proud to be in.


I do apologise for my tardiness. My legs slowed me down a little. We have just come back from a vote in the House and in my view we are going to see a very significant winding back of private health insurance in this country. That in itself is going to force a lot more people to either exit private health insurance because it will become unaffordable or, at the very least, reduce their cover. In doing so, it is going to put a massive impost on regional hospitals. As I spoke about last night, in Cairns they are already bursting at the seams and do not have the capacity because of underfunding and gross mismanagement by the state government and the politicisation of the health bureaucracy, which has seen some appalling decisions. It is struggling to cope. When you have a look at that and then you have a look at the money that has been squandered over the last few years, you have to despair at the money that was lost—$2.4 billion on pink batts—and at the lives that were lost, including one up in my region. We are familiar with the other fiascos. The school building program up in our area was a joke quite frankly.


But there are other impacts. Last year I raised the issue of the flooding of six communities in the outer islands of the Torres Strait. After not getting any satisfaction or any interest from the government, I made a decision to put up a private member's motion. As that private member's motion was going through, I was a little surprised but also pleased that I was approached by Simon Crean's office asking me to delay the voting until August. From the advice I received from his office, the government was of the view that they would support the building of these walls with a $22 million investment. Rather than play politics with it, I agreed to hold it over. His problem was that he did not want to take the money out of the Regional Development Australia Fund. He wanted to find, in their words, another bucket of money. I agreed to that in the interests of having the matter resolved, appreciating that about a third of the Saibai Island cemetery had already been washed out into the sea, that there was $1 billion worth of infrastructure on these six islands that needed to be protected and that there were some serious health risks in relation to the inundation of water during the king tide period.


The vote eventually went through in August and I wrote a letter to Minister Crean thanking him for his cooperation and consideration with regard to the urgent needs of the Torres Strait Island communities and asking if he could give me a time frame for when the money would be available to start addressing these concerns. I should have been suspicious when there was a delay in his response. Eventually I got that response. I got it just before the Christmas break. I had gone around and seen the minister. At that point, he started umming and ahing—he was surrounded by department officials—and he said he would have a letter to me shortly.


Just before Christmas, I got a Christmas present from Simon Crean. Basically, he wrote to me and said: 'This is not a problem of the government; this is something that has to go back to local government. It's a state government, local government problem. We give financial assistance grants to the Torres Strait council for $6 million a year. Let them fix the problem.' This is in direct contradiction to the commitment that was given. I actually have an email from one of his senior staff members apologising to me for the deceit and for the misleading arrangement that they made. At every opportunity I get, I will continue to remind the Torres Strait Islander people of the deceit by Minister Crean—I think it was him more than his office because I actually have an apology from one of his former staff.


Sadly, because of that deceit, we have now seen the king tides hit again. We have seen more of the cemeteries—people's families—being washed out to sea, never to be recovered. I was amazed to find that this same government, at the same time, committed $328.2 million to micro Pacific nations to assist them in dealing with climate change. That money goes through the UN. Guess what that is going for? We see all of the problem at the moment about leadership. This is buying a position through the UN for none other than Mr K Rudd. They do not realise that the islands in the Torres Strait are in the Pacific. They do not realise that the islands in the Torres Strait are actually part of Australia. And these islands are having massive damage every year in king tides. It is totally fixable. They could do it over two years with $22 million.




Mr Tehan:
  22?




Mr ENTSCH:
  22. Do you know what the problem with the Torres Strait Islanders is? They do not have a vote on the UN. We wonder, if we were to get them a vote, how quickly the government would be racing out there to get things fixed. You know: another vote with the UN; another way of getting rid of a thorn in the side of this government.


At every opportunity, I will continue to raise this. I think it is absolutely appalling that $328 million of taxpayers' money can go over to those microcountries but we cannot afford to save Australian communities suffering from the same challenges. It is just absolutely appalling.


While I am on that subject, I will talk about some other issues that we are facing too. We remember quite clearly the building revolution that we had in the stimulus package. How great was that? That was going to really make things happen. Of course, it was another example of wasted opportunities and a continued, building deficit, which facilitates the requirement that we have now for raising more money to pay for misjudgments or miscalculations in funding. In spending the money on those school halls, they had another layer of bureaucracy. They should have invested in more practical infrastructure.


In my electorate of Leichhardt, for example, schools are notoriously lacking in basic facilities. I am not referring to schools in remote communities here, which have been traditionally neglected by state governments, or even city schools. In some cases, only the threat of strike action by teachers and protests by parents have forced the issue of funding. Trinity Beach State School, which is in the northern suburbs in Cairns, was so run down that parents threatened to take their kids out of school unless basic issues such as covered play areas, rusted gutters, drainpipes, poor drainage and leaky, smelly toilet blocks were fixed. The state government only started to put money into those after parents shamed them into doing it.


The sad part about it is that the stimulus packages that we have heard so much about in recent years certainly failed to equip schools with much-needed facilities. I think that, again, it is another indictment of seriously failed policies, which at some stage we are going to have to address. Another area I would like to mention is our banks. There have been a lot of issues about banks in recent times and a lot of concerns about the dominance of the major four. Recently we had the decision from ANZ to independently raise interest rates. And, of course, the others all followed because they are very keen to get their snouts in the trough and take as much as they can from their mortgage holders. The greed of these banks, in their pursuit of increased profits at the expense of their customers, is most evident.


Another thing the big four banks are doing is changing their loan-to-valuation ratios. In my area, where we have been doing it tough for the last four or five years, they have been adjusting their loan-to-valuation ratios. They used to be around 70 to 80 per cent but they are now dropping them to around 60 to 65 per cent. At the expense of their borrowers, the banks are getting their valuers to go in and revalue the properties. The banks are telling the valuers what price they expect and they are bringing the value down by about 20 per cent. The valuers have got no choice; if they do not do it they have got no work. So they are doing this. And the borrowers are charged for the privilege. The banks come back to the borrower and say: 'Your valuation has dropped by 20 per cent and we've adjusted the loan-to-valuation ratio. We know you've made every payment that has ever been required of you but you now need to put in X amount of dollars to fix that adjustment. If you don't, you must sell any other real estate or property you have or we're going to come in and take back your property.' This is the sort of thing that is happening. It puts huge pressure on many businesses in the area. It is quite frightening to see and I think we need to be very vigilant with this. I think it is about time we had some sort of inquiry into the practices of the big banks.


But there is an alternative. There is a little bank in Cairns that has been going for 112 years. It is called the Cairns Penny Savings and Loans. I declare an interest here. I actually use it as my preferred bank. It is totally based in Cairns. We have got Peter Phillips and his team. They are all local people in that bank. There is a local board with all local people. The bank was originally established in 1899 by a group of locals who noted that banking in those days was aimed at the more lucrative trading cycles and tended to overlook the needs of local residents. What has changed in 112 years!


This bank has been an outstanding success in our region. Not only are their interest rates very competitive but they have the trust of the customers. You can walk in and talk to them anytime. They do not have all these undisclosed fees for services that continue to escalate in the big banks. They have not had to wind back these fees—as we see some of the big banks doing because they have been subject to a whole range of criticism because people just cannot afford it anymore—as they have never had them in the first place.


The Treasurer says you can walk away from the big banks. But we need to be looking at ways we can establish more of these wonderful little institutions like the Penny Savings and Loans. That will be real competition to the greedy big four and it will get community banking, and trust, back into our communities. That is the sort of thing that will actually make a difference. With all these inquiries and everything, the big fellas will still find ways around it. But if we find ways of making it easier to establish these little community banks I think you will find it will make a profound difference for our communities. (Time expired)

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2012-02-15,"



Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (11:54):  I rise today to speak about investment, something that the Gillard Labor government is not afraid to make—particularly when it comes to Canberra and the people here who strive to make this town the best capital city in the world. The government is committed to delivering a strong clean energy future for Australia, improving our economy and returning the budget to surplus in 2012-13.


The 2011-12 budget delivered some great things for Canberra. Our nation's capital saw investment of $82.2 million for roads, $30.6 million for the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, $33.9 million for the Australian War Memorial and $1.7 million for a new exhibition on World War I, $6.1 million in base funding for the High Court, $2 million for the completion of the National Gallery of Australia building and $2.1 million for Australian Disability Enterprises to support the work of Koomarri.


Koomarri is based in my electorate. It provides a great service to disabled Canberrans and to the carers and parents of those disabled Canberrans. I attended an event late last year where I met with a number of carers and their disabled children, some of whom are quite profoundly disabled. One of the key or fundamental messages I got from the conversations I had with those parents—who were quite often in tears and very distressed and concerned about what is going to happen to their children if they pass on or if they become ill at some stage—was, 'Bring on the National Disability Insurance Scheme.' These people want the National Disability Insurance Scheme. They see the value of it, and the sooner they can get it the better. It was very strong and profound message. Many of these parents were in tears because they are terribly worried about what is going to happen to their children. Some of the children were in their early 20s. Their parents were a bit older—in their late 50s and 60s—and they were concerned about what is going to happen to their children if they get ill and eventually do pass away. The message from them was, 'Please—we love the National Disability Insurance Scheme and we want it to come along as soon as possible.'


Canberra, and the indeed the nation, has also undoubtedly benefited from a range of investments in health, training, infrastructure, small business and families. I would like to outline some of the achievements we have made in those areas today. Better health and a better health system will always be a Labor priority. We were the ones who introduced Medicare. A universal health system is in the Labor DNA. It is fundamental to Labor's identity. In the ACT, the federal government has invested $67 million in a range of health reforms, including $8.3 million to expand the capacity of public hospital emergency departments, $26 million in capital and recurrent funding to deliver 21 subacute beds, $6.8 million to boost elective surgery capacity at the Canberra Hospital and $7.5 million in flexible capital funding.


In the past 12 months I have been out to the Canberra Hospital on a number of occasions with the former minister for health and the ACT Chief Minister, and had a number of tours of the great new facilities that are being built and expanded out there. The Canberra Hospital in Woden, which is in my electorate, is a great institution and very much loved by Canberrans. Canberrans have a great sense of ownership of the Canberra Hospital. They also have a very keen interest in its future. The Canberra Hospital services about 30 per cent of the region—so it is not just a hospital for Canberra, it is a hospital for the capital region. Through our investments, and also the investments of the ACT government, we are seeing it ever expanding, ever growing, and ever providing better health services for the people of Canberra.


Among the funding that we have provided to the Canberra Hospital and to health in the region is funding for 24 regional cancer centres around Australia to bring services closer to patients. I was pleased last year to be joined by the previous minister, Nicola Roxon, to turn the first sod on a fantastic new regional cancer centre to support and treat people from the ACT and our region—that 30 per cent in the region that are battling cancer. This centre will provide support to half a million people in the region. It will be a wonderful support to them and their families, and I am very much looking forward to watching this cancer centre being built over the next 12 months and coming years. It will provide a much needed facility to Canberrans and also to people in the region. It will also provide an opportunity for people in the region to stay in Canberra to get the support that they need when they are battling cancer or coming up to be diagnosed with potential cancer. As we all know from our own personal experiences and the experiences of people in our electorates, it can be very challenging and confronting if you are diagnosed with cancer and then to have to go through that journey of travelling interstate or intraregion to get your treatment can also be very challenging and often quite lonely. This cancer centre will provide much needed support and respite for those cancer sufferers and for their families. It is a very welcome initiative. I was proud that the Gillard government contributed some $30 million to this $46 million project.


But Labor's investment in health goes beyond Canberra. For a start, we have invested $2.2 billion in mental health, which includes 30 new headspace centres to bring the national total to 90 and provide nationwide coverage, up to 12 additional youth psychosis centres, 40 more family support services, 425 more personal helpers and mentors, and $344 million for new support services for the severely mentally ill and the National Mental Health Commission. I am very much looking forward to speaking tonight in the adjournment debate on post-traumatic stress disorder and what is happening in this space and the range of support mechanisms that are set up to deal with this disorder. It is one of those things that does afflict many people and can often be quite invisible. So I am looking forward to bringing people's attention to that in the adjournment debate tonight. There is also another $3 billion to improve hospitals and cancer facilities throughout Australia. I mentioned what was happening in Canberra but that applies right across the nation.


The Gillard Labor government is also investing $53 million to help improve access to public dental services. This investment is important because in 2007 Labor inherited a health shambles: six in 10 Australians were living with doctor shortages, public hospitals were run into the ground and bulkbilling was in national decline. Since then, Labor has worked to turn this Liberal shambles around. We increased capital works with $1.8 billion to build and rebuild 63 hospitals and health centres. We funded more doctors and nurses and boosted Medicare rebates to help bulkbilling grow. We delivered national health reform one year ago this week, ending the state and federal blame game in health. We have delivered more money, more beds, less waste and less waiting for public hospitals nationwide. There has also been our investment in nurses. We are training an extra 1,000 nurses every year and an extra 5,500 doctors over 10 years. We have increased public hospital funding by 50 per cent and reached agreement with states and territories on funding future public hospital growth via an extra 1,300 federally funded hospital beds and a further 13,000 residential aged care places. We are doing more to ensure there is fairness in our health system. This will be done through a means test of the private health insurance rebate, which looks on track. It has been passed today. So a household on $1,000 does not subsidise the insurance of one on $500,000.


The Gillard Labor government's commitment to health just goes on and on. We are also equipping 120 hospitals with new elective surgery equipment and/or operating theatres. We are investing in new community health programs, including plain packaging of tobacco products, tough new restrictions on tobacco advertising and subsidised nicotine replacement therapies. We are investing in the after-hours GP helpline for 24-hour day access to expert health advice. These are just some of the latest investments in health. This is because only Labor cares about delivering world-class health care for all Australians and only Labor can be trusted to keep our health and our public hospital system strong. I look forward to seeing even more investment in the health services that will be possible with the introduction of the means test for the private health insurance rebate.


I turn now to infrastructure, which is a fundamental framework for us to enhance productivity and to grow this nation. In terms of infrastructure, the Gillard Labor government has invested $1.1 million to fix local black spots on top of the $82 million for road infrastructure this financial year—this is just in the Canberra context. There was also the announcement by Minister Albanese of $144 million in funding for the Majura Parkway. That is perhaps the most welcome announcement of all, as it delivers something that has been needed for many years. The ACT government will co-fund that. It is very welcome news. We have the Tuggeranong Parkway and Gungahlin Drive linking one side of the city from north to south. But we now need to have the other side of the city linked from north to south, and the Majura Parkway will allow that to happen.


Investment in infrastructure and roads in Canberra has included $200 million for new roads and for the maintenance of Edison and Glebe Parks. We have had $32,000 for signage and line-marking improvements in Tuggeranong in my electorate. We have had over $240,000 for signage and intersection improvements for the intersections of Mugga Lane and Long Gully Road in Symonston.


In addition to that, we have made an $18.5 million investment in the Monaro Highway. The ACT government has also provided about $2 million for that. I am very much looking forward to that coming on line. That will finally, after 40 years, make the Monaro Highway a dual carriageway the whole way. We have been waiting 40 years for this to happen. At the moment, the upgrade is causing a bit of inconvenience for my constituents who work in Fyshwick. But it is a welcome development. I am very much looking forward to going out there and getting an update on progress in the near future. Thanks to both federal and ACT Labor we are seeing that huge enhancement occur after waiting for 40 years. It is a great development.


I could go on and on about the support that is being delivered to community organisations. I would just like to mention one, though—the investment that we have made in the Canberra Rape Crisis Centre, which last year received more calls than ever before. The Rape Crisis Centre is in my electorate and it does incredibly important work. I am a very strong supporter of it. Last year, we had Minister Ellis out there speaking to the workers, who do a fantastic job in providing support to men and women in Canberra. The Governor-General officially opened their beautiful new premises in Weston Creek. I am very proud of that investment and very proud of the fabulous work that the Canberra Rape Crisis Centre does.


When it comes to skills training, we have also made record investments in that area. The dignity of work is something that our government wants to help all Australians realise. I know that there are many employment initiatives in electorates across the country to get people into work and help them stay there. Better education, training and infrastructure are top priorities for the Gillard Labor government. I am always proud to tell my constituents how we have doubled investment in school education, upgraded facilities at every school and provided more information for parents than ever before. I mentioned this last night. I have nearly finished all the official openings of the projects funded through our significant Building the Education Revolution investment.


Each primary school across my electorate received between $1.5 million and about $3.5 million and all the parents, students and staff in those school communities are absolutely overjoyed at the investment that we have made. In many ways, they cannot believe their luck in many ways, because they would never have been able to raise that sort of money through sausage sizzles or fetes. It would not have been possible. It is beyond their wildest dreams. Not one person I have met at those schools does not think that the BER is the greatest of investments.


We have also created 130,000 new training places and are encouraging apprentices to stay in their training and to get a skilled job by investing $100 million in a mentoring program, $100 million in new apprenticeship models that deliver high-quality skills quickly and $30 million to help mature age workers formalise their trade skills.


The Gillard Labor government has made significant investments in Canberra in education, health, infrastructure and community organisations—the list goes on and on. I am particularly proud of what we are doing here in Canberra. The feedback that I am getting from the community is that they love what we are doing here. I am very proud to represent the Gillard Labor government in Canberra and am very proud of the investment that we are making. (Time expired)

"Tehan, Dan, MP",LP,2012-02-15,"



Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon) (12:09):  I rise today to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2011-2012 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2011-2012. When talking about the overall economic performance of the Gillard government there are three issues that come top of mind. The first one is the issue of trust and credibility—the issue of the truth. The second one is waste—and we have seen a lot of waste. The third one is the carbon tax and what it is going to do to the already increasing cost of living being felt in communities across the country.


Trust in government is vital and trust in the Prime Minister is vital. Yet sadly what we are seeing day by day is that our Prime Minister cannot be trusted. We saw it with the promise that there would be no carbon tax under a government she led, which was made before the last election and then was immediately disavowed after the election. We have seen it rear its ugly head with what happened on Australia Day. As 7.30 highlighted last night, we now once again cannot believe the version of events that we are getting from the Prime Minister on this issue. We have seen it with the private health insurance bills, the commitments that were made before the 2007 election and what was done immediately after to renege on those commitments.


Trust in government is very important for overall economic health. If you cannot trust what the Prime Minister and the government are saying then the overall sovereign risk increases. We now have companies, small businesses and individuals—farmers and manufacturers; people in all sectors of our economy—unable to believe what this government tells them. That means that the investment decisions that they would like to make are being put off, because they do not know whether this government will go back on its word and make a decision that will harm that long-term investment if they go forward with those investment decisions.


The best thing that we can do to improve sovereign risk in this country is to go to an election. People are fed up with their being told one thing and then the government doing another. It has got to the stage where lack of trust is eroding people's confidence in this government. It is time for the government to recognise this and to realise that it is damaging the nation and increasing sovereign risk, meaning that investment in all sectors across the country is being curtailed. No-one has the confidence to believe what the government is saying, even when it is looking them in the eye. They are worried that it will do something else. That is sad.


This was personified in the Prime Minister's appearance on Four Corners. I do not think that we have ever seen anything shiftier in political history in Australia than her answers to the two questions that were put to her about whether she had seen the polling that was being handed around to destabilise Kevin Rudd and whether a speech was being prepared in her office two weeks before Kevin Rudd was rolled. If you cannot have confidence in the words of the Prime Minister, it harms in every way people's ability to look and say, 'Okay, what is the level of sovereign risk in this country?' Australia has always been seen as a safe place to put investment.


I now turn to the question of waste. You have all seen today just another example of how this government treats the taxpayer with utter contempt. On the front page of today's Australianwe have the $700 Labor Party set-top box. We then have the $19 set-top box, which you can get down at your local discount store. The $19 set-top box versus the $700 Labor set-top box. On the front page of the Australianis pictured one of my constituents, who made this very valid comment which I think stands true for a lot of the spending problems this government has. She said:


I think their idea might have been well intended, but you wonder if they thought it through.


I will just repeat that, because I am hoping that the Labor members who are here today might just take this into account the next time they think of one of their wonderful ideas: 'I think their idea might have been well intended, but you wonder if they thought it through.' That is the $700 Labor set-top box versus the $19 set-top box that you can get from your local discount store. It is gross waste.


Let us turn to the BER. Once again it would be fair to say that the idea might have been well intended, but you wonder if they thought it through. Sadly, they did not. I have seen in my electorate example after example of waste and more waste. There is a little school, which I will not name because the school is still dealing with the BER issue, in one of the areas of socioeconomic disadvantage in my electorate. There is a school principal who is doing outstanding work in trying to educate those students. They had a roof which needed replacing because it was leaking. An amount of $1.2 million was spent on giving the school a new roof. The first time that it rained, the principal had to get up with a hammer because the rain was pouring so badly into one of the classrooms. She had to get up on a ladder herself and get a hammer and fix a hole in the roof to make sure that damage was not done to all the inside carpet and from rain running down the walls and ripping all the paint off the walls. So it was $1.2 million to fix the problem and the problem was made worse.




Mr Neumann:
  Whose fault's that?




Mr TEHAN:
  Yes, whose problem was that? It had nothing to do with the federal government that allocated the money! No; you just gave the money and then you wiped your hands. You do not care what happens to that taxpayers' money.




Mr Neumann:
  Oh, rubbish; that's nonsense.




Mr TEHAN:
  Why are you laughing then?



Mr Neumann interjecting—




Mr TEHAN:
  You are laughing at this; you do not care what happens to the—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Murphy
):  Order! The member for Wannon will not respond to the interjections, and the member for Blair will desist from interjecting.




Mr TEHAN:
  What happened in that school is an absolute disgrace. You should come down and talk to the principal about it, and then you would see firsthand what happened to that $1.2 million. That program was rushed out. I go back to my constituent who was on the front page of the Australian today, who said, 'I think their idea might have been well intended, but you wonder if they thought it through.' And they did not.


Just think about what could have been done with the money that was wasted. When we talk about employment, when we talk about job creation, think about what could have been done with that money. For instance, what about if you had thought: 'Okay, we've got a couple of billion dollars here; maybe we should go to state governments. One idea which might be quite a good one is, ''Let's work towards the reduction of payroll tax.''' If you understand business in the community, you will understand that payroll tax is one of the biggest disincentives to employing people. That would have been a very constructive way, a way which structurally would have changed the employment market in this country and led to more job creation. That is just one idea. The member for Blair asked me for one—there it is, right on the plate. Think about it; it would be a very good way to go about it.


The third issue is one that is about to hit the community and businesses across my electorate and across the country. It will add to the cost of living. It is the carbon tax. It is not too late to say that the carbon tax is the wrong policy at the wrong time. If you will face up to that you can save this country from immeasurable damage from this insidious tax.


I have an aluminium smelter in Portland in my electorate. It is a very good investment by Alcoa. It provides incredibly important jobs and, not only that, those jobs feed into the local community and provide jobs there as well. The carbon tax will add a $40 million cost to smeltering for Alcoa in the state of Victoria. That is the figure that was announced by the company in Senate estimates. At this time, when a review has just been announced of the 600 workers' jobs at Point Henry, and the company has come out and stated that the carbon tax is going to be a $40 million hit to its bottom line, why would you progress with it? Surely you would step back and say, given the climate for manufacturing at the moment, that this is not the right tax for the right time. You would admit, 'We got it wrong.' I would go back to my constituents and say, 'Maybe the idea was well intended, but I wonder whether we have thought this through properly.'


It is not just big manufacturing; it is small manufacturing. With a company like Gason in my electorate, which manufactures equipment which leads to a reduction in carbon emissions from soy, what are they getting for producing this equipment?




Mr Stephen Jones:
  Carbon farming!




Mr TEHAN:
  Carbon farming does nothing for them. Understand the issue—they are a manufacturer. Carbon farming does nothing for them. You do not understand your issue. What do they get for producing carbon-reduction equipment? They get a carbon tax. How is that fair? The carbon tax will add to the cost of living, and understand that the cost of living is increasing. We see it with insurance premiums, with people's electricity bills and with the cost of child care—another policy where once again this government's intentions might have been okay but they did not think through what the ultimate result of their policy would be.


I welcome the opportunity today to talk on these two appropriation bills and to raise the three key points that I have raised. The first was about the issue of trust and, sadly—I know the members sitting opposite saw it—that Four Corners show once and for all detailed that we have a Prime Minister and therefore a government which cannot be trusted. The second point I have highlighted is that we continue to see waste upon waste upon waste. Labor's $700 set-top box is just another example of this, especially when you realise that for $19 at the local discount store you can get a set-top box. The third issue is what the carbon tax is going to do to manufacturing—both small and large—in this country and, also, to the cost of living, to what it is going to do to increase people's electricity bills and to what it is going to do to a range of issues in driving up overall costs. It is an insidious tax and the government should just admit that it was an idea that might have been well intended but they never thought it through. (Time expired)

"Neumann, Shayne, MP",ALP,2012-02-15,"



Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (12:24):  This government's record on economic management has resulted in lower taxes, stronger growth, lower interest rates, lower unemployment and inflation in a low band. This government's economic management is the envy of the OECD. This government's economic management has seen a stimulus which has retained jobs. About 250,000 people would have been thrown on the scrap heap if those opposite had followed what they thought was the New Zealand model, and we would have seen unemployment rates in excess of seven per cent in this country. The rate is about 5.2 per cent.


Those opposite have said no to my electorate and no to the country—no to Blair, no to Ipswich and no to Somerset. There is not a road-funding bill that has been passed through this House in the last four years since I have been elected that those opposite have not opposed. There has not been a health-funding bill that those opposite have opposed that has not made an impact on my electorate. There has not been a bill in relation to education that has made a positive impact on my electorate that those opposite have not opposed. There has not been a regional development infrastructure funding commitment and execution in my electorate that those opposite have not opposed. Time and again they have opposed every single thing. They say no to Ipswich, no to Somerset and no to Queensland.


What we have done with respect to road funding in my home state, doubling the funding to $8.5 billion, those opposite failed to do. We have increased the funding for rail 10 times and doubled the road funding—$36 billion for road, rail and ports. Those opposite should stand condemned with respect to road funding in South-East Queensland in particular.


They have opposed, for three elections in a row, the most important road-funding commitment that this government has made, the Ipswich Motorway. It will be completed by the middle of or late this year. The Ipswich Motorway links Brisbane to Ipswich and goes on, linking from there to the Warrego and Cunningham highways, to western Queensland, Toowoomba, the Darling Downs, the Lockyer Valley, the Brisbane Valley et cetera. That is where we get the minerals through—on those roads. That is where farmers take their produce to the Rocklea markets and on to the ports. That is where mums and dads drive through. We have done the Ipswich Motorway against the opposition of those opposite. All the mayors in South-East Queensland supported it. Even Campbell Newman, the alternative Premier of Queensland, supported it. Those opposite opposed it.


They opposed the funding for the Blacksoil Interchange—again, one of the magnificent seven projects that we were urged to do by the mayors of South-East Queensland. We put in $54 million, and the state Labor government has just closed the tender. Those opposite opposed it for 11½ years. They opposed the Dinmore to Goodna section of the Ipswich Motorway, doing nothing on the Blacksoil Interchange for 11½ years.


Let us look at road funding. Those opposite gave such little amounts. For example, let us talk about the Somerset Regional Council. Under Roads to Recovery from 2005-06 to 2008-09, the total amount that the Somerset Regional Council received under those opposite—and this is the local council with the largest area in South-East Queensland—was only $714,468. That council has the largest area of the councils in South-East Queensland, and it got $714,000. We increased it to $3.266 million in local road funding from 2009-10 to 2013-14.


For Ipswich City Council again we did that. We increased it from $5.9 million to $6.55 million. Even in the electorate of the member for Groom, the road funding increased from $3.9 million to $14.9 million, with those opposite opposing all funding for roads. Brisbane City Council got the same. Road funding was massively increased for South-East Queensland, with those opposite opposing it time and time again.


The member for Wannon talks about waste. Is the road funding in South-East Queensland a waste? One in seven Australians lives in South-East Queensland. Is that a waste? Yet they opposed the funding for it. They should stand condemned for that. It is ridiculous to oppose that


What about regional infrastructure in that area? They opposed all the regional infrastructure in that area in my electorate. They opposed the funding for the Ipswich civic centre upgrade. They opposed the funding for the Ipswich Baptist Church community hall upgrade. They opposed the funding for the aquatic facilities and also for the River Heart Parklands on the Bremer River in my electorate. They opposed the corporate centre in the north Ipswich football area, where the Ipswich Jets play every week. They opposed the funding for the Fernvale Indoor Sports Centre, the skate parks at Esk and the skate part at Kilcoy. They opposed the funding for the Somerset Civic Centre—$2 million under Regional Development Australia funding. They say no to every regional infrastructure fund in my electorate. They also opposed the road funding.


Let's talk about health funding. They opposed the GP superclinic in Ipswich, which was so influential and helpful during the flood. They opposed the funding of the Medicare Locals program and for the health and hospital networks. They also opposed the funding we put into the Ipswich general hospital and they opposed the rehabilitation, geriatric and palliative care funding that we provided.


They opposed the BER in my electorate. The member for Wannon talks about the BER and that it is all a waste. Tell the people of Esk, the people of Fernvale and the people of Patrick Estate in my electorate who used those BER halls and sheds as the place they went to to shelter from the flood. That helped them to rebuild their homes and their communities. Those opposite say that is a waste. The BER projects provided jobs and vital infrastructure. In my seat, I cannot find one community that does not think the BER was a good thing for their school community. BER has been so important.


They opposed the trade training centres. They opposed the Ipswich trade training centre at St Edmund's. They have a fantastic facility there that is linked to Ipswich Girls Grammar School and Ipswich Grammar School. That project was $3 million. Those opposite also opposed all the computers in schools. They would rip up that program. They criticised us for not delivering them fast enough and then went to the last election with a policy opposed to it. They opposed the funding for the trade training centre at St Peter Claver College. They opposed the funding for the trade training centre at Ipswich State High School which is linked to other schools in Ipswich and the lower Somerset. They opposed the language learning centres and the science laboratories at places like St Peter Claver College and Ipswich State High School.


They cannot find a school funding project that they would not oppose in the BER. The Leader of the Opposition actually belled the cat on this because he does not want certain people to be educated well. He only wants the right people to be educated well. That is what he said: only the right people. They opposed all the BER funding. Those opposite do not want to fund areas of social and economic disadvantage. Only Labor governments provide for the Ipswich and Somerset region. Only Labor governments provide the road funding in that area.


Think of all the national school partnerships. Think of all the things in the 20 schools in the Ipswich and the Somerset region that are taking part. I have seen the advantage that has been provided in real working-class areas like One Mile and Leichhardt. I have seen the pride in the schools there and their pride in the extra facilities they have received. I have seen the improvements in literacy and numeracy in those schools. To have seen the great things that have been done in those schools is fantastic. I have 64 schools in my electorate and five more have recently opened. We have invested in those schools. Also, we have provided additional funding for chaplains in those schools. They helped so much during the flood. We are rolling out more chaplaincy services in those areas and I know that they will be warmly appreciated.


With respect to funding in my electorate, all those opposite can do is say no. On this side, we know how important these projects are. I was not intending to do this, but I want to go through this because the member for Wannon talked about waste and the BER. When I got elected in 2007, I was approached by the community at Brassall State School, the third biggest primary school in my electorate, about the need for a new school hall. The P&C president, Shelly McDonald, came and talked to me about it. She said that the previous member for Blair could not get them funding. They kept on asking for it all the time. We rolled out that funding under the BER and the Prime Minister was with me when we opened that school hall at Brassall State School on 21 July last year. Peter Doyle was the principal then. That school lost all of its computers owing to flooding. It had buildings demolished because they were flooded. There was not a piece of paper left as a result of the flood. It was entirely trashed. All credit goes to Peter Doyle and the whole school community for rebuilding the school and having the kids back on time. That school hall was a symbol of the pride of that school. They were so happy that day to see that school hall officially opened by the Prime Minister. Does the member for Wannon think that was a waste?


What about the new facilities for St Joseph's? St Joseph's Primary School in North Ipswich was the flood evacuation centre for the people of Brassall and North Ipswich during the flood in January 2011. I was there and opened the new facilities at that school. They received $2.625 million for a new library, new classrooms and other improvements. The people of Brassall and North Ipswich suffered in the flood. I saw the happiness, the joy, the enthusiasm, the pride and the self-respect of the people and the whole Catholic community in North Ipswich and Brassall on the day that was opened. Does the member for Wannon think that was a waste? I do not think it was.


What about Esk? That was where the SES and the rural fire brigade stayed. That is where people bunked as the waters from Redbank Creek flooded through the CBD of Esk and through people's houses. Esk Caravan Park was destroyed. People went to that hall. Without that hall there was nothing in Esk and no place to go. Was that a waste of money? Do not tell the people of Esk that was a waste of money because it certainly was not. The new library and the new hall are an important part of the education of the children there.


What about the heritage in my home city of Ipswich? We have seen refurbishments, a new multipurpose hall and a new gym, in one of the oldest schools in Ipswich, Ipswich Central State School—my dad's old school. It got $3.2 million. I know that is one of Ipswich's oldest schools and it is important. What about poor Karalee, where hundreds and hundreds of homes were flooded in January 2011? A grant of $3 million effectively gave them their own civic centre at the Karalee State School—a new performing arts and resources centre. I know that is so important for that area. I saw the happiness on the young people's faces as they performed on that Saturday afternoon when we opened it. Karalee was badly hit during the flood. Was the funding there wasted? I say it was not.


What about the new kitchen gardens at WoodLinks State School and Lowood State School? We gave them $60,000 grants under the Stephanie Alexander Kitchen Garden Foundation. Was that a waste? I think not, and the people do not believe that either. What about Claremont Special School and Ipswich West Special School? After I got elected Ipswich West Special School approached me because they needed a hydrotherapy complex—a pool for their kids with severe disabilities. They had not been able to get the money under the coalition. For over 20 years Peter Davis was the principal there and he could not convince coalition members in the federal government to give him the money. They would not do it. We provided that funding. We did it for them and now they have got a hydrotherapy complex there under the BER. Was that waste? I think not.


I could go on and on and on. Those opposite stand condemned for their refusal to invest in health, education, community and road infrastructure in South-East Queensland. They say one thing down here and they visit all those schools and facilities back in their electorates and want to take the credit for it. We have seen their websites and their newsletters.


This appropriation bill is in the spirit of this Labor government. It wants to make a difference in the lives of people through the length and breadth of this country. I commend the legislation to the House.

"Billson, Bruce, MP",LP,2012-02-15,"



Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley) (12:40):  My contribution today is about Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2011-2012 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2011-2012. They represent an implementation of the MYEFO—the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook—adjustments that were made in a few short months after the government laid out its 2011-2012 budget. It is interesting that the shelf life of that budget was so short and that we are here discussing substantial variations in the form of these appropriation bills.


I will not itemise all the areas of expenditure, other than to note that some of the leading items include a substantial amount of money related to the carbon tax: funds that are aiming to soften the impact, to ease the burden and to relieve some of the pain that is inherently acknowledged in these budget appropriations. All those adjustments, the soft landing and making sure that the hurt is a little bit less would not be necessary if it were not for the implementation of the carbon tax. That is the one that was promised not to happen. This would not be a discussion that we had to have if the Prime Minister had honoured her undertaking: 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.'


So in these appropriations across a number of portfolios there is a substantial amount of money to deal with transitional assistance for the carbon price and the job support package, recognising the vulnerability, the risk and the harm to important sectors of our economy. There is also some money that is designed to help households to meet the additional costs of the carbon tax, and money for setting up the bureaucratic infrastructure that sits around the measure that the government promised it would not implement but now is.


It is an interesting document in that it says a lot about where the government is, but it also gives us an insight into what is actually going on at the moment. There is quite a remarkable political Ponzi scheme being played out in this nation's parliament. You have heard government members talk about what a fantastic job they do in spending bucketloads of money. No-one is saying that they cannot spend money. I have not heard anybody that I have met suggest that this government cannot spend money. It knows how to spend money like no other government before. It knows how to spray it around and defer the responsibility for financing that spending onto subsequent generations.


In the few short years since the Rudd-Gillard government was elected, the Commonwealth outlays have grown by almost $100 billion. In the last year of the Howard government, if my recollection serves me well, I think the federal budget was about $270 billion. It is now up at $360 billion. That is an incredible uplift in government expenditure. Then the government has the hide to come out and say, 'Oh, but we are not the highest-taxing government,' on a very spurious set of data analysis. What it does not talk about is the deferred tax that is debt. Debt is simply tax deferred for subsequent generations to pay. Again, just as no-one contests the ability of this Labor government to spend money, it is unrivalled in its ability to accumulate debt and to record record deficits.


But the political Ponzi scheme sees the economic harm and the financial responsibility transferred on to subsequent years and to subsequent generations, as if it does not matter. It is an intergenerational theft of their opportunities to choose the priorities and the expenditure profile when it comes time for the subsequent generation to manage and to lead this nation and to shape its economy. In effect, it is actually stealing those opportunities, claiming them today and then being able to come into this chamber, as we have heard Labor members do, spruiking about all the money they have sprayed around everywhere. There is an infinite number of worthwhile things that you can do with other people's money, and the government has proven its capacity to make some inroads into that infinite range of possibilities. But there comes a day when you have to account for it. I have touched on how this political Ponzi scheme is sucking resources out of current and future generations to finance this extraordinary expenditure. Today, we as a nation will borrow another $100 million dollars, and this is at a time when the government boasts about the economy being at trend growth and the terms of trade being as good as they have been for a century and half. Yet we are still proving to be incapable of paying our way.


If, under the Gillard and Rudd administrations, the Commonwealth of Australia were a corporation, Gillard and Rudd would have lots of 'please explain's from the economic regulators in Australia. They would have lots of calls from ASIC to explain how their accounting tricks could be justified against the prudent and good practice that the corporate world needs to meet, but because they are the government they are not held to that same level of account. If the Stock Exchange were a corporate entity, it would be wondering how some of the assertions that have been put out into the marketplace could be made at all, given there is no evidence to substantiate those claims. We see this in the way that the government, after having accumulated extraordinary deficits, has almost overnight contrived a surplus for political advantage. It has been engineered for one budget, one year. Expenditure has been pulled forward into this financial year and then pushed back outside the target year to create a wafer-thin surplus for 2012-13. So we see how in this budget and in these appropriation bills the already enormous deficit which was going to be inflicted on this nation is getting worse. Where expenditure can be pulled forward into this financial year it has been and where other expenditures have been able to be deferred they have been put out past 2012-13. And this is while the government seeks to achieve some kind of political goal that it has set itself in light of the fact that the broader Australian public is quite dubious about this government's economic management, competence and capability.


So these additional expenditures come on the back of quite an extraordinary series of deficits. These are the four biggest deficits in our nation's history. Remember: these deficits have been arrived at—and I am drawing from the Labor government's own rhetoric—at a time when the economy seems to be going well. Any hardship is dismissed as growing pains and the trend growth that we are on now should enable us to pay our way, but we are failing miserably as a nation to fund our expenditures. The four biggest deficits in Australian history have a cumulative total of $167 billion, and that is supposed to be praiseworthy in the eyes of the Labor government and its members.


If the Prime Minister were the chief executive officer of a corporation and she received a bonus—whether it be a substantial payment or some political kudos—derived from a contrived financial outcome, everyone would look quite curiously at that. In fact, if the government were in the corporate world, the corporate world would be highly critical that high-flying executives were manipulating the fortunes of its company and massaging its finances to create some arithmetic outcome for which they would hope to be rewarded. If that happened in the corporate world there would be outrage.


When this government was going through its post-neoliberalism, former Prime Minister Rudd was trying to say that all things that had helped make this country great and grow our economy were all of sudden quite evil and that we needed a bigger government in every boardroom, in every economic decision and in every household of the country. One of the things he said at that time was that corporate executives were running companies to try to achieve certain financial KPIs so that they would be highly rewarded. Isn't it odd that here we are some years down the track—we no longer have Prime Minister Rudd; we have Prime Minister Gillard—and Prime Minister Gillard is presiding over a Commonwealth corporation, the Commonwealth of Australia, and is doing the very things that former Prime Minister Rudd was so highly critical of when he was Prime Minister. We have a contrived financial picture. We have a completely incredible set of assertions sitting behind one year's financial outcome where the CEO—in this case, the Prime Minister—wants to be lauded and praised for this contrived one-year financial outcome. I am not certain it will even happen, despite all the fiscal gymnastics, transactional shuffling and political Ponzi arrangements that the government is overseeing. We are still yet to see whether there will be a surplus as the Prime Minister and Treasurer have promised on the back of, dare I say, some very poor form. If past performance is a guide to future performance then it is very hard to believe the government will actually create a surplus, even as it creates this cynical fiscal strategy to contrive a budget outcome for 2012-13. There has been no discussion about how it will unwind these Ponzi arrangements that impose cost vulnerability on subsequent generations just so the government can try to look good in the short term.


The shadow finance minister has quite rightly touched on one of the glaring problems with the budget strategy that the government is proposing—and that is the imposition of a carbon tax. It is a particular gift to impose a new tax and have a net detrimental impact on the budget position, but that is what the government has done as it tries to massage the introduction of this tax. This tax is not only causing direct costs, which are canvassed in these bills; it is also causing enormous concern in the business community. You wonder where this trend of growth that the government relies upon to have some kind of credibility, albeit fairly spurious, with these numbers will end up after the carbon tax is introduced.


I sought to ask the Prime Minister about the concerns that are widely held in the business community, particularly in the small business community, about the impact of the carbon tax. She dismissed that concern and that question. She dismissed the anxiety and the fear that is out there amongst the business community, where they know that this is going to be detrimental to their interests, to the interests of employees and to the prosperity they bring to their communities. She tried to suggest that it was somehow a contrivance of the opposition, which I found quite remarkable. In survey after survey the message is consistent. In your great state of Queensland, Mr Deputy Speaker, just a couple of days ago the Chamber of Commerce and Industry released its report. Almost without exception across every region in Queensland the carbon tax was either No. 1 or No. 2 on the list of big concerns. Regionally, it was a concern. The carbon tax was only ever displaced by concerns about energy costs, which of course will go up with the carbon tax. So those interwoven concerns are the pinnacle of the anxieties, uncertainties and lack of confidence in the business community, and yet the government tries to talk it away as if it does not matter. If you look across the survey results, it does not even matter what size the business is: carbon tax concerns or concerns about the cost of energy are still at the pinnacle of concerns. Yet the government tries to swat this away as if it does not matter.


I am genuinely concerned because I look into the eyes of people in small business and family enterprises who are contending with a very difficult economic climate, despite the boast to the contrary of the government. I feel their concerns because I am there with them as they express very sincerely their anxieties about the future. They know cost-of-living pressures mean that consumers are not interested in price increases. They see that their input costs, not only their direct energy costs but all of the other input costs in their business, that have carbon costs embedded in them will be pushing up the cost of doing business. But there is no customer appetite to see those costs passed on. Whenever these issues get raised, Minister Combet, such as in his Press Club speech, swats them away with arrogant indifference—'You cannot get your car serviced in India, and you cannot get your dry-cleaning done in China.' That is of no comfort whatsoever to the small business community. In the communities that I represent, the mechanics are saying that people are not getting their regular scheduled service; they are only coming in when there is a need for a repair. The drycleaners are saying that people are less inclined to make use of their services. They have less frequent dry-cleaning of the articles that require it, and consumers are looking at other options for how to keep their clothing clean, such as washing by hand and the like.


This carbon tax hangs as a dagger over the small business community and it is eating away at the credibility of the budget and the economic scenario in this country. That is why these measures and the carbon tax should be deferred until the Australian public have a chance to cast their vote on just how well things are going for our nation.

"Keenan, Michael, MP",LP,2012-02-15,"



Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling) (16:00):  I am pleased to rise to speak on the Access to Justice (Federal Jurisdiction) Amendment Bill 2011. This bill seeks to amend the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975, the Family Law Act 1975, the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976, the Federal Magistrates Act 1999 and the Judiciary Act 1903 to implement the provisions of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General model bills relating to procedural and jurisdictional matters relating to the Federal Court and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.


I wish to note at the outset that the coalition broadly supports this bill as we recognise that affordable access to our courts is an essential component of the enjoyment of our individual rights and liberties. The coalition has a proud record in this regard. The establishment of the Federal Magistrates Court by the Howard government was the most important step forward in recent years, providing a forum for the low-cost, uncomplicated and efficient determination of disputes by a chapter 3 court.


We recognise that the final determination of disputes, especially in the courts but also in the various Commonwealth tribunals, necessarily entails steps that incur costs and delays—necessarily because the proper administration of justice requires the parties to disclose all information and material relevant to their dispute. Their processes can be abused by parties who seek to intimidate, delay and financially outshoot less well resourced litigants. Therefore, court and tribunal rules must ensure that judges and arbitrators have the authority and flexibility to detect and prevent abuses. The court and tribunal rules already provide this authority and flexibility, and the measures proposed by this bill provide incremental assistance to ensure that the administration of justice is not sidelined by process questions.


I will now briefly touch on the provisions contained in this bill. As has been noted in the bill's explanatory memorandum, the amendments proposed aim to provide the function and efficiency of the discovery rules in civil proceedings, specifically to provide more flexibility in costs orders and to allow pre-trial oral examination. The bill also aims to implement the SCAG model bill on suppression and non-publication orders and to implement the SCAG model bill concerning vexatious proceedings. It will align the jurisdictional limit of Family Court matters in Western Australia with the Federal Magistrates Court, and it will provide more flexibility to the AAT when dealing with the payment of fees.


One of the more notable issues in this bill is suppression and non-publication orders, which vary considerably across Australian jurisdictions. Stakeholders have suggested some minor amendments to the suppression order regime and to the explanatory memorandum in relation to the Western Australian Family Court.


The coalition supports measures to improve access to justice. However, we preserve the right to move amendments to this bill in the Senate pending the committee's recommendations. I note that this bill has been referred to the relevant committee. So, on the face of it, this bill does not present any problems. I think it is always wise within this parliament to give new legislation as wide an airing as possible so that people can look at it, examine it and make sure that the legislation itself is as flawless as possible. With that reservation in mind, the coalition does broadly support this bill and I therefore commend it to the House.

Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (16:04):  I rise to speak in support of the Access to Justice (Federal Jurisdiction) Amendment Bill 2011. After practising in the area of family law for more than 20 years before I came to this place, I have to say that I do not share the same faith and belief as the member for Stirling that the Federal Magistrates Court is a great step forward. The problem is that the Howard government, which he lauded in relation to its so-called proud history of legislative reform to improve access to justice, actually messed up the jurisdiction of the Federal Magistrates Court. We saw it having to be broadened and we saw more and more resources having to be applied to that court. This has resulted in concurrent jurisdiction in many respects between the Family Court and the Federal Magistrates Court. We have seen variability in terms of the appointments until recently, when we have seen better federal magistrates appointed, and we have seen problems of imperialism and administrative difficulties in the court registries between the Family Court and the Federal Magistrates Court. This is an area in need of legislative reform and I do not accept the belief of the member for Stirling. He lauded the Howard government as a great champion of the rights of people to access justice. That simply is not the case when you look at how it messed up the Federal Magistrates Court.


This bill amends by way of schedule a number of areas. In schedule 1 we are dealing with strengthening the power of the Federal Magistrates Court to deal with discovery. It provides additional direction for the Federal Court to have the power to make orders with respect to discovery and specifies the maximum cost that may be recovered for giving discovery or taking inspection. The process of discovery in any litigation, particularly matters dealt with by the Federal Court, can be expensive. This empowers the Federal Court judges to actually take control of the whole process of discovery, and I think that is a good and beneficial reform.


The second schedule deals with suppression and non-publication orders. These are very difficult issues for federal courts to deal with. I know that the Law Council of Australia has expressed some concern about this. There are grounds for making an order set out in section 102PF. I think they are right. I think the reform is good. I do think that having information in the public domain is a good thing, but there are times when suppression orders or non-publication orders have to be made, particularly when it is necessary to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice, to protect the safety of a person and to avoid causing undue distress or embarrassment to a party or a witness in criminal proceedings involving an offence of a sexual nature. It is only right, particularly in relation to children, that that is the case. There are good grounds for that and I support that schedule; I think it is important.


Vexatious litigants take up an enormous amount of time in court proceedings and schedule 3 deals with that. The new section 102QC allows a person to request a certificate stating that they are the subject of vexatious proceedings orders. In my practice as a lawyer I have dealt with vexatious litigants. It is extremely difficult to deal with them. Often they are quite unreasonable. I accept the reforms here.


Schedule 4 will remove the $5 million monetary limit on family property jurisdiction exercisable by family law magistrates in the Magistrates Court of Western Australia under section 46 of the Family Law Act 1975. I do think it is high time that the Western Australia government referred all of its powers over to the Commonwealth government so we have one system of family law in this country and Western Australians are not treated differently. There are always problems in that regard and I think it is high time that the dingo fence that stops at the Nullarbor Plain be expunged. I cannot see why residents of Western Australia should be treated any differently to residents of Queensland.


Schedule 5 deals with Administrative Appeals Tribunal fees. I note there was some concern expressed about changes in relation to fee structures for the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, which replaced the AAT's power to waive an application fee and replace it with a flat fee of $100. Here, we are allowing provision to be made for the introduction of a reduced application fee which imposes additional burdens on disadvantaged people and we are allowing the AAT to defer payment of the reduced fee to a later date. I note that the Law Society of Australia is comfortable with this particular change as it would relieve the hardship faced by applicants unable to pay the reduced fee.


I think there are some good and worthy reforms here. This is consistent with a government that is very committed to making sure people have access to justice. I think the coalition does not quite have the record the member for Stirling said it does with respect to reform, particularly in the area of the Federal Magistrates Court.

Mrs GRIGGS
 (Solomon) (16:10):  I rise to speak on the Access to Justice (Federal Jurisdiction) Amendment Bill 2011. This is a bill to introduce amendments which have been generated by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. The provisions prepared by this committee relate to a model bill for procedural and jurisdictional matters relevant to the Federal Court and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The amendments are directed at changes in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1995, the Family Law Act 1975, the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976, the Federal Magistrates Act 1999 and the Judiciary Act 1993.


The amendments proposed by the bill aim to improve the functioning and efficiency of the discovery rules in civil proceedings specifically to provide more flexibility in costs orders and to allow pre-trial oral examination. They are also to implement the standing committee's model bill based on suppression and non-publication orders and to implement the standing committee's model bill concerning vexatious proceedings to align the jurisdictional limit of family law magistrates in WA with the Federal Magistrates Court and to provide more flexibility to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal when dealing with payment of fees.


The coalition supports measures to improve access to justice. As the member for Stirling said, the Howard government established the Federal Magistrates Court with the express desire to provide a low-cost forum for the uncomplicated and efficient determination of disputes. Any court proceedings, however, generate costs and delays. In the pursuit of justice, consistency of decisions and open justice, we recognise that the administration of justice includes a requirement for parties to disclose relevant information and materials, which often leads to costs and delays.


It is unfortunate that these processes can be abused by parties with a mind to intimidate, delay and financially out-shoot less well resourced litigants. Acceptance of this point therefore requires the court and tribunal rules to enable judges and arbiters the flexibility to detect, and the authority to prevent, such abuses. While existing rules provide some existing measures, this bill provides incremental assistance in terms of administration of justice to prevent the sidelining of matters by questions of process. The bill seeks to address some of the variance across Australian jurisdictions relevant to suppression and non-publication of orders. It has been suggested by stakeholders consulted in the preparation of this bill that some minor amendments to the suppression order regime and the explanatory memorandum in respect of WA family magistrates are necessary.


As I have said, the coalition supports the measures to improve the process of justice and rules designed to further progress open justice, including measures to improve access to justice with cost-efficiency. While we broadly support the measures introduced by this bill, the coalition reserves the right to introduce amendments to the bill in the Senate pending the outcome of the Senate committee's recommendations.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I call the Attorney-General for her summing up. In doing so, I would like to congratulate her on her promotion to that position.

Ms ROXON
 (Gellibrand—Attorney-General) (16:14):  Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker Livermore. Last time I spoke here, in some excitement at my first bill as the Attorney-General, I was welcomed by the chair as the health minister. I think old habits die hard. Thank you for those congratulations.


I would like to thank the honourable members for Stirling, Blair and Solomon who spoke on this bill. I know that for some people this bill seems like it is just a procedural one. It does go to many procedures within our courts, but the reforms will have a noticeable and beneficial effect on the experiences of court users and they are therefore worthy of considered debate. I thank people for contributing in that light.


The Access to Justice (Federal Jurisdiction) Amendment Bill 2011 is an important step in the Labor government's efforts to make our judicial system responsive, accessible and efficient for all people who need its services. The courts must help to protect, and act impartially for, all participants in court processes whether they be one-off users in difficult circumstances, like a couple going through separation proceedings, or large corporate players utilising the courts to resolve commercial disputes. These reforms implement the practical recommendations from expert bodies such as the Australian Law Reform Commission and the Attorney-General's Department's Access to Justice Task Force, as well as bringing into the federal sphere model laws developed through the then Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. They go directly to addressing the points of aggravation experienced by court users and those wishing to report on court proceedings—that is, unnecessarily complex and costly discovery processes, a perceived overuse of suppression and non-publication orders, and unnecessary and wasteful litigation caused by vexatious litigants. By giving the Federal Court greater control over the costs of discovery, and clarifying that oral examinations can be used to assist in identifying which documents should be subject to discovery, we will support judges to manage and progress cases. By implementing the SCAG model suppression and non-publication order laws, we are also playing our part in ensuring nationally consistent rules are in place and in supporting open and transparent justice. I note, however, a matter that we will keep our eye on: the current concerns about the volumes and types of orders being granted. They are primarily at the state level; nevertheless, this does make our system more nationally consistent.


This bill will tighten up the scope of those suppression orders. Courts will have to specifically consider whether the order is really necessary and craft the order in as narrow terms as possible to achieve its objectives. The court must, when making a suppression order, take into account that it is the primary purpose of the administration of justice to safeguard the public interest. Open justice is part of ensuring we can do that. By establishing fair and understandable vexatious litigant rules we are also balancing the need to keep our courts accessible while ensuring valuable court time is not wasted on repetitive, unmeritorious claims at the expense of other users.


By amending the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act to allow applications without up-front payment of filing fees and allow regulations to give the AAT the power to impose fees on government agencies if they unsuccessfully defend appeals, this government is demonstrating its absolute ongoing commitment that individuals should be able to seek review of government action. This bill is all about improving access to justice for all who need it. It contains practical, considered measures initiated and supported by experts in the field of court practice. Extensive consultation with court officers, users and other stakeholders has ensured that these measures will achieve their desired outcomes. I thank the parliament for its support.

Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling) (16:00):  I am pleased to rise to speak on the Access to Justice (Federal Jurisdiction) Amendment Bill 2011. This bill seeks to amend the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975, the Family Law Act 1975, the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976, the Federal Magistrates Act 1999 and the Judiciary Act 1903 to implement the provisions of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General model bills relating to procedural and jurisdictional matters relating to the Federal Court and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.
