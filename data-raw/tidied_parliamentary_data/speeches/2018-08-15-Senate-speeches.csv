Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (09:31):  I seek leave to move a motion relating to the dismantling of the White Australia Policy.



The PRESIDENT:  Is leave granted?




Senator Hinch:
  Mr President, a point of order: I understand what Senator Wong is going to do. I seek leave to make a very brief personal statement before she does that—I support what she's doing.



The PRESIDENT:  I need to put the question about whether Senator Wong is granted leave to move the motion first. Is leave granted?


Leave granted.




Senator WONG:
  I thank the Senate for the courtesy. I move the following motion:


That the Senate—


(a) acknowledges the historic action of the Holt Government, with bipartisan support from the Australian Labor Party, in initiating the dismantling of the White Australia policy;


(b) recognises that, since 1973, successive Labor and Liberal/National Party governments have, with bipartisan support, pursued a racially non-discriminatory immigration policy to the overwhelming national, and international, benefit of Australia; and


(c) gives its unambiguous and unqualified commitment to the principle that, whatever criteria are applied by Australian governments in exercising their sovereign right to determine the composition of the immigration intake, race, faith or ethnic origin shall never, explicitly or implicitly, be among them.


Yesterday in this chamber we saw a speech that was not worthy of this parliament. We saw a speech that did not reflect the heart of this country. We saw a speech that did not reflect the strong, independent, multicultural, tolerant, accepting nation that we are. We saw a speech that did not reflect a nation which has been built by people from every country, every part of this world—a strong independent multicultural nation. Instead, we saw a speech that sought to divide us. We saw a speech that sought to fan prejudice. We saw a speech that sought to fan racism. I say again—and I know this is a statement that so many in this country support—that a nation that is divided is never safer. A nation that is divided is never stronger. Making others lesser, fanning prejudice and discrimination, has never made a nation safer.


It is so important that we in this chamber express our view, our positive view, about what values matter to us. We have built this country, a country that is the most multicultural nation on the face of the earth, not because we have allowed prejudice to persist, not because we have allowed discrimination to exist, not because we have accepted division but because we have stood against it. We have built this country because we have stood for unity, for a collective, for community and for values of acceptance and respect, values that are intrinsic to who we are. What we must do as a parliament, and that is what this motion does, is assert those values again.


There are many times in this chamber—and we saw them in question time yesterday and no doubt we'll see them again—when we have a bit of a barney, when the partisan system is at its finest or perhaps at its least fine. But the times in our history that have been of most importance on these issues have been when our parties have worked together, when our parties have stood for the values that have built modern Australia, when our parties have stood for the values of acceptance and respect and have stood against discrimination and prejudice. That is the history of Australia, and it is your history as much as it is ours. Today let us demonstrate that again. Let us demonstrate again that bipartisan support for those Australian values of inclusion, acceptance and respect; a belief in equality; the rejection of racism; the rejection of prejudice; and the rejection of division. Let us support tolerance, acceptance, respect and equality. Let us stand for that because that is the best of this country.


I want to say something on a human level. Think of what might be happening in some of the schoolyards in Australia today. Those of us who've been on the receiving end of racism know what it feels like and know that what leaders say matters. To be prejudiced against a group the first thing you have to do is diminish them, to say that they are somehow lesser and not deserving of the empathy that you would want for yourself and your family. That is the worst thing about the speech that we saw last night—because it sought to make one part of Australia less worthy of empathy. That is the first step in prejudice.


So I ask this chamber to support this motion and I ask us to reflect on what is the best of who we are and why it is so important that we do not allow any of our fellow Australians to be as diminished as they were in yesterday's speech and, more importantly, why we must go forward, particularly the parties of government, adhering to the central values that are at the heart of the Australian nation: tolerance, respect, acceptance and equality.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2018-08-15,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister for Finance, Special Minister of State and Vice-President of the Executive Council) (09:37):  The government will be supporting the motion moved by Senator Wong. Australia is a great migrant nation. Australia is a country which has welcomed people from all corners of the world. Australia is a country where, whatever your background, you will have the opportunity to contribute, to reach your full potential and to build a life for yourself and your family. Ours is a nation where all Australians, whatever their background, should be judged by the content of their character and their actions and not by the colour of their skin, their religious faith or any other consideration. It is in that spirit that, on behalf of the government, I'm speaking in support of this motion.


This chamber in many ways is a true reflection of what a great migrant nation we are. We have in this chamber representatives of our Indigenous community. We have in this chamber representatives of Australians whose families have been here for generations. They are the descendants of migrants who came to Australia more than 100 years ago. We have in this chamber first-generation migrants from Kenya, Malaysia, Belgium, Germany and Scotland. What a great country we are where first-generation Australians can join First Australians and those Australians whose families have lived here for more than 100 years and all work together to make our great country an even better country.


I very much support the sentiment in the motion that says that, since the Holt government, with the support of the Labor Party at the time, initiated the dismantling of the White Australia policy, Australia has become a better country. It has served us well as a country domestically and it has served us well as a country internationally. Let's continue to build on what makes us strong. Let's not go back to something that we made the right decision to dismantle some decades ago.

"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2018-08-15,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (09:39):  The Greens will absolutely be supporting this motion. We are a proud nation of immigrants. The things that bring us together are far more important and far more significant than the things that divide us. We should be very proud of the multicultural story here in Australia. Multiculturalism is often framed in language around people from multicultural communities needing to accept Australian values, but there's something much deeper going on. What it means is that people who come here from right around the world actually enrich our values. They make us better. They make us think more deeply about our national character. They help us to reflect on those things which we can learn from those communities that come here, make a contribution and make Australia a better place.


Of course, we know that, despite the fact that multiculturalism is embraced by the wider community, it's something we never have to stop fighting for. If recent events have shown as anything it's that we as a parliament have to redouble our efforts to continue fighting for that great multicultural experiment that began several decades ago and has made us the most successful multicultural nation on earth. That's why that speech yesterday was just so disappointing. It meant that Australia was forced to confront the fact that there are individuals who will seek to exploit questions of race, ethnicity and religion for base political motives. We are very pleased that we are coming in here today and recommitting to the notion of a multicultural Australia. It has never been more important.

"Hinch, Sen Derryn",DHJP,2018-08-15,"



Senator HINCH
 (Victoria) (09:41):  The Justice Party totally supports all the comments by Senator Wong, Senator Cormann and Senator Di Natale. I just want to place on record an action I took last night in this august chamber that I sincerely regret. Out of respect for this establishment I sat through the whole 30-minute diatribe, categorised as a first speech, from Senator Fraser Anning. I did not walk out, as one senator did during my first speech. At the time, I criticised the Greens for ostentatiously walking out on camera during Senator Hanson's first speech. I believe in free speech, especially in these houses of parliament, but there are limits. That is why I voted in favour of the censure motion yesterday of Senate Leyonhjelm, who made disgusting personal comments about Senator Hanson-Young.


I listened to Senator Anning's speech in full. It was one of the most disgraceful, racist, homophobic, divisive, misogynistic, spiteful and hateful speeches I have ever heard anywhere in 50 years in journalism. It was Pauline Hanson on steroids. As I said on the ABC today, I felt like I was trapped at a Ku Klux Klan rally. I want to apologise to the Senate and the Australian people that, after that vomitus poison last night, I then stupidly, recklessly and unthinkingly—no, I did think about it—followed Senate protocol and dutifully lined up here and shook this unworthy man's hand. I want to go on record and say I then went home and I washed my own.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2018-08-15,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (09:43):  As a migrant who came to this country in 1973, I had the opportunity to emigrate from Scotland to a number of countries. I chose Australia because Australia was a multicultural country and Australia was a country that had decent rights for working people and treated people fairly. I took the view that for my family it was better to come to Australia. I have been so fortunate in this country as a migrant. But my fortune has not been matched, certainly in recent times, by new migrants coming to this country who don't have a command of the English language and who come here to make things better for their families. I don't think running an argument about free speech, as in what we saw yesterday, was an appropriate response to what I witnessed in here last night.


I have sat through most of the first speeches since I have been in this place—for nearly 11 years now. Some of them I have completely disagreed with in the context of what has been said, but I have shown the respect that people deserve when they stand up to do their first speech. Yesterday was the first time that I have walked out of a first speech. I walked out on Senator Anning's speech because I thought it was absolutely despicable. I thought it was race baiting. I thought it was the worst racist thing I have witnessed in here. I've witnessed some terrible things in here, with some of the nonsense we hear from One Nation, but this took it to another level. My concern is that, as long as we sit in this place and say nothing about that type of race baiting, then we weaken democracy in this country.


I have taken the view that free speech is important. But I did follow one senator on the doors this morning who was arguing that this was free speech in action. This was not free speech. It was race hate. It was racism of the worst kind. A reporter asked that senator, 'What would you do if that was put against you?' I just don't accept his argument that people would argue back and stand up for themselves. It's okay for a highly educated, Australian-born person with a command of the English language, with all the power and privilege you get from being a senator, to say that you would stand up for yourself. But that's not what most people in this country have. They don't have that education. They don't have that power. They don't have that privilege. To stand up and excuse what Senator Anning did here yesterday as simply being free speech, and to say that someone who is offended by that should stand up for themselves, shows how far backwards we have gone in this country since I took the view that Australia was the best place for me to emigrate to as a skilled tradesperson and to bring my family.


We have gone backwards. We have gone backwards a long way. When Senator Hanson stands up and does her race baiting, we think that's a normal part of debate in this country. It's not a normal part of debate, it's racism. And it's not a normal part of debate in this place when Senator Anning stands up and uses his first speech to divide this community. I don't feel the least bit intimidated by anyone in here. I left school at 15. I'm a working-class guy. I can stand up for myself. I've got a great deal of power. I've got a great deal of privilege by being a senator in this place. But even I, because of my accent, have been told that I've been unintelligible in this place by those opposite. I've been told to 'speak Australian' by those opposite. We must get away from that. We must treat this place with the respect it deserves. We are leaders in this place, and everyone who comes to this country should be judged by the contribution they make—not their race, not their religion. It's about the contribution they make to this country.


Many, many migrants make a contribution—a contribution that is harder for them to make than it is for white, highly educated Australians. They come here with no money, but they come here with lots of hope. I had $80 when I came here, the equivalent of a week's wages. I've come a long way from that. But, for many in this country, they'll be the ones that are cleaning Woolies, they'll be the ones that are pushing the trolleys at Woolies, they'll be the ones that are digging the holes to keep this country going and they will be getting ripped off. And yet we've got a senator that would come in here and denigrate their contribution to this country. I'll tell you: if I were on an operating table and I had a Muslim surgeon fixing my problems, I wouldn't be worrying about what religion they were or where they came from. It's the contribution that people make that is important in this country. I thank Senator Cormann for the contribution he made. He is a first-generation migrant himself. But I would say to Senator Cormann: make sure the rest of your senators, the rest of your MPs, understand how difficult it is for migrants when they come to this country. They are faced with huge challenges, and they don't need Senator Anning or Pauline Hanson trying to rip them down. It's just unacceptable.


We are a better country than this, and we need to stand up for the issues that are important to this country—treating everyone fairly, treating everyone equitably. I support this motion. I support it because it's the right thing to do. If we allow racism to run unchallenged in this place, if we can't deal with it at the apex of our constitutional operation, then what happens out in the streets will become even worse. We all have an obligation to treat people fairly and equitably and to treat them on the basis of their contribution to the country, not where they come from, not what their religion is, not what the colour of their skin is. We need to change that now, and we need to stand up for every Australian, for our fellow Australians, because that's what's important in this place.

Senator STORER
 (South Australia) (09:52):  I would like to formally add my support to this motion. I'm a strong supporter of the bipartisan immigration policies backed by successive parliaments in the years since Liberal Prime Minister Harold Holt, at the head of a government in coalition with the then Country Party, started to end the White Australia policy, not Gough Whitlam, as stated by Senator Anning. I found much of what Senator Anning said yesterday to be incendiary, offensive and factually incorrect. It is Senate practice to shake the hand of senators after they have delivered their first speech. As I see myself as a courteous and polite individual, that is what I did, but I want to make sure that this act was not an endorsement of the contents of Senator Anning's speech, just a common courtesy and in line with Senate protocol. I want to make very clear that I strongly believe that we are a better multicultural country as a result of the ending of the White Australia policy, as noted before. I will always stand up for generous, non-discriminatory immigration policy in Australia. The Senate here today reflects this and indicates strongly the strong contribution that migrants have made to our nation. We should always defend that to the hilt.

Senator STEELE-JOHN

 (
Western Australia
) (
09:54
):  I entered the chamber last night and was immediately assaulted by a phrase which will live in my memory forever: a 'final solution to the immigration problem'. I sat transfixed. My blood ran cold, as hate poured forth into this place and brought it low. I felt myself sullied, and I sit here this morning dismayed. It is right that we now move to condemn Senator Anning for his disgraceful words, but it is also critical that we here recognise and reflect upon the fact that Senator Anning's words were not an aberration but were, in fact, a culmination. They were the final opening of a door that has been gradually prised ajar by every single person in this place who made the decision to play on people's fears for their personal gain. It is an indictment of every single one of us who has given credence to the language of assimilation, who has spoken of the dangers of our cities and our towns being swamped by immigrants and who has given any semblance of credit to the idea that those who come across the sea do so with anything other than the intent to build a life, to love and to experience the freedom that we here have so enjoyed and so prospered under. 


It is our responsibility to show leadership in our roles, to move the debate in this nation to a higher plane, and last night I was reminded not only of this individual's profound failure but of our collective failure and of the urgent need for us to do better in the future. I thank the chamber for its time.

"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2018-08-15,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (09:57):  Let me make it quite clear that I was not in the chamber yesterday for Fraser Anning's maiden speech and also the fact that I did watch it from my office and I was appalled at his comments and his remarks. To actually hear people say now, as Senator Hinch said, that it is like hearing Pauline Hanson on steroids, I take offence to that, because why relate it back to me? I think that's questionable. I have raised issues in this parliament, but I'll get into that. 


Fraser Anning, I can assure you, did not write that speech. But he delivered it and he is responsible for it. The speech was written by Richard Howard, straight from Goebbels's handbook from Nazi Germany. Richard Howard worked for a military propaganda specialist. He was one of the staffers—Richard Howard actually did work in Senator Malcolm Roberts's office and was sacked out of that office. He did ask me for a position in my office, after Senator Roberts lost his position in this parliament, and I refused to take him on. He got a job with Senator Anning when he was elected to the parliament under the banner of Pauline Hanson's One Nation, yes, but at no time has he ever held a seat in this parliament under Pauline Hanson's One Nation. From day one when he was sworn in, he was an Independent. Richard was one of the staffers that I warned Fraser Anning not to take on; he disregarded my warning and took him on. So that was his decision. 


As I said, I'm appalled by Fraser Anning's speech. I have always spoken up on issues with regard to our country and I will stand by those views that I have. We are a multiracial society, and I've always advocated you do not have to be white to be Australian. We have called for people coming here to give their loyalty, their undivided loyalty, to this country, that you be Australian and proud of this country and abide by the laws. I suggest that you actually go and have a look at the immigration policy of One Nation and read it thoroughly.


Might I also bring to your attention that our candidates standing under One Nation come from all different ethnic backgrounds. Our member for Mirani, Stephen Andrew, is the first South Sea Islander to hold a position in parliament as an MP in Queensland, or, as a matter of fact, in Australia. So I think you need to direct your criticisms elsewhere.


You say that you sat here through the speech and you are now appalled at the fact that you actually went up and shook Fraser Anning's hand—especially in light of the speech. You sat here and you listened to it. Well, how gutless are members in this parliament? If you were so appalled then you should have got up and walked out of the place. And the thing is: now that it has turned and the public are having a say about this, you're here on the floor of parliament—well, congratulations!


I do support the censure. The words said should not have been said, because it is not what we want in this country, and I don't agree with them either.


When Senator Cameron makes comments about my racist comments in this parliament, what are the racist comments? There were no racist comments. Criticism is not racism. To make comments about our immigration—that we have a right to a say on where our country's headed and the numbers that we have in Australia—is very important to our future and the wellbeing of this country. And I will continue to stand by it.


So what I would say to the people of this parliament is: while you may have your grievances on what Fraser Anning has said, don't direct them at me because it's got nothing to do with me. Go and talk to Bob Katter. Last I knew, Fraser Anning had joined the Katter party. I haven't heard one of you mention Katter's party. I would like to ask the Labor Party: do you intend to put Bob Katter's party last on your how-to-vote cards now?



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Hanson, please refer to Mr Katter by his title.




Senator HANSON:
  Sorry, President.



The PRESIDENT:  He is 'Mr Katter' or 'the member for Kennedy'.




Senator HANSON:
  Sorry—Mr Katter. So you want to go and ask: where are you going to put your preferences now? Is the Labor Party going to put the Katter party last on their how-to-vote cards? This is going to be quite interesting, to see how they're going to put out their how-to-vote cards. Let's just see.


As I said to you, I have always advocated for equality, right across the board, for everyone in this country. I have my views about different things, and I've made them quite clear on the floor of parliament. A lot of Australians support my views. But I do believe that Fraser Anning, Senator Anning, went too far in his speech yesterday, and it's unacceptable. It is not One Nation policy. We do not stand by this. I do not stand by it. I was the one who was not in the chamber. I was the one who never shook his hand. And I support the censure motion.

Think of the Italian community along the Murray, and its involvement in horticulture and wine making; there are the Yazidis, the Sikhs, the Karen in Nhill—I could go on and on, on the strong contribution that a diverse immigrant population has made by coming here, coming to the regions and working incredibly hard, shoulder to shoulder with our communities in regional Australia, to build a strong, diverse and open community.


I think it's a great privilege to be here today to see Senator Wong and Senator Cormann, both from migrant backgrounds, together, standing as one and championing not just what is great about our nation, at this point in our history, but also what is great about this place. This is the Senate working at its best and it is senators working at their best in the contributions they've made today, and I really look forward to voting for the motion.

Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (10:05):  I want to acknowledge that we're here today on the lands of the Ngunnawal and Ngambri people and that sovereignty was never ceded and that all of us, other than the First Australians, are migrants to this country. 


Over the 200 years of settlement of this country there's been a lot of hatred, there's been a lot of prejudice, there's been a lot of hurt and there's been a lot of harm. But we have been building a country, we have been striving for a country, that acknowledges and celebrates people regardless of who they are, regardless of their background. It celebrates people for what they contribute. It celebrates our common humanity. We have been building that country. 


I grew up in Altona, a highly multicultural suburb with many postwar migrants from all over the world. I live in Footscray, where almost half the population were born outside Australia or have parents born outside Australia. It is a country, a suburb and a community that is thriving. We have been building this sense of 'We are all together as Australians.' We are all together as citizens of the world but we are all together as Australians building a peaceful, harmonious society. That's what we have been working towards. We have been striving towards that. 


In supporting this motion today, I want us to recognise how precious that is, this striving towards a country that does recognise and celebrate people—regardless of their background, their race, their religion, their sex, their sexuality or their abilities—that does recognise we are all humans, that we can all contribute and that we are all working together to be furthering a better, more tolerant and more celebratory society for all of us. That's what we've been striving for. But I also want to acknowledge that over the last decade, and certainly in the four years that I have been in this Senate, we have been moving away from that. 


Up until about a decade ago, there was the sense that we were still making progress, that we were still making progress towards a more equal society, where everybody is celebrated regardless of their background. But over the last decade we have been moving away from that. There has been this rising racism in our society, this rising intolerance of people and division and hatred because of the differences between people. So I am hoping that debating this motion today, and the reaction to the awful hatred in Senator Anning's speech last night, can be a pivotal moment for us to recognise that we have something precious here in Australia—our multicultural society—to show that we can exist harmoniously. But we've got to work at it and we've got to totally reject the hateful racism that was on show last night and is on the rise in our society today. 


We have got to work together. We have got to redouble our efforts to work together to overcome that racism so that we can continue to strive for the society that we know is what we really want to have: a society that really, truly, respects everybody, regardless of their background.

Senator GICHUHI
 (South Australia) (10:08):  Today—and, precisely, last night—is a very sad day for me. For me, I'm evidence that this is multiculturalism at work. But I keep wondering: how on earth do we have a public leader, with the status of senator, in Australia, in the First World not the Third World, use those kinds of words in a public forum? What do we think is happening in kindy, in primary schools and at work today? And yet we are the house that makes the law.


I have been in this country for nearly 20 years—20 years in February. I've gone through a lot of questions like, 'Where do you come from originally?' and that's okay. I take it. But it is in this Senate that my appearance provoked 'Where do you come from?' We all went through the citizenship issues, culminating with 15 or however many of us in the elections that we finished last weekend, so at what point are we going to say: 'You are Australian. You are Australian, full stop, period, finished.' I don't have to be born here; all I have to do is hold that citizenship certificate. Mine has been questioned so many times. I happen to be Briton. I happen to be Kenyan. I happen to be Australian. That's my history and, because Australia is Australia, because of the multicultural system it is, I find myself in the Senate.


Nobody put me here in the Senate except the High Court. Why? Because Australian systems work and they support multiculturalism. What I'm asking the Senate, whether I'm here for a day, two days or longer, is to deal with this hard right, hard left. What do you mean by hard right, hard left? I heard those words in this place. I grew up in a civilised society. Call it that or Third World, but it was civil enough to prepare me enough to serve Australia in this Senate.


I appeal to all our leaders—by all our leaders I mean Liberal, Labor, and everything. In that bipartisan state of affairs, can we deal with our own prejudices? I don't have to be asked where I came from. I know we are first generation or third generation. And guess what. We still have issues to deal with First Australian generations. Something has to rise up and do this and deal with it. We are the leaders. Senator Anning is a leader. What happened to diversity training? What am I going to say to my daughter, trying to apply for a job, coming to me to saying, 'Mum, I don't think I can get this.' I'm tired of that. It's not going to work for Australia 2018. Take it or leave it. It doesn't matter who gets into power next; somebody has to deal with it. I'm Liberal Party by choice. I'm here and I have to tiptoe about being a woman, about being black, because the hard right doesn't like it. Hey; this is Australia. This is the First World. It's not the Third World. Can we do leadership for the First World? Thank you.

Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (10:12):  This morning I joined hundreds of Canberrans as we braved the cold in Canberra at the Indian High Commission to recognise today as India's Independence Day. They were Canberrans of Indian origin and they have made Australia their home. As I stood there with them, I was thinking of what was going through their minds as they opened the papers, as they reflected on the speech that was given in this place last night. What did it mean for them, as new Australians now building their lives here, raising their children here, sending their children to school, ensuring they have decent education, a career for themselves, an income for themselves to build their lives here but at the same time recognising where they came from? That small group of, say, 100 people this morning here in Canberra is a small sample of the some 700,000 Australians, people of Indian origin in this country who have chosen to make Australia their home and build the multicultural fabric that we know is the great country that we are, the country of the fair go. But I know that it would hurt them very much to hear the words that Senator Anning shared in this place last night.


I say, on behalf of all of those who have spoken today and are supporting the motion, that Senator Anning does not speak for us, that we stand with them. We stand with all people of various backgrounds that make Australia such a great country. We are an inclusive country.


When I was born in this place, in 1972, it was the end, thank God, of the White Australia policy. Some 46 years later, I am happy to say that this is a very successful multicultural nation, where we do welcome people from various backgrounds. No matter what your background, your race, your ethnicity, your religion, you can indeed be just as successful as the next person. You can have very much as decent and fulfilling a life as the next person. That is because of the policies that have passed this parliament—the multicultural policies, the policies of inclusiveness and the policies that deal with racial discrimination.


Unfortunately, though, there is someone in this place who is giving licence to hate speech, and we must call it out. That is what this is about today. It is about calling it out, ending it, putting a stop to this awful, divisive, hateful type of language that one would have thought went out of this nation 50 or more years ago. On this very sober morning in our Senate, after the incredible contributions that have shown how bipartisan we can become when we talk about our Australian identity, inclusiveness and the importance of what it is that makes Australia so successful—our multiculturalism—let's hope that this is the end of that sort of language. Let us hope that, through our actions in coming together in this place today, we ensure that we simply do not hear again the type of language that we heard last night from Senator Anning, because we simply do not tolerate it.

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2018-08-15,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (10:17):  I just want to add my support to this motion. The contributions from across the chamber today have been incredibly sobering but also incredibly heartening, because a line must be drawn. Enough is enough in relation to the hate speech, as Senator Singh has called it out and named it. Enough is enough when it comes to the race baiting that has been called out. It is time for us in this place, as leaders in our communities, to call it out, stand up and say: the line must be drawn.


We will all have debates about what are the best policies to support a multicultural nation, to protect and embrace the fabulous community we have. They are debates that are not going to go away. We cannot be complacent when it comes to multiculturalism and protecting tolerance, understanding and acceptance in our community. We must always fight against racism and bigotry. The job is never going to be done, but it will never be done if we sit back and say that it's too hard to name it and call it out. So I think it's incredibly sobering today to see so many people from across the chamber standing up and speaking out, including those members of this place who feel it very deeply, who've experienced racism firsthand in this place and outside this place.


My daughter goes to a small primary school in Adelaide. It's a new arrivals school. New migrant children, when they come to Australia, spend the first six to 12 months at this school. When I go into the playground in the afternoons, when the school bell rings, to pick her up, it's a fabulous demonstration of multicultural Australia. There are kids from all parts of the world, and children are so good at tolerance and respect. I have great faith that this country is in very good hands with the next generation. Children, when it comes to understanding, embracing difference and having compassion and tolerance, are often much better than adults. We have a responsibility in this place as political leaders to match that—to promote and protect what a fabulous multicultural society we are, and to condemn and call out racism and hatred whether we see it on the streets, in our media or in our chambers of parliament. If our children can be tolerant, understanding and blind to difference, then we too must match that.


Often when we're in this place, there are children from various schools around the country sitting up here and watching. I hope any of the kids who were here yesterday watching Senator Anning's speech walked away knowing that it was wrong. We must set a better standard. When a member of this chamber or the other place denigrates an entire group in our community—our history, our values as a nation—they must be called out and they must be condemned. I support this motion, and I also support us strongly condemning Senator Anning for his words. I don't believe he deserves to be in this place.

Senator DODSON
 (Western Australia) (10:21):  I wasn't intending to say anything, and I won't say anything that will be better than what my leader has said on this side of the house, but I am impressed by the fact that Australians can come together when we see things not up to the standard that we expect and that we try to inculcate into our society, and we ask others who carry the banners forward on our sporting fields and other places to stand up against ignorance, racism, bias and bigotry. It's a gratifying moment to see the parliament, and particularly this chamber, come as one, as it were. My recollection of this was previously when Senator Brandis was in here and spoke very strongly against an action taken by one of the senators.


We are a democracy. It is important that people say what they want to say in this place. But they've got to have responsibility. They are leaders; we are leaders. What we say is critical. It can hurt other people or influence the behaviour of others towards others. Our focus should definitely be on the respect for diversity and difference, and we should work to reconcile our differences with the First Nations. I believe that will help us as a nation go forward. It will resolve some of the residual remnants of racism and bigotry and hatred and misperception.


As you all know, I co-chair a joint select committee that is trying to find a way through that challenge. I would hope that our parliament, in fact, rises to the same tenor and calibre that we are exhibiting today when we come to those debates. Let's put ourselves beyond fundamental prejudices, and send a message to the world that we are a mature, modern democracy, capable of diversity and difference, welcoming diversity and difference, and using that to build our futures.


Let's not think of us not having achieved. We have achieved a great deal in this country—a great deal. We have yet more to achieve, and we will build on that achievement by reconciling with the First Nations. I support the motion and I congratulate those who have spoken before me.

While this chamber and people in this parliament are calling out the speech by Senator Anning yesterday, I want to make the point that there's one person especially in this parliament who needs to call this out, and that is Bob Katter. Bob, expel Senator Anning from your party. That would be a message that all Australia wants to see.



The PRESIDENT:  Please address a member of the chamber appropriately.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  Mr Katter, expel Senator Anning from your party. If you want to send the strongest possible message that racism and divisiveness won't be tolerated in this national parliament and you don't support his sentiments, you need to do that now. You need to do that today. It might surprise some people that I have actually worked very closely with Bob Katter in recent years around trying to get a banks' royal commission, on marine plastics and on issues that I care about—and we violently disagree on many other things. I was quite shocked yesterday that someone like Mr Katter would associate himself and his party and his family's reputation—whatever it may be—with the likes of Senator Anning. That's all I have to say.

I thank senators for and acknowledge and reflect to all Australians the overwhelming support across the chamber for this motion.


We have no intention of making Senator Anning a victim. We have the absolute intention of both condemning his remarks and taking on his arguments because they are wrong. Today, the Senate has shown that the best way to deal with division is to come together; that best way to deal with prejudice is to assert acceptance and tolerance; and the best way to deal with people going low is to go high. And, today, I think this is a chamber in the parliament of which Australians can be proud.

 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (10:27):  I seek leave to move a motion proposing the censure of Senator Anning.


Leave not granted.




Senator DI NATALE:
  Pursuant to contingent notice, I move:


That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Australian Greens moving a motion to provide for the consideration of a matter, namely a motion to give precedence to a motion of censure of Senator Anning.


Senator Anning's racist hate speech has no place in a decent society, let alone in the Australian parliament. These are comments that not only offend Jewish people, Muslims and immigrants but also attack the very essence of who we are. Just look at the language which was used here. Senator Anning chose to attack Muslim immigrants, using the language that the Nazis used to justify the extermination of Jews in Europe. That was unthinkable only a few short years ago, and yet here we are in the nation's parliament with those deeply offensive anti-Semitic views expressed and with the support of members of the crossbench. If it's hate speech outside the parliament, it's hate speech inside the parliament.


Mr President, I just want you to put yourself in the shoes of a young Muslim woman on her way to work this morning, being told that as a Muslim Australian she is not welcome here. Put yourself in the shoes of a holocaust survivor, where the actions of the Nazis were used to justify an attack on Australian immigration. Put yourself in the shoes of anyone who has directly experienced racism. I take this really personally. As a 12-year-old kid, when a schoolmate comes up to you and spits at you and calls you a wog and tells you to go back to where you come from, that's a memory that is burnt into your consciousness and never leaves you. We, as a party, are about to welcome a Muslim woman to this chamber. When we meet again, we will be welcoming Mehreen Faruqi, a proud Muslim Australian who has made an enormous contribution to this country, and yet she'll be entering into an environment where a member of this place has expressed those hateful views.


We're at a dangerous place in Australian history right now. We agree absolutely with the sentiments of the Race Discrimination Commissioner. Race politics is on the rise and it's being exploited for base political gain. Race baiting is alive and well right now in the Australian parliament. Let's ask ourselves some hard questions about why it's happening. When a nationally syndicated television outlet gives a platform to neo-Nazis, it makes it easier for the speech we heard yesterday. When the Prime Minister of this country starts flaming tensions around so-called African gangs, he makes it easier for the speech we heard yesterday. When the immigration minister says that refugees are dole bludgers or that Lebanese Muslims shouldn't have been settled here in Australia, he makes it easier for the speech that we heard yesterday. He gives it permission.


The question for us is: what are we going to do about it? We heard some heartfelt speeches about why those comments have no place in a decent society. We heard broad condemnation about those comments—about the race hate, as it was named by many speakers—from Senator Anning. The Greens will be moving for a code of conduct. We think it is long overdue that, in this chamber, we set a standard for what we believe is acceptable when it comes to racism, sexism and other discriminatory behaviour. We've seen too much of it over recent days and weeks. It's about time we came together and worked as a Senate to codify a set of behaviours that we think are acceptable and a set of unacceptable behaviours that deserve some sort of sanction. That is why we believe that it is absolutely critical that we now come together as a parliament and censure the speech that was made yesterday and censure Senator Anning for that behaviour.


We are at a very critical point in our history. We saw the power of people coming together and condemning the views that we heard yesterday. But speeches and hand-wringing are not enough; we need to do more. I call on all members of this place to make it very clear that the speech that we heard yesterday is condemned in the strongest possible terms. While we don't do this lightly, we believe a censure motion is the most appropriate tool for us to do that. We call on the Labor Party, the Liberal Party, the National Party and the crossbench to support it.

There are times and days in this place when we must put the positive ahead of the negative and when we must speak clearly as one, and that is precisely what this chamber just did. It is with some disappointment that, having made such an unqualified and unambiguous statement of support that was unanimously carried without a single dissenting voice in this chamber, we now find ourselves moving from such a positive declaration of the principles that have built the successful country that Australia is straight back to the negative.


I condemn the speech that was given by Senator Anning yesterday. I condemn the hate that was within aspects of that speech. I condemn the language that was used within that speech. I know that it is hurtful to Australians.


But what is most important to Australians is to know what this Senate just did. What this Senate just did was to speak very clearly for the respect and regard that we should all have for each and every Australian whatever their background. It said that in this place—from Senator Dodson and Senator McCarthy, who are First Australians, through to Senator Gichuhi, one of our most recent Australians—we respect the contribution of all. We acknowledge that, throughout Australian society, that diversity of Australians has built a country that we should all be incredibly proud of.


We should be proud of the fact that we continue to run an immigration program and policy that continue to welcome people from all corners of the globe. We as a country should be proud of the fact that the major parties and indeed all of the minor parties, it seems, bar one, acknowledge the fact that we should continue to have an immigration policy that is non-discriminatory and is based firmly on the principle of merit.

Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  I'm not sure why those in the Greens would say that it's rubbish that we should have and should continue to have an immigration policy that is non-discriminatory, based on the principle of merit and based on the principles of ensuring that we continue to build the successful country that we are.


Senator Wong and others have spoken about their schooling experience. I reflect back on my years at high school, and the high school I attended was very much a melting-pot high school on the northern fringes of Adelaide, with second-generation Italian and Greek migrants and first-generation Vietnamese migrants working hard in the market gardens that exist to the north of Adelaide. They were ensuring that they were building better futures for their children, for their families. Today, those people I went to school with are in a whole range of occupations and professions. They are migrants who came to this country, were welcomed to this country and were given the opportunities of the education available in this country. They secured the opportunities of employment available in this country and are now in third- and fourth- and fifth-generation families that some are supporting—or second and third in the case of others.


I also reflect on the fact that, at the time that I was finishing school, I know that some of the debates at that stage, particularly around Asian migration, were wrongly reflected and played out in this place and elsewhere around the country. But the positive of that was that governments have ensured that they have continued, to this day, to apply non-discriminatory policies and that we now have such very successful, bigger communities from different Asian nations who've helped us to be stronger, 20-plus years later, than we were then. They have helped us to be better connected to our region and to be able to enjoy the opportunities that that stronger connectedness makes.


That's why we so strongly supported the statement of principles that was made, the clear statement that ensures that Australia continues to give unanimous, unqualified, unambiguous commitment to immigration intakes regardless of race, faith or ethnic origin and that we will continue to stand shoulder to shoulder across this parliament in support of those principles.

Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (10:38):  I rise proudly to support this motion. Senator Anning's despicable comments were a new low in what has been a terrible term of this parliament for race-based hate speech. His speech has rightly been condemned across the political spectrum. But anyone following politics closely could hardly be surprised that we have reached this point. Senator Anning's speech last night was the inevitable result of toxic elements in politics and the Australian media that have fed each other in a downward spiral of hatred, xenophobia and pure and blatant racism.


This coalition government has embraced race politics at its core. It continues to push policies that are designed to exclude and ostracise migrants and people of different race and culture from Australian society. You've got a Prime Minister and Minister Tudge who very gently rebuked Senator Anning last night, but those gentle rebukes belie the fact that they have deliberately and systematically embraced the hatred of One Nation's world view and are now pursuing it with great vigour. The truth is that, in 2018, the only way that the Liberal and National parties differ from Senator Anning is in presentation. The pretence that Mr Turnbull and Mr Tudge are critical is an attempt to con Australia, because, remember, they are trying to introduce mandatory dictation tests for Australian citizenship, and they are trying to introduce the White Australia policy version two. Mr Turnbull supported amending section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 to make it easier to be a racist in Australia. And Mr Dutton and many of his colleagues want to give preferential treatment to white South African farmers.


Victorian opposition leader, Matthew Guy, has made the racial vilification of African migrants the cornerstone of his election campaign. He's been aided and abetted by Mr Jason Wood MP, whose Facebook page is chock-a-block full of racist scaremongering about foreign criminals. He chortles in glee about potentially deporting people. In days gone past, Mr Wood would have been kicked out of the Liberal Party, but Mr Turnbull has made him chair of the parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Migration.


We've got the con—the bipartisan pretence—that Australia has a non-discriminatory migration policy. That is untrue. That is categorically untrue, because we have a policy of immigration that does discriminate based on mode of arrival, which has the effect of discriminating on the basis of country of origin, which has the effect of discriminating on the basis of race and culture. There are no white people locked up on Manus Island or Nauru. We have a bipartisan policy of banishing people of different races and cultures who arrive by boat to island prison camps where they are tortured and deprived of basic liberties.


It's not just the Liberal Party and the Labor Party who should be examining their consciences today. Sunrise resurrected the career of now Senator Pauline Hanson and indirectly helped Senator Anning get his Senate seat. It's just days since Sky News hosted a violent neo-Nazi for a friendly chat. It's worth pointing out that that same neo-Nazi was given a friendly platform on Triple J, the ABC and Channel 7 in the past. Racist rantings in News Corp pamphlets are now so common they're too numerous to mention. Yes, we should be angry about Senator Anning's comments. In fact, we should be bloody furious about them, but we certainly should not be surprised.

It's worth pointing out that that same neo-Nazi was given a friendly platform on Triple J, the ABC and Channel 7 in the past. Racist rantings in News Corp pamphlets are now so common they're too numerous to mention. Yes, we should be angry about Senator Anning's comments. In fact, we should be bloody furious about them, but we certainly should not be surprised.

Senator DODSON
 (Western Australia) (10:53):  At present the constitutional framework of Australia divides legislative responsibilities between the states and the Commonwealth. The states are therefore different to territories. The residents of territories are therefore subject to a different legislative process than the residents of states. Under the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, article 24.2 states:


Indigenous individuals have an equal right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. States shall take the necessary steps with a view to achieving progressively the full realization of this right.


We know that Australia's attempt to achieve the realisation of that right, through the Closing The Gap campaign, has been an abysmal failure. First Nations people do not enjoy the same quality of life in this country at every stage of their existence, as shown in the national figures. In the womb, a First Nations child is at higher risk of contracting life-threatening bloodborne diseases. Last year, six First Nations babies died of syphilis. Our children are more likely to be diagnosed with chronic health conditions such as type 2 diabetes. They are at greater risk of contracting meningococcal and rheumatic heart disease. As teenagers, they watch their friends, their cousins and their siblings prematurely end their own lives. These facts are true of the Northern Territory and nationally. In the Kimberley region, where I come from, the suicide rate is the highest in the world.


By what most Australians call middle age, many First Nations people are already living with kidney failure, without sufficient access to dialysis. The burden of disease and disability in First Nations communities is far higher than it is in the general population. First Nations people are more likely to live with a severe or profound disability. They also die younger. On a national basis, First Nations men can expect to live to an average age of 69, while non-First Nations men can expect to live to 80. First Nations women can expect to live to an average age of 73, while non-First Nations women can expect to live to 83.


All governments—state, territory and federal—have failed to enact the necessary action to close the gap. The government is currently undertaking a refresh process, with the Minister for Indigenous Affairs announcing at Garma earlier this month that some two dozen new targets would be added as part of the refresh process. That seems a drastic amount of new targets, and only emphasises how we've failed to address the health issues suffered by First Nations people to date. With so many of our people suffering complex health conditions at an early age, there is a desperate need for culturally appropriate palliative care services in regional and remote areas. A review recently commissioned by the Australian government confirmed that more needs to be done to ensure that First Nations people are receiving palliative care within their communities. Where First Nations people are already overrepresented at every stage of our health system, it is irresponsible to vote in favour of another avenue to death. Paving the way for euthanasia and assisted suicide leaves First Nations people even more vulnerable, when our focus should be on working collectively to create laws that help prolong life and restore their right to enjoy a healthy life.


During the debate on the Voluntary Assisted Dying Bill 2017 in Victoria, former Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating argued:


No matter what justifications are offered for the bill, it constitutes an unacceptable departure in our approach to human existence and the irrevocable sanctity that should govern our understanding of what it means to be human.


…   …   …


It is a mistake for legislators to act on the deeply held emotional concerns of many when that involves crossing a threshold that will affect the entire society in perpetuity.


In Yawuru we have three concepts that guide our experience of life. They shape our ways of knowing and understanding, and are the collective approach to our existence on this earth and, to that extent, any afterlife that may come. They are: mabu ngarrungu(nil), a strong community—the wellbeing of all is paramount; mabu buru, a strong place and a good country—human behaviour and needs must be balanced in their demands and needs of what creation provides; and mabu liyan, a healthy spirit and good feeling. Individual wellbeing and that of our society not only have to be balanced but be at peace with each other within the context of our existence and experience.


This concept of interconnectedness is one that transcends across many First Nations groups. It is grounded in our understanding that human resilience is based on our relationships with each other and our connectedness with the world around us. The quality of life for individuals and for our communities are intertwined, not limited to the wellbeing of an individual. We are fundamentally responsible for honouring our fellow human beings. We are called to carry responsibilities, to exercise duties and to honour those who are in need, who are ill, who are elderly, who are dependent and those of the next generation to value life with love, respect and responsibility. This is true of family members and unknown individuals. Moving away from such principles and values begins to reshape the value of human beings and our civil society, in my view.


We exist not as solitary individuals; we exist within a family, a community, our cultures and ethos, and in the kinship landscape. I'm a great admirer of those who have cared for loved ones and made personal sacrifices to do so. Not everyone is able to do this, I know, and I do not condemn them for the choices that they make. In the broad sense, we are part of a common humanity. If we give one person the right to make that decision—that is, to assist in committing suicide—we as a whole are affected. If we give one family that right, we as a whole are affected. If we give one state or territory that right, we as a country are affected. If we give one nation the right to determine life, our common humanity is affected. I cannot support this legislation.

"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2018-08-15,"



Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania) (11:00):  I rise to make my contribution to the Restoring Territory Rights (Assisted Suicide Legislation) Bill 2015. I acknowledge the contributions made by others in this debate, regardless of their perspective. I understand fully that there are very strongly held views on this matter. I congratulate Senator Dodson on the contribution that he's just made, particularly from the perspective of the First Nations people. It was a quite profound presentation. I think it typifies the issues, particularly for the more disadvantaged in the Australian community. The bill is portrayed simply as returning rights to the territories to enable them to legislate for euthanasia. It's portrayed as being quite simple in that context and therefore, effectively, an issue of territories' rights. But one thing I have learnt in my time in this place is that, when you believe in something, you need to utilise your entire toolkit to ensure, to your best ability, that your beliefs are reflected. The reality is that, in this circumstance, the Commonwealth does retain some oversight with respect to territory law. Therefore, part of the toolkit of this place rests in that context.


I'm not a supporter of assisted dying. I understand that, as I said earlier, there are strongly held views with respect to people who view that as their right, but I can't sanction or support what I see as, effectively, state-sanctioned killing. I don't support the death penalty, so I can't support what's termed assisted suicide or euthanasia legislation. I understand perfectly the difficulties that exist for some people towards their end of life. I think we all understand that, and that's reflected very much in the way that this debate has been conducted. In that sense, I congratulate my colleagues for the sobriety of the debate and also the arguments that they've made in support of their relative perspectives. But, because I don't support assisted dying, assisted suicide, euthanasia, I can't support any legislative measure that might promote that. So I put on the record my opposition to the legislation and say that I will not be supporting this bill.

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2018-08-15,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (11:04):  I also rise to speak on the Restoring Territory Rights (Assisted Suicide Legislation) Bill 2015. I would like to place on the record my appreciation of the contributions that have been made, regardless of the positions that senators have taken on this bill. The intention of the bill before us is to undo the restrictions brought into effect by Mr Kevin Andrews's private member's bill in 1997. These restrictions limited the ability of the territories to decide for themselves how and when terminally ill people should be allowed to die. Such restrictions removed the democratic rights of territorians. I listened carefully to Senator Colbeck's contribution, and I can understand where he's coming from. But I do disagree that we should use the powers that we have as a federal parliament to take away the right of territorians to decide matters that they would normally be able to decide for themselves. The territories should have the same opportunities that the states have in Australia.


For those who don't support assisted dying, I understand that position. It is a difficult issue for many, and unfortunately there are many in this parliament who have had loved ones who have gone through agonisingly painful deaths. I have myself, and there are many others in this parliament who have witnessed their loved ones passing away in those conditions. It's not easy to see your loved ones passing away, especially when they do so in such pain and with a wish to die with dignity and in the manner they wish to. This is denied of many Australians. It is very hard to then come in here and have a position where we will not allow territorians the same right to debate the issue within their communities and in their parliament and to decide to legislate for it or not. But for a federal parliament to come over the top of the rights of that community, to even have that debate—I don't think we should be supporting that.


I had the opportunity to listen to a couple of contributions made last night on this bill. Both Senator Catryna Bilyk and Senator Claire Moore talked about good palliative care, and I absolutely agree with the content of their statements. Senator Bilyk said:


Having good palliative care available is not a reason to deny the option of assisted dying. Similarly, providing patients with the option of assisted dying is not a reason to ignore the need to invest in quality palliative care.


Senator Moore's contribution went to the very heart of investment in palliative care. I think we do have across-the-board support from senators and members in this place for investing in palliative care, but the action isn't there. There is not enough investment in palliative care, and both those contributions articulated the need for this investment.


But, as I was saying, restrictions that were placed on the territorians not only removed the democratic rights of territorians to create their laws for themselves but overturned properly constituted legislation. They also prevent legislators from having that debate, despite such laws—in the case of the Northern Territory—having already been passed.


The people of Australia overwhelmingly support the freedom of terminally ill Australians to decide on this matter. Approximately 75 per cent of Australians polled answered that the terminally ill should be able to legally end their lives with medical assistance. This is a very sensitive subject, and opinions are sincerely and strongly held on this matter. Many feel that Australians deserve the right to choose to die with dignity and that euthanasia is the most effective way of safeguarding this. Others, however, have closely held religious or personal beliefs which mean that they oppose euthanasia. I personally believe that there are, unfortunately, some people living with terminal illness for whom there is no other way to avoid suffering than dying with dignity. That is why voluntary euthanasia laws have been adopted in parts of Europe and the USA and, of course, in the state of Victoria.


Regardless of your position on euthanasia, it is clear that a single private member's bill removed the right for territorians to do so. The legislation was passed over two decades ago. To me, this is a matter of local representation and the right of citizens to elect, at a local level, people who can legislate on territory matters that they are legally able to. As many senators have said in their contributions, just because the federal parliament doesn't like what a state or territory does, that isn't sufficient justification to trample over its right to do it.


Critically, this bill reinstates the rights of territorians. It allows local representatives in the ACT and the NT to legislate for themselves. It goes to the very heart of our federal system. We live under the federal system of government, where state and territory parliaments are ordinarily allowed to debate and legislate these matters for themselves, and this is the system that we seek to uphold in this legislation that we are debating here today.


Recently, the Victorian parliament passed legislation to see voluntary euthanasia legalised. This is a path that the Northern Territory had followed as well, over 20 years ago. But, regardless of their legislative ends, what both the ACT and the NT governments want is the right to decide for themselves. This is something that they have called for—they put a full-page ad in The Australian—and it is something that other states are afforded. The right to decide for themselves, through their elected representatives, in these jurisdictions is something that I believe all territorians deserve.


As the architect of Victoria's assisted dying bill, Professor Brian Owler, suggested, discussions should be had at a national, state and territory level in order to ensure that the needs of Australians at all levels are met. As a medical doctor and former head of the Australian Medical Association, Professor Owler is well placed to comment on the needs of the terminally ill. He chaired an independent panel on the matter that provided 66 recommendations to the government on assisted dying.


I believe it is our duty as elected officials to consider the advice of experts on such matters and to respond to the needs of the terminally ill in the light of the recommendations of an expert such as Professor Owler. Now is the time to listen. It is the time to signal a willingness to participate in local grassroots democracy and to allow territorians to decide for themselves whether euthanasia most appropriately meets their needs.


This bill brings together a coalition of parties; it brings together a coalition of viewpoints. The Labor Party is holding a conscience vote on the matter, as indeed is the Liberal Party. I and some of my Labor colleagues would have differing views and opinions as to whether or not voluntary euthanasia should be legislated. But I sincerely believe that, fundamentally, that is not what is being considered here. What is up for consideration is whether or not people living in the ACT and the NT should be allowed to vote for themselves on voluntary euthanasia. This is a question of democratic enfranchisement and it is a matter that has been removed from Territorians for far too long. I am proud to support this bill and to recommend to all senators to vote for this bill, so that we can allow states and territories to have an equal say through their parliaments on whether the terminally ill should have the right to die with dignity.

"Farrell, Sen Don",ALP,2018-08-15,"



Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (11:15):  I rise to speak on the Restoring Territory Rights (Assisted Suicide Legislation) Bill 2015. I would like to start by recognising that many, if not all, in this place, and those watching will have experienced the suffering and the loss of someone dear to them. It's natural to be saddened by a loved one's suffering and passing, and it's natural to want to help to ease their pain. I think we all understand that it is a very sensitive issue and a very personal one. This debate will no doubt be a difficult and emotional one for many of us. In recognition of that, I hope this will continue to be a debate that is conducted respectfully and with the awareness of the emotions it will no doubt bring for many of us.


This bill does not of itself legalise assisted suicide and euthanasia. But it's very clear from its title, Restoring Territory Rights (Assisted Suicide Legislation) Bill 2015, and from Senator Leyonhjelm's public comments, that this bill's objective is to pave the way for the legalisation of assisted suicide. That's why it is important that this bill, as it should be, is being treated as a conscience issue. Speaking on the bill today, I'd like to address two main points: firstly, the core issue of the conscience matter, of assisted suicide; secondly, the circumstances that have brought us to this debate today. As I've just outlined, the bill's core objective is to facilitate the legalisation of assisted suicide, so I do not intend to address the issue of territory rights, other than to say that this is one of many issues in which the Commonwealth has sought to regulate the territories.


It is, however, the issue at the heart of the bill that I wish to address—assisted suicide. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, the suffering and passing of loved ones is something that most, if not all, of us in this place are likely to have experienced. We're all acutely aware that with life comes death. Obviously it's an extreme emotional experience and it is human nature for our emotions to influence our thoughts on such matters. I'm sure everyone in this place can sympathise with those who have had to witness and deal with loved ones towards the ends of their lives. While I expect much debate on this issue will focus on details, as has been the case with previous debates in state parliaments, my view is that we must not avoid addressing the fundamental realities of assisted suicide.


Paving the way for the legalisation of assisted dying would be an irreversible step over a major ethical threshold. As a society, we should give very serious consideration to the potential impacts of taking such a step—as former Prime Minister Paul Keating described—as abandoning the golden principles. It's also pointed out in typically blunt fashion what is proposed when we talk about euthanasia or assisted dying, which, in his words, would be 'permitting physicians to intentionally kill patients or assisting patients in killing themselves'. Unsurprisingly, whilst there is a range of views within the medical profession, as there is in society in general, the Australian Medical Association has serious concerns. The Australian Medical Association is against the legalisation of euthanasia and assisted suicide. In its position statement on the issue, the AMA says:


The AMA believes that doctors should not be involved in interventions that have as their primary intention the ending of a person's life.


It's my view that governments, too, should not be involved in interventions that have as their primary intention the ending of a person's life.


The comments of Paul Keating that I referred to earlier come from a piece he wrote following the approval by the Victorian lower house of the Voluntary Assisted Dying Bill 2017. That piece by the former Prime Minister summed up the key issues very succinctly. In that piece, he said:


… the advocates support a bill to authorise termination of life in the name of compassion, while at the same time claiming they can guarantee protection of the vulnerable, the depressed and the poor.


No law and no process can achieve that objective. This is the point. If there are doctors prepared to bend the rules now, there will be doctors prepared to bend the rules under the new system.


He goes on to say that his opposition to the Victorian bill was not about religion, and that his concerns were shared by people of any religion and no religion; it is the principles that matter in public life. He says of those principles:


They define the norms and values of a society and in this case the principles concern our view of human life itself. It is a mistake for legislators to act on the deeply held emotional concerns of many when that involves crossing a threshold that will affect the entire society in perpetuity.


This is an emotional issue, but we must not let emotion cloud fact. It's also an issue of conscience, and for some people, that conscience may be informed by their faith. But, at its core, as Paul Keating alluded, it's an issue of principles—the ethics rather than the morals.


This is the point that former South Australian Attorney-General Michael Atkinson also made during a debate on this issue in the South Australian parliament. He said:


If my opposition to AVE is based on ancient wisdom, it is not that of Jesus of Nazareth but Hippocrates of Kos, who lived some 350 years before.


He was of course referring to the Hippocratic oath, that well-known early expression of medical ethics, the principles of which remain of significance today. I'm told that one of the earliest surviving copies of the Hippocratic oath includes the words:


I will use treatment to help the sick according to my ability and judgment, but never with a view to injury and wrong-doing. Neither will I administer a poison to anybody when asked to do so, nor will I suggest such a course.


In Australia, the modern expression of medical ethics is in the Australian Medical Association's code of medical ethics. I would like to read from the section of the code that deals directly with assisted suicide. The AMA's code of ethics says:


It is understandable, though tragic, that some patients in extreme duress—such as those suffering from a terminal, painful, debilitating illness—may come to decide that death is preferable to life. However, permitting physicians to engage in assisted suicide would ultimately cause more harm than good.


Physician-assisted suicide is fundamentally incompatible with the physician's role as healer, would be difficult or impossible to control, and would pose serious societal risks.


Instead of engaging in assisted suicide, physicians must aggressively respond to the needs of patients at the end of life. Physicians:


(a) Should not abandon a patient once it is determined that cure is impossible.


(b) Must respect patient autonomy.


(c) Must provide good communication and emotional support.


(d) Must provide appropriate comfort care and adequate pain control.


The section on euthanasia is similar but goes even further, warning that the practice would be 'difficult or impossible to control, would pose serious societal risks' and could readily be extended to incompetent patients and vulnerable populations.


Advocates of assisted suicide often highlight patient autonomy as a reason. But, in the broader context of the code, that point refers to things like a patient's right to decline medical intervention or to ask that intervention be stopped, even when that decision is expected to lead to his or her death. Indeed, the code makes it very clear that respect for a patient's autonomy does not extend to providing for assisted suicide or euthanasia. It's important to note that the Australian Medical Association's code of medical ethics warns that assisted suicide and euthanasia would be difficult or impossible to control and could be extended to patients for whom these practices are not intended.


In recent days, I've seen reports that question the idea that paving the way for assisted dying would be a slippery slope. But I've also read with concern the comments of Australian bioethics professor Margaret Somerville reported in The Sydney Morning Herald yesterday. The Sydney Morning Herald reports that Professor Somerville, who has spent decades observing euthanasia in Canada, has said that the international experience demonstrated that 'euthanasia was being used as a cheaper alternative to psychiatric and palliative care'. The professor is quoted as saying that it would be a 'societal tragedy if we allow this', and I agree with her. The article goes on to say that, in a paper published in the Journal of Palliative Care, Professor Somerville and nine of her international counterparts argued that voluntary assisted dying has gone beyond the aims of relieving pain and suffering and is now being misused.


What is very concerning is that Professor Somerville says that assurance by the 'proponents of euthanasia that it would not lead to a slippery slope have been proven wrong, with research showing that safeguards are routinely violated.' The professor was quoted in the article as saying:


In one study in Belgium, they surveyed doctors and found that 32 per cent had gone outside of the regulations.


That should ring huge alarm bells for anybody, because it implies that not only have safeguards failed through human error but also that some doctors may be choosing to ignore them. Professor Somerville also says:



… in many cases, pain and suffering were not the primary motivator for an assisted suicide request, with a fear of being a burden on relatives a more common reason in patient surveys.



She has also argued that 'in most cases pain or discomfort could be remedied through proper palliative care'. I'm sure many in this place have personal experience of loved ones who, approaching the end of their lives, have struggled with the idea they may be a burden on their families. This is not a belief that should be encouraged through the provision of legalising assisted dying.


In the course of the broader debate on this issue across the nation, we've heard stories of people whose personal feelings on the issue of assisted dying and euthanasia have changed when they've been approaching their own end of life. A decision to make use of assisted dying made while a person is suffering and at a low point and may believe themselves to be a burden cannot later be undone. Some in favour of assisted dying argue that we can never achieve safeguards in any area of the law that work 100 per cent of the time, but the very obvious difference in this case is that the failure of the safeguards can result in death, a failure that is irreversible. The report I mentioned earlier—that 32 per cent of surveyed doctors in Belgium had gone outside the relevant assisted dying guidelines in that jurisdiction—only adds to these concerns.


Outside of debate on this issue, we've also heard many sad stories of elder abuse. Unfortunately, there are those who would seek to exploit vulnerable people who are terminally ill and suffering. Under the model proposed in Victoria, patients would have to administer the lethal drug themselves. What safeguards can ensure that once those drugs are provided, they will not be misused by others? I'm not insensitive to the hurt that can be caused by seeing a loved one in pain and suffering, but there is no way to provide adequate safeguards against the extension, misuse or abuse of legalising assisted dying.


It is not acceptable to put people at risk of dying against their wishes, be it through accident or malicious intent, when we can address the problems of pain and suffering through better provision of palliative care. We know it's common for patients to say that they don't want to be a burden on their families, but we must not legislate in ways that are likely to make the chronically ill, elderly, disabled or dying feel they are a burden. It is society's duty to provide appropriate health care to those who need it, not to devalue lives by classifying groups of people as less worthy of living because they meet an arbitrary set of criteria that make them eligible to seek assisted death.


Having made my position on the real objective of this bill clear, I'd like to now talk about how we got to this point. Malcolm Turnbull brought this bill on for debate this week in exchange for Senator Leyonhjelm's support for the re-establishment of the Australian Building Construction Commission. The democratic rights of workers in the building and construction industry were sold out so that this bill could be debated. The Law Council said this about the ABCC bill:


… a number of features of the bill are contrary to rule of law principles and traditional common law rights and privileges.



Dr Nicola McGarrity and Professor George Williams from the faculty of law at the University of New South Wales said:


… the ABC Commissioner's investigatory powers have the potential to severely restrict basic democratic rights such as freedom of speech, freedom of association, the privilege against self-incrimination and the right to silence.


Senator Leyonhjelm says that the Prime Minister gave him a guarantee that Liberals would be given a free vote on the bill and that it would proceed for consideration in the lower house. Former Prime Minister Tony Abbott reckons that deals like this one are wrong and says that Malcolm Turnbull has ignored proper internal process. Mr Abbott told 2GB:


I am a little worried about secret deals and I am a little worried that undertakings might have been made which weren't brought to the party room and the prime minister likes to talk about due process—I am very concerned about lack of due process.


On this, I agree with Mr Abbott. In other words, this bill is tainted.


To sum up, I oppose this bill because, at its heart, it's about facilitating assisted suicide. I oppose assisted suicide because I don't think any safeguards could guarantee the protection of the lives of the vulnerable. I oppose assisted suicide and euthanasia because experts, including the Australian Medical Association, have warned that it will be difficult if not impossible to control and is the wrong way to deal with the issue of pain and suffering. I cannot support something that I believe will ultimately lead to people dying against their wishes. I would like to again quote former Prime Minister Paul Keating, who said on Victoria's assisted dying bill:


Once this bill is passed the expectations of patients and families will change. The culture of dying, despite certain and intense resistance, will gradually permeate into our medical, health, social and institutional arrangements. It stands for everything a truly civil society should stand against.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",AC,2018-08-15,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (11:34):  I rise today with the intention of detailing two important principles that have led me to oppose the Restoring Territory Rights (Assisted Suicide Legislation) Bill 2015. Senator Farrell quite rightly raises an important third principle, and that is the principle of doing dirty deals in order to achieve particular outcomes. I say 'dirty deals' because I can't think of anything worse than trading off a life-and-death issue in favour of a political outcome against the wishes or knowledge of your own party room. It is, I think, a gross misuse of process. It is deeply disturbing not only that Senator Leyonhjelm maintains that the Prime Minister promised a vote in the House of Representatives—and promised to facilitate that—but also that the Prime Minister himself denies it. If you can't believe a Prime Minister or a senator, it brings this entire process and this parliament into some element of question. I have enormous reservation about how we come to this point, because I believe there are many more important and critical issues that need to be resolved in this country than whether the Northern Territory and the ACT should have the right to legislate for state-sanctioned killing.


That brings me to my first point. The Commonwealth Constitution makes it very clear that the states have certain rights and responsibilities and the Commonwealth has certain rights and responsibilities. One of those responsibilities applies to the territories. We have the right to make laws that affect the territories and will overturn their own laws—that will disallow them, if I can put it like that. Such an event took place in 1997 with the passage of the Andrews bill, which prevented the Northern Territory from having a state-assisted suicide regime. It's a regime, I might remind you, that was endorsed by, I regret to say, a neighbour of mine—when I say 'neighbour', I mean he lived in the neighbourhood that I lived in and I used to see him at the coffee shop, but we didn't mix very much—the disgraced Dr Nitschke, who was quite happily putting to death people who didn't have a terminal illness but just got sick of living. This is the same Dr Nitschke that professes to have a brewery now so he can import lethal gas and sell lethal suicide kits over the internet, or whatever it does. It makes me ill to think of how this callous man, in the name of compassion, likes to exploit the vulnerabilities of people, who perhaps need assistance, and put them to death rather than help them to enjoy life.


Nonetheless, we know the Northern Territory assisted suicide regime was misused. We know that. We also know that the states have the role and the responsibility to introduce assisted suicide regimes if they want to. We've seen that happen in Victoria. I don't agree with that either, but it is entirely within the remit of the Victorian parliament to make that determination. If you want to change it, you should elect different people. But the territories are not states. If you look at the population of the Northern Territory, it's 200,000 people. It's got a large land mass and it's had a series of relatively dysfunctional governments but, in terms of population, it's not even the size of a number of South-East Queensland councils. It wants states' rights, yet it has none of the responsibilities, or the ability to take responsibility, for some of the processes that go along with that. A case in point is the misuse of the assisted dying legislation that they introduced. Importantly—I'm interested in this—they voted against becoming a state. They actually voted against becoming a state, because they themselves knew that they weren't capable of taking on that responsibility.


In the ACT, it's even worse. If you want to give the ACT states' rights and if you want to empower it to make euthanasia legislation, the ACT is the most left-leaning government, if you can call it that—it's a council administrator—anywhere in the country. If you were to question how it will end up should you empower the ACT with euthanasia legislation or state-assisted dying legislation, look no further than what is happening in some of the most radical regimes around the world. These are the figures from a chap called Paul Russell, another South Australian, who's got the HOPE initiative.


In Belgium, three children have been put to death under euthanasia laws. They were aged 17, 11 and nine. How are those safeguards looking now? Seventy-seven people have been killed because of mental disorders and behaviour. That is the sixth most common reason for doctor-assisted suicide in that country. Think about that for a moment. Once you break the taboo that it's all right to help someone kill themselves, the only question is: what should be the limiting factors? If someone no longer wants to live, who are you to deny their right to kill themselves? It brings into question: why do we have suicide prevention things? Why do we have mental health support services? Why do we talk about the tragedy of farmers who contemplate this final act out of desperation? Supporting legalised, state-sanctioned assisted suicide is to say, 'We no longer value your worth at any level.' Just because someone has a temporary mental health disorder, just because someone is suffering from depression or just because someone feels they no longer want to live is not justification to support them in ending their own life. Quite the contrary: we should be looking to assist them.


What would you say if it were a 17-year-old? Perhaps you'd argue they don't have legal standing, that they're a minor, and so someone else should be able to make that decision for them. What if they're 18? They're an adult. They can go off to war and they can do a whole range of things. If it's okay for an 80-year-old to say, 'I want my doctor to kill me,' why can't an 18-year-old or a 28-year-old or a 38-year-old? That is the important principle here. To all the people who say, 'I've got the right to end my own life when I can,' where are you going to end that? In Belgium, we know a 17-year-old, an 11-year-old and a nine-year-old—all children—have been killed under this. Seventy-seven people have been killed because they had a mental disorder. I'm sure they were making a full and frank decision for themselves and the checks and balances had gone on there! In Belgium, more than half of the suicides occur within just three months of the request being made. They can just go to their doctor and a three-month process takes place for more than half of them. We also know that, in places like the United States where assisted suicide regimes are in place, there's actually been an increase in the number of suicides. Doesn't it fly counter to everything that we profess to value in the human dignity, in the innate worth, of every individual? We're now encouraging them to take their own lives because that's what they feel like doing. It's the ultimate in liberalism or in libertarianism, except it has a profound effect on so many others as well.


The suicide rate in the US, where it's been legal, has increased in the over-65s by 14½ per cent. There is the impact on other people. About a fifth of family members who actually witnessed an assisted suicide in places like Switzerland subsequently formed a post-traumatic stress disorder—another mental health issue, if I can couch it like that, which could be used to justify them ending their own life too. It truly is a slippery slope. It is a ride from which society cannot return, as soon as you start to measure someone's worth by whether they want to live.


Then there's the argument, of course, about pain. People, quite compassionately, understand and argue that, in insufferable pain, they should be able to choose to end their lives to prevent that. Palliative Care Victoria states that, in rare cases where all methods of palliation for pain and other symptoms fail, palliative sedation therapy is available to provide adequate relief from suffering. If we can accept that we can mitigate or limit this insufferable pain, the reality is that the justification used for assisted suicide is not actually about the pain itself but concern about the person in pain becoming a burden. In Oregon in the US, assisted suicide occurs primarily due to a loss of autonomy, for life being less enjoyable than you want it to be—for incontinence, for example, or for feeling like you are a burden on your family, your friends, your caregivers.


In this country we've had a recent debate and discussion about elder abuse, and quite rightly so. We are seeing ads on buses and elsewhere all around the nation, telling older Australians that, if they're being exploited, beaten or otherwise abused, they should call the hotline. The best statistics I could identify were that between 2½ and five per cent of the older demographic may be vulnerable to elder abuse. What more abusive thing can there be than a manipulative family member or person outside of the family but close to the elderly person, applying pressure—you can call it abuse if you like—that they should end their own lives to stop them being a burden, to relieve those around them of the pain and suffering of having to care for a loved one who is no longer able to care for themselves? It's entirely likely that those events and circumstances would occur. Encourage the elder to move on, whether you are a religious person or not, from the earthly cares, the mortality of this world. It's likely it might be a carer at their wit's end who is more likely seeking to be relieved of the burden of care and placing that guilt trip upon the person they care for.


We also know that, in Oregon, half of those who took lethal medicine under their assisted suicide regime cited that they were concerned about being a burden on their family and caregivers. We also know that around 79 per cent of those in Oregon took the lethal dose without a physician present. The question is: who did administer it? Who provided those checks and balances? Nobody really knows if it was self-administered or not. Surely, if someone's had permission and been provided the wherewithal to end their own life, but they do it without a physician being present, they're vulnerable to someone else doing it, perhaps without their knowledge.


Senator Abetz has quite rightly raised this in an earlier speech, and Senator Colbeck described this as state-sanctioned killing. It's a term that is equally as applicable to capital punishment as it is to assisted suicide. For those who say, 'We know this is very popular, because the polls will say it's very popular,' let me tell you that the death penalty is pretty popular in this country too if you ask the polls. If you say, 'Should we implement that?' they'll say yes, but it's still morally wrong. It's still the wrong thing to do. You'd ask yourself, 'What happens if the Northern Territory wanted to introduce the death penalty?' Do we say that's their right to do that, because we should take a hands-off approach to what is good for this country in the longer term or because it's popular?


Populism is not an excuse for doing something, particularly when it's going to have implications that will be felt for generations and, as Senator Farrell quite rightly pointed out, affects the life and death of individuals and affects deeply the lives of those around those individuals.


I note that one assisted suicide proponent, a neurosurgeon named Henry Marsh, said:


Even if a few grannies get bullied into it, isn't that the price worth praying for all the people who could die with dignity?


Let me repeat that:


Even if a few grannies get bullied into it, isn't that the price worth paying for all the people who could die with dignity?


The reality is, if you vote in favour of this, you are justifying that sort of comment. You are justifying the fact that maybe a couple of people will get bullied into killing themselves, because that's the price you're prepared to pay, or you're prepared for others to pay, for the cliche slogan 'to die with dignity'.


I make the point that Nembutal, the drug of choice for many suicide advocates, is the same drug used in executions. It's the same drug that massive concerns have been raised about in those countries that have the death penalty, because the drug can cause not only death but also a huge amount of pain along the way. We know that in 10 per cent of cases in the Netherlands, where this drug was used, it took longer than the expected median of three hours for the person to die after taking this drug. In one case, it took the person seven days to die. We know that people are concerned about the pain inflicted upon executed prisoners in the States because they haven't been adequately anaesthetised before taking the drug. Where state-sanctioned killing is allowed with the death penalty, and where it is the same drug as that advocated by some of the proponents of state-sanctioned suicide in this country, they can't even get it right. But, somehow, we think we're going to make all the difference and the problems that have afflicted the rest of the world, where these regimes have been impacted, are somehow not going to occur here.


I put to the Senate that there are many, many reasons why common sense prevailed on this question in 1997. It must prevail again. If the territories want to self-govern in this way, let them put it to a referendum on them becoming states. I know the Northern Territory rejected it. I can't see any justification for the Australian Capital Territory becoming a state—I can only imagine the 12 senators they would elect to this place. Rights come with responsibilities. It's not a party on the parents' purse strings. They need to stand on their own two feet, if that's what they want to do, but right now we have to help them to their feet. We have to guide them in the manner that our Constitution allows, because we have to do the right thing here. We can't fall for trendy cliches and slogans. We've got to think through the consequences of every single action that we take. These consequences were thought through in 1997 with the Andrews bill. To repeal that bill would be a retrograde step, because there is no evidence whatsoever, anywhere around the world, that a regime like the one that is proposed to be introduced or allowed can function sustainably with the adequate safeguards that everyone assures us would be different in Australia.

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2018-08-15,"



Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (11:53):  Wow, what a debate this has been. It's been a very, very interesting debate with lots of passion and lots of people who have welded ideologies. I have a great deal of respect for all of the views that have been put in this place. We should remind ourselves what this place is about. We call this the 'states house'. A long time ago we had Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania and 12 senators were provided as part of the founding fathers' decision in our Constitution to ensure that the states were dealt with equally—that no one state should be discriminated against. I'm actually from a state called the Northern Territory. I don't have statehood per se, but I'm here. On this whole notion of this debate being about ensuring that the states are treated equally, I have to say that I've been a little disappointed that many senators seem to have missed the point. I'll try to bring them back to that point. Fundamentally, it shouldn't matter where you live, in what jurisdiction, this place is a place that ensures that you are treated equally.


We're talking now about restoration. In fact, the legislation is called the Restoring Territory Rights (Assisted Suicide Legislation) Bill 2015. In 1995 the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act was voted for in the Northern Territory parliament, a parliament that was properly constituted and democratically elected, in exactly the same way as in every other jurisdiction—in exactly the same way as Western Australia, Queensland, Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory; their parliaments are constituted in very much the same way. There was a proper debate that went on and there were committees of inquiry. As you would imagine, it was highly controversial. It hadn't happened in Australia before. There was a lot of focus on the process. On 25 May, the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly voted 15 for and 10 against. The act didn't enter into force until 1 July 1996, and, in the period of time in which it was in force, four people accessed the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act to assist their passing.


For all of that to have happened, you have to look at the legitimacy of how that came about. It came about because of the Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act, which was passed on 22 June 1978. The Territorians were then able to 'make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Territory' where the laws related to any matter not controlled by the Commonwealth. That's not inconsistent with other jurisdictions; it's completely the same as the other states, exactly the same. The sorts of things that these laws dealt with were schools, hospitals, utilities, public transport, forests, police, prisons, community services, roads and rail—all of the things that would be dealt with by a state or territory jurisdiction. Nothing too controversial there. We all accept that's exactly as it should be. When the self-government act came out, we all felt equal. We weren't mendicants to the South Australian government or like some backyard nobody could afford. We were a jurisdiction unto ourselves. We had the capacity to raise funds and to do the same things as every state and territory did.


We always understood, as Territorians, that there were some matters that were proscribed as 'matters controlled by the Commonwealth'. Same-sex marriage, for example, has come up. The Australian Capital Territory tried to raise same-sex marriage, but the Constitution said, 'Look, the High Court has struck it down.' Eventually the Commonwealth said, 'Well, it is our responsibility,' and this place recently passed laws on same-sex marriage, which the states and territories had thus far been prevented from doing constitutionally and by the courts. We respected that.


But one thing I want to say about the debate today and over the last few days is that it's been a bit of a Clayton's debate, because we all know that this isn't within the ambit of the Commonwealth government. This is not a matter in the Constitution that we can deal with. We know, in fact, that it's been dealt with by state jurisdictions and will be dealt with by other jurisdictions from time to time—most recently, the legislation was passed in Victoria; legislation was recently defeated in New South Wales—as appropriate. That's entirely a matter for those jurisdictions. But, unlike those jurisdictions, the Northern Territory was a function of the Kevin Andrews bill, the Euthanasia Laws Act 1997. That bill effectively said: the self-government of all territories—there was no mischief in the ACT; no-one was trying to pass laws about euthanasia in the ACT, but we'll throw them in anyway, to make some sort of consistency—will be revoked so as to prevent them from passing laws on euthanasia. They are quite entitled, as jurisdictions, to pass laws on euthanasia. But, because we as a territory are slightly different, we could pass a private member's bill that would not have stood a chance in hell of getting up in New South Wales or Victoria—or of overturning any of those—and no attempt has been made to control those jurisdictions because of their rights under the Constitution. That bill passed through this place on the 27 March 1997 with a vote of 38 noes versus 33 ayes. So 38 people said, 'No, we want to deal with the matter of euthanasia in the Northern Territory.' I understand that, at that stage, it was a reality and it was an opportunity for people whose fundamental beliefs about euthanasia were probably more impacted than those of the Northern Territory.


But euthanasia is not a matter for us, and that's why I have indicated that, despite plenty of passion and plenty of smarts around this place, it's a bit of a Clayton's debate. I can tell you right now there would be a different sense in this place if we were debating euthanasia as a national piece of legislation. The place would be full of media, there would be people running around, and the back rooms would be full of people, ringing and cajoling. But it hasn't been like that because we know it's not going to change anything about euthanasia nationally—we are not doing anything federally—and it's not within our ambit constitutionally.


I heard there's broad agreement that restoring territory rights legislation is really not going to be impacted. So the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act is not going to be impacted if we pass this legislation. Some legal opinion submitted to the Senate Standing Committees on Legal and Constitutional Affairs inquiry into the Rights of the Terminally Ill (Euthanasia Laws Repeal) Bill 2008 said:


However, there is significant judicial and academic opinion which suggests that laws made by territory legislatures are not merely suspended or dormant for the duration of any inconsistent Commonwealth law and then enter back into force upon its removal …


The authors concluded:


… there are strong grounds for suggesting that item 2 of Schedule 1 is insufficient to revive the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995 (NT). The rights of individuals and interests at stake are too important to allow uncertainty on this score.


Another submission raised concerns that an attempt to revive the bill would:


… provide the basis for an argument that the [NT RTI] Act would be invested with a Federal character that it did not possess prior to the commencement of the Euthanasia Laws Act 1997 (Cth) or would not possess following the mere repeal of that Act. There is a real danger of the Act becoming entrenched and thus leaving the Assembly powerless to amend or repeal it …


In a sense, because it had this Commonwealth flavour.


Professor George Williams of the Gilbert and Tobin Centre told the committee:


… instead of the Northern Territory law being revived, the Legislative Assembly there and in the other territories would be able to pass a new law, should they so wish—


and they should be allowed to do so—


I think that is appropriate given the principles of democracy involved, given the time that has elapsed and also given the constitutional issues [rather] than to attempt to revive something that may not be possible to do and it would certainly be inappropriate to leave practitioners and others in a situation where they may be unclear as to the legality of their actions.


All subsequent federal bills to restore territory powers including the current bill have made it clear they do not attempt to revive the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act.


What remains for us if this is not a matter within the ambit of the Commonwealth or the Senate to decide on? It's not about euthanasia. I haven't talked about my issues with euthanasia and I shouldn't because it is not my right to do so; it is the right of states and territories to deal with that matter, and that is clear in the Constitution. So what remains? This debate is clearly not about euthanasia. The only issue remaining is the territories' rights to make laws that are not controlled by the Commonwealth in the Constitution.


It's been quite a disturbing process. Spatially, by dint of history, if you happen to live here in the Australian Capital Territory or you happen to live in the glorious Northern Territory, you are now a different class of citizen. You don't have the same rights to decide what you want as does every other jurisdiction. In this place, in the Senate, to choose to ignore that fundamental, I find very difficult to swallow.


I've heard so much about equality in this place: 'We're all equal in this place, and we've really got to look after equality.' But this is an opportunity to right the wrong of 27 March 1997, where every person who lived in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory became a different class of Australian. Are we equal? Well, sort of. We're equal unless the Commonwealth decides that we are not.


This is not a debate about euthanasia. Clearly, it should not be a debate about euthanasia, although I acknowledge and respect those people with strongly held views on those matters. This is only about state rights. I'm not sure why the people who enjoy living in a state don't trust me and don't trust territorians to democratically elect people who will make decisions in the same way as everybody else does in Victoria and New South Wales, Tasmania, Western Australia or Queensland—in exactly the same way. But we can't be trusted! People have said, 'Oh, look, the Northern Territory didn't become a state when it wanted to become a state.' Let me tell you: we had a constitutional referendum about statehood, and it failed because people didn't understand what we were about to get.


But can you imagine, even if it had passed, people coming into this place and saying, 'Thanks very much, and where are our extra 10 senators?' What a bloody joke that would be, because this place, I can tell you, after what I've heard over the last few days, is not a place of equity. It's not a place that respects everybody who lives in this country. For those people who are voting this down, I genuinely respect their views on the fundamentals of euthanasia, but that is a Clayton's debate. That is a Trojan Horse that just doesn't cut it.


There's an opportunity today to put right something that went wrong on 27 March 1997. Territorians for 19 years were okay. Territorians for 19 years were okay to get on with their own business because it was consistent with some of the views of people in the Commonwealth government. But, on the day it wasn't, they sent a clear signal—and to the ACT, who hadn't had the temerity to introduce legislation of their own. Even they would be caught up because it would somehow be consistent. What a lot of rubbish!


Nobody in this debate needs to be anything but absolutely clear about what this is about. This is about entrenching two types of citizens in this country, one who comes from a territory and the other who comes from the Commonwealth. And I can tell you that introducing 20 new senators in this place is not going to happen in my bloody lifetime. So the notion of, 'Oh, why don't you just become states, and then you'll be the same as us,' is complete garbage. There were those glorious 19 years when we were treated as equals around this country. There's an opportunity today to ensure that we are returned just simply to being equals. Territorians aren't asking for any more than that. We are simply asking in this place, in this house, to be treated as equals.

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2018-08-15,"



Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (12:08):  I rise to speak on the Restoring Territory Rights (Assisted Suicide Legislation) Bill 2015. It may be argued that the only question being asked of us within this bill is whether the federal parliament should permit the territories to legislate in this space. However, I believe that this is a misguided view and that it is not the only question being asked of us here. The broader purpose of this bill is to allow the territories the legal right to legislate for euthanasia and assisted suicide. But firstly I want to address that question briefly.


Under the Constitution, territories have a different status to states. Territories are not provided the same rights and responsibilities. Our founders did this for a reason. The Australian parliament is provided the right under the Constitution to make laws for the territories. We need to have a broader discussion about the rights of territories in comparison to states and their place in our federation.


The law dictates that government must protect all individuals and govern in the interest of all Australians, and the previous speaker said we have no right to have this debate. Well I believe, even though we can't legislate for assisted suicide and euthanasia, we do have a right, as Commonwealth senators and as members in the other place, to put on record our views in relation to the issue. We exist as a parliament to provide for good government and to protect the most vulnerable at all cost.


Let's not forget why this bill is here, being debated right now. The answer is because Malcolm Turnbull, the Prime Minister, is willing to horse trade on such legislation. This is legislation that is so important to those who support the rights of the territories and to those of us who are ensuring that we put on record our view in relation to assisted suicide. But he is prepared to horse trade on this sort of legislation to ensure he stays Prime Minister of this country—although Senator Leyonhjelm, who is the one that the deal was made with, has said the Prime Minister has reneged on that commitment.


The question for this parliament and the broader community is: should we be giving doctors, or anyone else for that matter, the right in law to end the life of another person? And if we do, how do these laws affect society over time? The issue of voluntary euthanasia affects the entire community, and our emotions through lived experiences with our own loved ones often hamper the ability for reasoned debate on this issue, which is why this subject deserves the time of this place for a considered and lengthy debate. The issue of voluntary euthanasia and assisted suicide is one of the most emotional, challenging issues that politicians, whether it's at a Commonwealth level or at a state or territory level, will have to deal with.


Social regulatory policy, which acts to make a considered change in the way we view life and death, deserves the most serious of considerations, and should not merely be rushed through under the guise of territory rights. Legislation that allows a third party to end or to assist in the ending of another person's life is, without question, the most difficult space to legislate. For the state to codify in law circumstances to authorise the ending of a human life may be viewed as an impossibility because of the inability to ensure it's not abused. Let's be clear here: this is not a legislative space that allows for individual freedom or autonomy; it is actually outsourcing individual freedom to the state and a third party.


This is my major concern: I don't believe that it can be safely legislated. And once we legislate in this space and we end the lives of people within the community, it will erode the value and importance we place on life. We enter this place to make assessments and form judgements about our respective states, territories and fellow Australians. We must take that responsibility with the honour and humility it deserves. We must be acutely aware of the fact that our decisions are not binding for all time, and can be amended. Such proposed legislation in this space will never be able to guarantee that a human life will not be prematurely ended due to abuse or flaws within such a legislative framework, or the social, cultural and medical ramifications of such laws as time moves on. This reason alone should ensure that no such legislation should exist in any state or territory. No legislative framework can account for every individual and unique circumstance, and no amount of safeguards can take into account all variables in a person's life or particular circumstances.


Unfortunately, the Victorian parliament has been successful in this space and has legislated for this reform, and that's been referred to by many speakers in this debate. But that legislation will not take effect until May 2019. I would have thought that we need to take the time to see how that legislation is enacted, and whether or not the safeguards that are being proposed by those who supported that legislation will stand the test of time. As the former Prime Minister Paul Keating said during that debate in Victoria, 'No law and no process can achieve that objective.' We know that legislation gets amended all the time and we know there are social changes within the community, so I don't think you can use the fact that the Victorian bill has not been implemented as justification for supporting this bill. 


It should be noted that, although divergent views exist on this issue within the medical profession, the Australian Medical Association believes that doctors should not be involved in interventions that have as their primary intention the ending of a person's life. Withholding and withdrawing treatment is ethically distinct from physician assisted suicide or euthanasia. We hear in this place on so many debates that we should be adhering to the experts' advice. Well, I don't think there are any experts that are more informed when it comes to assisted suicide and euthanasia than doctors. When the AMA is opposed to it—on the grounds they have articulated—then I think we should be adhering to that advice. 


I do sympathise with anyone who is suffering with terminal or life-limiting illness or people who live with permanent pain. I do not question your right to argue for voluntary euthanasia, nor do I question your ordeal or your suffering. I cannot possibly understand your individual circumstances. However, my own lived experience—without such legislation—is that pressure can be put on older members of our community when entering the acute health system such that they feel that maybe they shouldn't be asking for a second opinion. I've had that life experience with my own mother. I know what it's like when you're told: 'There's nothing more we can do for you. We don't believe that surgery is going to give you quality of life.' My mother was able to demand that she have a second opinion. That second opinion was still that the chances of surgery were limited, but that surgeon was in fact prepared to proceed with the surgery that she needed. We were fortunate at that time, because my mother had her faculties; she was strong and opinionated. The surgery did take place and my mother had an additional 3½ years to enjoy her life, her grandchildren and her great-grandchildren. With the overseas experience, as I will talk about further, there is not always that option for people. 


We've heard many of my colleagues talk about palliative care—and that there should not be a choice between palliative care and end of life, or assisted suicide. The reality is that we have the power in this place—and governments have failed over too many years—to adequately resource palliative care so that people have the support that they need, whether that's in their own home, in an aged-care home or in acute care. What we need to do is not just talk about the need for greater resources; we collectively need to ensure that the government of the day and future governments resource palliative care, because that in itself can assist with ensuring that people have the end of life that they want, with their loved ones. My concern is that legalising voluntary euthanasia and, effectively, allowing the state to legislate to end human life is a fundamentally flawed answer and not an adequate answer in a society where human life should be viewed as paramount. As I said, palliative care needs to be available to people in their homes, in hospices and in aged-care facilities. 


In my own home state, in northern Tasmania, we have been fighting for a standalone hospice to assist people with their end-of-life issues so they have the support they need. My colleagues from my home state have not supported that view; they didn't put pressure on the former Labor government to fund such a hospice. So I would like people, instead of just giving the words and talking, to actually walk the walk and ensure that a hospice for northern Tasmania is going to be funded by a future state government.


Quite frankly, until we have adequate services to support all people who are dying, why are we even considering this option? Bioethics professor Margaret Somerville, who has observed voluntary euthanasia in Canada for decades, argues that euthanasia is being used as a cheaper alternative to psychiatric and palliative care. Public policy is not infallible, but often public policy and law changes are in fact flawed. A law that would allow voluntary euthanasia is fraught with potential for abuse and medical malpractice. It's better that voluntary euthanasia does not become law, because if one person's life is extinguished prematurely and wrongly, then the state would be responsible for the killing of that human life. Such laws, as a matter of public policy, are not worth the risk to people's lives.


When considering the necessity and practically of new laws, it's best to look at overseas jurisdictions that have already introduced similar laws and see what has happened with those laws and how they have changed. One may argue that such legislation in those jurisdictions is operating effectively if individuals are being granted their wish to end their life on their terms. However, I argue that the legislation which has been instituted in other jurisdictions is flawed because human life has been extinguished prematurely and without the consent of the person. Effectively, in many jurisdictions the state is killing people where voluntary euthanasia laws have been established.


Belgium and the Netherlands have legislated euthanasia and we have seen the decline from the initial legislation that was introduced there. The Physician-assisted deaths under the euthanasia law in Belgium: a population-based survey study demonstrated that 32 per cent of euthanasia deaths recorded in the Flanders region of Belgium occurred without explicit consent. The research found that this was occurring because the groups were vulnerable and because there had been a change in the way that citizens and the medical profession viewed end-of-life measures since the inception of voluntary euthanasia laws. Many of the people who were euthanised were either terminally ill or suffering from dementia or other neurological diseases. Euthanasia in Belgium and the Netherlands is being used to end life prematurely when in fact voluntary euthanasia is supposed to control the way and conditions in which a person wishes to end their life.


Switzerland has also passed voluntary euthanasia laws. The Swiss statistics office reported that there were 965 reported assisted suicide deaths in 2015, up from 742 in 2014 and 86 in 2000. The number of assisted suicide deaths in Switzerland nursing homes via the Exit suicide clinic increased from 10 in 2007 to 92 in 2015. They reported that the Swiss association for ethics in medicine found this trend alarming and stated, 'To end lives in this way gives the practice of assisted suicide an institutional seal of approval.' In August 2015 a healthy, depressed British woman died by assisted suicide the Switzerland. In 2014 a Swiss assisted suicide study found that 16 per cent of people who died at Swiss assisted suicide clinics had no underlying illness. In May 2014 the Exit suicide clinic extended assisted suicide to healthy elderly people who lived with physical or psychological pain. In the last two years 77 people suffering from mental health issues and 173 people who had no physical suffering, but who suffered from addiction and loneliness, were euthanised.


The definition of an illness is expanding, with the Netherlands now considering euthanasia for people who are satisfied with their time on earth and have completed their life. The Netherlands legislated for euthanasia in 2001, and now the age of eligibility for euthanasia is 12 years of age. In 2015, Belgium extended the right of voluntary euthanasia to children. In September 2016, a 17-year-old was euthanised and recently it was revealed that two children, aged nine and 11, were euthanised. We must realise that, once someone is diagnosed with depression, they are not in the correct state of mind to make a life-and-death decision. For most people suffering from a terminal illness, depression is likely. If such a bill were to pass in the territories or any state in Australia, there is no reason why the experience of Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland would not be replicated. Over time, legislation will be amended, and there is no reason at all that we wouldn't consider that what's happened internationally wouldn't happen in Australia.


I often say that greed and self-interest are almost as certain as the sun rising in the east. The potential for the abuse of voluntary euthanasia laws is stark and is a major concern to any state which is considering legalising voluntary euthanasia. This is not about religion. The concerns I have are shared with agnostics and atheists. This issue is about the ethics of civilisation and the importance of a person's life. We need to balance individual rights with what is in the public interest. It's not in the public interest to provide doctors carte blanche on what constitutes a worthwhile life. Any change to the Hippocratic Oath places a dangerous amount of power in the hands of a third party, taking away individual rights. Where voluntary euthanasia has become law, choice is an illusion and the laws are open to abuse. People have come forth with stories of elder abuse and coercion by family members, doctors and nurses. Some of these stories are about death by lethal injection or assisted suicide. We've all heard the stories about people with disabilities whose quality of life was deemed unworthy by doctors. Voluntary euthanasia and assisted suicide at a state or federal level is not the correct legislative action for a government to take in the care of the terminally ill and the most vulnerable people in our communities.


I admire the contributions to the debate by both sides, whether they support euthanasia or not. This is the place where we should have the opportunity to voice our concerns. My concern is ensuring that we are protective of those who are most vulnerable in our communities and that we continue to value the sanctity of the life of every Australian.

Senator STORER
 (South Australia) (12:28):  I welcome the opportunity to speak in the chamber and indicate my support for Senator Leyonhjelm's private member's bill, Restoring Territory Rights (Assisted Suicide Legislation) Bill 2015. I support the ability of the territories to control their own legislative agenda. Their elected representatives should be fully answerable to their voters for the decisions they take. I would be disappointed if the Turnbull government did not allow this bill, should it be carried in the Senate, to be debated in the House of Representatives. I see here a fundamental question that the Senate is being asked to address: the ability of the Commonwealth to override the legislative will of the ACT and the Northern Territory on the specific question of assisted dying. This bill, if passed, would give the territories the same legislative rights as the states, specifically on assisted dying, overturning a 20-year-old federal law which prevented the territories from legalising assisted dying. This bill, simply put, provides the territories with the opportunity to introduce and debate assisted dying legislation, should they wish to do so. It is important to note that it does not enable the Northern Territory to reinstate the original assisted dying legislation, which gave rise to the decision of the parliament of the Commonwealth to overturn that law. This is a matter of the democratic right of the territories and the people in them. It's a states' right matter, as passionately discussed by Senator Scullion earlier today. Voters in the ACT and the Northern Territory should have the same right as voters in South Australia and the other states to vote for or oppose politicians who pledge to legalise assisted dying.


Other senators here have discussed the question of assisted dying itself. I shall not do so. I simply want to deal with the legislation before me. Should I be asked to consider legislation on assisted dying itself, I would apply myself to considering, deeply, the details of what is being proposed and especially the safeguards contained in the measure. But that is not the case right now.


That said, I have noted the processes that have occurred in other jurisdictions when legislators have been asked to consider bills. The legislation passed by the Victorian parliament at the end of last year, for example, followed a 10-month crossbench parliamentary inquiry set up after that state's legislative council agreed on such an approach in 2015. The relevant committee tabled its final report a year later. The government released its response six months after that. A ministerial advisory panel was then established and its 66 recommendations, informed by the work of the parliamentary inquiry, were completed a further six months later, in the middle of last year. Those recommendations were the building blocks for the legislation itself, which came into law at the end of last year, but not before an exhaustive debate in both houses of the Victorian parliament. As we have heard, the legislation will not be in effect until June 2019. So the reports and the decisions taken in Victoria have taken more than two, nearly three, years. From the outside, this appears to have been a thoughtful and measured way of gathering all the evidence for and against before any parliament makes a decision on a matter of such importance. Therefore, discussion of palliative care and related public policies with regard to assisted dying is admirable but is not being considered here today. Similarly, the discussion of the Victorian legislation and the findings from other jurisdictions, based on their legislation, is also not being considered here today. Again, this is a matter of the democratic rights of the territories to have the same rights as voters in South Australia and other states to vote for or oppose politicians who pledge to legalise assisted dying. Therefore, I will be supporting the legislation before the Senate today, Restoring Territory Rights (Assisted Suicide Legislation) Bill 2015, on that basis.

Senator McGRATH
 (Queensland—Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister) (12:33):  Life must trump all. All in this chamber have come to this debate on different paths. All have family and friends who have fought for life and who have shifted from life to come what may. This bill, Restoring Territory Rights (Assisted Suicide Legislation) Bill 2015, will allow a territory government to introduce a government sanctioned right to death or right to kill. Those most at risk will be now at risk of a sometimes morally nebulous society. I oppose this bill. I oppose euthanasia.


This bill socialises death, not as a last resort, but as a means for society to avoid the dignity of life, often when life is drawing to a close. This is a bill that effectively places the dignity of death ahead of the dignity of life as a means for society to allow, indeed promote, the state-sanctioned killing of the old, the infirm, the unwanted, the dying, the depressed and the forgotten. No human being has the moral authority to decide when another should die.


We are inherently fallible. We make mistakes. We commit monstrous acts in anger. We become overtaken by greed. We oppose the death penalty because we know it is wrong and will always be wrong. To take another human being's life in revenge, even for the most heinous of acts, is wrong. And yet we can somehow rationalise the killing of the sick and the elderly. The fact that such rationalisation is possible says enough about the inescapable weakness of human beings and our inherent unsuitability to make decisions so serious and irreversible as whether someone should live or die.


As a society, we should be asking not how to make it legal for people to be killed but how to build upon the dignity of life for all, dignity for life when it is at its hardest. I will not and cannot support this bill. Life must trump all.

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (12:35):  I rise to speak today to make a contribution to the debate on the bill introduced by Senator Leyonhjelm to this Senate chamber as a private member's bill entitled Restoring Territory Rights (Assisted Suicide Legislation) Bill 2015. I acknowledge the grief, the loss and the personal truth of every recount by senators sharing their life experiences of losing someone that they love. I respect the diversity of views that have been put respectfully on the record in the course of this debate. I have my own history, as others do, of grief and loss, and it's a lens that colours what I feel about this issue. But we're called on in this place to combine that journey of the heart with the intellectual endeavour to interrogate the legislation that comes before us, and I will endeavour to do that in my contribution.


I know that there have been many earnest contributions to this debate that, no doubt with good intent, call on us to avert our eyes from the substantive issue at the heart of this bill. Many will say, and indeed have said, that this bill is just about legislative rights of the territories. But that is only one small element of this bill. The greater, substantive, part deserves consideration. Let me say clearly that history will show that this bill is about giving territories of this nation the green light to go ahead with enacting legislation that will make it legal for physicians to terminate the lives of their patients and to assist patients to take their own lives.


I think a review of the contributions of those who will support the bill will show that, as much as they declare it is not so, they do indeed know that enabling state-sanctioned suicide in the ACT and the NT is in fact exactly what they're seeking to achieve today. The legislation that passed this parliament in the form of the Euthanasia Laws Act 1997 was about euthanasia. This bill, no matter what political magic dust may be thrown over it, is about euthanasia. But it does use the new lexicon of 'assisted suicide'. Let us also be clear that, despite its complexity, this matter of life and death will be determined by unicameral parliaments, where there is no house of review.


Senator Dodson last night made a very important contribution about the nature of the territories and the rejection of statehood by the Northern Territory. He also made important remarks about the particular vulnerability of First Nations people, who make up so much of the population of that territory.


Last year in the context of the Victorian state debate, 105 of Australia's 148 palliative medicine specialists—that's 70 per cent of the profession—wrote an open letter in which they stated that euthanasia advocates actively and deliberately undermine confidence in palliative care. At the time the vote passed the Victorian parliament, Victoria had the lowest rate of palliative medicine specialists per capita in the country. That is, in my view, instructive. It reveals that the one state that has delivered legislation to allow assisted suicide is the least well served in terms of expert palliation advice and access.


Much has been made of the pain of death in the course of this debate. I do not doubt for a moment that senators have authentically revealed their own perceptions of witnessing that pain in their own personal encounters with the death of a loved one. Indeed, I recall one day in the course of my father's dying when palliation failed him as an aggressive brain tumour progressed. He was very much in pain, and we were very much distressed. Seeing that sort of thing makes you question everything. But his palliation was adjusted, and he continued his farewell to us with very little pain over the following weeks. He reached his 49th birthday not long before he passed. That was 30 years ago. There's no doubt amongst palliation specialists that there has been a marked improvement over that time in the field of palliation. I acknowledge the powerful contributions of many senators that call attention to the need for an increase in the level of resources and the enablement of ever-improving palliation practices, including quality mental health and psychological supports that ameliorate the challenges of the journey to death.


In response to many claims about pain management made in the course of this debate, I want to make a few remarks about claims that pain management is the most pressing reason for advancing to legal assisted suicide. Just how significant is pain as a factor in the decision-making of those who actively seek assisted suicide in jurisdictions where it is currently enabled? In the Oregon public health report of 2016, of the 1,127 patients in that state who had died from ingesting a lethal dose of medication, the data revealed, somewhat surprisingly, that neither pain nor fear of pain was the main reason cited by those who sought assisted suicide. It was, in fact, some 296 of those 1,127 people—or 26.3 per cent—who indicated that pain control or concern about pain control was a factor for them.


To be fair, let me put on the record that the most often cited reason for assisted suicide in the Oregon study, at 91 per cent, was the steady loss of autonomy. Being less able to engage in activities making life enjoyable was a reason cited by 89.7 per cent. For 77 per cent, it was the loss of dignity that motivated their assisted suicide. Loss of control of bodily functions, such as incontinence and vomiting, was the reason cited by 46.8 per cent. It's important to note that the two reasons most cited by people who died by assisted suicide in Oregon reveal that it was their feelings about their lives, and their concerns about others' views of their lives, that prompted them to take action. That worries me.


Let me speak to the statistic that is of greatest concern to me—that is, the fact that, of the 1,127 people who chose assisted suicide as reported in the study in Oregon, 42.2 per cent indicated that their reason for seeking assisted suicide was concern about being a physical or emotional burden on family, friends or caregivers. It's here that I want to put on the record my recollection of attending a public meeting in the lead-up to the 2001 federal election. Labor's leader, Kim Beazley, and our candidate for the seat of Robertson, Trish Moran, arrived at Kincumber High School. It was a well-attended meeting. Many residents from the local retirement villages that surround it were in attendance. I do believe that most of the audience that evening were in favour of assisted suicide, and that was pretty clear to Mr Beazley as he was addressing them.


When he was asked the question, Mr Beazley spoke about his experience of taking evidence in hearings—and I point out that the Senate is not going to have the opportunity to do that. A young brother and sister came to the inquiry that he was part of and insisted that assisted suicide should be enabled because their mother was a perfect example of someone who was spending her children's inheritance on her health care, and they should have access to it. Mr Beazley rightly pointed out that people who want assisted suicide—people who have argued passionately for it here in this chamber—do not have a motivation of that kind at all. But those motivations do exist in our community, and we are wise to heed them as we make law for the country. We make it for all people, and we have to cover those who have malintent. Mr Beazley finished by saying, 'I don't know what kind of a mother you had but there's very little my mother wouldn't have done or given up in order to give me a better life.' I've never forgotten that.


That brings me to the very real threat of assisted suicide legislation advancing at a time in this nation when recent reports are urging us, as legislators, to give serious consideration to developing legislation, social leadership and agencies to curb increasing elder abuse—undue influence of one family member over another. Similarly, fears of the exploitation of the disabled were well articulated by Senator Steele-John last night in his contribution. I note Senator Steele-John indicated his support for the legislation, but he quite powerfully described the reality of living with disability, about which he perhaps has the greatest insight of all in this chamber. As he put it, four million Australians with disabilities are denied adequate access to the services they need and want, and violent abuse and neglect is still endemic. It is in this context, some fear, that euthanasia enters.

"Dodson, Sen Patrick",ALP,2018-08-15,"



Senator DODSON
 (Western Australia) (10:53):  At present the constitutional framework of Australia divides legislative responsibilities between the states and the Commonwealth. The states are therefore different to territories. The residents of territories are therefore subject to a different legislative process than the residents of states. Under the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, article 24.2 states:


Indigenous individuals have an equal right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. States shall take the necessary steps with a view to achieving progressively the full realization of this right.


We know that Australia's attempt to achieve the realisation of that right, through the Closing The Gap campaign, has been an abysmal failure. First Nations people do not enjoy the same quality of life in this country at every stage of their existence, as shown in the national figures. In the womb, a First Nations child is at higher risk of contracting life-threatening bloodborne diseases. Last year, six First Nations babies died of syphilis. Our children are more likely to be diagnosed with chronic health conditions such as type 2 diabetes. They are at greater risk of contracting meningococcal and rheumatic heart disease. As teenagers, they watch their friends, their cousins and their siblings prematurely end their own lives. These facts are true of the Northern Territory and nationally. In the Kimberley region, where I come from, the suicide rate is the highest in the world.


By what most Australians call middle age, many First Nations people are already living with kidney failure, without sufficient access to dialysis. The burden of disease and disability in First Nations communities is far higher than it is in the general population. First Nations people are more likely to live with a severe or profound disability. They also die younger. On a national basis, First Nations men can expect to live to an average age of 69, while non-First Nations men can expect to live to 80. First Nations women can expect to live to an average age of 73, while non-First Nations women can expect to live to 83.


All governments—state, territory and federal—have failed to enact the necessary action to close the gap. The government is currently undertaking a refresh process, with the Minister for Indigenous Affairs announcing at Garma earlier this month that some two dozen new targets would be added as part of the refresh process. That seems a drastic amount of new targets, and only emphasises how we've failed to address the health issues suffered by First Nations people to date. With so many of our people suffering complex health conditions at an early age, there is a desperate need for culturally appropriate palliative care services in regional and remote areas. A review recently commissioned by the Australian government confirmed that more needs to be done to ensure that First Nations people are receiving palliative care within their communities. Where First Nations people are already overrepresented at every stage of our health system, it is irresponsible to vote in favour of another avenue to death. Paving the way for euthanasia and assisted suicide leaves First Nations people even more vulnerable, when our focus should be on working collectively to create laws that help prolong life and restore their right to enjoy a healthy life.


During the debate on the Voluntary Assisted Dying Bill 2017 in Victoria, former Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating argued:


No matter what justifications are offered for the bill, it constitutes an unacceptable departure in our approach to human existence and the irrevocable sanctity that should govern our understanding of what it means to be human.


…   …   …


It is a mistake for legislators to act on the deeply held emotional concerns of many when that involves crossing a threshold that will affect the entire society in perpetuity.


In Yawuru we have three concepts that guide our experience of life. They shape our ways of knowing and understanding, and are the collective approach to our existence on this earth and, to that extent, any afterlife that may come. They are: mabu ngarrungu(nil), a strong community—the wellbeing of all is paramount; mabu buru, a strong place and a good country—human behaviour and needs must be balanced in their demands and needs of what creation provides; and mabu liyan, a healthy spirit and good feeling. Individual wellbeing and that of our society not only have to be balanced but be at peace with each other within the context of our existence and experience.


This concept of interconnectedness is one that transcends across many First Nations groups. It is grounded in our understanding that human resilience is based on our relationships with each other and our connectedness with the world around us. The quality of life for individuals and for our communities are intertwined, not limited to the wellbeing of an individual. We are fundamentally responsible for honouring our fellow human beings. We are called to carry responsibilities, to exercise duties and to honour those who are in need, who are ill, who are elderly, who are dependent and those of the next generation to value life with love, respect and responsibility. This is true of family members and unknown individuals. Moving away from such principles and values begins to reshape the value of human beings and our civil society, in my view.


We exist not as solitary individuals; we exist within a family, a community, our cultures and ethos, and in the kinship landscape. I'm a great admirer of those who have cared for loved ones and made personal sacrifices to do so. Not everyone is able to do this, I know, and I do not condemn them for the choices that they make. In the broad sense, we are part of a common humanity. If we give one person the right to make that decision—that is, to assist in committing suicide—we as a whole are affected. If we give one family that right, we as a whole are affected. If we give one state or territory that right, we as a country are affected. If we give one nation the right to determine life, our common humanity is affected. I cannot support this legislation.

Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania) (11:00):  I rise to make my contribution to the Restoring Territory Rights (Assisted Suicide Legislation) Bill 2015. I acknowledge the contributions made by others in this debate, regardless of their perspective. I understand fully that there are very strongly held views on this matter. I congratulate Senator Dodson on the contribution that he's just made, particularly from the perspective of the First Nations people. It was a quite profound presentation. I think it typifies the issues, particularly for the more disadvantaged in the Australian community. The bill is portrayed simply as returning rights to the territories to enable them to legislate for euthanasia. It's portrayed as being quite simple in that context and therefore, effectively, an issue of territories' rights. But one thing I have learnt in my time in this place is that, when you believe in something, you need to utilise your entire toolkit to ensure, to your best ability, that your beliefs are reflected. The reality is that, in this circumstance, the Commonwealth does retain some oversight with respect to territory law. Therefore, part of the toolkit of this place rests in that context.


I'm not a supporter of assisted dying. I understand that, as I said earlier, there are strongly held views with respect to people who view that as their right, but I can't sanction or support what I see as, effectively, state-sanctioned killing. I don't support the death penalty, so I can't support what's termed assisted suicide or euthanasia legislation. I understand perfectly the difficulties that exist for some people towards their end of life. I think we all understand that, and that's reflected very much in the way that this debate has been conducted. In that sense, I congratulate my colleagues for the sobriety of the debate and also the arguments that they've made in support of their relative perspectives. But, because I don't support assisted dying, assisted suicide, euthanasia, I can't support any legislative measure that might promote that. So I put on the record my opposition to the legislation and say that I will not be supporting this bill.

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2018-08-15,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (11:04):  I also rise to speak on the Restoring Territory Rights (Assisted Suicide Legislation) Bill 2015. I would like to place on the record my appreciation of the contributions that have been made, regardless of the positions that senators have taken on this bill. The intention of the bill before us is to undo the restrictions brought into effect by Mr Kevin Andrews's private member's bill in 1997. These restrictions limited the ability of the territories to decide for themselves how and when terminally ill people should be allowed to die. Such restrictions removed the democratic rights of territorians. I listened carefully to Senator Colbeck's contribution, and I can understand where he's coming from. But I do disagree that we should use the powers that we have as a federal parliament to take away the right of territorians to decide matters that they would normally be able to decide for themselves. The territories should have the same opportunities that the states have in Australia.


For those who don't support assisted dying, I understand that position. It is a difficult issue for many, and unfortunately there are many in this parliament who have had loved ones who have gone through agonisingly painful deaths. I have myself, and there are many others in this parliament who have witnessed their loved ones passing away in those conditions. It's not easy to see your loved ones passing away, especially when they do so in such pain and with a wish to die with dignity and in the manner they wish to. This is denied of many Australians. It is very hard to then come in here and have a position where we will not allow territorians the same right to debate the issue within their communities and in their parliament and to decide to legislate for it or not. But for a federal parliament to come over the top of the rights of that community, to even have that debate—I don't think we should be supporting that.


I had the opportunity to listen to a couple of contributions made last night on this bill. Both Senator Catryna Bilyk and Senator Claire Moore talked about good palliative care, and I absolutely agree with the content of their statements. Senator Bilyk said:


Having good palliative care available is not a reason to deny the option of assisted dying. Similarly, providing patients with the option of assisted dying is not a reason to ignore the need to invest in quality palliative care.


Senator Moore's contribution went to the very heart of investment in palliative care. I think we do have across-the-board support from senators and members in this place for investing in palliative care, but the action isn't there. There is not enough investment in palliative care, and both those contributions articulated the need for this investment.


But, as I was saying, restrictions that were placed on the territorians not only removed the democratic rights of territorians to create their laws for themselves but overturned properly constituted legislation. They also prevent legislators from having that debate, despite such laws—in the case of the Northern Territory—having already been passed.


The people of Australia overwhelmingly support the freedom of terminally ill Australians to decide on this matter. Approximately 75 per cent of Australians polled answered that the terminally ill should be able to legally end their lives with medical assistance. This is a very sensitive subject, and opinions are sincerely and strongly held on this matter. Many feel that Australians deserve the right to choose to die with dignity and that euthanasia is the most effective way of safeguarding this. Others, however, have closely held religious or personal beliefs which mean that they oppose euthanasia. I personally believe that there are, unfortunately, some people living with terminal illness for whom there is no other way to avoid suffering than dying with dignity. That is why voluntary euthanasia laws have been adopted in parts of Europe and the USA and, of course, in the state of Victoria.


Regardless of your position on euthanasia, it is clear that a single private member's bill removed the right for territorians to do so. The legislation was passed over two decades ago. To me, this is a matter of local representation and the right of citizens to elect, at a local level, people who can legislate on territory matters that they are legally able to. As many senators have said in their contributions, just because the federal parliament doesn't like what a state or territory does, that isn't sufficient justification to trample over its right to do it.


Critically, this bill reinstates the rights of territorians. It allows local representatives in the ACT and the NT to legislate for themselves. It goes to the very heart of our federal system. We live under the federal system of government, where state and territory parliaments are ordinarily allowed to debate and legislate these matters for themselves, and this is the system that we seek to uphold in this legislation that we are debating here today.


Recently, the Victorian parliament passed legislation to see voluntary euthanasia legalised. This is a path that the Northern Territory had followed as well, over 20 years ago. But, regardless of their legislative ends, what both the ACT and the NT governments want is the right to decide for themselves. This is something that they have called for—they put a full-page ad in The Australian—and it is something that other states are afforded. The right to decide for themselves, through their elected representatives, in these jurisdictions is something that I believe all territorians deserve.


As the architect of Victoria's assisted dying bill, Professor Brian Owler, suggested, discussions should be had at a national, state and territory level in order to ensure that the needs of Australians at all levels are met. As a medical doctor and former head of the Australian Medical Association, Professor Owler is well placed to comment on the needs of the terminally ill. He chaired an independent panel on the matter that provided 66 recommendations to the government on assisted dying.


I believe it is our duty as elected officials to consider the advice of experts on such matters and to respond to the needs of the terminally ill in the light of the recommendations of an expert such as Professor Owler. Now is the time to listen. It is the time to signal a willingness to participate in local grassroots democracy and to allow territorians to decide for themselves whether euthanasia most appropriately meets their needs.


This bill brings together a coalition of parties; it brings together a coalition of viewpoints. The Labor Party is holding a conscience vote on the matter, as indeed is the Liberal Party. I and some of my Labor colleagues would have differing views and opinions as to whether or not voluntary euthanasia should be legislated. But I sincerely believe that, fundamentally, that is not what is being considered here. What is up for consideration is whether or not people living in the ACT and the NT should be allowed to vote for themselves on voluntary euthanasia. This is a question of democratic enfranchisement and it is a matter that has been removed from Territorians for far too long. I am proud to support this bill and to recommend to all senators to vote for this bill, so that we can allow states and territories to have an equal say through their parliaments on whether the terminally ill should have the right to die with dignity.

"Farrell, Sen Don",ALP,2018-08-15,"



Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (11:15):  I rise to speak on the Restoring Territory Rights (Assisted Suicide Legislation) Bill 2015. I would like to start by recognising that many, if not all, in this place, and those watching will have experienced the suffering and the loss of someone dear to them. It's natural to be saddened by a loved one's suffering and passing, and it's natural to want to help to ease their pain. I think we all understand that it is a very sensitive issue and a very personal one. This debate will no doubt be a difficult and emotional one for many of us. In recognition of that, I hope this will continue to be a debate that is conducted respectfully and with the awareness of the emotions it will no doubt bring for many of us.


This bill does not of itself legalise assisted suicide and euthanasia. But it's very clear from its title, Restoring Territory Rights (Assisted Suicide Legislation) Bill 2015, and from Senator Leyonhjelm's public comments, that this bill's objective is to pave the way for the legalisation of assisted suicide. That's why it is important that this bill, as it should be, is being treated as a conscience issue. Speaking on the bill today, I'd like to address two main points: firstly, the core issue of the conscience matter, of assisted suicide; secondly, the circumstances that have brought us to this debate today. As I've just outlined, the bill's core objective is to facilitate the legalisation of assisted suicide, so I do not intend to address the issue of territory rights, other than to say that this is one of many issues in which the Commonwealth has sought to regulate the territories.


It is, however, the issue at the heart of the bill that I wish to address—assisted suicide. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, the suffering and passing of loved ones is something that most, if not all, of us in this place are likely to have experienced. We're all acutely aware that with life comes death. Obviously it's an extreme emotional experience and it is human nature for our emotions to influence our thoughts on such matters. I'm sure everyone in this place can sympathise with those who have had to witness and deal with loved ones towards the ends of their lives. While I expect much debate on this issue will focus on details, as has been the case with previous debates in state parliaments, my view is that we must not avoid addressing the fundamental realities of assisted suicide.


Paving the way for the legalisation of assisted dying would be an irreversible step over a major ethical threshold. As a society, we should give very serious consideration to the potential impacts of taking such a step—as former Prime Minister Paul Keating described—as abandoning the golden principles. It's also pointed out in typically blunt fashion what is proposed when we talk about euthanasia or assisted dying, which, in his words, would be 'permitting physicians to intentionally kill patients or assisting patients in killing themselves'. Unsurprisingly, whilst there is a range of views within the medical profession, as there is in society in general, the Australian Medical Association has serious concerns. The Australian Medical Association is against the legalisation of euthanasia and assisted suicide. In its position statement on the issue, the AMA says:


The AMA believes that doctors should not be involved in interventions that have as their primary intention the ending of a person's life.


It's my view that governments, too, should not be involved in interventions that have as their primary intention the ending of a person's life.


The comments of Paul Keating that I referred to earlier come from a piece he wrote following the approval by the Victorian lower house of the Voluntary Assisted Dying Bill 2017. That piece by the former Prime Minister summed up the key issues very succinctly. In that piece, he said:


… the advocates support a bill to authorise termination of life in the name of compassion, while at the same time claiming they can guarantee protection of the vulnerable, the depressed and the poor.


No law and no process can achieve that objective. This is the point. If there are doctors prepared to bend the rules now, there will be doctors prepared to bend the rules under the new system.


He goes on to say that his opposition to the Victorian bill was not about religion, and that his concerns were shared by people of any religion and no religion; it is the principles that matter in public life. He says of those principles:


They define the norms and values of a society and in this case the principles concern our view of human life itself. It is a mistake for legislators to act on the deeply held emotional concerns of many when that involves crossing a threshold that will affect the entire society in perpetuity.


This is an emotional issue, but we must not let emotion cloud fact. It's also an issue of conscience, and for some people, that conscience may be informed by their faith. But, at its core, as Paul Keating alluded, it's an issue of principles—the ethics rather than the morals.


This is the point that former South Australian Attorney-General Michael Atkinson also made during a debate on this issue in the South Australian parliament. He said:


If my opposition to AVE is based on ancient wisdom, it is not that of Jesus of Nazareth but Hippocrates of Kos, who lived some 350 years before.


He was of course referring to the Hippocratic oath, that well-known early expression of medical ethics, the principles of which remain of significance today. I'm told that one of the earliest surviving copies of the Hippocratic oath includes the words:


I will use treatment to help the sick according to my ability and judgment, but never with a view to injury and wrong-doing. Neither will I administer a poison to anybody when asked to do so, nor will I suggest such a course.


In Australia, the modern expression of medical ethics is in the Australian Medical Association's code of medical ethics. I would like to read from the section of the code that deals directly with assisted suicide. The AMA's code of ethics says:


It is understandable, though tragic, that some patients in extreme duress—such as those suffering from a terminal, painful, debilitating illness—may come to decide that death is preferable to life. However, permitting physicians to engage in assisted suicide would ultimately cause more harm than good.


Physician-assisted suicide is fundamentally incompatible with the physician's role as healer, would be difficult or impossible to control, and would pose serious societal risks.


Instead of engaging in assisted suicide, physicians must aggressively respond to the needs of patients at the end of life. Physicians:


(a) Should not abandon a patient once it is determined that cure is impossible.


(b) Must respect patient autonomy.


(c) Must provide good communication and emotional support.


(d) Must provide appropriate comfort care and adequate pain control.


The section on euthanasia is similar but goes even further, warning that the practice would be 'difficult or impossible to control, would pose serious societal risks' and could readily be extended to incompetent patients and vulnerable populations.


Advocates of assisted suicide often highlight patient autonomy as a reason. But, in the broader context of the code, that point refers to things like a patient's right to decline medical intervention or to ask that intervention be stopped, even when that decision is expected to lead to his or her death. Indeed, the code makes it very clear that respect for a patient's autonomy does not extend to providing for assisted suicide or euthanasia. It's important to note that the Australian Medical Association's code of medical ethics warns that assisted suicide and euthanasia would be difficult or impossible to control and could be extended to patients for whom these practices are not intended.


In recent days, I've seen reports that question the idea that paving the way for assisted dying would be a slippery slope. But I've also read with concern the comments of Australian bioethics professor Margaret Somerville reported in The Sydney Morning Herald yesterday. The Sydney Morning Herald reports that Professor Somerville, who has spent decades observing euthanasia in Canada, has said that the international experience demonstrated that 'euthanasia was being used as a cheaper alternative to psychiatric and palliative care'. The professor is quoted as saying that it would be a 'societal tragedy if we allow this', and I agree with her. The article goes on to say that, in a paper published in the Journal of Palliative Care, Professor Somerville and nine of her international counterparts argued that voluntary assisted dying has gone beyond the aims of relieving pain and suffering and is now being misused.


What is very concerning is that Professor Somerville says that assurance by the 'proponents of euthanasia that it would not lead to a slippery slope have been proven wrong, with research showing that safeguards are routinely violated.' The professor was quoted in the article as saying:


In one study in Belgium, they surveyed doctors and found that 32 per cent had gone outside of the regulations.


That should ring huge alarm bells for anybody, because it implies that not only have safeguards failed through human error but also that some doctors may be choosing to ignore them. Professor Somerville also says:



… in many cases, pain and suffering were not the primary motivator for an assisted suicide request, with a fear of being a burden on relatives a more common reason in patient surveys.



She has also argued that 'in most cases pain or discomfort could be remedied through proper palliative care'. I'm sure many in this place have personal experience of loved ones who, approaching the end of their lives, have struggled with the idea they may be a burden on their families. This is not a belief that should be encouraged through the provision of legalising assisted dying.


In the course of the broader debate on this issue across the nation, we've heard stories of people whose personal feelings on the issue of assisted dying and euthanasia have changed when they've been approaching their own end of life. A decision to make use of assisted dying made while a person is suffering and at a low point and may believe themselves to be a burden cannot later be undone. Some in favour of assisted dying argue that we can never achieve safeguards in any area of the law that work 100 per cent of the time, but the very obvious difference in this case is that the failure of the safeguards can result in death, a failure that is irreversible. The report I mentioned earlier—that 32 per cent of surveyed doctors in Belgium had gone outside the relevant assisted dying guidelines in that jurisdiction—only adds to these concerns.


Outside of debate on this issue, we've also heard many sad stories of elder abuse. Unfortunately, there are those who would seek to exploit vulnerable people who are terminally ill and suffering. Under the model proposed in Victoria, patients would have to administer the lethal drug themselves. What safeguards can ensure that once those drugs are provided, they will not be misused by others? I'm not insensitive to the hurt that can be caused by seeing a loved one in pain and suffering, but there is no way to provide adequate safeguards against the extension, misuse or abuse of legalising assisted dying.


It is not acceptable to put people at risk of dying against their wishes, be it through accident or malicious intent, when we can address the problems of pain and suffering through better provision of palliative care. We know it's common for patients to say that they don't want to be a burden on their families, but we must not legislate in ways that are likely to make the chronically ill, elderly, disabled or dying feel they are a burden. It is society's duty to provide appropriate health care to those who need it, not to devalue lives by classifying groups of people as less worthy of living because they meet an arbitrary set of criteria that make them eligible to seek assisted death.


Having made my position on the real objective of this bill clear, I'd like to now talk about how we got to this point. Malcolm Turnbull brought this bill on for debate this week in exchange for Senator Leyonhjelm's support for the re-establishment of the Australian Building Construction Commission. The democratic rights of workers in the building and construction industry were sold out so that this bill could be debated. The Law Council said this about the ABCC bill:


… a number of features of the bill are contrary to rule of law principles and traditional common law rights and privileges.



Dr Nicola McGarrity and Professor George Williams from the faculty of law at the University of New South Wales said:


… the ABC Commissioner's investigatory powers have the potential to severely restrict basic democratic rights such as freedom of speech, freedom of association, the privilege against self-incrimination and the right to silence.


Senator Leyonhjelm says that the Prime Minister gave him a guarantee that Liberals would be given a free vote on the bill and that it would proceed for consideration in the lower house. Former Prime Minister Tony Abbott reckons that deals like this one are wrong and says that Malcolm Turnbull has ignored proper internal process. Mr Abbott told 2GB:


I am a little worried about secret deals and I am a little worried that undertakings might have been made which weren't brought to the party room and the prime minister likes to talk about due process—I am very concerned about lack of due process.


On this, I agree with Mr Abbott. In other words, this bill is tainted.


To sum up, I oppose this bill because, at its heart, it's about facilitating assisted suicide. I oppose assisted suicide because I don't think any safeguards could guarantee the protection of the lives of the vulnerable. I oppose assisted suicide and euthanasia because experts, including the Australian Medical Association, have warned that it will be difficult if not impossible to control and is the wrong way to deal with the issue of pain and suffering. I cannot support something that I believe will ultimately lead to people dying against their wishes. I would like to again quote former Prime Minister Paul Keating, who said on Victoria's assisted dying bill:


Once this bill is passed the expectations of patients and families will change. The culture of dying, despite certain and intense resistance, will gradually permeate into our medical, health, social and institutional arrangements. It stands for everything a truly civil society should stand against.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",AC,2018-08-15,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (11:34):  I rise today with the intention of detailing two important principles that have led me to oppose the Restoring Territory Rights (Assisted Suicide Legislation) Bill 2015. Senator Farrell quite rightly raises an important third principle, and that is the principle of doing dirty deals in order to achieve particular outcomes. I say 'dirty deals' because I can't think of anything worse than trading off a life-and-death issue in favour of a political outcome against the wishes or knowledge of your own party room. It is, I think, a gross misuse of process. It is deeply disturbing not only that Senator Leyonhjelm maintains that the Prime Minister promised a vote in the House of Representatives—and promised to facilitate that—but also that the Prime Minister himself denies it. If you can't believe a Prime Minister or a senator, it brings this entire process and this parliament into some element of question. I have enormous reservation about how we come to this point, because I believe there are many more important and critical issues that need to be resolved in this country than whether the Northern Territory and the ACT should have the right to legislate for state-sanctioned killing.


That brings me to my first point. The Commonwealth Constitution makes it very clear that the states have certain rights and responsibilities and the Commonwealth has certain rights and responsibilities. One of those responsibilities applies to the territories. We have the right to make laws that affect the territories and will overturn their own laws—that will disallow them, if I can put it like that. Such an event took place in 1997 with the passage of the Andrews bill, which prevented the Northern Territory from having a state-assisted suicide regime. It's a regime, I might remind you, that was endorsed by, I regret to say, a neighbour of mine—when I say 'neighbour', I mean he lived in the neighbourhood that I lived in and I used to see him at the coffee shop, but we didn't mix very much—the disgraced Dr Nitschke, who was quite happily putting to death people who didn't have a terminal illness but just got sick of living. This is the same Dr Nitschke that professes to have a brewery now so he can import lethal gas and sell lethal suicide kits over the internet, or whatever it does. It makes me ill to think of how this callous man, in the name of compassion, likes to exploit the vulnerabilities of people, who perhaps need assistance, and put them to death rather than help them to enjoy life.


Nonetheless, we know the Northern Territory assisted suicide regime was misused. We know that. We also know that the states have the role and the responsibility to introduce assisted suicide regimes if they want to. We've seen that happen in Victoria. I don't agree with that either, but it is entirely within the remit of the Victorian parliament to make that determination. If you want to change it, you should elect different people. But the territories are not states. If you look at the population of the Northern Territory, it's 200,000 people. It's got a large land mass and it's had a series of relatively dysfunctional governments but, in terms of population, it's not even the size of a number of South-East Queensland councils. It wants states' rights, yet it has none of the responsibilities, or the ability to take responsibility, for some of the processes that go along with that. A case in point is the misuse of the assisted dying legislation that they introduced. Importantly—I'm interested in this—they voted against becoming a state. They actually voted against becoming a state, because they themselves knew that they weren't capable of taking on that responsibility.


In the ACT, it's even worse. If you want to give the ACT states' rights and if you want to empower it to make euthanasia legislation, the ACT is the most left-leaning government, if you can call it that—it's a council administrator—anywhere in the country. If you were to question how it will end up should you empower the ACT with euthanasia legislation or state-assisted dying legislation, look no further than what is happening in some of the most radical regimes around the world. These are the figures from a chap called Paul Russell, another South Australian, who's got the HOPE initiative.


In Belgium, three children have been put to death under euthanasia laws. They were aged 17, 11 and nine. How are those safeguards looking now? Seventy-seven people have been killed because of mental disorders and behaviour. That is the sixth most common reason for doctor-assisted suicide in that country. Think about that for a moment. Once you break the taboo that it's all right to help someone kill themselves, the only question is: what should be the limiting factors? If someone no longer wants to live, who are you to deny their right to kill themselves? It brings into question: why do we have suicide prevention things? Why do we have mental health support services? Why do we talk about the tragedy of farmers who contemplate this final act out of desperation? Supporting legalised, state-sanctioned assisted suicide is to say, 'We no longer value your worth at any level.' Just because someone has a temporary mental health disorder, just because someone is suffering from depression or just because someone feels they no longer want to live is not justification to support them in ending their own life. Quite the contrary: we should be looking to assist them.


What would you say if it were a 17-year-old? Perhaps you'd argue they don't have legal standing, that they're a minor, and so someone else should be able to make that decision for them. What if they're 18? They're an adult. They can go off to war and they can do a whole range of things. If it's okay for an 80-year-old to say, 'I want my doctor to kill me,' why can't an 18-year-old or a 28-year-old or a 38-year-old? That is the important principle here. To all the people who say, 'I've got the right to end my own life when I can,' where are you going to end that? In Belgium, we know a 17-year-old, an 11-year-old and a nine-year-old—all children—have been killed under this. Seventy-seven people have been killed because they had a mental disorder. I'm sure they were making a full and frank decision for themselves and the checks and balances had gone on there! In Belgium, more than half of the suicides occur within just three months of the request being made. They can just go to their doctor and a three-month process takes place for more than half of them. We also know that, in places like the United States where assisted suicide regimes are in place, there's actually been an increase in the number of suicides. Doesn't it fly counter to everything that we profess to value in the human dignity, in the innate worth, of every individual? We're now encouraging them to take their own lives because that's what they feel like doing. It's the ultimate in liberalism or in libertarianism, except it has a profound effect on so many others as well.


The suicide rate in the US, where it's been legal, has increased in the over-65s by 14½ per cent. There is the impact on other people. About a fifth of family members who actually witnessed an assisted suicide in places like Switzerland subsequently formed a post-traumatic stress disorder—another mental health issue, if I can couch it like that, which could be used to justify them ending their own life too. It truly is a slippery slope. It is a ride from which society cannot return, as soon as you start to measure someone's worth by whether they want to live.


Then there's the argument, of course, about pain. People, quite compassionately, understand and argue that, in insufferable pain, they should be able to choose to end their lives to prevent that. Palliative Care Victoria states that, in rare cases where all methods of palliation for pain and other symptoms fail, palliative sedation therapy is available to provide adequate relief from suffering. If we can accept that we can mitigate or limit this insufferable pain, the reality is that the justification used for assisted suicide is not actually about the pain itself but concern about the person in pain becoming a burden. In Oregon in the US, assisted suicide occurs primarily due to a loss of autonomy, for life being less enjoyable than you want it to be—for incontinence, for example, or for feeling like you are a burden on your family, your friends, your caregivers.


In this country we've had a recent debate and discussion about elder abuse, and quite rightly so. We are seeing ads on buses and elsewhere all around the nation, telling older Australians that, if they're being exploited, beaten or otherwise abused, they should call the hotline. The best statistics I could identify were that between 2½ and five per cent of the older demographic may be vulnerable to elder abuse. What more abusive thing can there be than a manipulative family member or person outside of the family but close to the elderly person, applying pressure—you can call it abuse if you like—that they should end their own lives to stop them being a burden, to relieve those around them of the pain and suffering of having to care for a loved one who is no longer able to care for themselves? It's entirely likely that those events and circumstances would occur. Encourage the elder to move on, whether you are a religious person or not, from the earthly cares, the mortality of this world. It's likely it might be a carer at their wit's end who is more likely seeking to be relieved of the burden of care and placing that guilt trip upon the person they care for.


We also know that, in Oregon, half of those who took lethal medicine under their assisted suicide regime cited that they were concerned about being a burden on their family and caregivers. We also know that around 79 per cent of those in Oregon took the lethal dose without a physician present. The question is: who did administer it? Who provided those checks and balances? Nobody really knows if it was self-administered or not. Surely, if someone's had permission and been provided the wherewithal to end their own life, but they do it without a physician being present, they're vulnerable to someone else doing it, perhaps without their knowledge.


Senator Abetz has quite rightly raised this in an earlier speech, and Senator Colbeck described this as state-sanctioned killing. It's a term that is equally as applicable to capital punishment as it is to assisted suicide. For those who say, 'We know this is very popular, because the polls will say it's very popular,' let me tell you that the death penalty is pretty popular in this country too if you ask the polls. If you say, 'Should we implement that?' they'll say yes, but it's still morally wrong. It's still the wrong thing to do. You'd ask yourself, 'What happens if the Northern Territory wanted to introduce the death penalty?' Do we say that's their right to do that, because we should take a hands-off approach to what is good for this country in the longer term or because it's popular?


Populism is not an excuse for doing something, particularly when it's going to have implications that will be felt for generations and, as Senator Farrell quite rightly pointed out, affects the life and death of individuals and affects deeply the lives of those around those individuals.


I note that one assisted suicide proponent, a neurosurgeon named Henry Marsh, said:


Even if a few grannies get bullied into it, isn't that the price worth praying for all the people who could die with dignity?


Let me repeat that:


Even if a few grannies get bullied into it, isn't that the price worth paying for all the people who could die with dignity?


The reality is, if you vote in favour of this, you are justifying that sort of comment. You are justifying the fact that maybe a couple of people will get bullied into killing themselves, because that's the price you're prepared to pay, or you're prepared for others to pay, for the cliche slogan 'to die with dignity'.


I make the point that Nembutal, the drug of choice for many suicide advocates, is the same drug used in executions. It's the same drug that massive concerns have been raised about in those countries that have the death penalty, because the drug can cause not only death but also a huge amount of pain along the way. We know that in 10 per cent of cases in the Netherlands, where this drug was used, it took longer than the expected median of three hours for the person to die after taking this drug. In one case, it took the person seven days to die. We know that people are concerned about the pain inflicted upon executed prisoners in the States because they haven't been adequately anaesthetised before taking the drug. Where state-sanctioned killing is allowed with the death penalty, and where it is the same drug as that advocated by some of the proponents of state-sanctioned suicide in this country, they can't even get it right. But, somehow, we think we're going to make all the difference and the problems that have afflicted the rest of the world, where these regimes have been impacted, are somehow not going to occur here.


I put to the Senate that there are many, many reasons why common sense prevailed on this question in 1997. It must prevail again. If the territories want to self-govern in this way, let them put it to a referendum on them becoming states. I know the Northern Territory rejected it. I can't see any justification for the Australian Capital Territory becoming a state—I can only imagine the 12 senators they would elect to this place. Rights come with responsibilities. It's not a party on the parents' purse strings. They need to stand on their own two feet, if that's what they want to do, but right now we have to help them to their feet. We have to guide them in the manner that our Constitution allows, because we have to do the right thing here. We can't fall for trendy cliches and slogans. We've got to think through the consequences of every single action that we take. These consequences were thought through in 1997 with the Andrews bill. To repeal that bill would be a retrograde step, because there is no evidence whatsoever, anywhere around the world, that a regime like the one that is proposed to be introduced or allowed can function sustainably with the adequate safeguards that everyone assures us would be different in Australia.

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2018-08-15,"



Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (11:53):  Wow, what a debate this has been. It's been a very, very interesting debate with lots of passion and lots of people who have welded ideologies. I have a great deal of respect for all of the views that have been put in this place. We should remind ourselves what this place is about. We call this the 'states house'. A long time ago we had Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania and 12 senators were provided as part of the founding fathers' decision in our Constitution to ensure that the states were dealt with equally—that no one state should be discriminated against. I'm actually from a state called the Northern Territory. I don't have statehood per se, but I'm here. On this whole notion of this debate being about ensuring that the states are treated equally, I have to say that I've been a little disappointed that many senators seem to have missed the point. I'll try to bring them back to that point. Fundamentally, it shouldn't matter where you live, in what jurisdiction, this place is a place that ensures that you are treated equally.


We're talking now about restoration. In fact, the legislation is called the Restoring Territory Rights (Assisted Suicide Legislation) Bill 2015. In 1995 the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act was voted for in the Northern Territory parliament, a parliament that was properly constituted and democratically elected, in exactly the same way as in every other jurisdiction—in exactly the same way as Western Australia, Queensland, Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory; their parliaments are constituted in very much the same way. There was a proper debate that went on and there were committees of inquiry. As you would imagine, it was highly controversial. It hadn't happened in Australia before. There was a lot of focus on the process. On 25 May, the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly voted 15 for and 10 against. The act didn't enter into force until 1 July 1996, and, in the period of time in which it was in force, four people accessed the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act to assist their passing.


For all of that to have happened, you have to look at the legitimacy of how that came about. It came about because of the Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act, which was passed on 22 June 1978. The Territorians were then able to 'make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Territory' where the laws related to any matter not controlled by the Commonwealth. That's not inconsistent with other jurisdictions; it's completely the same as the other states, exactly the same. The sorts of things that these laws dealt with were schools, hospitals, utilities, public transport, forests, police, prisons, community services, roads and rail—all of the things that would be dealt with by a state or territory jurisdiction. Nothing too controversial there. We all accept that's exactly as it should be. When the self-government act came out, we all felt equal. We weren't mendicants to the South Australian government or like some backyard nobody could afford. We were a jurisdiction unto ourselves. We had the capacity to raise funds and to do the same things as every state and territory did.


We always understood, as Territorians, that there were some matters that were proscribed as 'matters controlled by the Commonwealth'. Same-sex marriage, for example, has come up. The Australian Capital Territory tried to raise same-sex marriage, but the Constitution said, 'Look, the High Court has struck it down.' Eventually the Commonwealth said, 'Well, it is our responsibility,' and this place recently passed laws on same-sex marriage, which the states and territories had thus far been prevented from doing constitutionally and by the courts. We respected that.


But one thing I want to say about the debate today and over the last few days is that it's been a bit of a Clayton's debate, because we all know that this isn't within the ambit of the Commonwealth government. This is not a matter in the Constitution that we can deal with. We know, in fact, that it's been dealt with by state jurisdictions and will be dealt with by other jurisdictions from time to time—most recently, the legislation was passed in Victoria; legislation was recently defeated in New South Wales—as appropriate. That's entirely a matter for those jurisdictions. But, unlike those jurisdictions, the Northern Territory was a function of the Kevin Andrews bill, the Euthanasia Laws Act 1997. That bill effectively said: the self-government of all territories—there was no mischief in the ACT; no-one was trying to pass laws about euthanasia in the ACT, but we'll throw them in anyway, to make some sort of consistency—will be revoked so as to prevent them from passing laws on euthanasia. They are quite entitled, as jurisdictions, to pass laws on euthanasia. But, because we as a territory are slightly different, we could pass a private member's bill that would not have stood a chance in hell of getting up in New South Wales or Victoria—or of overturning any of those—and no attempt has been made to control those jurisdictions because of their rights under the Constitution. That bill passed through this place on the 27 March 1997 with a vote of 38 noes versus 33 ayes. So 38 people said, 'No, we want to deal with the matter of euthanasia in the Northern Territory.' I understand that, at that stage, it was a reality and it was an opportunity for people whose fundamental beliefs about euthanasia were probably more impacted than those of the Northern Territory.


But euthanasia is not a matter for us, and that's why I have indicated that, despite plenty of passion and plenty of smarts around this place, it's a bit of a Clayton's debate. I can tell you right now there would be a different sense in this place if we were debating euthanasia as a national piece of legislation. The place would be full of media, there would be people running around, and the back rooms would be full of people, ringing and cajoling. But it hasn't been like that because we know it's not going to change anything about euthanasia nationally—we are not doing anything federally—and it's not within our ambit constitutionally.


I heard there's broad agreement that restoring territory rights legislation is really not going to be impacted. So the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act is not going to be impacted if we pass this legislation. Some legal opinion submitted to the Senate Standing Committees on Legal and Constitutional Affairs inquiry into the Rights of the Terminally Ill (Euthanasia Laws Repeal) Bill 2008 said:


However, there is significant judicial and academic opinion which suggests that laws made by territory legislatures are not merely suspended or dormant for the duration of any inconsistent Commonwealth law and then enter back into force upon its removal …


The authors concluded:


… there are strong grounds for suggesting that item 2 of Schedule 1 is insufficient to revive the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995 (NT). The rights of individuals and interests at stake are too important to allow uncertainty on this score.


Another submission raised concerns that an attempt to revive the bill would:


… provide the basis for an argument that the [NT RTI] Act would be invested with a Federal character that it did not possess prior to the commencement of the Euthanasia Laws Act 1997 (Cth) or would not possess following the mere repeal of that Act. There is a real danger of the Act becoming entrenched and thus leaving the Assembly powerless to amend or repeal it …


In a sense, because it had this Commonwealth flavour.


Professor George Williams of the Gilbert and Tobin Centre told the committee:


… instead of the Northern Territory law being revived, the Legislative Assembly there and in the other territories would be able to pass a new law, should they so wish—


and they should be allowed to do so—


I think that is appropriate given the principles of democracy involved, given the time that has elapsed and also given the constitutional issues [rather] than to attempt to revive something that may not be possible to do and it would certainly be inappropriate to leave practitioners and others in a situation where they may be unclear as to the legality of their actions.


All subsequent federal bills to restore territory powers including the current bill have made it clear they do not attempt to revive the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act.


What remains for us if this is not a matter within the ambit of the Commonwealth or the Senate to decide on? It's not about euthanasia. I haven't talked about my issues with euthanasia and I shouldn't because it is not my right to do so; it is the right of states and territories to deal with that matter, and that is clear in the Constitution. So what remains? This debate is clearly not about euthanasia. The only issue remaining is the territories' rights to make laws that are not controlled by the Commonwealth in the Constitution.


It's been quite a disturbing process. Spatially, by dint of history, if you happen to live here in the Australian Capital Territory or you happen to live in the glorious Northern Territory, you are now a different class of citizen. You don't have the same rights to decide what you want as does every other jurisdiction. In this place, in the Senate, to choose to ignore that fundamental, I find very difficult to swallow.


I've heard so much about equality in this place: 'We're all equal in this place, and we've really got to look after equality.' But this is an opportunity to right the wrong of 27 March 1997, where every person who lived in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory became a different class of Australian. Are we equal? Well, sort of. We're equal unless the Commonwealth decides that we are not.


This is not a debate about euthanasia. Clearly, it should not be a debate about euthanasia, although I acknowledge and respect those people with strongly held views on those matters. This is only about state rights. I'm not sure why the people who enjoy living in a state don't trust me and don't trust territorians to democratically elect people who will make decisions in the same way as everybody else does in Victoria and New South Wales, Tasmania, Western Australia or Queensland—in exactly the same way. But we can't be trusted! People have said, 'Oh, look, the Northern Territory didn't become a state when it wanted to become a state.' Let me tell you: we had a constitutional referendum about statehood, and it failed because people didn't understand what we were about to get.


But can you imagine, even if it had passed, people coming into this place and saying, 'Thanks very much, and where are our extra 10 senators?' What a bloody joke that would be, because this place, I can tell you, after what I've heard over the last few days, is not a place of equity. It's not a place that respects everybody who lives in this country. For those people who are voting this down, I genuinely respect their views on the fundamentals of euthanasia, but that is a Clayton's debate. That is a Trojan Horse that just doesn't cut it.


There's an opportunity today to put right something that went wrong on 27 March 1997. Territorians for 19 years were okay. Territorians for 19 years were okay to get on with their own business because it was consistent with some of the views of people in the Commonwealth government. But, on the day it wasn't, they sent a clear signal—and to the ACT, who hadn't had the temerity to introduce legislation of their own. Even they would be caught up because it would somehow be consistent. What a lot of rubbish!


Nobody in this debate needs to be anything but absolutely clear about what this is about. This is about entrenching two types of citizens in this country, one who comes from a territory and the other who comes from the Commonwealth. And I can tell you that introducing 20 new senators in this place is not going to happen in my bloody lifetime. So the notion of, 'Oh, why don't you just become states, and then you'll be the same as us,' is complete garbage. There were those glorious 19 years when we were treated as equals around this country. There's an opportunity today to ensure that we are returned just simply to being equals. Territorians aren't asking for any more than that. We are simply asking in this place, in this house, to be treated as equals.

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2018-08-15,"



Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (12:08):  I rise to speak on the Restoring Territory Rights (Assisted Suicide Legislation) Bill 2015. It may be argued that the only question being asked of us within this bill is whether the federal parliament should permit the territories to legislate in this space. However, I believe that this is a misguided view and that it is not the only question being asked of us here. The broader purpose of this bill is to allow the territories the legal right to legislate for euthanasia and assisted suicide. But firstly I want to address that question briefly.


Under the Constitution, territories have a different status to states. Territories are not provided the same rights and responsibilities. Our founders did this for a reason. The Australian parliament is provided the right under the Constitution to make laws for the territories. We need to have a broader discussion about the rights of territories in comparison to states and their place in our federation.


The law dictates that government must protect all individuals and govern in the interest of all Australians, and the previous speaker said we have no right to have this debate. Well I believe, even though we can't legislate for assisted suicide and euthanasia, we do have a right, as Commonwealth senators and as members in the other place, to put on record our views in relation to the issue. We exist as a parliament to provide for good government and to protect the most vulnerable at all cost.


Let's not forget why this bill is here, being debated right now. The answer is because Malcolm Turnbull, the Prime Minister, is willing to horse trade on such legislation. This is legislation that is so important to those who support the rights of the territories and to those of us who are ensuring that we put on record our view in relation to assisted suicide. But he is prepared to horse trade on this sort of legislation to ensure he stays Prime Minister of this country—although Senator Leyonhjelm, who is the one that the deal was made with, has said the Prime Minister has reneged on that commitment.


The question for this parliament and the broader community is: should we be giving doctors, or anyone else for that matter, the right in law to end the life of another person? And if we do, how do these laws affect society over time? The issue of voluntary euthanasia affects the entire community, and our emotions through lived experiences with our own loved ones often hamper the ability for reasoned debate on this issue, which is why this subject deserves the time of this place for a considered and lengthy debate. The issue of voluntary euthanasia and assisted suicide is one of the most emotional, challenging issues that politicians, whether it's at a Commonwealth level or at a state or territory level, will have to deal with.


Social regulatory policy, which acts to make a considered change in the way we view life and death, deserves the most serious of considerations, and should not merely be rushed through under the guise of territory rights. Legislation that allows a third party to end or to assist in the ending of another person's life is, without question, the most difficult space to legislate. For the state to codify in law circumstances to authorise the ending of a human life may be viewed as an impossibility because of the inability to ensure it's not abused. Let's be clear here: this is not a legislative space that allows for individual freedom or autonomy; it is actually outsourcing individual freedom to the state and a third party.


This is my major concern: I don't believe that it can be safely legislated. And once we legislate in this space and we end the lives of people within the community, it will erode the value and importance we place on life. We enter this place to make assessments and form judgements about our respective states, territories and fellow Australians. We must take that responsibility with the honour and humility it deserves. We must be acutely aware of the fact that our decisions are not binding for all time, and can be amended. Such proposed legislation in this space will never be able to guarantee that a human life will not be prematurely ended due to abuse or flaws within such a legislative framework, or the social, cultural and medical ramifications of such laws as time moves on. This reason alone should ensure that no such legislation should exist in any state or territory. No legislative framework can account for every individual and unique circumstance, and no amount of safeguards can take into account all variables in a person's life or particular circumstances.


Unfortunately, the Victorian parliament has been successful in this space and has legislated for this reform, and that's been referred to by many speakers in this debate. But that legislation will not take effect until May 2019. I would have thought that we need to take the time to see how that legislation is enacted, and whether or not the safeguards that are being proposed by those who supported that legislation will stand the test of time. As the former Prime Minister Paul Keating said during that debate in Victoria, 'No law and no process can achieve that objective.' We know that legislation gets amended all the time and we know there are social changes within the community, so I don't think you can use the fact that the Victorian bill has not been implemented as justification for supporting this bill. 


It should be noted that, although divergent views exist on this issue within the medical profession, the Australian Medical Association believes that doctors should not be involved in interventions that have as their primary intention the ending of a person's life. Withholding and withdrawing treatment is ethically distinct from physician assisted suicide or euthanasia. We hear in this place on so many debates that we should be adhering to the experts' advice. Well, I don't think there are any experts that are more informed when it comes to assisted suicide and euthanasia than doctors. When the AMA is opposed to it—on the grounds they have articulated—then I think we should be adhering to that advice. 


I do sympathise with anyone who is suffering with terminal or life-limiting illness or people who live with permanent pain. I do not question your right to argue for voluntary euthanasia, nor do I question your ordeal or your suffering. I cannot possibly understand your individual circumstances. However, my own lived experience—without such legislation—is that pressure can be put on older members of our community when entering the acute health system such that they feel that maybe they shouldn't be asking for a second opinion. I've had that life experience with my own mother. I know what it's like when you're told: 'There's nothing more we can do for you. We don't believe that surgery is going to give you quality of life.' My mother was able to demand that she have a second opinion. That second opinion was still that the chances of surgery were limited, but that surgeon was in fact prepared to proceed with the surgery that she needed. We were fortunate at that time, because my mother had her faculties; she was strong and opinionated. The surgery did take place and my mother had an additional 3½ years to enjoy her life, her grandchildren and her great-grandchildren. With the overseas experience, as I will talk about further, there is not always that option for people. 


We've heard many of my colleagues talk about palliative care—and that there should not be a choice between palliative care and end of life, or assisted suicide. The reality is that we have the power in this place—and governments have failed over too many years—to adequately resource palliative care so that people have the support that they need, whether that's in their own home, in an aged-care home or in acute care. What we need to do is not just talk about the need for greater resources; we collectively need to ensure that the government of the day and future governments resource palliative care, because that in itself can assist with ensuring that people have the end of life that they want, with their loved ones. My concern is that legalising voluntary euthanasia and, effectively, allowing the state to legislate to end human life is a fundamentally flawed answer and not an adequate answer in a society where human life should be viewed as paramount. As I said, palliative care needs to be available to people in their homes, in hospices and in aged-care facilities. 


In my own home state, in northern Tasmania, we have been fighting for a standalone hospice to assist people with their end-of-life issues so they have the support they need. My colleagues from my home state have not supported that view; they didn't put pressure on the former Labor government to fund such a hospice. So I would like people, instead of just giving the words and talking, to actually walk the walk and ensure that a hospice for northern Tasmania is going to be funded by a future state government.


Quite frankly, until we have adequate services to support all people who are dying, why are we even considering this option? Bioethics professor Margaret Somerville, who has observed voluntary euthanasia in Canada for decades, argues that euthanasia is being used as a cheaper alternative to psychiatric and palliative care. Public policy is not infallible, but often public policy and law changes are in fact flawed. A law that would allow voluntary euthanasia is fraught with potential for abuse and medical malpractice. It's better that voluntary euthanasia does not become law, because if one person's life is extinguished prematurely and wrongly, then the state would be responsible for the killing of that human life. Such laws, as a matter of public policy, are not worth the risk to people's lives.


When considering the necessity and practically of new laws, it's best to look at overseas jurisdictions that have already introduced similar laws and see what has happened with those laws and how they have changed. One may argue that such legislation in those jurisdictions is operating effectively if individuals are being granted their wish to end their life on their terms. However, I argue that the legislation which has been instituted in other jurisdictions is flawed because human life has been extinguished prematurely and without the consent of the person. Effectively, in many jurisdictions the state is killing people where voluntary euthanasia laws have been established.


Belgium and the Netherlands have legislated euthanasia and we have seen the decline from the initial legislation that was introduced there. The Physician-assisted deaths under the euthanasia law in Belgium: a population-based survey study demonstrated that 32 per cent of euthanasia deaths recorded in the Flanders region of Belgium occurred without explicit consent. The research found that this was occurring because the groups were vulnerable and because there had been a change in the way that citizens and the medical profession viewed end-of-life measures since the inception of voluntary euthanasia laws. Many of the people who were euthanised were either terminally ill or suffering from dementia or other neurological diseases. Euthanasia in Belgium and the Netherlands is being used to end life prematurely when in fact voluntary euthanasia is supposed to control the way and conditions in which a person wishes to end their life.


Switzerland has also passed voluntary euthanasia laws. The Swiss statistics office reported that there were 965 reported assisted suicide deaths in 2015, up from 742 in 2014 and 86 in 2000. The number of assisted suicide deaths in Switzerland nursing homes via the Exit suicide clinic increased from 10 in 2007 to 92 in 2015. They reported that the Swiss association for ethics in medicine found this trend alarming and stated, 'To end lives in this way gives the practice of assisted suicide an institutional seal of approval.' In August 2015 a healthy, depressed British woman died by assisted suicide the Switzerland. In 2014 a Swiss assisted suicide study found that 16 per cent of people who died at Swiss assisted suicide clinics had no underlying illness. In May 2014 the Exit suicide clinic extended assisted suicide to healthy elderly people who lived with physical or psychological pain. In the last two years 77 people suffering from mental health issues and 173 people who had no physical suffering, but who suffered from addiction and loneliness, were euthanised.


The definition of an illness is expanding, with the Netherlands now considering euthanasia for people who are satisfied with their time on earth and have completed their life. The Netherlands legislated for euthanasia in 2001, and now the age of eligibility for euthanasia is 12 years of age. In 2015, Belgium extended the right of voluntary euthanasia to children. In September 2016, a 17-year-old was euthanised and recently it was revealed that two children, aged nine and 11, were euthanised. We must realise that, once someone is diagnosed with depression, they are not in the correct state of mind to make a life-and-death decision. For most people suffering from a terminal illness, depression is likely. If such a bill were to pass in the territories or any state in Australia, there is no reason why the experience of Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland would not be replicated. Over time, legislation will be amended, and there is no reason at all that we wouldn't consider that what's happened internationally wouldn't happen in Australia.


I often say that greed and self-interest are almost as certain as the sun rising in the east. The potential for the abuse of voluntary euthanasia laws is stark and is a major concern to any state which is considering legalising voluntary euthanasia. This is not about religion. The concerns I have are shared with agnostics and atheists. This issue is about the ethics of civilisation and the importance of a person's life. We need to balance individual rights with what is in the public interest. It's not in the public interest to provide doctors carte blanche on what constitutes a worthwhile life. Any change to the Hippocratic Oath places a dangerous amount of power in the hands of a third party, taking away individual rights. Where voluntary euthanasia has become law, choice is an illusion and the laws are open to abuse. People have come forth with stories of elder abuse and coercion by family members, doctors and nurses. Some of these stories are about death by lethal injection or assisted suicide. We've all heard the stories about people with disabilities whose quality of life was deemed unworthy by doctors. Voluntary euthanasia and assisted suicide at a state or federal level is not the correct legislative action for a government to take in the care of the terminally ill and the most vulnerable people in our communities.


I admire the contributions to the debate by both sides, whether they support euthanasia or not. This is the place where we should have the opportunity to voice our concerns. My concern is ensuring that we are protective of those who are most vulnerable in our communities and that we continue to value the sanctity of the life of every Australian.

Senator STORER
 (South Australia) (12:28):  I welcome the opportunity to speak in the chamber and indicate my support for Senator Leyonhjelm's private member's bill, Restoring Territory Rights (Assisted Suicide Legislation) Bill 2015. I support the ability of the territories to control their own legislative agenda. Their elected representatives should be fully answerable to their voters for the decisions they take. I would be disappointed if the Turnbull government did not allow this bill, should it be carried in the Senate, to be debated in the House of Representatives. I see here a fundamental question that the Senate is being asked to address: the ability of the Commonwealth to override the legislative will of the ACT and the Northern Territory on the specific question of assisted dying. This bill, if passed, would give the territories the same legislative rights as the states, specifically on assisted dying, overturning a 20-year-old federal law which prevented the territories from legalising assisted dying. This bill, simply put, provides the territories with the opportunity to introduce and debate assisted dying legislation, should they wish to do so. It is important to note that it does not enable the Northern Territory to reinstate the original assisted dying legislation, which gave rise to the decision of the parliament of the Commonwealth to overturn that law. This is a matter of the democratic right of the territories and the people in them. It's a states' right matter, as passionately discussed by Senator Scullion earlier today. Voters in the ACT and the Northern Territory should have the same right as voters in South Australia and the other states to vote for or oppose politicians who pledge to legalise assisted dying.


Other senators here have discussed the question of assisted dying itself. I shall not do so. I simply want to deal with the legislation before me. Should I be asked to consider legislation on assisted dying itself, I would apply myself to considering, deeply, the details of what is being proposed and especially the safeguards contained in the measure. But that is not the case right now.


That said, I have noted the processes that have occurred in other jurisdictions when legislators have been asked to consider bills. The legislation passed by the Victorian parliament at the end of last year, for example, followed a 10-month crossbench parliamentary inquiry set up after that state's legislative council agreed on such an approach in 2015. The relevant committee tabled its final report a year later. The government released its response six months after that. A ministerial advisory panel was then established and its 66 recommendations, informed by the work of the parliamentary inquiry, were completed a further six months later, in the middle of last year. Those recommendations were the building blocks for the legislation itself, which came into law at the end of last year, but not before an exhaustive debate in both houses of the Victorian parliament. As we have heard, the legislation will not be in effect until June 2019. So the reports and the decisions taken in Victoria have taken more than two, nearly three, years. From the outside, this appears to have been a thoughtful and measured way of gathering all the evidence for and against before any parliament makes a decision on a matter of such importance. Therefore, discussion of palliative care and related public policies with regard to assisted dying is admirable but is not being considered here today. Similarly, the discussion of the Victorian legislation and the findings from other jurisdictions, based on their legislation, is also not being considered here today. Again, this is a matter of the democratic rights of the territories to have the same rights as voters in South Australia and other states to vote for or oppose politicians who pledge to legalise assisted dying. Therefore, I will be supporting the legislation before the Senate today, Restoring Territory Rights (Assisted Suicide Legislation) Bill 2015, on that basis.

Senator McGRATH
 (Queensland—Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister) (12:33):  Life must trump all. All in this chamber have come to this debate on different paths. All have family and friends who have fought for life and who have shifted from life to come what may. This bill, Restoring Territory Rights (Assisted Suicide Legislation) Bill 2015, will allow a territory government to introduce a government sanctioned right to death or right to kill. Those most at risk will be now at risk of a sometimes morally nebulous society. I oppose this bill. I oppose euthanasia.


This bill socialises death, not as a last resort, but as a means for society to avoid the dignity of life, often when life is drawing to a close. This is a bill that effectively places the dignity of death ahead of the dignity of life as a means for society to allow, indeed promote, the state-sanctioned killing of the old, the infirm, the unwanted, the dying, the depressed and the forgotten. No human being has the moral authority to decide when another should die.


We are inherently fallible. We make mistakes. We commit monstrous acts in anger. We become overtaken by greed. We oppose the death penalty because we know it is wrong and will always be wrong. To take another human being's life in revenge, even for the most heinous of acts, is wrong. And yet we can somehow rationalise the killing of the sick and the elderly. The fact that such rationalisation is possible says enough about the inescapable weakness of human beings and our inherent unsuitability to make decisions so serious and irreversible as whether someone should live or die.


As a society, we should be asking not how to make it legal for people to be killed but how to build upon the dignity of life for all, dignity for life when it is at its hardest. I will not and cannot support this bill. Life must trump all.

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (12:35):  I rise to speak today to make a contribution to the debate on the bill introduced by Senator Leyonhjelm to this Senate chamber as a private member's bill entitled Restoring Territory Rights (Assisted Suicide Legislation) Bill 2015. I acknowledge the grief, the loss and the personal truth of every recount by senators sharing their life experiences of losing someone that they love. I respect the diversity of views that have been put respectfully on the record in the course of this debate. I have my own history, as others do, of grief and loss, and it's a lens that colours what I feel about this issue. But we're called on in this place to combine that journey of the heart with the intellectual endeavour to interrogate the legislation that comes before us, and I will endeavour to do that in my contribution.


I know that there have been many earnest contributions to this debate that, no doubt with good intent, call on us to avert our eyes from the substantive issue at the heart of this bill. Many will say, and indeed have said, that this bill is just about legislative rights of the territories. But that is only one small element of this bill. The greater, substantive, part deserves consideration. Let me say clearly that history will show that this bill is about giving territories of this nation the green light to go ahead with enacting legislation that will make it legal for physicians to terminate the lives of their patients and to assist patients to take their own lives.


I think a review of the contributions of those who will support the bill will show that, as much as they declare it is not so, they do indeed know that enabling state-sanctioned suicide in the ACT and the NT is in fact exactly what they're seeking to achieve today. The legislation that passed this parliament in the form of the Euthanasia Laws Act 1997 was about euthanasia. This bill, no matter what political magic dust may be thrown over it, is about euthanasia. But it does use the new lexicon of 'assisted suicide'. Let us also be clear that, despite its complexity, this matter of life and death will be determined by unicameral parliaments, where there is no house of review.


Senator Dodson last night made a very important contribution about the nature of the territories and the rejection of statehood by the Northern Territory. He also made important remarks about the particular vulnerability of First Nations people, who make up so much of the population of that territory.


Last year in the context of the Victorian state debate, 105 of Australia's 148 palliative medicine specialists—that's 70 per cent of the profession—wrote an open letter in which they stated that euthanasia advocates actively and deliberately undermine confidence in palliative care. At the time the vote passed the Victorian parliament, Victoria had the lowest rate of palliative medicine specialists per capita in the country. That is, in my view, instructive. It reveals that the one state that has delivered legislation to allow assisted suicide is the least well served in terms of expert palliation advice and access.


Much has been made of the pain of death in the course of this debate. I do not doubt for a moment that senators have authentically revealed their own perceptions of witnessing that pain in their own personal encounters with the death of a loved one. Indeed, I recall one day in the course of my father's dying when palliation failed him as an aggressive brain tumour progressed. He was very much in pain, and we were very much distressed. Seeing that sort of thing makes you question everything. But his palliation was adjusted, and he continued his farewell to us with very little pain over the following weeks. He reached his 49th birthday not long before he passed. That was 30 years ago. There's no doubt amongst palliation specialists that there has been a marked improvement over that time in the field of palliation. I acknowledge the powerful contributions of many senators that call attention to the need for an increase in the level of resources and the enablement of ever-improving palliation practices, including quality mental health and psychological supports that ameliorate the challenges of the journey to death.


In response to many claims about pain management made in the course of this debate, I want to make a few remarks about claims that pain management is the most pressing reason for advancing to legal assisted suicide. Just how significant is pain as a factor in the decision-making of those who actively seek assisted suicide in jurisdictions where it is currently enabled? In the Oregon public health report of 2016, of the 1,127 patients in that state who had died from ingesting a lethal dose of medication, the data revealed, somewhat surprisingly, that neither pain nor fear of pain was the main reason cited by those who sought assisted suicide. It was, in fact, some 296 of those 1,127 people—or 26.3 per cent—who indicated that pain control or concern about pain control was a factor for them.


To be fair, let me put on the record that the most often cited reason for assisted suicide in the Oregon study, at 91 per cent, was the steady loss of autonomy. Being less able to engage in activities making life enjoyable was a reason cited by 89.7 per cent. For 77 per cent, it was the loss of dignity that motivated their assisted suicide. Loss of control of bodily functions, such as incontinence and vomiting, was the reason cited by 46.8 per cent. It's important to note that the two reasons most cited by people who died by assisted suicide in Oregon reveal that it was their feelings about their lives, and their concerns about others' views of their lives, that prompted them to take action. That worries me.


Let me speak to the statistic that is of greatest concern to me—that is, the fact that, of the 1,127 people who chose assisted suicide as reported in the study in Oregon, 42.2 per cent indicated that their reason for seeking assisted suicide was concern about being a physical or emotional burden on family, friends or caregivers. It's here that I want to put on the record my recollection of attending a public meeting in the lead-up to the 2001 federal election. Labor's leader, Kim Beazley, and our candidate for the seat of Robertson, Trish Moran, arrived at Kincumber High School. It was a well-attended meeting. Many residents from the local retirement villages that surround it were in attendance. I do believe that most of the audience that evening were in favour of assisted suicide, and that was pretty clear to Mr Beazley as he was addressing them.


When he was asked the question, Mr Beazley spoke about his experience of taking evidence in hearings—and I point out that the Senate is not going to have the opportunity to do that. A young brother and sister came to the inquiry that he was part of and insisted that assisted suicide should be enabled because their mother was a perfect example of someone who was spending her children's inheritance on her health care, and they should have access to it. Mr Beazley rightly pointed out that people who want assisted suicide—people who have argued passionately for it here in this chamber—do not have a motivation of that kind at all. But those motivations do exist in our community, and we are wise to heed them as we make law for the country. We make it for all people, and we have to cover those who have malintent. Mr Beazley finished by saying, 'I don't know what kind of a mother you had but there's very little my mother wouldn't have done or given up in order to give me a better life.' I've never forgotten that.


That brings me to the very real threat of assisted suicide legislation advancing at a time in this nation when recent reports are urging us, as legislators, to give serious consideration to developing legislation, social leadership and agencies to curb increasing elder abuse—undue influence of one family member over another. Similarly, fears of the exploitation of the disabled were well articulated by Senator Steele-John last night in his contribution. I note Senator Steele-John indicated his support for the legislation, but he quite powerfully described the reality of living with disability, about which he perhaps has the greatest insight of all in this chamber. As he put it, four million Australians with disabilities are denied adequate access to the services they need and want, and violent abuse and neglect is still endemic. It is in this context, some fear, that euthanasia enters.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (12:45):  I am a senator for Queensland. I represent the whole state of Queensland and am a very proud Queenslander. I hope that, over the years, I've done things in this place that will help my state. But I am passionate about northern Australia, and particularly North Queensland—the part of my state where I live and have worked for all of my long years in this parliament. I'm proud to say, although a bit unhappy to say, that I am now the only senator of any political party currently residing and working in North Queensland. 


So, it is perhaps fortuitous that this week, in this parliament, I am helping to host over 80 people from the capital of North Queensland, which is Townsville, who are in the building at the arrangement of Townsville Enterprise Limited to promote Townsville to those here in Canberra who have power over the money. I'm delighted that that group of community and civic leaders from Townsville has been able to meet with a wide range of ministers who are able to assist in their portfolio areas with some of the desires and aspirations of Townsville—including the Townsville region, I should emphasise. 


I'm delighted that the delegation has been led by some old friends of mine, the five mayors from that area: Alf Lacey, mayor of Palm Island Aboriginal Shire Council; Ramon Jayo, mayor of the Hinchinbrook Shire Council; Jenny Hill, mayor of Townsville; Liz Schmidt, mayor of Charters Towers Regional Council; and Lyn McLaughlin, mayor of the Burdekin Shire Council—a council that I spent 11 years on as an elected member before I came to this parliament almost 30 years ago. It was great to hear the mayors and their passion, and the passion of all of those who came with them. I've been delighted that Mr Phillip Thompson has joined me and the delegation in meeting with any number of ministers, including the Prime Minister later today. Phillip Thompson is the LNP's candidate for the electorate of Herbert at the next election and is an Afghanistan veteran. He was blown up in Afghanistan and has spent the last few years helping those with mental trauma—particularly those who have suffered in the way he suffered—as a result of wars that Australia has been involved in. For that, Phillip Thompson was selected as the Queensland Young Australian of the Year this year. Congratulations to Phillip on that particular award. 


It's great to have these people here who are passionate about the north. As I often point out, northern Australia has less than five per cent of the population of Australia but already contributes about 50 per cent of Australia's export earnings to our nation. As the theme of the Townsville delegation states, a stronger north means a stronger Australia. I totally support them in what they've done. 


As part of my passion for the north, just last week I jumped into my car and, with Mr Frank Beveridge, the LNP candidate in the electorate of Kennedy, drove for 2,500 kilometres around the electorate of Kennedy, first of all going to Charters Towers, where we met up with Mayor Liz Schmidt again. We were able to make an announcement on behalf of the Turnbull government of a $4 million grant to cattlemen and pastoralists in the north-west who are doing it tough with the drought and other difficulties, to help them better manage their properties. 


From Charters Towers we drove up the Douglas Development Road to the Goldfield's Tavern at Forsayth. We stopped in there for a beer, but really it was to see some of the locals. The Goldfield's Tavern is always a good place to meet the locals. Then it was on to Georgetown and my old mates in the Latara Motel. The next day we went to Normanton and out to Karumba, where all of the local authorities in the north-west were meeting at their rock meeting at Karumba. It was great to catch up with all of those mayors, with Frank Beveridge, to hear their concerns and to again offer my assistance for the good work they are trying to do in those remote parts of Australia. 


Then we went back to Normanton. One of the purposes of going out there was to join Normanton during its 150th year anniversary. Normanton is nowadays a very small town, about 500 people on the Norman River up in the Gulf Country, originally established in Burketown a bit further west. There was a disease there—they went over to Mornington Island and eventually came back to Normanton, where they set up what was 150 years ago the entree into the rich agricultural Gulf Country and gold mining area at Croydon.


They had a wonderful party. We joined them in the street party that day. I was privileged to join Mayor Jack Bawden and the deputy mayor, Ashley Gallagher, to bury a time capsule in Normanton, which will be opened in many, many years time—long after I've departed this earth, I'm afraid. It was good to be part of those celebrations and to have the honour of helping to bury the time capsule.


It was also good to catch up with people there. I had been in Normanton not all that many weeks previously, opening the Gulf Christian College up there because the Turnbull government is very keen on promoting education—quality education—even in places as remote as Normanton. That's a great school. I was delighted to catch up with people I'd met a couple of weeks before at the opening of additional buildings at the Gulf Christian College in Normanton.


After that, we went down the road through Charters Towers and on to Mount Isa, where I had the honour of opening, on behalf of the Prime Minister and the minister for regional development, the Mount Isa Rodeo Hall of Fame, which recognises the heroes of the Rotary rodeo in its 60th anniversary rodeo event. The rodeo was started 59 years ago but it was celebrating its 60th rodeo. Why? Because one year they had two rodeos. The acceptable reason for that was that Queen Elizabeth II was able to attend a rodeo that year, and already in those earlier days the rodeo was recognised as the biggest rodeo in the Southern Hemisphere, so obviously Queen Elizabeth had wanted to see it. And the rodeo continues today. Congratulations to the Rotary Club who have run it for the last 59 years. With our work done on the Thursday, with Frank Beveridge I was able to go along to the rodeo as the guest of the rodeo committee. We really enjoyed some of the fabulous sporting events at the rodeo. It's a unique sport and very, very exciting to watch.


As we moved around, there were two questions that were always asked of me. One was, 'Senator Macdonald, how can we vote for you at the next election?'—more about that some other time, some other place. But the other question was, 'How can we encourage people to move to these remote parts of Australia?' They are aware that I've promoted to the Prime Minister and the Treasurer a proposal to review and upgrade the zone tax rebate scheme, which, when introduced in 1945, actually compensated people living in remote parts of Australia a little bit for the additional costs of living remotely, far from our capital cities. They're very keen to look at that, and I'm going to be urging my government and the parliament to seriously review the zone tax rebate scheme.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (15:03): I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Education and Training (Senator Birmingham) to questions without notice asked by Senators Keneally and Ketter today relating to a grant to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation.


What a bumbling performance from Senator Birmingham! What a pathetic performance from a cabinet minister, who was unable to deal with any of the questions with any substance during his answers. It's quite clear that this is an absolute rort, handing half a billion dollars over to a small foundation with six employees, when it should have actually been providing more resources to the CSIRO or to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. These are the areas that have the scientific knowledge. These are the organisations that know what's happening in the Great Barrier Reef. It's quite clear that Senator Birmingham doesn't have a clue about what's going on. 


I'm not surprised Senator Birmingham doesn't have a clue, because the Prime Minister doesn't have a clue either. This is a government in its death throes. This is a rabble of a government, unable to deal with the real issues that affect ordinary Australians. This is a government so consumed by its internal conflict, so consumed by looking after its own jobs, that it doesn't care about the Great Barrier Reef. It doesn't care about ordinary working people in this country. This is a government that is so bad that it can't come up with a reasonable argument—not one decent argument—as to why it would hand half a billion dollars of taxpayers' money to the mates of the Prime Minister and the mates of the Prime Minister's wife. That's what's happened here.


This is about the big end of town looking after the big end of town. So what do they do? They hand them half a billion dollars on the basis that they are supposedly the experts in fundraising in the private sector. Well, maybe the people who are on the board should just put their hands in their own pockets, because these are the people with the $17-million-a-year salaries—the mates of Malcolm and Lucy. These are the mates getting half a billion dollars of public money. It's an absolute outrage. And, if there was one thing that this government could do to actually justify it, we would have heard it by now. Questions have been asked every day this week as to why this government would hand half a billion dollars of taxpayers' money to their mates in the big end of town—to some small organisation, employing six people—when we have the CSIRO and the Great Barrier Reef marine council ready to get the money. They could get the money, they could use the money and they could actually use it well.


The reason they won't give it to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority is that that authority actually believes in climate change. The authority actually knows that man-made pollution is causing problems. It's causing problems with water quality, problems with the crown-of-thorns starfish and causing calcification. But, because the authority recognise that climate change is a reality and this lot over here want to deny it, they are not going to get a cent. It's the same with the CSIRO. The CSIRO is the pre-eminent research body in this country. They act in the interests of the community. They act in the interests of industry. They are there to make sure we achieve our international and national responsibilities. Yet this mob want to hand half a billion dollars to a small organisation that happened to be mates of the Prime Minister and mates of the Prime Minister's wife.


Senator Birmingham was absolutely pathetic. He can't handle his own portfolio, he can't handle this. This is a government in decline. It's a government that should go. (Time expired)

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (15:08):  You can see why Senator Cameron is more interested in his old mate Eddie Obeid and the bad Ian Macdonald—both in jail in New South Wales—than he is about what's happening here. Senator Cameron talks about the Great Barrier Reef council. Well, Senator Cameron, sitting in my office now I have mayors from five councils in the Townsville region—Palm Island council, Hinchinbrook council, Townsville regional council, Burdekin council and Charters Towers council—but there is no-one there from the Barrier Reef council that you're talking about. This just shows how particularly inept and inaccurate Senator Cameron is. He is leaving the chamber. I was going to actually tell him where the Great Barrier Reef is. Quite clearly, a Sydney based senator has obviously never, ever been there.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Macdonald please resume your seat. Senator Keneally.




Senator Keneally:
  Madam Deputy President, I would like to call to your attention that Senator Macdonald has just reflected on another member's exit from the chamber.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you. I do remind you, Senator Macdonald, that it isn't appropriate to refer to whether senators are in or out of the chamber. But please continue your remarks.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Sorry, Madam Deputy President, I'd forgotten that. Every time I speak and then leave the chamber, Senator Cameron mentions it. I don't remember Senator Keneally taking points of order then. Maybe she's worried about her former cabinet ministers, Mr Obeid and the bad Ian Macdonald, who are both languishing in jail, and she's not thinking very clearly about these things.


Senator Cameron doesn't even know the names of the groups in North Queensland. As the Senate well knows, I live up there, I interact with people who work there and I understand the Barrier Reef. Senator Cameron makes the accusation that we're not doing anything about man-made pollution and the crown-of-thorns starfish. Yet, if he looks at this package of half a billion dollars, they are two of the specific areas that this money will be used to address. The crown-of-thorns starfish is being specifically targeted under this new program, with additional boats going out and picking them up.


I have to tell all of the senators on the other side just where the Barrier Reef is. It's up off the North Queensland coast, starting around Bundaberg and going right up to Thursday Island. I tell them that because none of the Labor Queensland senators live anywhere outside of Brisbane. We had former Senator McLucas in the Senate at one stage. I didn't often agree with her but at least she was based in Cairns. She wouldn't be making these stupid comments about the Great Barrier Reef. Former Senator McLucas and I at least know where the Barrier Reef is.



Senator Watt interjecting—




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Senator Watt, who's yelling out across the chamber, knocked off former Senator McLucas. He stabbed her in the back. But I hear the Labor Party's going to put a senator in North Queensland. One of Senator Watt's staffers is going to be parachuted into the Senate when they get rid of Senator Moore. What happened to gender equity in the Labor Party? You got rid of former Senator McLucas, you're getting rid of Senator Moore, and I understand, Senator Watt, you're going to parachute one of your male staffers into the Senate and then put them up in North Queensland. They'll be a great North Queensland advocate, I know that. But the Barrier Reef is something we are keen about.


I often say, 'Don't take my word for it; take the word of Save Our Marine Life,' an alliance of leading conservation organisations working to protect Australia's marine life. This group sets quite accurately out in its booklet called A big blue legacy: the Liberal National tradition of marine conservation, which I read from often, all of the work that Liberal Party and National Party governments have done over the years to protect the Great Barrier Reef. We're the first ones in there protecting it—we're the only ones there that know where it is, for a start!—and we know what to do to enhance the wonderful experience that is the Great Barrier Reef.


No doubt we'll have Senator Keneally get up after this—I'd be interested in her views as a Sydneysider. I hope she's been to the Barrier Reef. In fact I encourage all senators to actually go up to the Barrier Reef and have a look around. Talk to the people who work there. Talk to the people who understand it. Talk to farmers who are doing real things to stop pollution of the Barrier Reef. These five-minute experts—like other Labor speakers will be, no doubt—will be interesting to listen to. Those of us who understand the reef—and the mayor's sitting in my office—are ecstatic about the concentration that this government has put into the Barrier Reef and the substantial money it has provided to protect and enhance it.

"Chisholm, Sen Anthony",ALP,2018-08-15,"



Senator CHISHOLM
 (Queensland) (15:13):  I wasn't going to talk about this but I can't resist the opportunity. This time last week I was actually having lunch in Ayr, which is Senator Macdonald's home town. I met with the local journos and members of the community, and do you know what the sad part was? Not one person said they were going to miss Senator Macdonald. They didn't even mention him. It is a very sad way for him to exit. The fact that his contribution today was just an attack on Senator Keneally and others, rather than defending the decision of this government, speaks volumes for this decision that they have made to give almost half a billion dollars to this foundation.


The questions today from Labor, from Senator Keneally and Senator Ketter, go to the heart of the government's problem on this issue. The inept justifications are laid bare. The lack of due diligence is evident. It is clear evidence of a government on the run. They are making up justifications as they go, with zero substance behind them.


At that fateful meeting on 9 April, the Prime Minister, the Minister for the Environment and Energy and the chairman of the Great Barrier Reef Foundation met. It was a cosy little gathering, if ever I have seen one, where the Prime Minister said, 'We're going to give you $444 million.' The response from the foundation is priceless, and it's one of key phrases that captured the attention of Australians. The foundation declared, 'This is like winning lotto'. That was a key point where Australians thought: 'Hang on a sec, this foundation described it as winning lotto. That shows you there was a lack of due diligence on the government's part.' It also shows you that this foundation was not up to it. They had six full-time staff. They clearly were not ready.


The questions that we had today proved the government's lack of due diligence and lack of effort to ensure that this foundation was up to the task. We know that before they handed over the $444 million there was no tender process, no application and no due diligence. The foundation described it as 'like winning lotto', a phrase that has made an impact with the Australian people. 


The substance of the questions today go to a key government claim that they have been making repeatedly: that the Great Barrier Reef Foundation will leverage this $444 million for private donations. Yet they can't tell us how much the organisation has raised from private sources. If they had done due diligence, they would have an answer to that question. But, as Senator Keneally said in her question, Minister Frydenberg has used five different figures. First it was over $90 million, then it was around $80 million, then he said $65 million, then he said more than $60 million and then he said tens of millions of dollars. We know their own website said it was $57 million. The fact that the government had not done their due diligence on this key claim has been laid bare. The substance that they are trying to mount around this being a government decision that stands shows you the lack of effort that they have put in.


Then we had the second question from Senator Ketter, which further ripped apart the government's claim about the foundation's ability to leverage this donation. That is the fact that they have engaged a consultant to write their co-financing plan. If they were so good at raising money from private and corporate sources, they wouldn't need to engage a consultant. If they were so successful over their 20 years of life, they wouldn't need a consultant to do it for them. But the fact that they have had to go and do that just shows you that that key plank, which the government have been using to argue the substance of why this has happened, does not stand up. 


The other part of this—which is also important—that has come out through the questioning of the Senate committee is that the government handed over this money, all $444 million, without getting a commitment from the foundation about how much money they were going to be able to raise. So they've got $444 million in the bank, but they have not said what they are going to raise from private and corporate interests. If that was a key plank of why the government was giving this mob the money, surely the government would say, 'This is what we expect from you.' But, no: they handed over the money and now they are scrambling behind the scenes to look like they went through some sort of due diligence process to justify the decision. They clearly haven't done it. We know there was no tender, we know there was no application, we know the foundation described this as winning lotto, and we know the Australian people are on to them. This is what is coming their way. The sooner the government realise and accept responsibility for what they have done and hand this money back, the better. The Australian people have no confidence in the foundation, and that is the fault of this government.

"Paterson, Sen James",LP,2018-08-15,"



Senator PATERSON
 (Victoria) (15:18):  In question time today and throughout this week and in the take note of answers we've just had from Labor senators today, we've heard three novel concepts that you don't typically hear from the Labor Party. We've heard three new concerns that Labor have about this particular policy that they don't typically show in other areas of public life. 


Firstly, they've shown a new-found concern for the careful use of taxpayer dollars. If only they had shown that when they were last in government. I will return to that in a moment. Secondly, they've shown a new-found and recent concern for proper process. That's something that, again, I didn't seen them particularly uphold when they were in government. I will return to that. And then, thirdly, they've shown a new-found scepticism about the fact that expenditure on environmental projects might sometimes be questionable. These are three new, different takes from the Labor Party that we're not used to normally hearing.


I will return to the first point that I made: the careful use of taxpayers' dollars. It is a little bit—just a little bit—galling to sit here and listen to lectures from the Labor Party about the careful use of taxpayer dollars. It's not something that they typically showed much sentimentality about when they were in government. We don't have to turn back the clock very far at all to remember the way in which they showed wanton disregard for taxpayers' dollars when they had the opportunity to be careful stewards of them. They are the party, after all, of pink batts. They are the party of sending cheques in the mail to people who are deceased, in the name of economic stimulus. They are the party which, when coming to government in 2007, inherited the most enviable set of books in the Western world and promptly went about absolutely smashing the nation's finances in just a few years. And they, of course, are the party which in this chamber have opposed virtually every single attempt that this government has made to fix the problem that they have caused and the wreckage that they have done to our budget. They have voted time and time again against measures designed to be more carefully stewarding of taxpayers' dollars.


When it comes to proper process, this again is a new-found and recent concern of the Labor Party. I did not hear and I have not yet heard—perhaps later in this debate or in other debates I will be surprised, but I did not hear—this same concern shown for perhaps the largest expenditure of taxpayer dollars ever conceived, in the worst and most shambolic process ever known, which of course is the creation of the National Broadband Network. It took place—we now know, thanks to media reporting and the benefit of hindsight—initially over a scrap of a napkin in the Prime Minister's VIP jet, between the minister, Stephen Conroy, and the then Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, during several flights around the country. The expenditure of tens of billions of dollars of taxpayers' money started on the back of a napkin on the VIP jet. That was not exactly proper process, and it's a bit galling to hear Labor senators come in here and question that today.


Finally, as I mentioned, they have a new-found concern that possibly the expenditure of taxpayers' money on environmental projects might not be effective. Well, I wish that was a trait that they showed more consistently and more widely and that they applied equally to their own policies as they are applying it to ours. It's almost as if their questions on this matter have been written by my friend Andrew Bolt. It's very reminiscent of his criticism of our government from the right flank, but it's somewhat unusual coming from Labor senators, on our left flank.


The real question is: what is actually underlying the Labor Party's criticism of this policy? What is really driving it? I think the senator who let the mask slip the most during questions this week was my fellow senator from Victoria Senator Kim Carr, who asked a question to the government about this earlier this week. In his question, he referred to the fact that the charity that's receiving this money is in fact a private charity. There was particular emphasis on the word 'private'. In fact, he almost spat the word 'private' in the chamber as he said it. Why was the government giving so much taxpayers' money to a private charity to undertake this work?


And that, I think, perfectly encapsulates Labor's real objection here. They believe that only public servants, only government agents—only the state—are capable of doing good environmental works or other good social works. They're deeply sceptical about the role of civil society, of private organisations, in delivering innovative solutions to the problems that we face.


I commend the government for thinking outside of the box, for looking at other ways to solve this problem, for not relying on the same traditional and sometimes unsuccessful methods to solve these problems, and for empowering a private charity to solve this problem.

Senator KENEALLY
 (New South Wales) (15:23):  I rise today to participate in this take-note debate in response to questions asked by me and Senator Ketter of Senator Birmingham. Well, they say that success has many parents and failure is an orphan. We can't get anyone from the government to admit whose idea it was to give the Great Barrier Reef Foundation $444 million of public money. Minister Frydenberg has been asked. He's been asked in the parliament. He's been asked on ABC Insiders. He's been asked on 2GB radio by Ben Fordham. He refuses to say.


Yesterday, in the House of Representatives, the Prime Minister was asked twice whether it was his idea to give the money to the foundation. He refused to answer on both occasions. You'd think, if this was such a magnificent idea, the person who conceived of it would be shouting it from the rooftops. Instead, we have people scattering away from this ill-conceived and ill-designed proposal, this maladministration of public money. This is a flawed approach, and it is an approach that leads directly to Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, to Mr Turnbull.


We only know through the scrutiny applied by the Senate process in estimates and in committee hearings that there was no grant application, that there was no public tender process. We only know through the scrutiny of the Senate that the foundation itself did not ask for this money. They had no conversations with anyone in government prior to 9 April about taking responsibility for nearly half a billion dollars of public money. And why is 9 April important? We now know, due to the Senate scrutiny process, that 9 April is the day the Prime Minister of Australia went into a room with Minister Frydenberg and no public servants and offered the chair of this foundation, Dr John Schubert, $444 million of public money—no due diligence; no grant application process; no contestability; no discussions. We now know, through the Senate process, there were no discussions with the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. We now know, through processes in this Senate, that there were no discussions with the CSIRO. We know that this government seems to have come up with this proposal without talking to anyone whatsoever, and decided that it can gift this private foundation $444 million of public money.


And it is important to note that it's a private foundation, because this is public money. Now we are in the farcical situation of public sector science agencies, like the CSIRO, like the Australian Institute of Marine Science, having to go cap in hand to a private foundation to get access to public money to carry out public science to protect one of our great public assets, the Great Barrier Reef. This is an extraordinary set of circumstances conceived by a bunch of merchant bankers, including the Prime Minister, who think that it's okay to strike up a deal behind closed doors. The carelessness of public money being handed out in this fashion!


Now, the government waltzes around justifying this, a post-hoc justification, and saying that this foundation can raise additional money—that they can leverage $444 million and they can get additional money from corporates. They say on their website they've raised $57 million from corporates and philanthropy. They do not have audited reports on their websites to substantiate that, so maybe they could start by putting those reports up. We know the government hasn't done the due diligence because, again through the Senate process, we have heard from the department that they haven't even looked at the audited reports prior to 2011. So how can the government, as we saw today, stand up and say this foundation is a great fundraising machine when they don't even know if it's true? Not Minister Frydenberg, not Senator Birmingham, not the Prime Minister and not anyone from government can stand here and say how much money this foundation has raised in the past, or tell us how much it is going to raise in the future. They have privatised the Great Barrier Reef.

 (Queensland) (15:40):  Mr President—



The PRESIDENT:  Are you seeking leave to make a statement at this point? There are a number of other stages. Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator CHISHOLM:
  Labor observes that the Senate has traditionally allowed bills to be introduced no matter what senators think of the subject matter, on the basis that the Senate can then determine what it thinks about it once the terms of the bill are available. For this reason we will not be opposing the introduction of this bill, although we will be opposing the bill.


However, it is surprising that Senator Hanson has elected to proceed with the introduction of this bill today in the light of her comments this morning in response to Senator Wong's motion supporting a racially non-discriminatory immigration policy to the overwhelming national and international benefit of Australia. If Senator Hanson is true to her word when she said, 'I have always advocated for equality, right across the board, for everyone in this country,' she should not be introducing this bill today or ever. Senator Hanson cannot condemn Senator Anning on one hand and seek to advance this bill in the Senate on the other; otherwise, her words are hollow.

Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (15:41):  I seek leave to make a short statement.



The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator HANSON:
  In relation to the Labor Party's comments with regard to this bill, it has nothing to do with my comments this morning. This bill is about immigration numbers. It's got nothing to do with the people who are coming to Australia, but it does refer to numbers. That will be presented next week when the bill is formally presented to the parliament. As I said before, this has nothing to do with Senator Fraser Anning and his comments. My bill is about the immigration numbers and giving the people of Australia the say in whether the immigration numbers are too high. Give the people their say.



The PRESIDENT:  Can I make an observation at this point, senators. This is the introduction of a bill, not a formal motion. From my memory, there has not usually been a series of statements when it comes to the introduction of a bill—because they are opportunities for debate—to be debated later on when it goes on the Notice Paper. So I would encourage all senators to reflect on that, lest we start having multiple debates on the same bill.

 (Queensland) (15:43):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to table an explanatory memorandum relating to the bill.


Leave granted.




Senator HANSON:
  I table an explanatory memorandum, and I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



Australia's population increased by 3.5 million people in the decade 2006 to 2016. Around 60% of that population increase came from immigration. 


There is no doubt that immigration is the cause of Australia's exceptional population growth. 


If we continue to allow annual immigration targets to determine the size of our population, then the Australian Bureau of Statistics expects that Australia's population increase will double from 25 million to 50 million in just 30 years. Melbourne and Sydney will become megacities of over ten million people, but there is no evidence that we can plan and pay for this growth.


Governments, both Liberal and Labor, argue immigration is good for the economy, but economist Judith Sloan says immigration benefits special interest groups. She says the economics of immigration are very clear. In the short term immigration reduces per capita income and in the long term per capita income gains are very modest, but these calculations ignore the congestion costs, house prices and the loss of amenity.


Our immigration policy is like a horse that has lost its rider. It is dangerous. What we need is a rider, a population policy to safely guide the immigration horse.


Each year the government of the day sets an immigration target, but there is no plan to take into account the cumulative long term consequences of those yearly decisions. In fact it is the States and Territories that are left to manage the ever increasing population. State Governments are now carrying very high levels of debt and have little prospect of ever paying these loans.


If high levels of legal immigration are such a good idea, why is Australia the only OECD country with a population greater than ten million that is increasing its population at the rate of over 1.7% a year?


In 2011 the percentage of overseas born was just over 25% but today it is over 28%. In certain regions of our major cities those percentages are much higher due to concentration of settlement by certain groups.


No other comparable country has such a high proportion of overseas born. We have double the percentage of overseas born when we compare ourselves to the United States, the United Kingdom or New Zealand. 


It is time to put the interests of citizens first and to stop pandering to special interest groups, including business, higher education and property developers who benefit from excessive immigration. 


The Lowy Institute Survey reported a 'sharp spike in anti-immigration sentiment' in 2018, causing their annual sentiment measure to change from positive to negative.


The 2017 Scanlon Survey reported 37% of respondents see the current immigration intake as too high, but when respondents remained anonymous 74% said that Australia did not need any more people.


In the same year the Australian Population Research Institute found 54% of respondents, who were Australian voters, wanted the number of immigrants reduced.


The government and the opposition must be aware of these findings, but they have not changed their positions. Jointly the major political parties want a bigger and bigger population for Australia.


Is it that these political parties do not believe the results of these surveys?


Inevitably the sample sizes in these surveys are small when compared to the total population. Perhaps the major parties will be persuaded of the electorates view if a plebiscite on immigration is held at the next general election, because that is what is proposed in the Plebiscite (Future Migration Level) Bill 2018.


My Bill proposes to ask voters ""Do you think the immigration rate is too high?"" 


My view is that an overwhelming majority of Australians will say that the immigration rate is too high, when they are told 62% of the population increase in the decade to 2016 was the result of immigration.


It is clear to see that the benefits of a high level of legal immigration are outweighed by problems, but political parties depend for much of their support from the special interest groups which benefit from high immigration.


The Liberals and Labor have two choices. Either they accept there is no political support for high levels of legal immigration or they can argue there is no problem with legal mass immigration. 


There is plenty of evidence the government and the opposition will use statistics to mislead the electorate on the real cause of Australia's population explosion.


There are three recent examples worth noting. 


The first one took place on the day after the Budget in May this year when the Treasurer said that permanent immigration only accounted for around 20% of Australia's population growth. 


Treasurer Morrison made that statement knowing that many permanent visas can only be issued after residency requirements in Australia are met. Once these pathway visas are taken into account, permanent immigration accounts for around 60% of Australia's population growth and not the 20% claimed by the Treasurer.


The second example involved the publication of figures which showed that in 2017-18 the number of permanent migrants had dropped from 190,000 to 163,000, but the government failed to say that a further 40,000 people were on bridging visas awaiting the outcome of their applications for permanent residence. In other words, the government can manipulate the figures by reducing staffing resources.


Labor is just as deceptive, because like the government they will not accept there is a problem with permanent immigration. 


Labor says the immigration problem is one of temporary migration because we have two million temporary migrants in Australia, including up to half a million foreign students. Temporary migrants, however, are just temporary and unless they are on a pathway visa they leave Australia.


Political parties must be stupid to deny there is a problem with permanent migration, because families do notice demountable classrooms at the school, crowded train platforms, buses that don't stop because they are already full, ever increasing travelling times between familiar destinations and long wait times to see specialist doctors etc.


I have often been called a 'populist', but all I do is listen to people wherever I go. 


Unlike most of the political class I talk with people, who are doing their best to get by, and they tell me that politicians are out of step with them on the issue of migration.


I take the view that I am here to represent the views of most Australians or a significant majority of Australians.


One Nation believes that our immigration should be reduced to 70,000 a year or whatever number is necessary to maintain the current population size and a sustainable population profile. 


Australia is a dry continent and our vast land fragile. We need to consider the carrying capacity of the country.


At the end of World War II Australia's population was over seven million people and 90% of those people were born in Australia. In 1945 we were short of labor and the war had created a feeling that a bigger population would be necessary if we were to defend ourselves in the future. After the horror of the war in Europe many people wanted to leave and start a new life in Australia.


I acknowledge the hard work and the contribution made by so many overseas born Australians and their families, but that does not mean that we should continue to have the highest levels of legal immigration in the world.


I do not believe in a bigger and bigger population, but more importantly I believe Australian Citizens need to be given a say and that governments should not act on this issue without a mandate from the people of Australia which is why I am putting this Bill before the Senate for debate.

      (i) Tuberculosis (TB) was declared an emergency in 1993 by the World Health Organization and causes more deaths than any other infectious disease – of the more than 10.4 million infected with TB in 2016, 1.7 million people died, 


      (ii) drug-resistant TB is one of the most common and deadly forms of all antimicrobial resistance in the world, accounting for a significant number of antimicrobial resistant deaths globally, 


      (iii) around the world, an estimated 4.1 million people with TB are not diagnosed, thus missing out on receiving quality care and treatment, 


      (iv) TB affects different populations inequitably and contributes to the cycle of ill-health and poverty, 


      (v) the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal to end the global TB epidemic by 2030 will not be met without new and more effective tools, and more innovative approaches to prevention, diagnosis, treatment, care and vaccination, and 


      (vi) TB is preventable, curable and can be ultimately eliminated through access to quality drugs, treatment and prevention, effective people-centred models of care, and innovation in identification and treatment; 


   (b) recognises: 


      (i) the United Nations (UN) General Assembly is holding the first-ever High-Level Meeting on TB on 26 September 2018, during the 73rd session of the General Assembly in New York, 


      (ii) the United Nations High-Level Meeting on TB provides an unprecedented and historic opportunity for world leaders to reaffirm their commitment and raise the resources required for ending the global TB epidemic by 2030, 


      (iii) the world should aim to increase the overall global investments for ending the TB epidemic to US$2 billion, and to close the estimated US$1.3 billion gap in funding annually for support to TB research and development for prevention, diagnosis treatment and care, and 


      (iv) Australia has supported global actions to reduce TB, including through contributions to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, its support to TB programs in Papua New Guinea and Kiribati, and through the Indo-Pacific Health Security Initiative in our support to Product Development Partnerships and research grants; and 


   (c) calls on the Australian Government to: 


      (i) ensure Australia has senior representation at the United Nations High-Level Meeting on TB in September, and 


      (ii) commit to support countries in the Indo-Pacific in their efforts for TB elimination.

Senator ABETZ:
  The move of the Australian Antarctic Division to Kingston was a great visionary move by the then Liberal government. I recently confirmed to the local mayor, Steve Wass, that the division's situation in Kingston was secure as far as the government was concerned. Those assurances were reported. The Tasmanian and Australian governments along with key organisations are working closely on the development of an Antarctic and science precinct at Macquarie Point as part of the Hobart City Deal. The government's very clear position is that Kingston remains the home of the Australian Antarctic Division. I, therefore, invite Labor to stop their faux concern which they know is causing unnecessary concern. In short, we moved the AAD to Kingston, we remain committed to the division remaining there and we are committed to growing the Antarctic presence in Tasmania with the exciting development at Mac Point.

  The coalition government is focused on getting Australians into jobs, and our employment services programs play a vital part in achieving this outcome. The government's jobactive program began on 1 July 2015 and plays a critical role in ensuring that Australians can be placed in jobs. There have been over one million job placements through jobactive since the program began. To build on this strong record, the government has established an Employment Services Expert Advisory Panel to advise on the development of a future employment services model beyond 2020, chaired by Sandra McPhee. The coalition government also strongly believes in mutual obligation and is strengthening penalties to the small group of jobseekers who are persistently and wilfully non-compliant, whilst increasing support for jobseekers who genuinely try to meet their requirements.

  Labor will oppose this motion. We acknowledge the concerns raised in this motion and have been speaking about these issues for many years. This is particularly true in relation to safety of the government's core of jobactive programs such as Youth Jobs PaTH and Work for the Dole. However, given the fact there are currently inquiries before the Senate Education and Employment References Committee that are looking at issues particularly relating to safety in work, including the exploitation of general and specialist cleaners working in retail chains for contracting and subcontracting cleaning companies, and the prevention, investigation and prosecution of industrial deaths in Australia, we do not believe it is necessary to establish yet another inquiry. As such, the proposed inquiry is ill timed. Labor does not support the government punishing people for being out of work instead of preparing them for a job.

To build on this strong record, the government has established an Employment Services Expert Advisory Panel to advise on the development of a future employment services model beyond 2020, chaired by Sandra McPhee. The coalition government also strongly believes in mutual obligation and is strengthening penalties to the small group of jobseekers who are persistently and wilfully non-compliant, whilst increasing support for jobseekers who genuinely try to meet their requirements.

Senator CHISHOLM
 (Queensland) (16:17):  I seek leave to make a short statement.



The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator CHISHOLM:
  Labor will oppose this motion. We acknowledge the concerns raised in this motion and have been speaking about these issues for many years. This is particularly true in relation to safety of the government's core of jobactive programs such as Youth Jobs PaTH and Work for the Dole. However, given the fact there are currently inquiries before the Senate Education and Employment References Committee that are looking at issues particularly relating to safety in work, including the exploitation of general and specialist cleaners working in retail chains for contracting and subcontracting cleaning companies, and the prevention, investigation and prosecution of industrial deaths in Australia, we do not believe it is necessary to establish yet another inquiry. As such, the proposed inquiry is ill timed. Labor does not support the government punishing people for being out of work instead of preparing them for a job.


Question agreed to.



An honourable senator interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  I didn't hear you call for a division. I called it for the ayes, so I'm moving to the next motion, unless I misheard and someone called for a division I didn't hear. Senator Hinch, are you raising a point of order?




Senator Hinch:
  Mr President, there's some confusion. You did call it for the ayes, and we obviously lost that last motion.



The PRESIDENT:  I call it based on the noises I hear. I called it for the ayes. I'm pretty certain I got it correct.



An honourable senator interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  It's not up to the chair. If you want to raise a point of order, then stand on your feet. I'm not going to provide a commentary on the divisions I call.

 (Victoria—Minister for Rural Health, Minister for Sport, Minister for Regional Communications and Deputy Leader of The Nationals) (16:43):  I present the government's response to the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on its inquiry into the review of the Defence annual report 2015-16 and seek leave to have the document incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The document read as follows—





Australian Government response to the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Review of the Defence Annual Report 2015-16





August 2018





Recommendation 1



The Committee recommends that in future years, the Department of Defence make available to the Committee all documentation that demonstrates the breakdown of Portfolio Budget Statement outcomes to internal programs to enable the Parliament and other agencies to analyse Defence performance.



Government response





Agree.




Previously, Defence has reported the annual outcome for the Portfolio Budget Statement programs by cost summary for each program as part of the online version of the Defence Annual Report. Defence will ensure this level of reporting is included in the online version of future publications.


Together with the Portfolio Budget Statements, the Defence Corporate Plan provides the external strategic narrative about Defence investment in military capability and how it intends to meet and measure performance against government requirements.


In accordance with guidance from the Department of Finance, the Annual Performance Statements report to what extent Defence has fulfilled its purposes as articulated at the beginning of a reporting year in the Defence Corporate Plan. This includes reporting on non-financial performance criteria in both the Defence Corporate Plan and in the Portfolio Budget/Additional Estimates Statements. The Annual Performance Statements are made available in the Defence Annual Report.


The Defence Annual Report 2016–17 includes the mapping of the Defence Purposes from the 2016–17 Defence Corporate Plan, and the outcomes and programs from the Portfolio Budget/Additional Estimates Statements 2016–17. The 2016–17 Annual Performance Statements also includes a narrative detailing the level of achievement against each of the performance criteria in the Portfolio Budget Statements.




Recommendation 2



The Committee recommends that future Department of Defence Annual Reports should clearly report performance against the Portfolio Budget Statement outcomes and detail the level of achievement against all program sub elements. If purposes are used for external communication, the linkages between Portfolio Budget Statement outcomes, departmental programs and the purposes should also be made clear.




Government response





Agree.



Section 39 of the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 (PGPA Act) introduced a requirement for entities to prepare annual performance statements for publication in the annual report. The annual performance statements report to what extent the entity has fulfilled their purpose(s) as outlined in their Corporate Plan. Section 39 of the PGPA Act superseded the requirement under section 63(2) of the Public Service Act 1999 to report performance in relation to the deliverables and key performance indicators of the programs in the Portfolio Budget Statements, and the effectiveness in achieving the planned outcomes in the Portfolio Budget Statements.


The Annual Performance Statements were prepared in accordance with the PGPA Act for the first time in the Defence Annual Report 2015–16. The quality of the annual performance statements is improving as Defence achieves better alignment between the non-financial performance criteria in the Corporate Plan and the Portfolio Budget/Additional Estimates Statements.


The Defence Annual Report 2016–17 includes the mapping of the Defence Purposes from the 2016–17 Defence Corporate Plan, and the outcomes and programs from the Portfolio Budget/Additional Estimates Statements 2016–17. The 2016–17 Annual Performance Statements also includes a narrative detailing the level of achievement against each of the performance criteria in the Portfolio Budget Statements.


Defence is continuing to improve the alignment between the non-financial performance information in the Portfolio Budget Statements and the Defence Corporate Plan to establish a clearer read about how Defence is fulfilling its purposes.




Recommendation 3



The Committee recommends that the Department of Defence develop a transparent reporting mechanism that demonstrates changes in effectiveness or efficiency resultant from the First Principles Review related change for consideration by the Defence Sub-Committee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade by 31 March 2018.



Government response





Agree.



Defence agrees in principle with Recommendation 3, but suggests that the timeframe be amended to 31 July 2018.


Defence notes that a number of improvements relating to efficiency and effectiveness have been gained by implementing the First Principles Review.


The Government has asked Defence to provide an update on First Principles Review implementation, including progress measuring and reporting on improvements in effectiveness and efficiency, in July 2018. Given the timing of work already underway to measure efficiency and effectiveness and the existing requirement to report to Government in July 2018, Defence suggests that it would also be appropriate to provide the Defence Sub-Committee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade with an update on measurement and reporting of effectiveness and efficiency improvements in July 2018.



Recommendation 4



The Committee recommends the Department of Defence consider leveraging private sector expertise during Investment Committee Gate Zero deliberations; where the addition of an industry expert may increase public confidence in approach to market decisions.



Government response





Agree.



Defence agrees with the intent of Recommendation 4. Defence will leverage private sector expertise in the development of Gate Zero proposals but does not propose industry representatives be invited into the Investment Committee as a part of the deliberative process. Defence intends to strike the right balance between early industry engagement and leveraging industry experience, whilst maintaining a competitive environment and protecting the Commonwealth's negotiating position.


Industry will be engaged at multiple points up to and including Gate Zero. Defence intends to leverage industry's expertise in a number of ways, including but not limited to:


Ongoing engagement through the Australian Industry Capability Program and the Centre for Defence Industry Capability;


Participation in Rapid Assessments, a Defence Innovation Hub service offering being developed to seek industry input and advice as part of a capability risk reduction and / or requirements definition activity;


Engagement through the Defence Innovation framework, including the Defence Innovation Hub, the Next Generation Technology Fund, and the Special Notice mechanism where industry is invited to identify options to address capability challenges;


Industry involvement in the Force Design process through the Defence Capability Assessment Program; and


Industry engagement in the context of Defence's Smart Buyer workshops which inform the Investment Committee's consideration of Gate Zero proposals.



Recommendation 5



The Committee recommends that the Department of Defence work with the Defence Sub-Committee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade to harmonise and streamline reporting matrices to the Parliament to allow for independent Parliamentary oversight.



Government response





Disagree.



The Department of Finance has issued guidance to Commonwealth entities on how to meet the obligations under the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 (PGPA Act) and the PGPA Rule 2014 to provide a transparent approach to reporting on performance to Parliament.


In accordance with the Department of Finance's Resource Management Guides, Defence prepares a corporate plan and annual performance statements in the annual report.




Recommendation 6



The Committee recommends that the Department of Defence improve:


the consistency between the Defence Portfolio Budget Statements and the Defence Annual Report;


the reporting of Departmental expenditure on major projects in real as opposed to out-turn dollars; and


the reporting on the cost and status of Australian Defence Force capability.



Government response



Recommendation 6.1: Agree. The 2015–16 Annual Performance Statements, published in the Defence Annual Report 2015 –16 are the first statements produced by Commonwealth entities under the PGPA Act. The 2016–17 Annual Performance Statements in the Defence Annual Report 2016 –17 demonstrated greater alignment between the outcomes in the Portfolio Budget Statements 2016–17 and the purposes in the 2016–17 Defence Corporate Plan. This enhanced the narrative of Defence's non-financial performance for the reporting period.


The Defence Annual Report 2016–17 also improved the transparency of reporting on planned expenditure set out in the Portfolio Budget Statements. This reporting will continue to mature in future reporting periods.


Recommendation 6.2: Disagree. Government approvals are required and obtained on an out-turned basis. To allow effective performance reporting, budget estimates are reported on the current price basis against actual expenditure.


Recommendation 6.3: Disagree. The Defence Annual Report does disclose results and performance in relation to the Defence Workforce (2015-16 Defence Annual Report Chapter 7). Additionally the online version of the 2015-16 Defence Annual Report includes comparable information published within the Portfolio Budget Statements and the Portfolio Additional Estimates Statements on Acquisition, Sustainment and Facilities and Infrastructure.


Improvement in performance reporting must take into account that the level of aggregation and disambiguation required to make the report suitable for publication at the Unclassified level may compromise the meaning of the information, to the point that it becomes potentially misleading.


The Australian Defence Force Headquarters Governance and Coordination will work with line areas conducting performance reporting to improve the quality of performance reporting provided, within the constraints of the Australian Government Protective Security Policy Framework.




Recommendation 7



The Committee recommends that the Department of Defence investigate opportunities to partner with industry to advance research and innovation on space capabilities.



Government response





Agree.



Defence is already working with industry to develop innovative space related capabilities, including through the Defence Innovation Hub and the Centre for Defence Industry Capability.




Recommendation 8



The Committee recommends that the Department of Defence review the Plan Suakin scope and objective; its implementation timeframe and resourcing to ensure that this signature program is and continues to meet all of the Department's personnel capability needs.



Government response





Agree.



Since the Defence Annual Report 2015–16 was tabled the Services have implemented all but one component of the Australian Defence Force (ADF) Total Workforce Model, designed and developed by Project Suakin. A robust evaluation plan has been put in place to monitor the benefits envisaged by implementing the Total Workforce Model. Suakin as a project will close four years earlier than envisaged.


Navy, Army and Air Force are now able to apply a range of innovative service arrangements that enable them to provide Defence capability through a flexible, contemporary and sustainable workforce. The Total Workforce Model provides individual ADF members with access to service arrangements that allows them to better balance their personal and military commitments. This enhances Defence's position as an employer of choice and improves its prospects of attracting and retaining key ADF personnel.




Recommendation 9



The Committee recommends that the Department of Defence urgently review security clearance processes, resourcing and timeframe to ensure all organisations that require the Australian Government Security Vetting Agency to complete vetting and subsequent re-assessment of clearances are being serviced in a timely manner.



Government response





Disagree.



The Australian Government Security Vetting Agency (AGSVA) completed a review in 2016 and commenced a reform and renewal program which has significantly improved performance in the following 2 years.


AGSVA continues to work closely with stakeholders to identify further reforms and improvements in business processes to develop a sustainable whole of government capability to meet higher clearance demand into the future.




Recommendation 10



The Committee recommends that the Department of Veterans' Affairs investigate options for an independent authority to review all unsuccessful Veterans' Review Board determinations in consultation with the affected veteran or their delegate to alleviate the stress and burden of making their own case to appeal.



Government response





Agree in part.



The Department of Veterans' Affairs has committed to undertaking an Advocacy Service Models Scoping Study in response to this recommendation and to the following two recommendations of the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade report: The Constant Battle: Suicide by Veterans:


Recommendation 23:




The Australian Government establish a Bureau of Veterans
'
 Advocates to represent veterans, commission legal representation where required, train advocates for veterans and be responsible for advocate insurance issues.



and


Recommendation 24:



The Australian Government establish an independent review to assess whether further support mechanisms for veterans appearing before the Veterans
'
 Review Board are required:


Among other things, the Scoping Study will examine:


current challenges and barriers in accessing entitlements and services, and the impact this has on veterans' wellbeing;


needs of different veteran cohorts for professionalised advocacy support and the potential benefits to each cohort;


different models for professionalised advocacy both within Australia and overseas to determine the most suitable model;


governance and quality frameworks available to deliver professionalised advocacy and service models; and


roles and responsibilities of traditional, new and emerging stakeholders within the veteran community and articulating the value and contribution of those roles and responsibilities in professionalising veterans' advocacy.

Airports Amendment Bill 2018


We all recognise the 22 Australian federal leased airports are critical infrastructure assets to our nation's productivity and economic growth. 


The Government regulates planning and development on our airport sites through the Airports Act 1996. Under the Airports Act, all federal leased airports (except Mount Isa and Tenant Creek) are required to prepare a master plan every five years to establish a strategic direction for efficient and economic development at the airport as well as prepare major development plans for specific major on-airport developments. 


The Airports Act sets out the required content of each plan and prescribes the public consultation process an airport lessee company must undertake prior to the plan being submitted for Ministerial consideration. On average, the current legislative process requires an airport lessee company to expend significant resources and it can take the company two years on average to develop each plan. 


Certain aspects of these processes are generating inefficient outcomes for industry as well as imposing unnecessary and onerous administrative and compliance costs. I also recognise on-airport developments are not immune to fluctuations in the marketplace and the economic climate. 


The measures contained in this Airports Amendment Bill 2018 will fine-tune existing regulation and streamline policy intentions; it will not significantly shift policy or regulatory oversight. It reinforces the Government's commitment to implement measures consistent with its deregulation and productivity agendas. The Bill offers a more proportionate and efficiency-based regulatory approach that reduces administrative and compliance costs for operators. It also creates regulatory certainty for industry and maintains appropriate and effective regulatory oversight.


This Bill can be considered in three parts. 


Part one proposes two key changes to the existing master plan process, the first of which is to implement a differential master plan cycle to enable federal leased airports, other than the major airports; Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth, and Sydney (Kingsford-Smith), to submit a master plan every eight years instead of every five years. 


All federal leased airports are currently required to prepare a new master plan every five years irrespective of the operational, administrative, resourcing and financial capacity of individual airports or the level of impact their operations have on the community. Implementing an eight year master plan cycle for secondary and general aviation airports, will minimise the impacts of these factors.


I also recognise that implementation timeframes of various components of the master plan, including key airport infrastructure projects and other aviation and non-aviation developments, the ground transport plan and environment strategy, generally extend beyond the current five year submission cycle. Therefore, this amendment aims to enable longer-term planning at these secondary and general aviation airports. 


Please note, this amendment will not change the current situation for Sydney West Airport; it will maintain a five year cycle along with the other four major federal leased airports, once the airport is operational.


The second change is to mandate the inclusion of a new Australian Noise Exposure Forecast in each new master plan. While the Airports Act currently requires an Australian Noise Exposure Forecast must be included in a master plan, it does not specify the Australian Noise Exposure Forecast must be renewed for each new plan. 



The Australian Noise Exposure Forecast is a computer generated descriptor of aircraft noise widely used by State, Territory, Local Governments and land use planning agencies for long-term planning and development arrangements around airport sites. 


Therefore, the Government maintains it is essential each new master plan contain the most up-to-date information to facilitate integrated, balanced and coherent planning outcomes and to inform incompatible and sensitive land uses from encroaching too close to airports.


Part two of the Bill relates specifically to the monetary trigger for a major development plan. 


Major development plans are required for each major airport development at federal leased airports, excluding Tennant Creek and Mount Isa. The Airports Act prescribes the circumstances which trigger a major development plan, including a monetary trigger, for certain development where the cost of construction exceeds $20 million.


In 2007 the Airports Act was amended to increase the monetary threshold from $10 million to $20 million due to ongoing increases in building costs since the Act came into effect. Further increases to the construction activity costs and inflation since 2007 have resulted in an increased number of on-airport developments unnecessarily triggering the requirement for a major development plan. 


The Bill proposes to increase the current $20 million monetary trigger for a major development plan to $25 million. The monetary threshold will be reviewed and revised via legislative instrument every three years; having regard to changes in construction activity costs and associated indexations to ensure the monetary trigger accurately reflects and keeps pace with economic and marketplace conditions. 


The Bill further proposes an additional legislative instrument to clarify the type of construction activities that should and should not be included when calculating if a project triggers the monetary threshold for a major development plan. For example, airports must include costs for base building fitout in its calculations. Base building fitout includes the internal cladding to finish off the base building prior to tenancy fitout. However, the airport is not required to include tenant specific fitout costs and tenant supplied items. This instrument will remove any confusion for industry and ensure a consistent costing application across all federal leased airports.


Part three of the Bill relates specifically to major development plan processes. 


The first amendment imposes a new 15 business day statutory decision timeframe within which the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport must consider applications from airport lessee companies for reduced consultation periods for major development plans, with such applications deemed refused if there is no Ministerial decision within this timeframe. 


This amendment will not impact the prescribed requirements for public consultation, however it will provide industry with certainty about the Ministerial decision timeframe, which could then be accounted for in the airport's planning process. 


The final amendments proposed in this Bill relate to substantial completion of an approved major development plan. 


The Airports Act currently requires an approved major development plan to be substantially completed, unless otherwise specified in the approval, within a maximum of five years with only one option for the Minister to extend the period by up to a further two years. 


While the majority of approved major development plans are completed in the prescribed timeframe, on rare occasions some larger or more complex developments, such as a new runway, may be subject to unforeseen delays and exceptional circumstances beyond airports' control. As a result, achieving a substantially complete status may require more than the standard seven year timeframe. 


Where an airport is committed to substantially completing an approved major development plan, the airport should be given the opportunity to do so without the threat of legislative penalty. Therefore, the Bill proposes to remove the restriction on the number of times the Minister may extend the timeframe for substantial completion. 


In rare circumstances a project with an approved major development plan may become unviable due to exceptional and unforeseen circumstances beyond airports' control. For such instances, where the project has not commenced, the Bill proposes the airport can notify the Minister of its intentions to not proceed with the approved major development plan without the threat of legislative penalty.


These amendments recognise that airports would have already expended significant financial and administrative resources to have a major development plan approved. Therefore, these amendments will minimise regulatory uncertainty for airports and industry and ensure an efficient and streamlined process. 


The Bill also includes:


a minor amendment to correct an existing error; 


a technical amendment to insert a word to complete a provision; and 


a technical amendment to remove a provision that has been spent for some time.


On a final note, I would like to acknowledge our airports are nationally significant infrastructure assets that keep us connected to each other and connect Australia to the world. They continue to play a major role in driving the economic development of Australia as enablers of commerce and trade, and the social and economic benefits they provide to all Australians should not be understated.


This Bill is yet another example of this Government consulting with and responding to the needs of industry to achieve better regulatory outcomes for all.


I commend the Bill.


Legislation Amendment (Sunsetting Review and Other Measures) Bill 2018


The Legislation Amendment (Sunsetting Review and Other Measures) Bill 2018 seeks to improve and streamline the operation of legislative frameworks for Commonwealth Acts and Instruments by making amendments to various Acts, primarily the Legislation Act 2003 and Acts Interpretation Act 1901. 


The key purpose of the Bill is to implement those recommendations of the Report on the Operation of the Sunsetting Provisions in the Legislation Act 2003 that can only be addressed by legislative action. 


Last year, a review of the sunsetting provisions in the Legislation Act was conducted by a committee comprised of three senior Commonwealth public servants. 


The sunsetting provisions provide that a legislative instrument is automatically repealed approximately 10 years after commencement. Sunsetting ensures that legislative instruments are kept up to date and only remain in force for so long as they are needed.


The committee found that the sunsetting framework is, in general, fulfilling its stated purpose. As at 1 October 2017, over 2,000 legislative instruments have appeared on sunsetting lists tabled in Parliament under section 52 of the Legislation Act. Of those instruments, approximately 20% were allowed to sunset, 19% were actively repealed, and 24% were replaced (comprising approximately 63% of the listed instruments in total). These statistics indicate that the sunsetting framework has substantially contributed to keeping the statute book up-to-date.


The sunsetting of older legislative instruments is also an important mechanism for the Australian Government to reduce red tape, deliver clearer laws and align existing legislation with current government policy.


The Attorney-General's Department has made enhancements to administrative processes and internal guidance to assist Commonwealth rule‑makers and agencies to manage the sunsetting of their legislative instruments efficiently, effectively and in accordance with the law. 


However, some legislative action is necessary to further streamline and improve the operation of the scheme. 


This Bill seeks to include more flexibility in the sunsetting framework by broadening the scope of the Attorney-General's power to issue certificates of deferral of sunsetting and declarations of alignment of sunsetting. It also provides for greater parliamentary scrutiny of the exercise of these powers. 


The time restriction on the Parliament's power to roll over the sunsetting date of a legislative instrument will also be removed.


The Bill will provide that rules made by each of the federal courts are not subject to the sunsetting framework, as there are already numerous mechanisms in place to ensure that rules of court remain fit‑for‑purpose, relevant and required.


Further, this Bill provides a definition of 'sitting day' as it applies to the disallowance provisions of the Legislation Act. This definition is consistent with current practice, but will provide greater legal certainty about the status of legislative instruments in circumstances where the Parliament has sat on an unscheduled sitting day.


This Bill will also make minor changes to a number of provisions to clarify their operation, in particular the interaction between the disallowance, tabling and automatic repeal provisions of the Legislation Act. 


In addition to the amendments resulting from the recommendations of the committee, this Bill will make other minor and technical amendments to the Legislation Act and the Acts Interpretation Act to clarify their operation, resolve inconsistencies between provisions and simplify language. 


In particular, it will clarify that a provision in the Legislation Act allowing a legislative or notifiable instrument to commence before the instrument is registered operates despite any rule or principle of common law. Any retrospective commencement of a legislative or notifiable instrument, however, is displaced to the extent that the retrospective commencement adversely affects the rights or liabilities of a person other than the Commonwealth. This provides a protection against retrospectivity for adversely affected individuals without rendering an entire instrument or provision of an instrument ineffective in relation to all people both prospectively and retrospectively. 


It will also clarify the limits of the First Parliamentary Counsel's power to rectify an error on the Federal Register of Legislation. This error correction power ensures that administrative errors, such as lodgement of the incorrect version of an instrument or compilation for publication on the Register, can be rectified without requiring the rule‑maker to repeal and remake the instrument.


Finally, this Bill will clarify that, where an Act refers to a provision of another Act or State or Territory law, and that provision is repealed and re‑enacted, a reference to the repealed provision extends to the re-enacted provision even if it is differently numbered.


This Bill provides an opportunity to improve and streamline the legislative frameworks for Commonwealth Acts and delegated legislation that ensure Commonwealth laws are up-to-date, clear and align existing legislation with current government policy.


Public Sector Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 2018


The Public Sector Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 2018 includes four key changes relating to the superannuation arrangements for parliamentarians, judges and civilian employees of the Commonwealth.


The first key change concerns a measure announced in the 2012-13 Budget relating to a reduction in the tax concessions on superannuation contributions of very high income earners, which is known as the Division 293 tax.


In 2013, the legislation for several Commonwealth superannuation schemes was amended to allow a person to request that they be paid a lump sum amount from their scheme to meet their Division 293 tax liability. This is done using a Division 293 tax release authority.


The Judges' Pensions Act 1968 was not amended as judges are exempt from the Division 293 tax for constitutional reasons. However, there are a small number of non judges that have been granted the same status as judges for the purpose of membership of the Judges' Pensions Scheme. These non-judge members, and any future non-judge members, are subject to the Division 293 tax.


The Bill therefore includes amendments to the Judges' Pensions Act 1968 that are similar to those made to the legislation for other Commonwealth superannuation schemes.


The second key change included in the Bill is to amend the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Act 1948 to ensure that in all circumstances in the future that the calculation of any lump sum superannuation guarantee safety-net benefit payable to an estate is enough to ensure the Superannuation Guarantee requirements are met. 


The actuary for the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Scheme has advised that, in certain limited circumstances, in the future, the current calculation method would not produce a benefit that would meet the statutory minimum Superannuation Guarantee requirements.


Under the current provisions of the scheme, this could potentially occur in the future, where a scheme member dies who had retired after age 65; had very long service; who had converted a significant proportion of their pension into a lump sum; and has no spouse.


The Bill therefore includes amendments to the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Act 1948 to change the calculation method to ensure that any lump sum superannuation guarantee safety-net benefit payable to an estate will meet the statutory minimum Superannuation Guarantee requirements. The amendments do not increase any parliamentary pension entitlements for any individual members.


The third key change included in the Bill concerns reversionary superannuation benefits payable to or in respect of children. The Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Act 1948, the Judges' Pensions Act 1968, the Federal Circuit Court of Australia Act 1999, the Superannuation Act 1976 and the Superannuation Act 1922 provide for benefits to be payable to, or in respect of, a person who is the child of a deceased member of one of the schemes established by those Acts.


Generally, the requirement is that the child must prove that from the age of 16 and above, they remain in formal full time education to be eligible for a reversionary benefit. In addition, in some schemes where the child is between age 16 and 25 the child must also not be ordinarily in employment.


The amendments increase the minimum age that a child will have to meet the test of being in full time education from age 16 to age 18 and remove the requirement for an eligible child to not be ordinarily in employment.


This reflects that the majority of current children do not leave formal education until at least the age of 18 and that part-time and casual employment is common.


These changes are consistent with those that have already been made to the Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme.


The fourth key change included in the Bill is in relation to the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation Board. Under the changes, the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation Board will be reduced from eleven to nine directors. 


The Bill also includes two minor amendments to the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Act 1948. The first provides the Parliamentary Retiring Allowances Trust with the flexibility to pass a resolution without a meeting. However, this flexibility is subject to the Trust first determining in writing that it may make decisions without a meeting and setting out the way in which trustees are to indicate agreement with proposed decisions. The second allows an actuary other than only the Australian Government Actuary to provide advice in relation to the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Scheme.


The Bill also corrects a misdescribed amendment relating to the Judges' Pensions Act 1968.


Treasury Laws Amendment (OECD Multilateral Instrument) Bill 2018


This Bill represents another important step in demonstrating the Government's ongoing commitment to tackling multinational tax avoidance. 


The Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, commonly referred to as the Multilateral Instrument, is a key element of the OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Project, which identified fifteen specific areas in which countries should take action to address multinational tax evasion. The Multilateral Instrument is the output of BEPS Action 15. 


Under this Government Australia has been a strong supporter of the BEPS project, and remains at the forefront of global efforts to ensure that multinationals' profits are taxed in the jurisdiction where economic value is added or created. Since coming to office, the Government has implemented a comprehensive suite of integrity measures designed to prevent multinationals from shifting untaxed Australian profits offshore. 


The Multinational Instrument is a multilateral treaty that will modify the majority of Australia's bilateral tax treaties to include new integrity rules that will help prevent those treaties from being exploited for tax avoidance purposes. More specifically, and from an Australian perspective, it will include rules designed to: 


Ensure that income derived through fiscally transparent entities (such as partnerships and trusts) will only be eligible for treaty benefits, such as reduced taxation, in appropriate circumstances; 


Prevent entities from changing their jurisdiction of residence for tax purposes in order to obtain treaty benefits;


Ensure that tax treaty-based relief from double taxation does not result in double non-taxation (that is, no tax paid in either jurisdiction);


Clarify that Australia's tax treaties are not intended to facilitate tax avoidance or evasion; 


Provide Australia and its treaty partners with specific treaty-based anti-avoidance rules;


Prevent entities from inappropriately increasing their shareholdings in Australian companies in order to obtain reduced taxation on dividends; 


Prevent entities from avoiding capital gains tax by diluting their ownership interests in Australian land-rich entities shortly before disposing of those interests; 


Clarify that Australia's tax treaties do not restrict its right to tax its own residents; 


Prevent entities from fragmenting their business-related activities or engaging in contract-splitting to avoid having a permanent establishment (a taxable presence) in Australia or in a treaty partner. 


The Multilateral Instrument will also improve the effectiveness of tax treaty-based dispute resolution mechanisms, including by allowing taxpayers to refer unresolved disputes to independent and binding arbitration (where Australia's treaty partners agree to adopt these optional arbitration rules). These features will provide greater certainty to taxpayers in relation to tax treaty-related disputes. 


To date, 78 jurisdictions have signed the Multilateral Instrument. Australia signed it on 7 June 2017.


Pending its ratification by other jurisdictions, the Multilateral Instrument will modify the application of 31 of Australia's 44 bilateral tax treaties; that is Australia's tax treaties with Argentina, Belgium, Canada, Chile, China, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Fiji, Finland, France, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Malta, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Romania, Russia, Singapore, Slovakia, South Africa, Spain, Turkey and the United Kingdom. 


This innovative multilateral approach will generate significant time and cost savings for Australia, by avoiding the need to bilaterally renegotiate each of these treaties individually to achieve similar outcomes, a process that could take decades. 


Effective international cooperation is critical to maintaining the integrity of the international tax system and the Multilateral Instrument clearly demonstrates the results that such cooperation can produce. 


The Government is committed to continuing this cooperation and to working actively with the OECD and the G20, and bilaterally with Australia's tax treaty partners, to ensure that Australia's tax system remains fair and open, and keeps pace with international best practice.

Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (16:47):  I seek leave to move notices of motion Nos. 2 and 3, standing in my name, together. I also indicate that I intend to address my remarks to both motions.


Leave granted.




Senator BERNARDI:
  I move the following motions together:


That the Product Emissions Standards (Excise) Charges Regulations 2018, made under the Product Emissions Standards (Excise) Charges Act 2017, be disallowed [F2018L00762].


That the Product Emissions Standards (Customs) Charges Regulations 2018, made under the Product Emissions Standards (Customs) Charges Act 2017, be disallowed [F2018L00761].


I rise to talk about these disallowance motions before the Senate in respect to legislative instruments which I will summarise as the product emissions standards, customs and excise charges, regulations 2018. They were registered on 12 June 2018 and tabled in the Senate on 18 June 2018. These regulations prescribe the amount of levy or charge to be imposed on the import or manufacture of emissions controlled products, essentially off-road engines like those in boats, dirt bikes, ditch diggers, mowers, chainsaws and small generators. In essence, they are the carbon tax on whipper-snippers, lawnmowers and outboard engines that were identified at the very passage of this bill and yet they were blithely championed through and sponsored through in the absence of a great deal of information and supported by people who said they had nothing whatsoever to do with the climate agreement reached in Paris. They were wrong.


The initial focus of these new assessments and certifications will be on non-carbon emissions such as sulphur and nitrous oxide. But, as the years pass, the real focus will turn to carbon dioxide emissions, to squeeze fewer and fewer emissions out of these products by tightening fuel-burning efficiency standards and ensuring that only the cleanest products and technologies can ever make it into the Australian marketplace.


These costly new assessments and certifications will be carried out by new emissions regulators and our future carbon commissars. For this privilege, a levy will be charged by these commissars on a cost-recovery basis on the products assessed and certified, which will flow on to customers that just want to go about their business. This is a carbon tax by stealth. The new charge or levy will be set at 0.45 per cent of the value of each product made or imported. There is a value threshold, or a ceiling, of $20,000 to which the 0.45 per cent rate can be applied. This is to prevent high-value items being charged an assessment levy well beyond the regulatory costs of administration.


These regulations are a small part of a whole family of new red and green tape regulations coming down the pipeline. They're being foisted on Australian businesses and consumers in a thinly veiled attempt—you could even say the veil has been completely removed—to implement a carbon tax by stealth. It is a Turnbull government carbon tax instead of the more explicit Gillard-Greens carbon tax that we got six years ago. The Gillard-Greens carbon tax was comprehensively rejected by Australians, with all its paraphernalia and bureaucracies, at the 2013 election. But, due to a hostile Senate at the time—especially, if I may say, an erratic and spoiling Palmer United Party—egged on and propped up by an opportunistic ABC and other media cheerleaders, the Abbott government failed to abolish all or enough of the government bodies and legacy infrastructure that were shields for big climate. It failed to abolish or sufficiently gut the Rudd government's Renewable Energy Target, and we are all paying the price for that today. Nor had the Abbott government sufficiently made the case for zero emissions reductions or even more modest ones in the lead-up to the Paris climate conference in late 2015. Instead we've noticed in the last couple of days that Australia will be one of the only countries in the world to be legislating the Paris climate accord targets. This is an extension of that, because the disallowance relates to a bill in which the Paris climate accord is expressly mentioned.


All of this is costly and unnecessary, because even if Australia stops emitting any noxious fumes or carbon dioxide—even our Chief Scientist says it will make no difference at all to the global temperatures; it will make zero difference to the climate. Yet we are now faced with the very real prospect that there is going to be a tax on our whipper snippers, our lawnmowers, our leaf blowers and our outboard motors, and coming soon will be a tax on our farm machinery and a tax on cars—another tax on cars, I should say—all while this government says it's not true.


The consequences of these emissions policies have already crippled our electricity sector. It has saddled us with a weather-dependent and non-performing renewable energy sector. It is driving away the efficacious base load power sources like coal. Despite the rhetoric of the government, they are not technology agnostic or technology neutral in our electricity sector because they refuse to remove a blanket prohibition on nuclear power in this country. It is a power source that has been rolled out all over the world. The new generation of nuclear reactors for power are absolutely safe. You would have to defy the laws of physics in order to have something go wrong with them. They're not my words for it; I've met with experts in this field. They are being built and developed and rolled out all over the world, and Australia—with perhaps more uranium than any other country in the world—is, sadly, shutting our industry down. We're not even allowed to have a debate about it.


That proves just how dangerous this green ideology is. The one source of base-load power that can provide emissions-free electricity is nuclear, but they will not countenance it. We know there's an ideology here, and we know the ideology will disadvantage Australian citizens, and not only in the electricity sector, because that only accounts for 30 per cent of carbon dioxide emissions. They're dressing it up in these bills by saying, 'You could harm your health by mowing your lawn.' Believe it or not, that was in the explanatory memorandum. They're saving people from developing terrible diseases from mowing their lawn. It beggars belief. This is about tax. This is about going ahead with a controlling ideology that seeks to enslave the world, and that is the climate scam.


The coalition's proposed National Energy Guarantee, which is in effect an emissions intensity scheme—a type of carbon tax by any other name—in our electricity sector, tries to minimise supply costs and unreliability, but subject to certain emissions targets. This is all about emissions. It is by definition not technology neutral, as I've explained. As the Energy Security Board's modelling predicts, there will be no cheap, reliable base-load power entering our market, because it dare not, unless there are very special circumstances provided for, such as massive subsidies. The proposal is: the government will probably subsidise that which was previously efficient but was made inefficient and uneconomical through government subsidies of another technology. Because that has had this impact on base-load energy, the government will now be forced to subsidise that. It's a catch 22 of idiocy, if I can put it like that. It is a recipe for disaster. It's a massive offshoring of Australian business, economic activity and jobs, and everyone behind it needs to look the people who lose their jobs in the eye and say, 'It was my fault.' I'm prepared to look them in the eye and say, 'I don't want to be a part of this disaster.'


But, not content with having knotted out our electricity sector and our energy sector, which, as I said, is responsible for around one-third of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions, the focus is now turning to the specifics of the regulations around this motion. It's turning to emissions in other areas, such as the agricultural sector, particularly livestock. We know that livestock emit methane or carbon dioxide, so they're a target. We know that the transport sector is a target, particularly trucks and freight, and it's only a matter of time before cars are targeted. There were discussions by the energy minister, about 18 months ago, floating cars. He was forced to back-pedal and deny it, but this bill, from which these regulations emanate, allows for cars to be included in the future. We know that it affects on-road engines of the smaller variety—so light vehicles—and non-road spark engines, as I've mentioned, and marine engines. That's outboards, so every fisherman who wants to get a new outboard engine is going to be on the hook for paying a little bit more, because their old one is emitting too much.


That brings in the question: how does the second-hand market work? Will there be any market? Will you be able to sell your second-hand outboard motor? It will be deemed to be not compliant with the new regime. We're going to see it in blower vacs, chainsaws and small generators. And, might I add, this was justified by the government at the time on health grounds. People could develop respiratory illnesses from being too close to their outboard engine or their lawnmower. I just wonder how many people have been hospitalised from the fumes of lawnmowers. Perhaps, if they fall over and the lawnmower runs over them, they might get hacked up, but I'm yet to hear of someone hospitalised because of the fumes from mowing their lawn. That's how they justified it.


These regulations deal with the latter group of engines that I mentioned—the non-road engines and equipment—but they do create a part of a new bureaucratic architecture upon which the emissions from these non-road engines and equipment can be reined in and controlled, whether they're made here or overseas. It is part of a creeping rollout of a carbon tax by stealth. They'll call it a national emissions standards regime or they'll call it a National Energy Guarantee, but, however you want to dress it up, it is all about emissions and putting a price on carbon dioxide, a price that every Australian is going to pay, a price that is going to damage and impact the ability of people to live comfortably in this country that is blessed with an abundance of natural resources. Somehow it's okay for us to utilise them, or dig them up and ship them somewhere else for use, but we're not allowed to use them in our own country. 


It is a shameful indictment, I believe, and the effect of it will be felt very significantly in the years and decades to come, because there is a complete lack of will from both of the major parties to discuss the reality of what we're dealing with. They have all drunk the climate Kool Aid; they're not prepared to buck the system in which the United Nations gives us lectures. In pursuing these emissions trading standards—or these emissions intensity schemes or carbon tax by stealth—in order to get to the Paris climate accord agreement, they ignore the fact that Russia hasn't signed up, the United States has walked away and China and India are not subject to it until 2030, so good luck getting them on board. So 55 per cent of the global economy and the emissions-generating industry in the world is not signing up to the stuff that we're about to legislate about and that these regulations directly apply to, notwithstanding the statements from former Senator Malcolm Roberts, who said they didn't, when he was here supporting this legislation.


People need to understand what's going on here. The wool has been pulled over our eyes. The Australian people comprehensively rejected a carbon tax in 2013, yet here we are, scarcely five years later, and a coalition government is introducing an emissions intensity scheme in the form of their quaintly named National Energy Guarantee—it's like Safe Schools, if I could put it like that. Now we've got another carbon tax, an emissions intensity scheme, applying to people's weed-whackers, lawnmowers, leaf-blowers and outboard engines. These are things that add value to people's lives. 


I don't mind saying that the Conservative Party has no time whatsoever for this new regulatory architecture. It is a massive bureaucracy that is being put in place to operationalise Mr Turnbull's long-held ambition to be celebrated on the world stage and to have a carbon tax. Remember, Mr Turnbull wanted to support former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's emissions trading scheme. In fact, he crossed the floor to vote with it. He said he would never lead a party that wasn't as committed to action on climate change as he is. Well, he's actually got his wish. He's got his wish, but it's going to cost every single Australian. Saying that he's slightly less bad than the opposition doesn't cut the mustard in looking after the national interest. 


We need to disallow these regulations because they will have an impact on every Australian. We know, despite the protestations of the government when this was introduced, that this is all about complying with the Paris climate accord, an accord that, as I said, 55 per cent of the world's emitters of carbon dioxide are not at all engaged with. Yet Australia is about to put in place one plank of emissions intensity trading in the form of the National Energy Guarantee. The second plank, applying to a whole range of other engines, is in the form of these regulations. There will be a third plank, and that third plank will be in the agricultural sector. Then it may animate some in the National Party, who will say, 'Hey, we're sticking up for it.' But these regulations today can equally apply to farm machinery, to tractors and to off-road vehicles, all of which can have an impact on farmers. I'd ask them to think very carefully before supporting these regulations, because they are opening Pandora's box in respect of increasing bureaucracy and costs for all those involved.


It is going to drive up prices of emission-controlled products and it will drive down the range of products available. If you have any doubt, there was some modelling done on what it would cost Australian consumers if we were forced to comply with emissions criteria for motor vehicles similar to those they have in the European Union. The estimate is about $5,000 per car. We know that many of the motor vehicle manufacturers in the European Union were scamming their figures—they were just making them up and rigging the software system—so there was no material benefit. Yet it's coming down the pipe that these emissions standards will be put in place in Australia, and we'll all be paying more for it. In effect, we are stifling our country and choking the productive mass of our industry with green tape for absolutely zero gain.


As I said, these regulations are part of complying with the Paris climate accord. I believe, and the Australian Conservatives believe, we should walk away from the accord. We should never have signed it just a week after President Trump was actually elected in the United States, because that was one of his strongest election promises. Our competitors have virtually no constraints on their emissions, and we're going the full monty into it. We have put in place two of the three planks that will attempt to control our economy and put government at the centre of almost everything for absolutely zero environmental or climate benefit.


We've spent a decade debating the futility of these measures. Every time common sense seems to prevail, there seems to be a new attempt to impose these big taxes by stealth. I urge the Senate to disallow these regulations because I know that no amount of legislative and regulatory measures that attempt to enact the Paris creep will benefit our economy. Our economy stands at a crossroads. Government is already applying too many onerous costs, too many compliances and too many regulations on the people that are making a productive contribution to our way of life. I urge the government and I urge the Senate to disallow these regulations in the interest of all Australians.

Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (17:08):  Senator Bernardi will be unsurprised to know that we are not supporting this disallowance. I know in his contribution he thought he had us. I think it was just after, 'We reject the Paris agreement,' that perhaps we slipped away from you, Senator Bernardi!


In terms of the process, the Labor Party actually supported the primary legislation which led to these regulations. There were three bills in the package that came through that led to the regulations we have: the Product Emissions Standards Bill 2017, the Product Emissions Standards (Excise) Charges Bill 2017 and the Product Emissions Standards (Customs) Charges Bill 2017. I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't again say that I continue to be concerned that we're required to pass primary legislation and then, several months later, we actually have the regulations which bring in the detail of the primary legislation. So there were those bills, and there was one other that went with it, which was the Product Emissions Standards (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2017. We had the debate in this place and I think very similar arguments were raised in that debate, Senator Bernardi, as those that you've raised on the regulations. I think I remember some of those clauses—particularly the ones about the health issues.


The bills were directed to allow:


… the Minister to prescribe products as emissions-controlled products and make rules relating to those products …


and set emissions standards, as the regulations have detailed. Products include, and I won't run through the list that Senator Bernardi has—he has a particular love for the weed blower—non-road petrol engines, lawnmowers, leaf blowers and outboard motors. Those particular products were itemised. The bills also enabled exemptions, penalties, certification, and trigger compliance and enforcement.


So these were brought through to a number of areas where there was going to be some regulation—and there is. There is a regulation process in the development of what came after months of consultation with industry, with health. Certainly, we know the health impacts of these particular products were studied. There was a great deal of evidence provided that there could well be health impacts with the use of non-road petrol engines and the other products, with people breathing in the fumes. There was concern about the emissions, but they came forward and said that the bills would come through, that the excise and charges bills will also allow charges to be imposed on imports or, if applicable, domestic manufacture of emissions control products. Any pre-existing products that people had were exempt from the process, and we talked about that when we had the primary legislation debate. Labor supported the legislation. We said it was a step forward. We hoped that there would be movement towards creating greater awareness in our community about the needs, towards educating people so that they would understand how this would actually work, and towards gradually building up more knowledge and awareness of how all of these products could have an impact on our environment and on people's health.


We have got to the stage where we have regulations to spell it out. Again, this is based on making sure that there is awareness and there is education and discussion with people who both produce and use these products. It's a wide market; it touches people across our community. The regulations will have to be made public. We'll get discussions going around them. But we, as a party, are standing by the fact that in this case—and, sadly, only in this case—the government is moving to bring in some regulation and ensure that there are processes where there is an indication that we will move forward with emission reduction targets that will make a genuine difference.


Senator Bernardi, in his arguments—these are the same arguments that we have heard in debates in this place for a decade. As he said, there are people who feel that it's perfectly appropriate to take no action, to do nothing here in Australia, to ensure that we have no commitment to be part of the global response to the issues around climate change. It's very clear that Senator Bernardi and his party fit into that area. I know I'm not verballing him; I think my point is a fair one. The Labor Party have been arguing, both in government and in opposition, that it is an absolutely essential element that people in Australia are part of a global response. The Paris accord? Absolutely that was one which we signed up to as a nation. We regret the fact that there has not been more action taken by the government. We have consistently argued that there needs to be more action taken. That is a diametrically opposite position to that supported by Senator Bernardi. This debate this afternoon is on one small element of that process, but it actually reflects the core of the whole debate.


We believe that actions must be taken to be part of our response to global warming, to climate change; other people believe we don't have that role. We think these regulations that are coming through now will take a small step, sadly only a small step—actually, in some ways it's good that a small step has been taken. That's why Labor will be opposing this disallowance. We believe we've had the debate around the primary legislation, which actually has no implementation value if it doesn't have the regulations attached to it. It would be passing strange if we came into this place and supported the legislation and then supported this motion. Maybe Senator Bernardi was waiting for some Damascus-like conversion on this side, where we would suddenly 'understand' and that our longstanding public commitment to having an effective response and having an emissions trading process would somehow disappear during that period.


For us, sadly, that didn't occur, Senator Bernardi. We will be maintaining our support for this legislation and the supporting regulation. We will continue to argue that we have to do more. We have said, and our shadow minister, Mr Butler, has said consistently in the other place, that there needs to be more ambition around this process. We need to have more action, more engagement with the community and more engagement with people who are working so hard in industries across our country and internationally to come up with better ways to see where we can have a stronger response and stronger action. Given that, my job this afternoon is to reinforce the position we took when the legislation came through, to support the action that the government has made and to hope for more into the future. But we will absolutely be rejecting this disallowance motion and calling for more action into the future.

Senator PAYNE
 (New South Wales—Minister for Defence) (17:15):  In relation to these notices of motion for disallowance, I can advise the Senate that the government's view is that the Product Emissions Standards Rules give effect to the Product Emissions Standards Act, which was passed through this chamber last year. Disallowing these rules will block a significant outcome which has been more than 10 years in the making with a $1.7 billion benefit in avoided healthcare costs. These rules set standards for the import and sale of new two-stroke engines, but they don't impact existing owners. These products can contribute up to 10 per cent of pollution in urban areas. The rules are about maintaining clean air for all Australians. They have been in effect since 1 July this year, and disallowing them at this point would cause industry a great deal of uncertainty and would come at a significant cost. The standards are fully cost recovered, with the vast majority of funding coming from a 0.45 per cent levy on the value of imports, which equates to 90c on a $200 imported lawnmower. The levy regulations enable the levy to be calculated and then recovered. If they're disallowed we would be left in a position where those standards would not be able to be enforced.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Whish-Wilson

Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (16:47):  I seek leave to move notices of motion Nos. 2 and 3, standing in my name, together. I also indicate that I intend to address my remarks to both motions.


Leave granted.




Senator BERNARDI:
  I move the following motions together:


That the Product Emissions Standards (Excise) Charges Regulations 2018, made under the Product Emissions Standards (Excise) Charges Act 2017, be disallowed [F2018L00762].


That the Product Emissions Standards (Customs) Charges Regulations 2018, made under the Product Emissions Standards (Customs) Charges Act 2017, be disallowed [F2018L00761].


I rise to talk about these disallowance motions before the Senate in respect to legislative instruments which I will summarise as the product emissions standards, customs and excise charges, regulations 2018. They were registered on 12 June 2018 and tabled in the Senate on 18 June 2018. These regulations prescribe the amount of levy or charge to be imposed on the import or manufacture of emissions controlled products, essentially off-road engines like those in boats, dirt bikes, ditch diggers, mowers, chainsaws and small generators. In essence, they are the carbon tax on whipper-snippers, lawnmowers and outboard engines that were identified at the very passage of this bill and yet they were blithely championed through and sponsored through in the absence of a great deal of information and supported by people who said they had nothing whatsoever to do with the climate agreement reached in Paris. They were wrong.


The initial focus of these new assessments and certifications will be on non-carbon emissions such as sulphur and nitrous oxide. But, as the years pass, the real focus will turn to carbon dioxide emissions, to squeeze fewer and fewer emissions out of these products by tightening fuel-burning efficiency standards and ensuring that only the cleanest products and technologies can ever make it into the Australian marketplace.


These costly new assessments and certifications will be carried out by new emissions regulators and our future carbon commissars. For this privilege, a levy will be charged by these commissars on a cost-recovery basis on the products assessed and certified, which will flow on to customers that just want to go about their business. This is a carbon tax by stealth. The new charge or levy will be set at 0.45 per cent of the value of each product made or imported. There is a value threshold, or a ceiling, of $20,000 to which the 0.45 per cent rate can be applied. This is to prevent high-value items being charged an assessment levy well beyond the regulatory costs of administration.


These regulations are a small part of a whole family of new red and green tape regulations coming down the pipeline. They're being foisted on Australian businesses and consumers in a thinly veiled attempt—you could even say the veil has been completely removed—to implement a carbon tax by stealth. It is a Turnbull government carbon tax instead of the more explicit Gillard-Greens carbon tax that we got six years ago. The Gillard-Greens carbon tax was comprehensively rejected by Australians, with all its paraphernalia and bureaucracies, at the 2013 election. But, due to a hostile Senate at the time—especially, if I may say, an erratic and spoiling Palmer United Party—egged on and propped up by an opportunistic ABC and other media cheerleaders, the Abbott government failed to abolish all or enough of the government bodies and legacy infrastructure that were shields for big climate. It failed to abolish or sufficiently gut the Rudd government's Renewable Energy Target, and we are all paying the price for that today. Nor had the Abbott government sufficiently made the case for zero emissions reductions or even more modest ones in the lead-up to the Paris climate conference in late 2015. Instead we've noticed in the last couple of days that Australia will be one of the only countries in the world to be legislating the Paris climate accord targets. This is an extension of that, because the disallowance relates to a bill in which the Paris climate accord is expressly mentioned.


All of this is costly and unnecessary, because even if Australia stops emitting any noxious fumes or carbon dioxide—even our Chief Scientist says it will make no difference at all to the global temperatures; it will make zero difference to the climate. Yet we are now faced with the very real prospect that there is going to be a tax on our whipper snippers, our lawnmowers, our leaf blowers and our outboard motors, and coming soon will be a tax on our farm machinery and a tax on cars—another tax on cars, I should say—all while this government says it's not true.


The consequences of these emissions policies have already crippled our electricity sector. It has saddled us with a weather-dependent and non-performing renewable energy sector. It is driving away the efficacious base load power sources like coal. Despite the rhetoric of the government, they are not technology agnostic or technology neutral in our electricity sector because they refuse to remove a blanket prohibition on nuclear power in this country. It is a power source that has been rolled out all over the world. The new generation of nuclear reactors for power are absolutely safe. You would have to defy the laws of physics in order to have something go wrong with them. They're not my words for it; I've met with experts in this field. They are being built and developed and rolled out all over the world, and Australia—with perhaps more uranium than any other country in the world—is, sadly, shutting our industry down. We're not even allowed to have a debate about it.


That proves just how dangerous this green ideology is. The one source of base-load power that can provide emissions-free electricity is nuclear, but they will not countenance it. We know there's an ideology here, and we know the ideology will disadvantage Australian citizens, and not only in the electricity sector, because that only accounts for 30 per cent of carbon dioxide emissions. They're dressing it up in these bills by saying, 'You could harm your health by mowing your lawn.' Believe it or not, that was in the explanatory memorandum. They're saving people from developing terrible diseases from mowing their lawn. It beggars belief. This is about tax. This is about going ahead with a controlling ideology that seeks to enslave the world, and that is the climate scam.


The coalition's proposed National Energy Guarantee, which is in effect an emissions intensity scheme—a type of carbon tax by any other name—in our electricity sector, tries to minimise supply costs and unreliability, but subject to certain emissions targets. This is all about emissions. It is by definition not technology neutral, as I've explained. As the Energy Security Board's modelling predicts, there will be no cheap, reliable base-load power entering our market, because it dare not, unless there are very special circumstances provided for, such as massive subsidies. The proposal is: the government will probably subsidise that which was previously efficient but was made inefficient and uneconomical through government subsidies of another technology. Because that has had this impact on base-load energy, the government will now be forced to subsidise that. It's a catch 22 of idiocy, if I can put it like that. It is a recipe for disaster. It's a massive offshoring of Australian business, economic activity and jobs, and everyone behind it needs to look the people who lose their jobs in the eye and say, 'It was my fault.' I'm prepared to look them in the eye and say, 'I don't want to be a part of this disaster.'


But, not content with having knotted out our electricity sector and our energy sector, which, as I said, is responsible for around one-third of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions, the focus is now turning to the specifics of the regulations around this motion. It's turning to emissions in other areas, such as the agricultural sector, particularly livestock. We know that livestock emit methane or carbon dioxide, so they're a target. We know that the transport sector is a target, particularly trucks and freight, and it's only a matter of time before cars are targeted. There were discussions by the energy minister, about 18 months ago, floating cars. He was forced to back-pedal and deny it, but this bill, from which these regulations emanate, allows for cars to be included in the future. We know that it affects on-road engines of the smaller variety—so light vehicles—and non-road spark engines, as I've mentioned, and marine engines. That's outboards, so every fisherman who wants to get a new outboard engine is going to be on the hook for paying a little bit more, because their old one is emitting too much.


That brings in the question: how does the second-hand market work? Will there be any market? Will you be able to sell your second-hand outboard motor? It will be deemed to be not compliant with the new regime. We're going to see it in blower vacs, chainsaws and small generators. And, might I add, this was justified by the government at the time on health grounds. People could develop respiratory illnesses from being too close to their outboard engine or their lawnmower. I just wonder how many people have been hospitalised from the fumes of lawnmowers. Perhaps, if they fall over and the lawnmower runs over them, they might get hacked up, but I'm yet to hear of someone hospitalised because of the fumes from mowing their lawn. That's how they justified it.


These regulations deal with the latter group of engines that I mentioned—the non-road engines and equipment—but they do create a part of a new bureaucratic architecture upon which the emissions from these non-road engines and equipment can be reined in and controlled, whether they're made here or overseas. It is part of a creeping rollout of a carbon tax by stealth. They'll call it a national emissions standards regime or they'll call it a National Energy Guarantee, but, however you want to dress it up, it is all about emissions and putting a price on carbon dioxide, a price that every Australian is going to pay, a price that is going to damage and impact the ability of people to live comfortably in this country that is blessed with an abundance of natural resources. Somehow it's okay for us to utilise them, or dig them up and ship them somewhere else for use, but we're not allowed to use them in our own country. 


It is a shameful indictment, I believe, and the effect of it will be felt very significantly in the years and decades to come, because there is a complete lack of will from both of the major parties to discuss the reality of what we're dealing with. They have all drunk the climate Kool Aid; they're not prepared to buck the system in which the United Nations gives us lectures. In pursuing these emissions trading standards—or these emissions intensity schemes or carbon tax by stealth—in order to get to the Paris climate accord agreement, they ignore the fact that Russia hasn't signed up, the United States has walked away and China and India are not subject to it until 2030, so good luck getting them on board. So 55 per cent of the global economy and the emissions-generating industry in the world is not signing up to the stuff that we're about to legislate about and that these regulations directly apply to, notwithstanding the statements from former Senator Malcolm Roberts, who said they didn't, when he was here supporting this legislation.

Given that, my job this afternoon is to reinforce the position we took when the legislation came through, to support the action that the government has made and to hope for more into the future. But we will absolutely be rejecting this disallowance motion and calling for more action into the future.

Senator PAYNE
 (New South Wales—Minister for Defence) (17:15):  In relation to these notices of motion for disallowance, I can advise the Senate that the government's view is that the Product Emissions Standards Rules give effect to the Product Emissions Standards Act, which was passed through this chamber last year. Disallowing these rules will block a significant outcome which has been more than 10 years in the making with a $1.7 billion benefit in avoided healthcare costs. These rules set standards for the import and sale of new two-stroke engines, but they don't impact existing owners. These products can contribute up to 10 per cent of pollution in urban areas. The rules are about maintaining clean air for all Australians. They have been in effect since 1 July this year, and disallowing them at this point would cause industry a great deal of uncertainty and would come at a significant cost. The standards are fully cost recovered, with the vast majority of funding coming from a 0.45 per cent levy on the value of imports, which equates to 90c on a $200 imported lawnmower. The levy regulations enable the levy to be calculated and then recovered. If they're disallowed we would be left in a position where those standards would not be able to be enforced.

(

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (17:25):  Just as we headed into senators' statements, I was making a point about the contribution to the debate by Senator Steele-John with regard to people with disability. I acknowledged the importance of his contribution to the debate. I also wanted to put on the record the words of the much loved Stella Young, Australian comedian, writer and disability advocate, who wrote on the implications of legalising assisted suicide for people living with disabilities. I acknowledge that many of us felt we lost an amazing Australian with her passing. This is what she said:


People make all sorts of assumptions about the quality of my life and my levels of independence. They're almost always wrong.


I've lost count of the number of times I've been told, ""I just don't think I could live like you,"" or ""I wouldn't have the courage in your situation,"" or, my favourite one to overhear (and I've overheard it more than once), ""You'd just bloody top yourself, wouldn't you?"".


…   …   …


Also, social attitudes towards disabled people come from a medical profession that takes a deficit view of disability. This is my major concern with legalising assisted death; that it will give doctors more control over our lives.


Senator Steele-John's confidence in legislators to create legislation that adequately protects people is a confidence I don't share. In my view, legislation, no matter how well crafted, considered and critiqued, cannot cover all the areas of concern that have been articulated in this place by many—and, hopefully, with some clarity in my contribution to the debate this morning. I'm also sure that there are many more concerns that haven't been raised in the course of this debate that are yet to be elicited and will deserve careful consideration. In my view, we're all right to fear assisted suicide as an extension of an increasingly alarming statistic of self-harm and suicide that reveals the despair of so many in our nation at this time.


Senators, data consistently demonstrates lower support for euthanasia and assisted suicide amongst physicians than the public. There's a reason for that. They know a lot more than most of us about the way in which people move on from this life. They see it all the time. They fight against death's victory every day. But to ask them to take a different position in relation to death, to demand by law that they offer services to the end of life, is fraught with extreme practical and moral risk for the medical profession and, indeed, for all of us and our families. Physician-assisted suicide is legal in the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Colombia, Canada and five US states as well as in Switzerland. Research that reviews the practices of those jurisdictions indicates that between 0.3 per cent and up to 4.6 per cent of deaths are reported as euthanasia. If we were to apply that 4.6 per cent of deaths to the Australian death statistics of 2016, which were 158,504 Australians, that would mean 7,291 Australians could be removed from this world by assisted euthanasia if we were to follow these international trends. In jurisdictions where assisted suicide has been legislated for some time, the legislative containment that accompanied those first laws has slackened. Research shows that safeguards are being violated, with studies in Belgium now indicating that up to 32 per cent of physicians assisting suicide had gone outside the regulations. 


Former Prime Minister Paul Keating published an article last year in the context of the Victorian debate. He said:


… the advocates support a bill to authorise termination of life in the name of compassion, while at the same time claiming they can guarantee protection of the vulnerable, the depressed and the poor.


No law and no process can achieve that objective. This is the point. If there are doctors prepared to bend the rules now, there will be doctors prepared to bend the rules under the new system.


The original containment of eligibility for assisted suicide has been extended in those jurisdictions in which assisted suicide is now legal. It's been extended from consenting adults to young children to the mentally ill to newborns with disabilities. I remind senators that right now in this country one in five Australians at any time are suffering from mental ill-health of some sort. In 2016, 2,866 Australians lost their lives to suicide. Research revealed around 65,000 people attempted suicide every year and that hundreds of thousands of people are affected by the impact of a suicide death. We're on a collision course between this national malaise and the potential of assisted suicide legislation, especially when depression and cancer collide. I want to note that the finding reported in European Psychiatry in 2012 indicates that family members in Switzerland who assisted the suicide of someone they loved reported after the fact a 20 per cent rate of post-traumatic stress disorder.


I will not be supporting this bill. I'm accused of being a person of faith and I freely admit to it. My faith does colour my view of the world and it enriches it. I've often wondered what people mean when they make a case for euthanasia by arguing that people should be allowed to die with dignity. In my world view, every person has dignity and value simply because they exist. It matters not their sex, gender, age, colour, race or, certainly, creed. I can never be persuaded that human beings need to have control over their bodies or their minds to have dignity. In my world view, each and every person, from conception to their last breath, is endowed with a dignity that is inherent in their very existence. Dignity is not something you lose on your journey to death.


How can legislating for the healers at the heart of our health system to actively bring on death not be a conflict of interest for doctors? How can legislating for the healers at the heart of our health system to actively assist in suicide not immerse them daily under the extreme burden of ongoing and profound moral dilemma? The profession itself is not united in asking for these powers. Indeed, there is a very lively debate amongst doctors on the public record. 


Like everyone in this place and like Australians across the country, I've lost people I love, four of them in my close family: my sister, my brother, my niece and my father—all from cancer, all from the illness that evidence shows triggers up to 75 per cent of the requests for assisted suicide. I've been in hospitals with the people I love as they have passed. Today seems a very good day to thank all those health professionals who cared for them as they passed and who cared for me and my family as we faced the profound loss and the initial throes of grief that engulfed us. I never for one moment doubted their care or their determination to preserve the lives of the people I love. 


Colleagues, in this place we know there has been the articulation of the awareness of the complexity around making law around end-of-life procedures. This complexity—if this bill passes here and we do allow the territories to discern their own particular legislation—cannot be overstated. I remind colleagues that the Northern Territory and the ACT are both unicameral parliaments—as, indeed, is the great state of Queensland. I fear that the march across this nation towards the establishment of assisted suicide continues and that we may see the emergence of differentiated legislation that will deal with life and death in different ways across all of the jurisdictions. We train doctors for all of the country, yet we're preparing, with this legislation, to create rights that will differentiate responsibilities across the borders. 


In closing, colleagues, this debate asks us to consider and come to a point of discernment about conflicting principles. On one side, there is the right of the individual and their autonomy, a position so championed here today by this bill advanced by the libertarian Senator Leyonhjelm and supported by many in this chamber. I put it to you, senators, that there is a disproportionate response to the issues of both mental and physical distress that have been discussed in the Senate over the course of the last two days. This is an argument that drives us to wholesale change to law at the request of few, to the detriment of many. Assisted suicide cannot, in my view, be safely legislated. On the other side is the right of the public to safety and natural assumptions and instincts that drive us to make lawful the protection of life. 


I believe in the fundamental right of a person to live in a society that values their life. This should not be put at risk. A community needs to ensure that institutions such as the law and the professions—especially our doctors—value lives, will save lives and will not take life. I close with Paul Keating's comments:


No matter what justifications are offered for the bill, it constitutes an unacceptable departure in our approach to human existence and the irrevocable sanctity that should govern our understanding of what it means to be human.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2018-08-15,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister for Finance, Special Minister of State and Vice-President of the Executive Council) (17:37):  I rise to speak to this bill, the Restoring Territory Rights (Assisted Suicide Legislation) Bill 2015, which seeks to undo a decision of this parliament 21 years ago. The vote on this bill is, rightly, a conscience issue because good people across Australia have strongly held views on both sides of this argument. Personally, I will vote against this bill, and that is because, as a matter of deep personal conviction and faith, I am committed to upholding the dignity of human life. 


There is no circumstance in which I could or would vote in support of any bill which would either directly or indirectly legalise or facilitate the state sanctioned taking of a human life. Of course, like all in this chamber, I want to see the right care and support available for our terminally ill. I want to see high-quality care for those that go through this very difficult process as they approach the end of their life—the appropriate pain relief and palliative care to help facilitate dying with dignity. But I cannot support the official, state sanctioned, deliberate taking of a human life. It goes against everything I believe to be right. I do not believe there is a safe way that it can be legislated. I do not believe it can be legislated in a way which provides the appropriate protections to the vulnerable, depressed or the poor. 


Some have argued that this is not a bill to legalise assisted suicide or euthanasia but rather a bill to uphold states' rights. I would submit to the Senate that this is objectively wrong. Firstly, by definition, the territories are not states; they are territories. Under section 122 of our Constitution, the power to make laws for the government of any territory rests with the Commonwealth parliament. Having the constitutional power gives us the constitutional responsibility. We can't abrogate that responsibility. If we, as the Commonwealth parliament, vote in favour of this legislation, we are effectively voting in favour of legalising assisted suicide, except that we're doing so without having any capacity to influence the circumstances and the framework within which that is then done. We would be delegating the power to legalise assisted suicide to the territories. We would be abrogating our responsibility to ensure it is done in an appropriate way. As I say, I'm opposed to state-sanctioned assisted suicide. But even those who are in favour should ask themselves the question whether they are comfortable with being responsible for whatever form that state-sanctioned assisted suicide takes on the other side of a process in the Australian Capital Territory assembly or the Northern Territory assembly, over which we then no longer have any influence.


It is also important to remember that, in the year after the Andrews bill—which this bill seeks to overturn—became law back in 1997, the Northern Territory had the opportunity to become a state. The people of the Northern Territory, by majority vote, chose not to do so. If a majority of the people in the Northern Territory back in 1998, the year after the Commonwealth took away the Northern Territory's power to keep euthanasia legal, were offended by that and wanted to preserve their right to make laws into the future to legalise assisted suicide, then surely they would have voted in favour of statehood, which would have removed the constitutional power of the Commonwealth to continue to maintain the prohibition that is currently legislated. I put it to the chamber that the fact that, on the back of the federal parliament's intervention, they did not do so shows that the people of the Northern Territory at the time supported the actions of the federal parliament at that time.


In conclusion, I will vote no both as a matter of deep personal conviction and faith as well as on the basis that I do not feel comfortable to abrogate the responsibility to get the framework and safeguards right, if assisted suicide were to be legislated, to either the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory. I don't believe that there is a safe way to legalise assisted suicide in a way that would not inappropriately expose the vulnerable, the depressed and the poor to inappropriate pressures. Finally, given that the Constitution gives the Australian parliament the power to enact this legislation, I believe we have a responsibility to maintain the legislation as it currently stands and not to undo the decision, which I believe was the right decision back in 1997, to prevent the territories from legislating state-sanctioned taking of human life.

"Urquhart, Sen Anne",ALP,2018-08-15,"



Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania—Opposition Whip in the Senate) (17:42):  Australians who are terminally and incurably ill should have the right to choose a humane and dignified end to their life. They should be able to choose to end their pain and suffering, and their families should be afforded compassionate support in this decision. I rise to speak in support of the territories to legislate for assisted suicide in their respective jurisdictions. It is no longer appropriate, nor has it been, for the Commonwealth to interfere with the ability of the territories to determine their own legislative futures on this incredibly important matter. While the passing of the Restoring Territory Rights (Assisted Suicide Legislation) Bill 2015 will not automatically legalise assisted suicide in the territories, it will significantly improve the ability of those governments to demonstrate empathy and leadership to those who are suffering in their communities.


Australia is rapidly falling well behind the rest of the world on this issue. Switzerland has the world's oldest act, in effect since 1942, and, some 20 years ago, the state of Oregon in the USA enacted the Death with Dignity Act. There are increasing numbers of jurisdictions providing their citizens with the dignity of choosing when to end their suffering. There are now eight countries and six states in the United States where you can choose to die with assistance. In these jurisdictions, there are a range of safeguards and checks and balances to ensure that society's most vulnerable are cared for and protected. There are an extensive range of measures to avoid elder abuse, a commonly forwarded argument used by those against voluntary assisted suicide. To do nothing, however, is also, in my eyes, abuse. Poll after poll continues to show that a majority of Australians—indeed, up to 80 per cent of them—support voluntary assisted dying laws. It is abundantly clear that people want a choice in when and the way in which they choose to die.


The Northern Territory has shown leadership in this area before, as has the ACT. We would all be aware that the Victorian government has just become the first to pass its Voluntary Assisted Dying Act late last year. Tasmanian Labor continues to work tirelessly to demonstrate compassion, courage and leadership on this issue, fighting to win the right for those in our state to be afforded the dignity of dying when they see fit. My state colleagues have campaigned vigorously to end this example of government overreach. Government should not take on the role or the authority of telling people in excruciating pain when they can die; it is inhumane. The Tasmanian state Labor caucus believes people should have the right to end their life when they have a serious and incurable medical condition that is causing them to suffer in a way that is intolerable to them. I support them in those beliefs.


As incredible as palliative care and those providing the care can be, we must recognise that it does not alleviate all suffering for all people. No person should have to suffer intolerable pain but, rather, should be able to choose to die with assistance with appropriate supports and safeguards in place. During the numerous times that this topic has been debated, we have all heard harrowing stories of those forced to endure intolerable pain and suffering, sometimes for months and years on end. I have no doubt that all of us in this chamber have at some point been moved by a story or an experience of a family member or friend who wished only for their pain to end.


I've been touched by the story of Andrew Denman and his family. Andrew is a very well-known Tasmanian. Some of my colleagues here today would know him for his passion for our specialist timber industry. He shared his story with us after he watched his mother, Carol, die a long, protracted, terrifying and painful death. An advanced directive to cease food and water was enforced and she starved to death. I will paraphrase what he wrote when sharing his story with my Tasmanian colleague. Andrew wrote, 'Another injection, more pain, more suppositories, more indignity. It is excruciating to watch knowing that I made a promise to her not to ever let things get to this stage. I will be forever haunted by mum's pleading looks every time her eyes partially open, asking me to end it all.' At her passing, he shared, 'Mum died this morning at 11:00 am. She died a so-called good death imposed upon her by the laws of Australia. Thirteen days she lasted with no food or water—death by dehydration until her internal organs failed one by one.'


In May 2011, I lost my own father to cancer. Our family watched as he fought this disease until it took his life. He used to talk to us for a very long number of years about wanting to be able to choose when his life ended, when his suffering would be ended. It was his wish always to have control over the end of his life and, in the end, he had no control. Earlier this year, again we felt the sting of what's happened with overreach when we lost our mum. The night before she passed, sitting with her, she asked if I could make it end, make the pain go away with an injection. And, just like dad, in the end, she had no control.


People are suffering and they feel trapped within that suffering, with many looking for a way to peacefully make it end. They are not provided with that and, as leaders, we continue to actively deny them that. This denial must stop. In an attempt to gain back control, people are taking their own lives in the most horrific and tragic methods. Those who are suffering are sometimes making the decision to end their lives with often catastrophic consequences for their loved ones who find them.


The time to provide a legal framework for these decisions to be made is well overdue. It's time to eliminate this end-of-life trauma that many Australian families are having to experience. I support the bill before the Senate.

"Fifield, Sen Mitch",LP,2018-08-15,"



Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (17:49):  I'd like to lay down three markers to frame my contribution to this debate on the Restoring Territory Rights (Assisted Suicide Legislation) Bill 2015. Firstly, territories don't have equal constitutional standing with the states. States are sovereign and territories are creations of the Commonwealth parliament. Secondly, had I been in federal parliament in 1996, I would have supported the Kevin Andrews bill. Thirdly, had I been a member of the Victorian parliament in 2017, I would have opposed the Daniel Andrews bill.


Victoria made a mistake, and I don't want to see other jurisdictions make the same mistake. I can't do anything about what states may do, but I can around what territories do. My reasoning is straightforward. In jurisdictions, before Victoria changed their legislation, I believe there was adequate space in the law for parents, families and doctors to put in place good and appropriate palliative care. My experience with a parent in Queensland 21 years ago and a parent in Victoria 16 years ago is that this was the case. I'm deeply troubled by the current Victorian law at a number of levels. I can't support the Senate allowing a jurisdiction within the Commonwealth parliament's control to go down that same path. I'll, therefore, be opposing this bill.

"Gallacher, Sen Alex",ALP,2018-08-15,"



Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (17:51):  I also want to make a contribution to this debate on the Restoring Territory Rights (Assisted Suicide Legislation) Bill 2015. I want to take a slightly different tack at the start of my contribution. I actually think that it's appalling that the Prime Minister of this country has traded away about five per cent of the nation's legislative time with respect to a vote on another piece of legislation. In order to get Senator Leyonhjelm's vote on the ABCC legislation, the Prime Minister dedicated precious legislative time in this chamber to advance Senator Leyonhjelm's electoral prospects. The reality is we have no jurisdiction in this issue anyway. We don't have any jurisdiction to legislate for assisted suicide, euthanasia or the like. For a deal—in my view, a very tawdry deal—to be done on such an emotive and important issue of territory rights and euthanasia is just another symptom of the dysfunction of this government.


I rely on my information coming from those good people in the Parliamentary Library. If I get a Bills Digest, I ask the Parliamentary Library about it and they always provide all of the information. In the Bills Digest on this bill, there is a description of this deal—a clear and concise description—alleged by Senator Leyonhjelm and there is, at the end of the information provided, disagreement about what the deal actually was. It's contained in the Parliamentary Library's Bills Digest on the Restoring Territory Rights (Assisted Suicide Legislation) Bill 2015. For the life of me, I cannot understand how we can take an issue like this and make it a tradeable commodity for a vote on another piece of legislation. I find that very disturbing.


I've listened to the debate and many of the speakers on this. For what it's worth, I used to live in the Northern Territory. I have family that live in the Northern Territory right now. I've consulted with those family members in the Northern Territory. I had a brother in Royal Adelaide Hospital, very recently, getting treatment. My daughter-in-law's brother-in-law died at 43 of leukaemia after a very critical cancer treatment. His treatment was, incidentally, delivered mainly in South Australia. I've been lobbied quite substantially on this issue. One of the most compelling people who I've spoken to is that good person Andrew Denton. Andrew Denton pointed me in the right direction on a number of these matters.


Over a period of time, I've sourced the original legislation from Oregon, which, I think, was the first jurisdiction to put this type of legislation in place, and I've had a look at the legislation in Victoria. I can say very clearly that, if you look at the evidence and the assessment of what happened in Oregon—under the legislation there I think there were some 1,969 prescription recipients, and 1,275 of those patients actually ingested the medication—you can get a very good view of how big an issue this is. I understand the population of Oregon is currently 4.1 million. You can actually dive into the 2017 annual report and you can see that there were 143 deaths during 2017, and most of the patients, 80.4 per cent, were aged 65 or older. The median age of death was 74 years. As in the previous years, recipients were commonly white, at 94.4 per cent, and well educated, with 48.9 per cent having baccalaureate degrees.


I hear all the contributions from various sectors of the chamber and I listen to my colleague Senator Dodson, who says there are grave reservations in the Indigenous community. It's probably not the most pressing issue in the Indigenous community; I think that's fair to say. But if people are not accessing health services because of the fear—whether it's mistaken or whether it's a misunderstanding—that there is an assisted dying process, that's absolutely catastrophic, in my view.


I can go on about this probably more than most of the people in this chamber. I saw my father die during an episode of chemotherapy. In those days, chemotherapy was catastrophic. You would get a dose of chemotherapy which was so caustic that it overcame most of your bodily functions, but you got six weeks. You got six weeks of respite. I think, after two periods of that chemotherapy, he was at least able to put his affairs in order. He was at least able to do the things he wanted to do. He never wanted to go a second earlier. He endured. Ultimately he died of a heart attack while I was actually physically there, during an episode of chemotherapy. But it's come a long way from there.


Palliative care has come a long way from there. Just last week a colleague of mine, who was 76 years old and a president of the TWU South Australia and Northern Territory branch, was doing something that was probably a little untoward at the age of 76: moving a fridge. He suffered an incident when he was transporting that fridge and collided with a pole. He was admitted to intensive care and put into a coma. As always, our very, very good intensive care people did their absolute best to maintain life and the rest of his functions, but ultimately he was taken out of the coma and was found to have no cognitive functions. He basically had been deprived of oxygen; it was unclear how long he'd been in the car before the retrieval teams got there and took him to the appropriate facility. So the decision was made then that they would not continue with restoring his bodily functions or getting him to breathe unaided and, after a reasonably short period of time, he passed away.


I go from one end of the scale to the other end of the scale and, in the middle, I could stand here and reiterate many cases of friends and family—close family, including both my mothers-in-law and my first wife—who all went through cancer treatments and palliative care and passed in the company of their children, grandchildren, friends and relatives. I'm not certain that there are a great number of people who are rushing to take a solution here. The evidence, if we look at Oregon, is 4.1 million people and about 143 per annum in that 20-year zone. It's very clear. People like Andrew Denton and other very competent people in this space say: 'You need to recognise, Alex, that five per cent of people will not get the benefit of palliative care. Five per cent of people will suffer inordinately from their condition, and they should have the right to choose.' That's the prevailing argument. They also say that 40 per cent of that five per cent will not take it, but they should have the right to it.


I have been entirely conflicted by this debate. The argument in respect of people in the Northern Territory having the same rights as every other Australian is probably where I started out. I thought that looked like a no-brainer. What's the difference between an Australian in the Northern Territory and an Australian in South Australia? But when you dive back into it, there probably is a little bit of a debate. If you go back to the Northern Territory referendum on statehood, 94,000 people voted. That's probably smaller than a federal electorate. Of those, 44,702 voted yes, 48,241 voted no and there were 1,065 informals. There was an attempt to set up a bipartisan NT Legislative Assembly committee, chaired by former Chief Minister Steve Hatton. That committee proposed a draft constitution and said that it should be debated at an elected constitutional convention. The Hon. Shane Stone ignored that recommendation, nominating a convention membership of 53 members at short notice, and presented the convention's draft constitution, which was different from the committee's recommendations. The former CLP Chief Minister Steve Hatton later said that one of the campaign slogans at the time was 'We want statehood, not Stonehood.' So it was very clear that there was a very divisive character leading the Northern Territory at that time. It beggars belief that the Northern Territory would vote against statehood, but they did, and clearly because they had reservations about the way the place was being run.


The starting point of my statement is: if you can trade off five per cent of the nation's legislative time for a vote on another bill, what certainty will we ever have that there won't be another deal in the future which will change the parameters of whichever state or territory comes out and puts into place some assisted suicide legislation? I'm not certain that this is as clear-cut as people are making out. I've lived in the Northern Territory, and the saying in the Northern Territory is: if you're in pain, get on a plane. You're generally going to get better advice from specialists and/or medical treatment if you go to Adelaide or Melbourne or wherever. That's no criticism of the Northern Territory. It's a very small population base. Obviously, they can't have all of the attendant specialist services and expertise that a major population centre will have. They do great work. You can see that in the work they did with respect to East Timor and the like. But if you do get crook in the Northern Territory, a lot of people choose to get their treatment in another state.


I'm not sure, if we do not support this right to go and discuss assisted dying, assisted suicide or the like, that we're going to be doing anyone in the Northern Territory a great disservice. I'm not sure that anybody in the Northern Territory is really going to be tremendously upset. They may have an in-principle objection, but they voted against statehood because they didn't like the way their leader was taking them to it. That's essentially what the evidence says. They've been used very unfairly in this issue, in my view.


I asked initially: 'Why is this a conscience vote? Why hasn't our leadership done what they do on most issues?' The answer that came back was: it's a conscience vote because in 1998 it was a conscience vote. Okay, I'll accept that. I've sought some advice from the Northern Territory, and some of the advice coming back was: 'Shouldn't this be done at a higher level? Why should a small jurisdiction like the Northern Territory have to go through and do this?'


One of the things I do disagree with Senator Leyonhjelm on is this position about competitive federalism. What does that mean? I can point to a couple of examples of what it means. It means that if you are a jurisdiction that is in favour of online gambling—and I'm not opposed to that—then you seek to base yourself in the Northern Territory, and that's essentially what's happened. I have no particular view on pornography or the rest of it, but when in recent times you want to go into that business, the place do you it is the ACT. That's what the history was.


I'm opposed to this notion of taking the smallest group of constituents, getting a position up and then trying to expand that around the country. Basically, I think my bottom line position is that I'm not convinced that, although a good death is desired by all, we can prescribe that adequately and in perpetuity. It will change. We've got an example here where a Prime Minister traded a position for a vote. So ultimately I'm going to come down on the basis that I'm totally unsure about the effect of what we're doing here on the Northern Territory and, on balance, I don't think we're going to strenuously disadvantage anybody in the ACT or the Northern Territory with regard to not passing Senator Leyonhjelm's bill.


I will sum up by saying I don't like the way it came to this chamber. I don't like the fact this nation's legislative time has been used as a bargaining chip. I'm unsure whether we can carefully and appropriately prescribe in perpetuity for end of life choice. My own lived experience of quite a number of people extremely close to me is that they all went the way they wanted to go, fighting for every last breath in their body and, really, surrounded by the people they loved. And I don't know if we should be doing too much more than that. Thank you.

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (18:07):  Before I start my contribution on this particularly important bill before the chamber, can I just correct something that Senator Gallacher asserted during his contribution. He made the assertion that the government had allocated precious government business time in the Senate on this bill as part of a deal. This assertion has been made by previous contributors today, and it is not correct. The reason that this bill is currently being debated is that the Labor Party, the Greens and enough of the crossbenchers voted in favour of a motion to make this happen. I'd now like to move onto the substantive part of my contribution.


Before us today are two very serious concerns: one of great emotional divide and the other in pursuit of legality and federalism. It conflates the two issues of assisted suicide legislation and recognising the autonomy of the territories. I fear it is too simplistic to be debating this proposed legislation as it is. These are concerns that warrant full and frank discussion, whereas the Restoring Territory Rights (Assisted Suicide Legislation) Bill 2015 concurrently discusses multiple matters at once. Some have said it's not about territory issues, while others have said it's not about euthanasia. In the same vein, others have said this legislation before us goes to the rights of territories to make decisions for themselves and contend it does not ask senators to give a view approving or disapproving of euthanasia. Are we discussing territory rights or human rights? Are we discussing social issues, ethical issues, jurisdiction issues or constitutional issues?


The message falls flat on what is actually before the Senate. In my opinion, there are two intrinsically unique matters, each of which unfortunately masks the other. Before us currently, the legal inquiry cannot ignore the philosophical question, but, with equal merit, the philosophical concerns cannot navigate its legality. The two are individually separate, yet the very title of this bill binds them together.


There should be other means through which we can have a full and frank territory rights debate. Similarly, this is not the setting for an assisted suicide debate, with external motives potentially roadblocking a serious policy discussion that can touch the lives of all Australians. This bill purports to encourage competitive federalism. Territories have a distinct role within our federal parliamentary system—they always have—but the existence of the powers retained by the Commonwealth under section 122 of the Constitution can suggest that the debate before us is to be determined by political means, not legislative ones at the hands of local assemblies. The Commonwealth is the supreme law-making body and, as it stands, the Commonwealth can retain legislative oversight for the government of a territory. 


In acknowledging the intentions of this bill, it confirms that the Howard government's Euthanasia Laws Act 1997 successfully repealed the Northern Territory Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995. To this end, the proposed legislation recognises the respective roles and powers of the territories and the federal parliament in acknowledging that the federal parliament is the body that is ultimately responsible for the laws of the territories. To ignore this important function without considerable consultation and dialogue could be ill-advised, and I'm not sure whether this discussion is rightly placed against this issue.


However, in saying that, I'm a strong supporter of the inalienable rights and freedoms of all people, underpinned by the most minimal government intrusion in their private lives as possible. Individuals are almost always best positioned to make their own choices. To this end, I appreciate Senator Leyonhjelm's pursuit. However, the inextricable linking of the two issues in this bill makes it impossible to separate the discussion. I firmly believe that these two distinct issues must be debated separately. Euthanasia and territory rights are not one and the same. By binding them together, we overlook their respective significance and unconsciously belittle their inherent worth. I deeply respect the views and opinions of all who have participated in this debate. However, I find myself unable to support all aspects of this bill.

"Canavan, Sen Matthew",Nats,2018-08-15,"



Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland—Minister for Resources and Northern Australia) (18:12):  I am opposed to the Restoring Territory Rights (Assisted Suicide Legislation) Bill 2015 because I believe in the sanctity of human life. Leaving the state to assist and sanction suicide, in my view, would diminish the special and unique gift of human life. I recognise that, while the bill seeks to restore territory rights, it explicitly does so for the purpose of sanctioning assisted suicide. Indeed, the words 'assisted suicide' are in the title of the bill. While the matter of euthanasia is a matter for the states, the Commonwealth does have the constitutional right to legislate in this area for the territories. I believe this is a matter of such ethical importance that it should be reserved for the national parliament and not be delegated to jurisdictions that are not recognised as states under our Constitution. I will confine the rest of my marks to the ethical question of the legalisation of assisted suicide.


I want to very clearly outline in my contribution what I mean by euthanasia or assisted suicide. Euthanasia is a deliberate act that causes death. The failure to provide or to accept treatment is not euthanasia. The provision of pain relief, providing it's administered without the intention of ending life, is not euthanasia. I think we can all agree that we should seek to adequately fund palliative care to help all people at the end of their lives to avoid unnecessary suffering.


Of course, we don't all agree on whether the legalisation of assisted suicide is a good idea. This is a deeply ethical question and I appreciate and respect other views on this issue. My views stem from the ethical views that I hold—in particular, that there is a natural law that demarcates certain acts as good and other acts as evil. I've heard many times in this debate that we put down animals to end their suffering, so why shouldn't we allow humans to do the same? There are a number of things that I think are fundamentally wrong with such a metaphor. The first most practical one is that animals have no agency in their euthanasia. A dog is not asked for its permission before a needle is administered, because a dog cannot give its permission. It has no free will. Human beings do have free will, however. We are remarkable creatures. We are not mere animals. We have an innate desire to seek the good. We make choices after contemplation and consciousness. There is something unique, special and sacred about every human life, and we should fight to cherish and protect all human lives.


Another thing human beings uniquely do is love. We should celebrate and love life. That must start by learning to love our individual selves and the gift of human life that we have been given. That will let us love others as well and will let us seek a good and virtuous life. I believe that this parliament and the state more generally should pass laws that celebrate life and that help establish a culture of life; unfortunately, in my view this bill does not celebrate life. 


Some will argue in rebuttal to me that assisted suicide will only be permissible in limited circumstances—those in great suffering or those at the end of their life. But a society is judged by the values it holds most dear, the thing it will not trade off for some other thing of higher worth. For a Judeo-Christian society, that most valuable thing, that thing that is most sacred, that cannot be violated, is human life. I believe that such a standard helps deliver more good. In a society that allows the state to sanction suicide, clearly human life is not the highest good, not the most sacred thing. Such a society is willing to trade off life for less human suffering. Instead, in such a society the greatest good would be the minimisation of human suffering and the promotion of untrammelled human liberty towards that end. This would be a fundamental change to the bedrock moral and ethical standards of our society. 


The problem with this change is that there is no clear definition of who is to decide what is too much human suffering and what restrictions would be placed around the maximisation of human welfare, even potentially at the expense of the suffering of others. At its limit, this philosophy replaces the 10 commandments with a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. We can calculate one person's suffering—or the antiseptic jargon, 'their quality of life'—against the happiness of others. When human life is not infinitely valued, our lives literally become the inputs to a morally vacuous mathematical formula. This is not just a theoretical concern; it has been the lived experience of societies who have gone down this path. 


Take the example of the Netherlands, where assisted suicide has been legal for more than 15 years. A recent survey found that 60 per cent of Dutch physicians do not report their cases of assisted suicide, even though reporting is required by law, and about 25 per cent of physicians admit to ending patients' lives without their consent. There is even a reported case where a Dutch doctor euthanised a 26-year-old ballerina with arthritis in her toes, because she could no longer pursue her career as a dancer, she was depressed and requested to be put to death. The doctor complied with her request and merely noted, 'One doesn't enjoy such things, but it was her choice.' 


I fear that a right to die could soon transform into an expectation to die. This would then cause a fundamental shift in how we interact with our families and our loved ones. If we are seeking to maximise happiness, not protect life, soon people will be seen as, or will see themselves as, a burden on others, not someone with intrinsic value in their own life. I don't want to encourage a society where the disabled or sick are not seen as anything other than fully human with all the God-given rights that we all enjoy. Again, this is the lived experience of jurisdictions that have legalised state sanctioned suicide. The Oregon Health Authority found that 40 per cent of those who assisted a suicide cited being a burden on family or friends or their caregivers as their motivation to end their life. 


As I said at the start of my contribution on this matter, my views on this are deeply personal; they do stem from the fundamental ethics that I hold. I do hope we can vote for life in this chamber, because I believe that, if we do not, we will return to a harsher, less forgiving world that we should not return to.

"Chisholm, Sen Anthony",ALP,2018-08-15,"



Senator CHISHOLM
 (Queensland) (18:18):  When it became clear in the last sitting week that this bill was going to be debated, my initial view was this was a matter of territory rights and that it would be a relatively simple for issue for me to deal with. But, obviously, in the winter break, with the opportunity to engage with more people and to talk about the issues at stake in this matter, it became a more complex decision for me to make. I want to put on the record that I appreciate those people, from both sides, who have come and spoken to me about this. They've done so in good faith; they believe in their case. I very much valued the opportunity to discuss this issue with them. It would be fair to say that I am uncomfortable with euthanasia, without being outright opposed to it. 


I keep coming back to this being an issue of territory rights, which I strongly believe in. A couple of things have influenced this more than others. Since the right of territories to legislate on this issue was taken away, we have seen state parliaments debate euthanasia legislation. Recently, we saw Victoria become the first state to pass that legislation, and that will begin in approximately 12 months time. And it is likely that, in other states throughout Australia, this legislation will be debated in coming years as well.


Some people opposed to this legislation have argued that the unique unicameral nature of the territories makes them unsuitable to deal with such complex issues. As a Queensland Labor senator, that's not an argument that I can sustain, given the make-up of the Queensland parliament, which has only one chamber. The thought that it would be able to deal with this in an adequate manner also gives me the confidence that the territories would be able to do so as well.


So, given that the debate has occurred in Victoria and other states and will likely occur in the future, I believe that territories deserve that same opportunity. I obviously urge them to progress that carefully, but I will be voting to support this bill, the restoring territories' rights bill, when it comes to a vote.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2018-08-15,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (18:20):  I seek leave to speak for about five minutes.


Leave granted.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I thank the Senate for that. I had spoken very briefly previously, so I'm technically barred without leave, but I thank the Senate for giving me leave for this short period so that I may just put on record my views on the Restoring Territory Rights (Assisted Suicide Legislation) Bill 2015, although I suspect my views are reasonably well known.


I was one of the few senators who was in this place when the Andrews bill was first dealt with on 19 March 1997. At that stage, I opposed the Andrews bill, which actually brought about the situation that this bill is trying to reverse. If people are interested particularly in my views, I would refer them to my speech in the Hansard of 19 March 1997, where I indicated why I was opposing what was then euphemistically called the Andrews bill.


I just want to briefly also mention that I chaired the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee when it dealt with the exposure draft of a private senator's bill, the Medical Services (Dying with Dignity) Bill 2014. That committee looked into this whole question in great detail, and there were an enormous number of witnesses. The one that sticks in my mind most was the young man, a family man, who attended the hearings in Melbourne with his wife, his three children and his uncle, former Senator Jim Short. He had three or four weeks left to live. He asked us to bring the hearing forward so he could give evidence. He was pleading with the committee as someone who, in his situation, was terminally ill. He wanted to pass away with his family, his loved ones, around the bed, at a time of his choosing. He knew there was no hope. He didn't want to wake up at two o'clock in the morning and die by himself. It was the most telling piece of evidence given to the committee at that time.


The committee didn't make recommendations on the bill or otherwise. It did, however, raise some issues which I think Senator Leyonhjelm might like to look at. I'll just quote from the committee's report:


Although the evidence received enabled the committee to consider some of the provisions of the Bill in detail, there remain some technical issues with a number of the provisions of the Bill. These include clarification of the definition of a dying with dignity service, clarification around the definition of a terminal illness, the number of medical practitioners required to consider the request, consistency of definition around decision-making capacity, and the serious consequences for medical practitioners who relied upon the immunities in the Bill if such immunities were later found to be unconstitutional.


The committee went on to say:


The committee notes conflicting evidence it received in relation to the primary constitutional basis for the Bill under—


section 51 of the Constitution. It continued:


The committee was told that there could be very serious consequences for medical practitioners who relied upon the immunities in the Bill, if such immunities were later found to be unconstitutional. This concern is enlivened by the virtual certainty that any federal legislation dealing with voluntary euthanasia will face constitutional challenge.


That was for another bill that was before this parliament. The bill we're dealing with now would give the Northern Territory parliament the right to make these decisions. It's a bit strange to quote my own words, but back in 1997 I said:


My opinion is, I believe, no better formed than the views of a democratically elected parliamentarian of the Northern Territory—a parliamentarian who was required over a much longer period of time than I to determine how the laws of that state like territory should apply. I am not one of those who believe that because I am in the federal parliament my opinions are that much superior to those of representatives of the people of the Northern Territory.


So I would vote in favour of this bill, as I have consistently done when this has come before this parliament on a couple of occasions previously. (Extension of time granted). 


I have heard a lot of the speeches here and I've had a lot of people come to talk to me, both for and against. I just want to make it clear that this is not like animals and it's not like dealing with someone against their will. We don't know what form a bill on this will take should one be introduced into the Northern Territory in future, but a lot of the conversation here talks about other people putting a person to death or agreeing to a person being put to death. The bills that we have looked at over the period of time are all about decisions by individuals who are capable of making decisions. People talk to me about dementia and people who are imposed upon or who are depressed. If a similar bill came into force in Australia, those people would not be eligible to make the decision, because you need a number of doctors to certify, first of all, that you are capable of making an informed decision and then, having made that informed decision, that it was your choice and not anybody else's—nobody could put you to death; it was solely your decision.


My own position comes from a brave Christian lady, a committed family person—in fact, my mother. She knew she was dying and she fought it for four years. In the last three years of her life, her quality of life fell by so much that she just wanted to go. There was nothing in it for her. She was being comfortably looked after, but she tried every trick in the book to terminate her own life. She couldn't do it. She eventually starved herself to death because it was the only way she could terminate her own life. (Extension of time granted). I do appreciate the chamber in this matter, which is a matter of conscience. I saw my mother in that situation back in 1997. In the end, after a long, uncomfortable and torturous battle, she did pass away, and I suspect that at the very end she was assisted in any case. I believe, from the medical profession, that this often happens.


The same sort of situation happened with my sister, a very Christian lady. She fought the good fight for so long, but, in the end, she was begging to move on. There was no quality of life. There was nothing in it for her. She knew she couldn't last and she just wanted to terminate her despair and hurt at an earlier time. Those are my two personal experiences, and a lot of experiences have been related to me by others. I acknowledge that many other people in this chamber and across Australia have a different view to me, but that is my view. I wanted to put it on the record yet again. I thank the Senate for their indulgence for me being able to do this.

Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria—Minister for Rural Health, Minister for Sport, Minister for Regional Communications and Deputy Leader of The Nationals) (18:30):  Over the course of this debate, I've been able to listen to many senators provide their second reading debate contributions on the Restoring Territory Rights (Assisted Suicide Legislation) Bill 2015. I would like to thank them all for their thoughtful, considerate and compassionate contributions irrespective of which side of this debate they're on. This is a very personal matter. I recognise your contribution, Mr Acting Deputy President Williams, around the concept of dying with dignity. You made some very poignant points that the Senate should read if they didn't get a chance to hear your contribution.


For many people around this debate, they've argued that this is actually a bill about state and territory rights. I took the opportunity to read the second reading speech of the mover of this bill, and there's not a lot there. It makes very clear through the second reading speech that this is about euthanasia. I guess Senator Leyonhjelm wants to move this bill because he's concerned that the law says we are only permitted to die by our own hand without assistance. For me, that is how it should be if you feel life and death are part of the human experience. The joy of life, the mixed experience of living and the finality and inevitability of death are part of the human condition. For me, it is a bit like what the Stoic Seneca said: 'death is the wish of some, the relief of many and the end of all.' It is, for me, part of that human journey.


Additionally, when we look at dying and making sure that the experience of death for those in Australia is as painless, sensitive and compassionate as possible, we've come a long way. Think about the last two decades and how palliative care is practised in this country now. Patients and families have the choice to ensure that their emotional, spiritual and physical care needs are being met, and everybody can be supported by a professional who's trained and knows how to assist. We need to focus on that aspect of the death experience. It's not a state, territory or Commonwealth government's role to say who should live or die. It is an individual's decision. We know from experiences overseas that if we open a decision then we get perverse outcomes. It is a government's role to actually protect the most vulnerable in our society. Even opening the door by a fraction to the potential of another person, another officer of the state or the state itself to be taken advantage of for monetary gain or convenience is something that I can't be a part off. I will be voting against the bill.

"Martin, Sen Steve",Nats,2018-08-15,"



Senator MARTIN
 (Tasmania) (18:33):  I rise today to put on record my position on the Restoring Territory Rights (Assisted Suicide Legislation) Bill 2015, introduced by Senator Leyonhjelm. This bill is one of the most important. It quite literally deals with the prospect of life and death. This is not an issue that I or honourable senators can take lightly. Regardless of one's philosophical and emotional views on this issue, such significant changes must be considered with the wellbeing of territorians foremost in our minds. For the record, I am a supporter of an individual's right, when facing the prospect of long and painful suffering with no hope of recovery, to have the ability to choose to end their own lives.


But, like many issues that come before us as parliamentarians, this issue is not black and white. I cannot simply impose my beliefs about voluntary euthanasia on this matter when asked whether or not to support this bill. I would like to recognise the work of former Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Mr Marshall Perron, in passing Australia's first euthanasia laws some 22 years ago. This was our country's first attempt at giving the terminally ill the option of making an informed decision to end their own lives. However, within two years this legislation became invalid after the passing of the Euthanasia Laws Act 1997 by this parliament to amend the Northern Territory's and Australian Capital Territory's self-governing acts to remove those territories' ability to legislate in this area. It is this change, made over two decades ago, that we are now essentially being asked to overturn.


I have sat and listened carefully to the contribution of honourable senators to this bill. I have also watched with great interest the public contributions of the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, the Hon. Michael Gunner MLA; and the Chief Minister of the ACT, Mr Andrew Barr MLA. They have framed this argument around this debate to be one of the legislative rights of the territories. In fact, thousands of dollars of territorian taxpayers' money was spent by their respective governments on taking out full-page adverts in The Australian to put forward their case. However, I strongly hold the view that such arguments overtook the core function of this bill. The fact is that, if this bill were to pass the Senate and the other place, it would enable territorian parliaments to legislate once again in the area of voluntary euthanasia, and legislate they would. Whilst I acknowledge the passionate contributions of territory senators in this place, particularly that of my Nationals Senate leader, Senator Scullion, this is where my greatest concern with this bill begins.


Whilst considering this bill, I reflected on the debates on this matter in 1996 and, in particular, I reflected on the second reading contribution of the honourable member for Menzies in another place, where he said:


It is not a debate about territory rights;


It is not about the separation of church and state;


It is not about regulating current practice; and


It is not a simple issue of personal autonomy.


I believe that these words of the honourable member for Menzies in the other place are just as applicable to this debate as they were two decades ago.


I would like to place on the record my recognition of Australian territories' rights to make laws for those Australians who call these unique parts of our nation home. However, I cannot in good conscience offer my support to this bill, which will provide the territories the ability to legislate in the area of voluntary euthanasia—certainly not without ensuring that appropriate safeguards are put in place, because the fact is there are no second chances for us as legislators if we get this wrong.


It is a matter of public record that the original Rights of the Terminally Ill Act of the Northern Territory, passed by the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory in 1995, was carried by just a handful of votes in a unicameral parliament, unlike the parliaments of other jurisdictions, with the exception of Queensland, who themselves have instituted a comprehensive committee system. The territories do not have a house of review. There are no other legislators to provide sober reflection on such complex matters, which are literally ones of life and death. The decisions on these matters are left in the hands of just 25 members in a chamber which maintains a government majority. Whilst I do not wish to cast aspersions in any way on the competencies or efforts of the hardworking members of our territory parliaments, I firmly believe that such a final matter should be canvassed by a group of concerned citizens in greater numbers and be subject to substantially more legislative scrutiny. This just further adds to my concerns that the safeguards, as well as the processes, which will determine if and how an individual can choose to end their life, are simply insufficient.


I conclude by saying that, as legislators, we cannot create laws that will cover every aspect of someone's life. We can only put into place laws that, to the best of our knowledge, with consultation and experience, will not only provide freedom of choice but also adequately protect people. Given those concerns, I will not be supporting this bill, and encourage honourable senators to do the same. Thank you.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2018-08-15,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (18:40):  I've thought long and hard about this over many years. I don't want to give the impression that I'm being simplistic in what I say tonight, but dying with dignity and voluntary euthanasia decisions made to end life and end suffering are happening informally anyway, from my personal experience. My dearly beloved grandpa passed away a few years back. Sadly, I wasn't there that night, but my family were. A family discussion was had, medical staff were consulted and my grandfather was given a dose of morphine and sent on his way. Having spoken to many friends, I understand this is quite common.


Tonight, I want to very quickly tell a story about a friend of mine. Her mother was terminally ill and was suffering. They put an end-of-life plan in place. They lived on the North Coast of New South Wales. When their mother deemed the time was right, the family were going to convene at a coastal town. They knew the family doctor very well. All of them had known the family doctor, including the mother, and it was agreed that he would be there when the time was right and she would die with dignity under her own terms, with her family and loved ones there. As it turned out, when the time came, the doctor was away on leave and a locum was in town. When the mother said she was in pain and she wanted to go, they called the doctor and the locum said, 'She has to go to emergency.' He refused to administer a dose of morphine. Although the family tried to plead with the doctor, he said, 'No, it's against the law. She's going to emergency. She needs medical help.' They put her in an ambulance to take her to Brisbane emergency, some 45 minutes away, and she died in the ambulance, alone, on the way to the hospital. Her family were sitting in the lounge room when they got the phone call. They had planned this for months. That's what their mother wanted: to die with dignity. How many other stories do you need to hear about people who choose to end their life on their own terms?


So, while I understand that these things need to be carefully thought through and there need to be the right checks and balances, I believe—and it may sound simplistic—that this kind of thing is happening anyway and decisions are being made. It isn't actually official or regulated or legal, but it happens anyway. We probably will never get statistics on that, but certainly that's my experience. You may want to take a sample and ask the question: who should be making decisions about this? Of course, we are voting on this tonight, and they may very well vote on legislation in the Northern Territory. The people we should really be asking are those who are terminally ill and are in the situation where they may wish to die with dignity. None of us, I hope, in this chamber are in that situation. Some of us may be one day. They are the people we should be asking. I find it very difficult to sit in here and listen to people saying it's against their values and their beliefs. It's actually the people who are suffering who should be the ones making this decision, not us in here today, and we should provide the ability for them to do that.


On behalf of Senator Di Natale, I would like to indicate that we do not intend to move the amendments as circulated following any second reading vote. Those amendments were on sheet 8493.


I will conclude my contributions by saying I do support this legislation. I think it's critically important that we give every human being the right to go on their own terms and to die with dignity. We should accept that death is a fact of life and we should deal with it in a mature and open way.

Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (18:46):  The incorporated speech read as follows—


I support this bill, which removes a longstanding injustice done to citizens of the Northern Territory and the ACT.


And that's all it does.


It is not a bill that legalises medically assisted suicide.


Or which creates a system of safeguards to define and regulate the circumstances in which people may seek medical assistance to end their lives.


It may be argued that there are two separate issues:


Whether Australian citizens should be entitled to equal rights wherever they live.


And whether the states and territories should have the right to legalise medically assisted suicide. (The Commonwealth does not have the power to do that.)


My answer to both questions is yes, and I wish to state briefly the reasons why I believe this bill should be passed.


I am one of the few in this place who took part in the 1997 Senate debate on the legislation the bill seeks to overturn.


My view has not changed.


In 1997, I said:


""I am probably the last one in this chamber to argue that the state has no right to interfere in the lives of its citizens.


To the contrary, I believe that the role of the state is to provide some form of sensible regulation which is vital for the fair and equitable running of a society.


Therefore I won't say that the state has no right to tell a person when they can or cannot die, because I am aware that people are already making those decisions.


What I believe the state must do is ensure that people have access to safety, proper medical advice, and as much decent care and support as can be given.


There are others who also oppose the bill before us today on the grounds that the state has no right to restrict the freedom of an individual to seek their own death and to seek medical assistance to do that.


It gives me a sense of ironic pleasure to quote John Stuart Mill, who argues that 'the only justification for restricting freedom through law is to prevent harm to others'.


It puzzles me somewhat that so many of the free marketeers in this Parliament, who would normally proclaim the sanctity of the individual and invoke the name of Mill, are in this instance opposing the individual's right to self-determination.


I also acknowledge that many senators support this [1997] bill on genuinely held religious grounds ... However, Australia is a secular nation, and as its Parliament we have an obligation to make secular laws, not religious ones.""


One of the consequences of the 1997 Act was that it restricts equality before the law on the basis of where people live.


If you live in one of the states, your state's parliament is considered competent to legislate on euthanasia.


But if you live in the Northern Territory or the ACT, your territory's assembly is denied that competence.


The bill now before us removes that geographic inequality.


And in doing so, it would restore to the territories the right to allow their residents to seek medical assistance to end their lives if they are facing a protracted, painful death from incurable illness.


There is no justification for elected parliaments refusing to allow individuals to make that decision.


If you apply the John Stuart Mill test—that a restriction of freedom is only justified to prevent harm to others—who is harmed when the law denies individuals of sound mind the right to end their lives in the circumstances I have described?


The harm is done to the individuals whose autonomy has been denied.


They have lost control over their lives.


A law on assisted suicide should stipulate appropriate safeguards to ensure that personal autonomy is respected.


The Northern Territory law overturned in 1997 did have these safeguards.


That is also true of the assisted dying law recently enacted in Victoria.


It is important to be aware of this, because one of the most common cited reasons for opposing voluntary euthanasia is the fear that some people will not be choosing freely when they ask to be helped to die.


Perhaps, the opponents of assisted suicide say, because of subtle pressure from families who see them as a burden.


Or pressure from hospitals that are short of beds for patients who will recover.


These are familiar scenarios put forward in the course of any debate on euthanasia.


It is claimed that legalising voluntary euthanasia will start us on a slippery slope to a society of manipulation and abuse.


I do not accept the notion that we cannot devise laws to avoid such an outcome.


And I remind senators that the unregulated environment that applies in every Australian jurisdiction except Victoria is much more likely to result in the manipulation and abuse of the terminally ill.


We should not pretend that medically assisted suicides do not already take place, but without safeguards.


Opponents of medically assisted suicide like to evoke images of fascist regimes that used euthanasia to eliminate the unwanted.


That is not what the NT Act overturned in 1997 and the present Victorian Act allow.


Both those laws contain safeguards to prevent abuse — safeguards that do not exist in jurisdictions without such laws.


The NT law allowed medically assisted suicide only in strictly defined circumstances.


A person seeking assistance to die had to be an adult, and suffering from a terminal illness causing severe pain for which there was no treatment acceptable to the patient.


They had to have proper medical advice about the likely course of their illness, and about other options such as palliative care.


The doctor had to be satisfied that the patient was of sound mind and acting voluntarily, after due consideration and without restraint.


A second doctor with specialist qualifications in treating the patient's ailment had to confirm the first diagnosis.


A psychiatrist had to confirm that the patient was not suffering from treatable depression.


There had to be two cooling-off periods.


Seven days between the patient requesting medical assistance to die and the issuing of a certificate authorising that assistance.


And another 48 hours between the certificate being issued and being acted upon.


A request for assistance to end life could be rescinded by the patient at any time and in any form.


And, the law provided penalties for any person who attempted to influence a doctor to end the life of another person.


And for anyone who improperly induced another to sign or witness a form requesting medically assisted suicide.


Under the NT Rights of the Terminally Ill Act, no doctor or other health-care professional could be obliged to assist someone to die.


There was no attempt to force people to act against their moral beliefs.


A law with those stringent safeguards is not a law that de-values human life.


It is a law that respects the choices people make.


I support the principle that the will of the Senate should not be distorted.


If a senator is not able to attend because of ill-health, it is appropriate that pairing arrangements are made.


In this case, arrangements are made informally and not through the parties.


This is a conscience-vote bill.


Accordingly I have agreed to pair with Senator Sinodinos.


However, for the reasons I have set out I hope that this bill will be passed.


The Northern Territory and the ACT assemblies should be able to resolve this matter democratically, just as the parliaments of the states are able to do.


That is the question posed to us by this bill, and our answer should be yes.

"PRESIDENT, The",,2018-08-15,"



The PRESIDENT
 (18:46):  I'm taking this relatively rare opportunity to participate in debate as President. This is an issue that most people have a well-developed opinion of, based on deeply-held personal, philosophical and even political values, and experiences of loved ones and friends, as well as professional experiences and insights. Both sides of this debate are, I believe, motivated by the highest aspirations to care for our fellow citizens. Defending human dignity comes in various forms and there is nothing more difficult than caring for those most vulnerable in their last days, weeks or months.


Both perspectives on this issue are entirely respectable. I don't believe any should condemn another for holding the opposite view to that which they hold in this debate. But, in outlining my position and why I'll be opposing this legislation, I would like to explain the perspective I bring and the reasons I hold that view, both in principle, regarding the issue of euthanasia, and the administrative matter—the authority of this parliament in relation to the territory legislatures.


First, the matter of euthanasia. I am a liberal first and foremost. I start from the principle of limiting the actions of the state or the collective will of people limiting the autonomy of their fellow citizens. But I'm not a libertarian. A liberal believes in the existence of the state and that there are limits on the autonomy of individuals. The debate over where to draw this line is the defining one in a liberal democracy. Every instinctive liberal, at some point, comes across the writings of JS Mill, with his famous harm principle that, in short, provides the framework to assess whether a restriction on the choices an individual can make is legitimate and asks: does it bring harm to others?


On another matter, if Mill was correct—and I think he was—that there is a legitimate limit that someone cannot voluntarily submit themselves to slavery, then I think euthanasia needs to be considered differently to other matters of choice, because, when it comes to matters of ending life, there is a different element because of the finality of the consequences of any choice or incident.


I fear euthanasia not because I distrust individuals but because I distrust the state and the scope of it that now exists with the public health system we are all part of through a very strong and effective national insurance system and the public provision of health services. I fear it not because engaged citizens, like many of us in this chamber, are able to navigate the health and aged-care systems; I fear it because of the risks to the most vulnerable, who do not have the capacity for choice many of us have. I simply do not believe the checks and balances can guarantee that no innocent person will have their most important right, that of life, taken from them through the lack of care or even the feeling of being a burden upon those close to them or their fellow citizens. I also fear the inevitable expansion of this to those not equipped to make such a choice, let alone the pressure they may feel in the most difficult of circumstances. I happen to oppose capital punishment in all its forms, no matter the justification claimed, because I do not believe the state has a right to take a life and because I believe the risks of error are too grave to contemplate, and that thinking drives me in this particular instance as well. 


Second, I'd like to turn to the issue of territory rights. Territories and states don't have rights; people do. The territories have a different status in our constitutional arrangements than do the states. The people of the territories are in a different situation than are the people of the states. Therefore, we have a different set of responsibilities here than we do with respect to the states. I note that this parliament has previously legislated to prevent the states and territories from enacting capital punishment. While I agree that such a regime has no place in Australia, I find it difficult to accept as persuasive arguments about territory rights and disregard the fact that it's actually about the issue in question—in this case, euthanasia. I don't raise this to draw into question the motives of anyone, only to explain my own position.


We do have a different role with respect to the citizens of our territories than we do with respect to the citizens of our states. It is not about this parliament forcing its view on the territories; it is about my responsibility that I feel to the citizens of the territories. As someone who does not believe that euthanasia can be made safe, that there are risks of it causing the most grievous harm to the innocent, I have a responsibility to protect the citizens of the territories for whom this parliament is ultimately responsible. Accordingly, I will be voting against this bill.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2018-08-15,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (18:51):  In wrapping up the second reading debate on my Restoring Territory Rights (Assisted Suicide Legislation) Bill 2015, I wish to thank each senator for their contribution. We haven't had such a demonstration of individual honesty since the debate on same-sex marriage. In fact, I think this exceeds that debate. On the crossbench, we each form our own view about bills every day. But I understand this is a fairly novel experience for many in the major parties. I would particularly like to thank Labor and my crossbench colleagues for helping me bring this bill on for debate after it became clear that the Prime Minister was reluctant to stick to his deal with me. I have listened to as many of the speeches as possible, mostly while in my office, and I have been very impressed by the honesty and sincerity of my colleagues, if not necessarily all of their arguments. I know that the debate has been influential, with some senators changing how they were leaning in response to the contributions of other senators. That's good.


Now that I have the floor, I hope the debate continues to be influential, because I'd like to dispel some myths and misrepresentations that have been repeated during the debate. We've heard that we don't need assisted suicide legislation as long as we improve palliative care resources. In fact, palliative care is not an alternative to assisted suicide. You can have both. Indeed, in my opinion, you should have both. But what we haven't heard is how the best palliative care is ineffective for one in 20 patients with a terminal illness. Those Australians die a slow death in agony, and we are unable to help them.


We've heard how a nine-year-old girl was killed in Belgium, under the laws there. I'm personally not in favour of extending assisted suicide to children. But no mention was made when that subject was raised of the laborious processes taken to confirm consent. No mention was made of the untreatable brain tumour that, according to unanimous medical opinion, was to cause death in the near term, and no mention was made of the excruciating, untreatable pain.


We've heard a lot about slippery slopes but no mention of how the loose European laws have always been loose and how the tight law in Oregon has hardly changed over two decades—so, no slippery slope. We've heard how doctors can't be trusted but there has been no mention of how doctors deal, right now, with dying patients in an unregulated environment. Assisted suicide laws that require crystal clear consent can actually save lives from doctors who think they know best. There are many overdoses of morphine given with absolutely no consent. We've even heard claims that assisted suicide laws would reduce the willingness of Indigenous Australians to attend hospital, for fear of being killed against their wishes. This is insane. The only thing that could make any Australians fearful of being killed against their wishes is irresponsible and baseless fearmongering, unrelated to any law that could be legislated in Australia.


We will have an opportunity to further explore these issues in the committee stage, provided we pass this bill at the second reading. So I implore all senators: please question the fearmongering you have heard. Please ask yourself whether this fearmongering is coming from a source that knows what they are talking about, and please ask yourself what the basis of the fearmongering is, when this bill does not legislate for assisted suicide and the only legislation in Australia that does is the very tight legislation of the state of Victoria. But, contrary to what many have said, this bill is not about assisted suicide. It is about the freedom of the elected parliaments of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory to legislate on assisted suicide.


In 1995 the Northern Territory parliament adopted the world's first assisted suicide legislation. Four people took advantage of it to end their lives. However, in late 1996, with the debate extending into 1997, Mr Kevin Andrews introduced a bill into the Commonwealth parliament to overturn that legislation and to prevent the territories from legislating on assisted suicide. Twenty-one years later, that bill remains on the books, and yet, during that time, 14 jurisdictions have legalised assisted suicide in one form or another. Victoria is one of them. Other states, including WA, South Australia and New South Wales, have debated bills to legalise it and voted against it. However, the elected parliaments of the ACT and the Northern Territory can't do that. Big Brother, otherwise known as the Commonwealth government, doesn't allow it.


Surveys repeatedly show that between 75 per cent and 85 per cent of the public supports assisted suicide, including in the territories. It's the social issue with the most clear-cut public support. It's been that way for decades too, as this week's Australian newspaper confirmed. If this parliament were genuinely representative of the people, this bill wouldn't be necessary. The fact that we don't have assisted suicide in this country exposes a serious flaw in our democracy. It reminds me of the old joke about when the parliament and the people disagree with each other: some people believe we should change the people because the government can't be wrong.


I'm confident that there is majority support in this chamber for this modest bill and even greater support for the bill to at least reach the committee stage following the second reading. But I would like the support to be as strong as possible to reflect how this truly is a modest and reasonable bill. The time has come for this parliament to respect voters in the Northern Territory and the ACT. We in this parliament were all elected, but so were the members of the parliaments of the ACT and the Northern Territory. We are no smarter or more insightful than they are. We should not be denying them the ability to make decisions about a matter that their equivalents in Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, Tasmania, New South Wales and Western Australia can make. Whether we like the decisions those elected politicians make is not our concern. We can't decide whether assisted suicide should be permitted in the states, so what gives us the right to decide for those who are not in one of the states? I say we shouldn't make that decision. We should leave it to the people who were elected to represent them. I commend the bill to the chamber.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that the bill be read a second time.

"O'Neill, Sen Deb",ALP,2018-08-15,"



Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (17:25):  Just as we headed into senators' statements, I was making a point about the contribution to the debate by Senator Steele-John with regard to people with disability. I acknowledged the importance of his contribution to the debate. I also wanted to put on the record the words of the much loved Stella Young, Australian comedian, writer and disability advocate, who wrote on the implications of legalising assisted suicide for people living with disabilities. I acknowledge that many of us felt we lost an amazing Australian with her passing. This is what she said:


People make all sorts of assumptions about the quality of my life and my levels of independence. They're almost always wrong.


I've lost count of the number of times I've been told, ""I just don't think I could live like you,"" or ""I wouldn't have the courage in your situation,"" or, my favourite one to overhear (and I've overheard it more than once), ""You'd just bloody top yourself, wouldn't you?"".


…   …   …


Also, social attitudes towards disabled people come from a medical profession that takes a deficit view of disability. This is my major concern with legalising assisted death; that it will give doctors more control over our lives.


Senator Steele-John's confidence in legislators to create legislation that adequately protects people is a confidence I don't share. In my view, legislation, no matter how well crafted, considered and critiqued, cannot cover all the areas of concern that have been articulated in this place by many—and, hopefully, with some clarity in my contribution to the debate this morning. I'm also sure that there are many more concerns that haven't been raised in the course of this debate that are yet to be elicited and will deserve careful consideration. In my view, we're all right to fear assisted suicide as an extension of an increasingly alarming statistic of self-harm and suicide that reveals the despair of so many in our nation at this time.


Senators, data consistently demonstrates lower support for euthanasia and assisted suicide amongst physicians than the public. There's a reason for that. They know a lot more than most of us about the way in which people move on from this life. They see it all the time. They fight against death's victory every day. But to ask them to take a different position in relation to death, to demand by law that they offer services to the end of life, is fraught with extreme practical and moral risk for the medical profession and, indeed, for all of us and our families. Physician-assisted suicide is legal in the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Colombia, Canada and five US states as well as in Switzerland. Research that reviews the practices of those jurisdictions indicates that between 0.3 per cent and up to 4.6 per cent of deaths are reported as euthanasia. If we were to apply that 4.6 per cent of deaths to the Australian death statistics of 2016, which were 158,504 Australians, that would mean 7,291 Australians could be removed from this world by assisted euthanasia if we were to follow these international trends. In jurisdictions where assisted suicide has been legislated for some time, the legislative containment that accompanied those first laws has slackened. Research shows that safeguards are being violated, with studies in Belgium now indicating that up to 32 per cent of physicians assisting suicide had gone outside the regulations. 


Former Prime Minister Paul Keating published an article last year in the context of the Victorian debate. He said:


… the advocates support a bill to authorise termination of life in the name of compassion, while at the same time claiming they can guarantee protection of the vulnerable, the depressed and the poor.


No law and no process can achieve that objective. This is the point. If there are doctors prepared to bend the rules now, there will be doctors prepared to bend the rules under the new system.


The original containment of eligibility for assisted suicide has been extended in those jurisdictions in which assisted suicide is now legal. It's been extended from consenting adults to young children to the mentally ill to newborns with disabilities. I remind senators that right now in this country one in five Australians at any time are suffering from mental ill-health of some sort. In 2016, 2,866 Australians lost their lives to suicide. Research revealed around 65,000 people attempted suicide every year and that hundreds of thousands of people are affected by the impact of a suicide death. We're on a collision course between this national malaise and the potential of assisted suicide legislation, especially when depression and cancer collide. I want to note that the finding reported in European Psychiatry in 2012 indicates that family members in Switzerland who assisted the suicide of someone they loved reported after the fact a 20 per cent rate of post-traumatic stress disorder.


I will not be supporting this bill. I'm accused of being a person of faith and I freely admit to it. My faith does colour my view of the world and it enriches it. I've often wondered what people mean when they make a case for euthanasia by arguing that people should be allowed to die with dignity. In my world view, every person has dignity and value simply because they exist. It matters not their sex, gender, age, colour, race or, certainly, creed. I can never be persuaded that human beings need to have control over their bodies or their minds to have dignity. In my world view, each and every person, from conception to their last breath, is endowed with a dignity that is inherent in their very existence. Dignity is not something you lose on your journey to death.


How can legislating for the healers at the heart of our health system to actively bring on death not be a conflict of interest for doctors? How can legislating for the healers at the heart of our health system to actively assist in suicide not immerse them daily under the extreme burden of ongoing and profound moral dilemma? The profession itself is not united in asking for these powers. Indeed, there is a very lively debate amongst doctors on the public record. 


Like everyone in this place and like Australians across the country, I've lost people I love, four of them in my close family: my sister, my brother, my niece and my father—all from cancer, all from the illness that evidence shows triggers up to 75 per cent of the requests for assisted suicide. I've been in hospitals with the people I love as they have passed. Today seems a very good day to thank all those health professionals who cared for them as they passed and who cared for me and my family as we faced the profound loss and the initial throes of grief that engulfed us. I never for one moment doubted their care or their determination to preserve the lives of the people I love. 


Colleagues, in this place we know there has been the articulation of the awareness of the complexity around making law around end-of-life procedures. This complexity—if this bill passes here and we do allow the territories to discern their own particular legislation—cannot be overstated. I remind colleagues that the Northern Territory and the ACT are both unicameral parliaments—as, indeed, is the great state of Queensland. I fear that the march across this nation towards the establishment of assisted suicide continues and that we may see the emergence of differentiated legislation that will deal with life and death in different ways across all of the jurisdictions. We train doctors for all of the country, yet we're preparing, with this legislation, to create rights that will differentiate responsibilities across the borders. 


In closing, colleagues, this debate asks us to consider and come to a point of discernment about conflicting principles. On one side, there is the right of the individual and their autonomy, a position so championed here today by this bill advanced by the libertarian Senator Leyonhjelm and supported by many in this chamber. I put it to you, senators, that there is a disproportionate response to the issues of both mental and physical distress that have been discussed in the Senate over the course of the last two days. This is an argument that drives us to wholesale change to law at the request of few, to the detriment of many. Assisted suicide cannot, in my view, be safely legislated. On the other side is the right of the public to safety and natural assumptions and instincts that drive us to make lawful the protection of life. 


I believe in the fundamental right of a person to live in a society that values their life. This should not be put at risk. A community needs to ensure that institutions such as the law and the professions—especially our doctors—value lives, will save lives and will not take life. I close with Paul Keating's comments:


No matter what justifications are offered for the bill, it constitutes an unacceptable departure in our approach to human existence and the irrevocable sanctity that should govern our understanding of what it means to be human.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2018-08-15,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister for Finance, Special Minister of State and Vice-President of the Executive Council) (17:37):  I rise to speak to this bill, the Restoring Territory Rights (Assisted Suicide Legislation) Bill 2015, which seeks to undo a decision of this parliament 21 years ago. The vote on this bill is, rightly, a conscience issue because good people across Australia have strongly held views on both sides of this argument. Personally, I will vote against this bill, and that is because, as a matter of deep personal conviction and faith, I am committed to upholding the dignity of human life. 


There is no circumstance in which I could or would vote in support of any bill which would either directly or indirectly legalise or facilitate the state sanctioned taking of a human life. Of course, like all in this chamber, I want to see the right care and support available for our terminally ill. I want to see high-quality care for those that go through this very difficult process as they approach the end of their life—the appropriate pain relief and palliative care to help facilitate dying with dignity. But I cannot support the official, state sanctioned, deliberate taking of a human life. It goes against everything I believe to be right. I do not believe there is a safe way that it can be legislated. I do not believe it can be legislated in a way which provides the appropriate protections to the vulnerable, depressed or the poor. 


Some have argued that this is not a bill to legalise assisted suicide or euthanasia but rather a bill to uphold states' rights. I would submit to the Senate that this is objectively wrong. Firstly, by definition, the territories are not states; they are territories. Under section 122 of our Constitution, the power to make laws for the government of any territory rests with the Commonwealth parliament. Having the constitutional power gives us the constitutional responsibility. We can't abrogate that responsibility. If we, as the Commonwealth parliament, vote in favour of this legislation, we are effectively voting in favour of legalising assisted suicide, except that we're doing so without having any capacity to influence the circumstances and the framework within which that is then done. We would be delegating the power to legalise assisted suicide to the territories. We would be abrogating our responsibility to ensure it is done in an appropriate way. As I say, I'm opposed to state-sanctioned assisted suicide. But even those who are in favour should ask themselves the question whether they are comfortable with being responsible for whatever form that state-sanctioned assisted suicide takes on the other side of a process in the Australian Capital Territory assembly or the Northern Territory assembly, over which we then no longer have any influence.


It is also important to remember that, in the year after the Andrews bill—which this bill seeks to overturn—became law back in 1997, the Northern Territory had the opportunity to become a state. The people of the Northern Territory, by majority vote, chose not to do so. If a majority of the people in the Northern Territory back in 1998, the year after the Commonwealth took away the Northern Territory's power to keep euthanasia legal, were offended by that and wanted to preserve their right to make laws into the future to legalise assisted suicide, then surely they would have voted in favour of statehood, which would have removed the constitutional power of the Commonwealth to continue to maintain the prohibition that is currently legislated. I put it to the chamber that the fact that, on the back of the federal parliament's intervention, they did not do so shows that the people of the Northern Territory at the time supported the actions of the federal parliament at that time.


In conclusion, I will vote no both as a matter of deep personal conviction and faith as well as on the basis that I do not feel comfortable to abrogate the responsibility to get the framework and safeguards right, if assisted suicide were to be legislated, to either the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory. I don't believe that there is a safe way to legalise assisted suicide in a way that would not inappropriately expose the vulnerable, the depressed and the poor to inappropriate pressures. Finally, given that the Constitution gives the Australian parliament the power to enact this legislation, I believe we have a responsibility to maintain the legislation as it currently stands and not to undo the decision, which I believe was the right decision back in 1997, to prevent the territories from legislating state-sanctioned taking of human life.

"Urquhart, Sen Anne",ALP,2018-08-15,"



Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania—Opposition Whip in the Senate) (17:42):  Australians who are terminally and incurably ill should have the right to choose a humane and dignified end to their life. They should be able to choose to end their pain and suffering, and their families should be afforded compassionate support in this decision. I rise to speak in support of the territories to legislate for assisted suicide in their respective jurisdictions. It is no longer appropriate, nor has it been, for the Commonwealth to interfere with the ability of the territories to determine their own legislative futures on this incredibly important matter. While the passing of the Restoring Territory Rights (Assisted Suicide Legislation) Bill 2015 will not automatically legalise assisted suicide in the territories, it will significantly improve the ability of those governments to demonstrate empathy and leadership to those who are suffering in their communities.


Australia is rapidly falling well behind the rest of the world on this issue. Switzerland has the world's oldest act, in effect since 1942, and, some 20 years ago, the state of Oregon in the USA enacted the Death with Dignity Act. There are increasing numbers of jurisdictions providing their citizens with the dignity of choosing when to end their suffering. There are now eight countries and six states in the United States where you can choose to die with assistance. In these jurisdictions, there are a range of safeguards and checks and balances to ensure that society's most vulnerable are cared for and protected. There are an extensive range of measures to avoid elder abuse, a commonly forwarded argument used by those against voluntary assisted suicide. To do nothing, however, is also, in my eyes, abuse. Poll after poll continues to show that a majority of Australians—indeed, up to 80 per cent of them—support voluntary assisted dying laws. It is abundantly clear that people want a choice in when and the way in which they choose to die.


The Northern Territory has shown leadership in this area before, as has the ACT. We would all be aware that the Victorian government has just become the first to pass its Voluntary Assisted Dying Act late last year. Tasmanian Labor continues to work tirelessly to demonstrate compassion, courage and leadership on this issue, fighting to win the right for those in our state to be afforded the dignity of dying when they see fit. My state colleagues have campaigned vigorously to end this example of government overreach. Government should not take on the role or the authority of telling people in excruciating pain when they can die; it is inhumane. The Tasmanian state Labor caucus believes people should have the right to end their life when they have a serious and incurable medical condition that is causing them to suffer in a way that is intolerable to them. I support them in those beliefs.


As incredible as palliative care and those providing the care can be, we must recognise that it does not alleviate all suffering for all people. No person should have to suffer intolerable pain but, rather, should be able to choose to die with assistance with appropriate supports and safeguards in place. During the numerous times that this topic has been debated, we have all heard harrowing stories of those forced to endure intolerable pain and suffering, sometimes for months and years on end. I have no doubt that all of us in this chamber have at some point been moved by a story or an experience of a family member or friend who wished only for their pain to end.


I've been touched by the story of Andrew Denman and his family. Andrew is a very well-known Tasmanian. Some of my colleagues here today would know him for his passion for our specialist timber industry. He shared his story with us after he watched his mother, Carol, die a long, protracted, terrifying and painful death. An advanced directive to cease food and water was enforced and she starved to death. I will paraphrase what he wrote when sharing his story with my Tasmanian colleague. Andrew wrote, 'Another injection, more pain, more suppositories, more indignity. It is excruciating to watch knowing that I made a promise to her not to ever let things get to this stage. I will be forever haunted by mum's pleading looks every time her eyes partially open, asking me to end it all.' At her passing, he shared, 'Mum died this morning at 11:00 am. She died a so-called good death imposed upon her by the laws of Australia. Thirteen days she lasted with no food or water—death by dehydration until her internal organs failed one by one.'


In May 2011, I lost my own father to cancer. Our family watched as he fought this disease until it took his life. He used to talk to us for a very long number of years about wanting to be able to choose when his life ended, when his suffering would be ended. It was his wish always to have control over the end of his life and, in the end, he had no control. Earlier this year, again we felt the sting of what's happened with overreach when we lost our mum. The night before she passed, sitting with her, she asked if I could make it end, make the pain go away with an injection. And, just like dad, in the end, she had no control.


People are suffering and they feel trapped within that suffering, with many looking for a way to peacefully make it end. They are not provided with that and, as leaders, we continue to actively deny them that. This denial must stop. In an attempt to gain back control, people are taking their own lives in the most horrific and tragic methods. Those who are suffering are sometimes making the decision to end their lives with often catastrophic consequences for their loved ones who find them.


The time to provide a legal framework for these decisions to be made is well overdue. It's time to eliminate this end-of-life trauma that many Australian families are having to experience. I support the bill before the Senate.

 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (17:49):  I'd like to lay down three markers to frame my contribution to this debate on the Restoring Territory Rights (Assisted Suicide Legislation) Bill 2015. Firstly, territories don't have equal constitutional standing with the states. States are sovereign and territories are creations of the Commonwealth parliament. Secondly, had I been in federal parliament in 1996, I would have supported the Kevin Andrews bill. Thirdly, had I been a member of the Victorian parliament in 2017, I would have opposed the Daniel Andrews bill.


Victoria made a mistake, and I don't want to see other jurisdictions make the same mistake. I can't do anything about what states may do, but I can around what territories do. My reasoning is straightforward. In jurisdictions, before Victoria changed their legislation, I believe there was adequate space in the law for parents, families and doctors to put in place good and appropriate palliative care. My experience with a parent in Queensland 21 years ago and a parent in Victoria 16 years ago is that this was the case. I'm deeply troubled by the current Victorian law at a number of levels. I can't support the Senate allowing a jurisdiction within the Commonwealth parliament's control to go down that same path. I'll, therefore, be opposing this bill.

Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (17:51):  I also want to make a contribution to this debate on the Restoring Territory Rights (Assisted Suicide Legislation) Bill 2015. I want to take a slightly different tack at the start of my contribution. I actually think that it's appalling that the Prime Minister of this country has traded away about five per cent of the nation's legislative time with respect to a vote on another piece of legislation. In order to get Senator Leyonhjelm's vote on the ABCC legislation, the Prime Minister dedicated precious legislative time in this chamber to advance Senator Leyonhjelm's electoral prospects. The reality is we have no jurisdiction in this issue anyway. We don't have any jurisdiction to legislate for assisted suicide, euthanasia or the like. For a deal—in my view, a very tawdry deal—to be done on such an emotive and important issue of territory rights and euthanasia is just another symptom of the dysfunction of this government.


I rely on my information coming from those good people in the Parliamentary Library. If I get a Bills Digest, I ask the Parliamentary Library about it and they always provide all of the information. In the Bills Digest on this bill, there is a description of this deal—a clear and concise description—alleged by Senator Leyonhjelm and there is, at the end of the information provided, disagreement about what the deal actually was. It's contained in the Parliamentary Library's Bills Digest on the Restoring Territory Rights (Assisted Suicide Legislation) Bill 2015. For the life of me, I cannot understand how we can take an issue like this and make it a tradeable commodity for a vote on another piece of legislation. I find that very disturbing.


I've listened to the debate and many of the speakers on this. For what it's worth, I used to live in the Northern Territory. I have family that live in the Northern Territory right now. I've consulted with those family members in the Northern Territory. I had a brother in Royal Adelaide Hospital, very recently, getting treatment. My daughter-in-law's brother-in-law died at 43 of leukaemia after a very critical cancer treatment. His treatment was, incidentally, delivered mainly in South Australia. I've been lobbied quite substantially on this issue. One of the most compelling people who I've spoken to is that good person Andrew Denton. Andrew Denton pointed me in the right direction on a number of these matters.


Over a period of time, I've sourced the original legislation from Oregon, which, I think, was the first jurisdiction to put this type of legislation in place, and I've had a look at the legislation in Victoria. I can say very clearly that, if you look at the evidence and the assessment of what happened in Oregon—under the legislation there I think there were some 1,969 prescription recipients, and 1,275 of those patients actually ingested the medication—you can get a very good view of how big an issue this is. I understand the population of Oregon is currently 4.1 million. You can actually dive into the 2017 annual report and you can see that there were 143 deaths during 2017, and most of the patients, 80.4 per cent, were aged 65 or older. The median age of death was 74 years. As in the previous years, recipients were commonly white, at 94.4 per cent, and well educated, with 48.9 per cent having baccalaureate degrees.


I hear all the contributions from various sectors of the chamber and I listen to my colleague Senator Dodson, who says there are grave reservations in the Indigenous community. It's probably not the most pressing issue in the Indigenous community; I think that's fair to say. But if people are not accessing health services because of the fear—whether it's mistaken or whether it's a misunderstanding—that there is an assisted dying process, that's absolutely catastrophic, in my view.


I can go on about this probably more than most of the people in this chamber. I saw my father die during an episode of chemotherapy. In those days, chemotherapy was catastrophic. You would get a dose of chemotherapy which was so caustic that it overcame most of your bodily functions, but you got six weeks. You got six weeks of respite. I think, after two periods of that chemotherapy, he was at least able to put his affairs in order. He was at least able to do the things he wanted to do. He never wanted to go a second earlier. He endured. Ultimately he died of a heart attack while I was actually physically there, during an episode of chemotherapy. But it's come a long way from there.


Palliative care has come a long way from there. Just last week a colleague of mine, who was 76 years old and a president of the TWU South Australia and Northern Territory branch, was doing something that was probably a little untoward at the age of 76: moving a fridge. He suffered an incident when he was transporting that fridge and collided with a pole. He was admitted to intensive care and put into a coma. As always, our very, very good intensive care people did their absolute best to maintain life and the rest of his functions, but ultimately he was taken out of the coma and was found to have no cognitive functions. He basically had been deprived of oxygen; it was unclear how long he'd been in the car before the retrieval teams got there and took him to the appropriate facility. So the decision was made then that they would not continue with restoring his bodily functions or getting him to breathe unaided and, after a reasonably short period of time, he passed away.


I go from one end of the scale to the other end of the scale and, in the middle, I could stand here and reiterate many cases of friends and family—close family, including both my mothers-in-law and my first wife—who all went through cancer treatments and palliative care and passed in the company of their children, grandchildren, friends and relatives. I'm not certain that there are a great number of people who are rushing to take a solution here. The evidence, if we look at Oregon, is 4.1 million people and about 143 per annum in that 20-year zone. It's very clear. People like Andrew Denton and other very competent people in this space say: 'You need to recognise, Alex, that five per cent of people will not get the benefit of palliative care. Five per cent of people will suffer inordinately from their condition, and they should have the right to choose.' That's the prevailing argument. They also say that 40 per cent of that five per cent will not take it, but they should have the right to it.


I have been entirely conflicted by this debate. The argument in respect of people in the Northern Territory having the same rights as every other Australian is probably where I started out. I thought that looked like a no-brainer. What's the difference between an Australian in the Northern Territory and an Australian in South Australia? But when you dive back into it, there probably is a little bit of a debate. If you go back to the Northern Territory referendum on statehood, 94,000 people voted. That's probably smaller than a federal electorate. Of those, 44,702 voted yes, 48,241 voted no and there were 1,065 informals. There was an attempt to set up a bipartisan NT Legislative Assembly committee, chaired by former Chief Minister Steve Hatton. That committee proposed a draft constitution and said that it should be debated at an elected constitutional convention. The Hon. Shane Stone ignored that recommendation, nominating a convention membership of 53 members at short notice, and presented the convention's draft constitution, which was different from the committee's recommendations. The former CLP Chief Minister Steve Hatton later said that one of the campaign slogans at the time was 'We want statehood, not Stonehood.' So it was very clear that there was a very divisive character leading the Northern Territory at that time. It beggars belief that the Northern Territory would vote against statehood, but they did, and clearly because they had reservations about the way the place was being run.


The starting point of my statement is: if you can trade off five per cent of the nation's legislative time for a vote on another bill, what certainty will we ever have that there won't be another deal in the future which will change the parameters of whichever state or territory comes out and puts into place some assisted suicide legislation? I'm not certain that this is as clear-cut as people are making out. I've lived in the Northern Territory, and the saying in the Northern Territory is: if you're in pain, get on a plane. You're generally going to get better advice from specialists and/or medical treatment if you go to Adelaide or Melbourne or wherever. That's no criticism of the Northern Territory. It's a very small population base. Obviously, they can't have all of the attendant specialist services and expertise that a major population centre will have. They do great work. You can see that in the work they did with respect to East Timor and the like. But if you do get crook in the Northern Territory, a lot of people choose to get their treatment in another state.


I'm not sure, if we do not support this right to go and discuss assisted dying, assisted suicide or the like, that we're going to be doing anyone in the Northern Territory a great disservice. I'm not sure that anybody in the Northern Territory is really going to be tremendously upset. They may have an in-principle objection, but they voted against statehood because they didn't like the way their leader was taking them to it. That's essentially what the evidence says. They've been used very unfairly in this issue, in my view.


I asked initially: 'Why is this a conscience vote? Why hasn't our leadership done what they do on most issues?' The answer that came back was: it's a conscience vote because in 1998 it was a conscience vote. Okay, I'll accept that. I've sought some advice from the Northern Territory, and some of the advice coming back was: 'Shouldn't this be done at a higher level? Why should a small jurisdiction like the Northern Territory have to go through and do this?'


One of the things I do disagree with Senator Leyonhjelm on is this position about competitive federalism. What does that mean? I can point to a couple of examples of what it means. It means that if you are a jurisdiction that is in favour of online gambling—and I'm not opposed to that—then you seek to base yourself in the Northern Territory, and that's essentially what's happened. I have no particular view on pornography or the rest of it, but when in recent times you want to go into that business, the place do you it is the ACT. That's what the history was.


I'm opposed to this notion of taking the smallest group of constituents, getting a position up and then trying to expand that around the country. Basically, I think my bottom line position is that I'm not convinced that, although a good death is desired by all, we can prescribe that adequately and in perpetuity. It will change. We've got an example here where a Prime Minister traded a position for a vote. So ultimately I'm going to come down on the basis that I'm totally unsure about the effect of what we're doing here on the Northern Territory and, on balance, I don't think we're going to strenuously disadvantage anybody in the ACT or the Northern Territory with regard to not passing Senator Leyonhjelm's bill.


I will sum up by saying I don't like the way it came to this chamber. I don't like the fact this nation's legislative time has been used as a bargaining chip. I'm unsure whether we can carefully and appropriately prescribe in perpetuity for end of life choice. My own lived experience of quite a number of people extremely close to me is that they all went the way they wanted to go, fighting for every last breath in their body and, really, surrounded by the people they loved. And I don't know if we should be doing too much more than that. Thank you.

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (18:07):  Before I start my contribution on this particularly important bill before the chamber, can I just correct something that Senator Gallacher asserted during his contribution. He made the assertion that the government had allocated precious government business time in the Senate on this bill as part of a deal. This assertion has been made by previous contributors today, and it is not correct. The reason that this bill is currently being debated is that the Labor Party, the Greens and enough of the crossbenchers voted in favour of a motion to make this happen. I'd now like to move onto the substantive part of my contribution.


Before us today are two very serious concerns: one of great emotional divide and the other in pursuit of legality and federalism. It conflates the two issues of assisted suicide legislation and recognising the autonomy of the territories. I fear it is too simplistic to be debating this proposed legislation as it is. These are concerns that warrant full and frank discussion, whereas the Restoring Territory Rights (Assisted Suicide Legislation) Bill 2015 concurrently discusses multiple matters at once. Some have said it's not about territory issues, while others have said it's not about euthanasia. In the same vein, others have said this legislation before us goes to the rights of territories to make decisions for themselves and contend it does not ask senators to give a view approving or disapproving of euthanasia. Are we discussing territory rights or human rights? Are we discussing social issues, ethical issues, jurisdiction issues or constitutional issues?


The message falls flat on what is actually before the Senate. In my opinion, there are two intrinsically unique matters, each of which unfortunately masks the other. Before us currently, the legal inquiry cannot ignore the philosophical question, but, with equal merit, the philosophical concerns cannot navigate its legality. The two are individually separate, yet the very title of this bill binds them together.


There should be other means through which we can have a full and frank territory rights debate. Similarly, this is not the setting for an assisted suicide debate, with external motives potentially roadblocking a serious policy discussion that can touch the lives of all Australians. This bill purports to encourage competitive federalism. Territories have a distinct role within our federal parliamentary system—they always have—but the existence of the powers retained by the Commonwealth under section 122 of the Constitution can suggest that the debate before us is to be determined by political means, not legislative ones at the hands of local assemblies. The Commonwealth is the supreme law-making body and, as it stands, the Commonwealth can retain legislative oversight for the government of a territory. 


In acknowledging the intentions of this bill, it confirms that the Howard government's Euthanasia Laws Act 1997 successfully repealed the Northern Territory Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995. To this end, the proposed legislation recognises the respective roles and powers of the territories and the federal parliament in acknowledging that the federal parliament is the body that is ultimately responsible for the laws of the territories. To ignore this important function without considerable consultation and dialogue could be ill-advised, and I'm not sure whether this discussion is rightly placed against this issue.


However, in saying that, I'm a strong supporter of the inalienable rights and freedoms of all people, underpinned by the most minimal government intrusion in their private lives as possible. Individuals are almost always best positioned to make their own choices. To this end, I appreciate Senator Leyonhjelm's pursuit. However, the inextricable linking of the two issues in this bill makes it impossible to separate the discussion. I firmly believe that these two distinct issues must be debated separately. Euthanasia and territory rights are not one and the same. By binding them together, we overlook their respective significance and unconsciously belittle their inherent worth. I deeply respect the views and opinions of all who have participated in this debate. However, I find myself unable to support all aspects of this bill.

"Canavan, Sen Matthew",Nats,2018-08-15,"



Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland—Minister for Resources and Northern Australia) (18:12):  I am opposed to the Restoring Territory Rights (Assisted Suicide Legislation) Bill 2015 because I believe in the sanctity of human life. Leaving the state to assist and sanction suicide, in my view, would diminish the special and unique gift of human life. I recognise that, while the bill seeks to restore territory rights, it explicitly does so for the purpose of sanctioning assisted suicide. Indeed, the words 'assisted suicide' are in the title of the bill. While the matter of euthanasia is a matter for the states, the Commonwealth does have the constitutional right to legislate in this area for the territories. I believe this is a matter of such ethical importance that it should be reserved for the national parliament and not be delegated to jurisdictions that are not recognised as states under our Constitution. I will confine the rest of my marks to the ethical question of the legalisation of assisted suicide.


I want to very clearly outline in my contribution what I mean by euthanasia or assisted suicide. Euthanasia is a deliberate act that causes death. The failure to provide or to accept treatment is not euthanasia. The provision of pain relief, providing it's administered without the intention of ending life, is not euthanasia. I think we can all agree that we should seek to adequately fund palliative care to help all people at the end of their lives to avoid unnecessary suffering.


Of course, we don't all agree on whether the legalisation of assisted suicide is a good idea. This is a deeply ethical question and I appreciate and respect other views on this issue. My views stem from the ethical views that I hold—in particular, that there is a natural law that demarcates certain acts as good and other acts as evil. I've heard many times in this debate that we put down animals to end their suffering, so why shouldn't we allow humans to do the same? There are a number of things that I think are fundamentally wrong with such a metaphor. The first most practical one is that animals have no agency in their euthanasia. A dog is not asked for its permission before a needle is administered, because a dog cannot give its permission. It has no free will. Human beings do have free will, however. We are remarkable creatures. We are not mere animals. We have an innate desire to seek the good. We make choices after contemplation and consciousness. There is something unique, special and sacred about every human life, and we should fight to cherish and protect all human lives.


Another thing human beings uniquely do is love. We should celebrate and love life. That must start by learning to love our individual selves and the gift of human life that we have been given. That will let us love others as well and will let us seek a good and virtuous life. I believe that this parliament and the state more generally should pass laws that celebrate life and that help establish a culture of life; unfortunately, in my view this bill does not celebrate life. 


Some will argue in rebuttal to me that assisted suicide will only be permissible in limited circumstances—those in great suffering or those at the end of their life. But a society is judged by the values it holds most dear, the thing it will not trade off for some other thing of higher worth. For a Judeo-Christian society, that most valuable thing, that thing that is most sacred, that cannot be violated, is human life. I believe that such a standard helps deliver more good. In a society that allows the state to sanction suicide, clearly human life is not the highest good, not the most sacred thing. Such a society is willing to trade off life for less human suffering. Instead, in such a society the greatest good would be the minimisation of human suffering and the promotion of untrammelled human liberty towards that end. This would be a fundamental change to the bedrock moral and ethical standards of our society. 


The problem with this change is that there is no clear definition of who is to decide what is too much human suffering and what restrictions would be placed around the maximisation of human welfare, even potentially at the expense of the suffering of others. At its limit, this philosophy replaces the 10 commandments with a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. We can calculate one person's suffering—or the antiseptic jargon, 'their quality of life'—against the happiness of others. When human life is not infinitely valued, our lives literally become the inputs to a morally vacuous mathematical formula. This is not just a theoretical concern; it has been the lived experience of societies who have gone down this path. 


Take the example of the Netherlands, where assisted suicide has been legal for more than 15 years. A recent survey found that 60 per cent of Dutch physicians do not report their cases of assisted suicide, even though reporting is required by law, and about 25 per cent of physicians admit to ending patients' lives without their consent. There is even a reported case where a Dutch doctor euthanised a 26-year-old ballerina with arthritis in her toes, because she could no longer pursue her career as a dancer, she was depressed and requested to be put to death. The doctor complied with her request and merely noted, 'One doesn't enjoy such things, but it was her choice.' 


I fear that a right to die could soon transform into an expectation to die. This would then cause a fundamental shift in how we interact with our families and our loved ones. If we are seeking to maximise happiness, not protect life, soon people will be seen as, or will see themselves as, a burden on others, not someone with intrinsic value in their own life. I don't want to encourage a society where the disabled or sick are not seen as anything other than fully human with all the God-given rights that we all enjoy. Again, this is the lived experience of jurisdictions that have legalised state sanctioned suicide. The Oregon Health Authority found that 40 per cent of those who assisted a suicide cited being a burden on family or friends or their caregivers as their motivation to end their life. 


As I said at the start of my contribution on this matter, my views on this are deeply personal; they do stem from the fundamental ethics that I hold. I do hope we can vote for life in this chamber, because I believe that, if we do not, we will return to a harsher, less forgiving world that we should not return to.

"Chisholm, Sen Anthony",ALP,2018-08-15,"



Senator CHISHOLM
 (Queensland) (18:18):  When it became clear in the last sitting week that this bill was going to be debated, my initial view was this was a matter of territory rights and that it would be a relatively simple for issue for me to deal with. But, obviously, in the winter break, with the opportunity to engage with more people and to talk about the issues at stake in this matter, it became a more complex decision for me to make. I want to put on the record that I appreciate those people, from both sides, who have come and spoken to me about this. They've done so in good faith; they believe in their case. I very much valued the opportunity to discuss this issue with them. It would be fair to say that I am uncomfortable with euthanasia, without being outright opposed to it. 


I keep coming back to this being an issue of territory rights, which I strongly believe in. A couple of things have influenced this more than others. Since the right of territories to legislate on this issue was taken away, we have seen state parliaments debate euthanasia legislation. Recently, we saw Victoria become the first state to pass that legislation, and that will begin in approximately 12 months time. And it is likely that, in other states throughout Australia, this legislation will be debated in coming years as well.


Some people opposed to this legislation have argued that the unique unicameral nature of the territories makes them unsuitable to deal with such complex issues. As a Queensland Labor senator, that's not an argument that I can sustain, given the make-up of the Queensland parliament, which has only one chamber. The thought that it would be able to deal with this in an adequate manner also gives me the confidence that the territories would be able to do so as well.


So, given that the debate has occurred in Victoria and other states and will likely occur in the future, I believe that territories deserve that same opportunity. I obviously urge them to progress that carefully, but I will be voting to support this bill, the restoring territories' rights bill, when it comes to a vote.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2018-08-15,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (18:20):  I seek leave to speak for about five minutes.


Leave granted.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I thank the Senate for that. I had spoken very briefly previously, so I'm technically barred without leave, but I thank the Senate for giving me leave for this short period so that I may just put on record my views on the Restoring Territory Rights (Assisted Suicide Legislation) Bill 2015, although I suspect my views are reasonably well known.


I was one of the few senators who was in this place when the Andrews bill was first dealt with on 19 March 1997. At that stage, I opposed the Andrews bill, which actually brought about the situation that this bill is trying to reverse. If people are interested particularly in my views, I would refer them to my speech in the Hansard of 19 March 1997, where I indicated why I was opposing what was then euphemistically called the Andrews bill.


I just want to briefly also mention that I chaired the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee when it dealt with the exposure draft of a private senator's bill, the Medical Services (Dying with Dignity) Bill 2014. That committee looked into this whole question in great detail, and there were an enormous number of witnesses. The one that sticks in my mind most was the young man, a family man, who attended the hearings in Melbourne with his wife, his three children and his uncle, former Senator Jim Short. He had three or four weeks left to live. He asked us to bring the hearing forward so he could give evidence. He was pleading with the committee as someone who, in his situation, was terminally ill. He wanted to pass away with his family, his loved ones, around the bed, at a time of his choosing. He knew there was no hope. He didn't want to wake up at two o'clock in the morning and die by himself. It was the most telling piece of evidence given to the committee at that time.


The committee didn't make recommendations on the bill or otherwise. It did, however, raise some issues which I think Senator Leyonhjelm might like to look at. I'll just quote from the committee's report:


Although the evidence received enabled the committee to consider some of the provisions of the Bill in detail, there remain some technical issues with a number of the provisions of the Bill. These include clarification of the definition of a dying with dignity service, clarification around the definition of a terminal illness, the number of medical practitioners required to consider the request, consistency of definition around decision-making capacity, and the serious consequences for medical practitioners who relied upon the immunities in the Bill if such immunities were later found to be unconstitutional.


The committee went on to say:


The committee notes conflicting evidence it received in relation to the primary constitutional basis for the Bill under—


section 51 of the Constitution. It continued:


The committee was told that there could be very serious consequences for medical practitioners who relied upon the immunities in the Bill, if such immunities were later found to be unconstitutional. This concern is enlivened by the virtual certainty that any federal legislation dealing with voluntary euthanasia will face constitutional challenge.


That was for another bill that was before this parliament. The bill we're dealing with now would give the Northern Territory parliament the right to make these decisions. It's a bit strange to quote my own words, but back in 1997 I said:


My opinion is, I believe, no better formed than the views of a democratically elected parliamentarian of the Northern Territory—a parliamentarian who was required over a much longer period of time than I to determine how the laws of that state like territory should apply. I am not one of those who believe that because I am in the federal parliament my opinions are that much superior to those of representatives of the people of the Northern Territory.


So I would vote in favour of this bill, as I have consistently done when this has come before this parliament on a couple of occasions previously. (Extension of time granted). 


I have heard a lot of the speeches here and I've had a lot of people come to talk to me, both for and against. I just want to make it clear that this is not like animals and it's not like dealing with someone against their will. We don't know what form a bill on this will take should one be introduced into the Northern Territory in future, but a lot of the conversation here talks about other people putting a person to death or agreeing to a person being put to death. The bills that we have looked at over the period of time are all about decisions by individuals who are capable of making decisions. People talk to me about dementia and people who are imposed upon or who are depressed. If a similar bill came into force in Australia, those people would not be eligible to make the decision, because you need a number of doctors to certify, first of all, that you are capable of making an informed decision and then, having made that informed decision, that it was your choice and not anybody else's—nobody could put you to death; it was solely your decision.


My own position comes from a brave Christian lady, a committed family person—in fact, my mother. She knew she was dying and she fought it for four years. In the last three years of her life, her quality of life fell by so much that she just wanted to go. There was nothing in it for her. She was being comfortably looked after, but she tried every trick in the book to terminate her own life. She couldn't do it. She eventually starved herself to death because it was the only way she could terminate her own life. (Extension of time granted). I do appreciate the chamber in this matter, which is a matter of conscience. I saw my mother in that situation back in 1997. In the end, after a long, uncomfortable and torturous battle, she did pass away, and I suspect that at the very end she was assisted in any case. I believe, from the medical profession, that this often happens.


The same sort of situation happened with my sister, a very Christian lady. She fought the good fight for so long, but, in the end, she was begging to move on. There was no quality of life. There was nothing in it for her. She knew she couldn't last and she just wanted to terminate her despair and hurt at an earlier time. Those are my two personal experiences, and a lot of experiences have been related to me by others. I acknowledge that many other people in this chamber and across Australia have a different view to me, but that is my view. I wanted to put it on the record yet again. I thank the Senate for their indulgence for me being able to do this.

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2018-08-15,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria—Minister for Rural Health, Minister for Sport, Minister for Regional Communications and Deputy Leader of The Nationals) (18:30):  Over the course of this debate, I've been able to listen to many senators provide their second reading debate contributions on the Restoring Territory Rights (Assisted Suicide Legislation) Bill 2015. I would like to thank them all for their thoughtful, considerate and compassionate contributions irrespective of which side of this debate they're on. This is a very personal matter. I recognise your contribution, Mr Acting Deputy President Williams, around the concept of dying with dignity. You made some very poignant points that the Senate should read if they didn't get a chance to hear your contribution.


For many people around this debate, they've argued that this is actually a bill about state and territory rights. I took the opportunity to read the second reading speech of the mover of this bill, and there's not a lot there. It makes very clear through the second reading speech that this is about euthanasia. I guess Senator Leyonhjelm wants to move this bill because he's concerned that the law says we are only permitted to die by our own hand without assistance. For me, that is how it should be if you feel life and death are part of the human experience. The joy of life, the mixed experience of living and the finality and inevitability of death are part of the human condition. For me, it is a bit like what the Stoic Seneca said: 'death is the wish of some, the relief of many and the end of all.' It is, for me, part of that human journey.


Additionally, when we look at dying and making sure that the experience of death for those in Australia is as painless, sensitive and compassionate as possible, we've come a long way. Think about the last two decades and how palliative care is practised in this country now. Patients and families have the choice to ensure that their emotional, spiritual and physical care needs are being met, and everybody can be supported by a professional who's trained and knows how to assist. We need to focus on that aspect of the death experience. It's not a state, territory or Commonwealth government's role to say who should live or die. It is an individual's decision. We know from experiences overseas that if we open a decision then we get perverse outcomes. It is a government's role to actually protect the most vulnerable in our society. Even opening the door by a fraction to the potential of another person, another officer of the state or the state itself to be taken advantage of for monetary gain or convenience is something that I can't be a part off. I will be voting against the bill.

Senator MARTIN
 (Tasmania) (18:33):  I rise today to put on record my position on the Restoring Territory Rights (Assisted Suicide Legislation) Bill 2015, introduced by Senator Leyonhjelm. This bill is one of the most important. It quite literally deals with the prospect of life and death. This is not an issue that I or honourable senators can take lightly. Regardless of one's philosophical and emotional views on this issue, such significant changes must be considered with the wellbeing of territorians foremost in our minds. For the record, I am a supporter of an individual's right, when facing the prospect of long and painful suffering with no hope of recovery, to have the ability to choose to end their own lives.


But, like many issues that come before us as parliamentarians, this issue is not black and white. I cannot simply impose my beliefs about voluntary euthanasia on this matter when asked whether or not to support this bill. I would like to recognise the work of former Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Mr Marshall Perron, in passing Australia's first euthanasia laws some 22 years ago. This was our country's first attempt at giving the terminally ill the option of making an informed decision to end their own lives. However, within two years this legislation became invalid after the passing of the Euthanasia Laws Act 1997 by this parliament to amend the Northern Territory's and Australian Capital Territory's self-governing acts to remove those territories' ability to legislate in this area. It is this change, made over two decades ago, that we are now essentially being asked to overturn.


I have sat and listened carefully to the contribution of honourable senators to this bill. I have also watched with great interest the public contributions of the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, the Hon. Michael Gunner MLA; and the Chief Minister of the ACT, Mr Andrew Barr MLA. They have framed this argument around this debate to be one of the legislative rights of the territories. In fact, thousands of dollars of territorian taxpayers' money was spent by their respective governments on taking out full-page adverts in The Australian to put forward their case. However, I strongly hold the view that such arguments overtook the core function of this bill. The fact is that, if this bill were to pass the Senate and the other place, it would enable territorian parliaments to legislate once again in the area of voluntary euthanasia, and legislate they would. Whilst I acknowledge the passionate contributions of territory senators in this place, particularly that of my Nationals Senate leader, Senator Scullion, this is where my greatest concern with this bill begins.


Whilst considering this bill, I reflected on the debates on this matter in 1996 and, in particular, I reflected on the second reading contribution of the honourable member for Menzies in another place, where he said:


It is not a debate about territory rights;


It is not about the separation of church and state;


It is not about regulating current practice; and


It is not a simple issue of personal autonomy.


I believe that these words of the honourable member for Menzies in the other place are just as applicable to this debate as they were two decades ago.


I would like to place on the record my recognition of Australian territories' rights to make laws for those Australians who call these unique parts of our nation home. However, I cannot in good conscience offer my support to this bill, which will provide the territories the ability to legislate in the area of voluntary euthanasia—certainly not without ensuring that appropriate safeguards are put in place, because the fact is there are no second chances for us as legislators if we get this wrong.


It is a matter of public record that the original Rights of the Terminally Ill Act of the Northern Territory, passed by the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory in 1995, was carried by just a handful of votes in a unicameral parliament, unlike the parliaments of other jurisdictions, with the exception of Queensland, who themselves have instituted a comprehensive committee system. The territories do not have a house of review. There are no other legislators to provide sober reflection on such complex matters, which are literally ones of life and death. The decisions on these matters are left in the hands of just 25 members in a chamber which maintains a government majority. Whilst I do not wish to cast aspersions in any way on the competencies or efforts of the hardworking members of our territory parliaments, I firmly believe that such a final matter should be canvassed by a group of concerned citizens in greater numbers and be subject to substantially more legislative scrutiny. This just further adds to my concerns that the safeguards, as well as the processes, which will determine if and how an individual can choose to end their life, are simply insufficient.


I conclude by saying that, as legislators, we cannot create laws that will cover every aspect of someone's life. We can only put into place laws that, to the best of our knowledge, with consultation and experience, will not only provide freedom of choice but also adequately protect people. Given those concerns, I will not be supporting this bill, and encourage honourable senators to do the same. Thank you.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2018-08-15,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (18:40):  I've thought long and hard about this over many years. I don't want to give the impression that I'm being simplistic in what I say tonight, but dying with dignity and voluntary euthanasia decisions made to end life and end suffering are happening informally anyway, from my personal experience. My dearly beloved grandpa passed away a few years back. Sadly, I wasn't there that night, but my family were. A family discussion was had, medical staff were consulted and my grandfather was given a dose of morphine and sent on his way. Having spoken to many friends, I understand this is quite common.


Tonight, I want to very quickly tell a story about a friend of mine. Her mother was terminally ill and was suffering. They put an end-of-life plan in place. They lived on the North Coast of New South Wales. When their mother deemed the time was right, the family were going to convene at a coastal town. They knew the family doctor very well. All of them had known the family doctor, including the mother, and it was agreed that he would be there when the time was right and she would die with dignity under her own terms, with her family and loved ones there. As it turned out, when the time came, the doctor was away on leave and a locum was in town. When the mother said she was in pain and she wanted to go, they called the doctor and the locum said, 'She has to go to emergency.' He refused to administer a dose of morphine. Although the family tried to plead with the doctor, he said, 'No, it's against the law. She's going to emergency. She needs medical help.' They put her in an ambulance to take her to Brisbane emergency, some 45 minutes away, and she died in the ambulance, alone, on the way to the hospital. Her family were sitting in the lounge room when they got the phone call. They had planned this for months. That's what their mother wanted: to die with dignity. How many other stories do you need to hear about people who choose to end their life on their own terms?


So, while I understand that these things need to be carefully thought through and there need to be the right checks and balances, I believe—and it may sound simplistic—that this kind of thing is happening anyway and decisions are being made. It isn't actually official or regulated or legal, but it happens anyway. We probably will never get statistics on that, but certainly that's my experience. You may want to take a sample and ask the question: who should be making decisions about this? Of course, we are voting on this tonight, and they may very well vote on legislation in the Northern Territory. The people we should really be asking are those who are terminally ill and are in the situation where they may wish to die with dignity. None of us, I hope, in this chamber are in that situation. Some of us may be one day. They are the people we should be asking. I find it very difficult to sit in here and listen to people saying it's against their values and their beliefs. It's actually the people who are suffering who should be the ones making this decision, not us in here today, and we should provide the ability for them to do that.


On behalf of Senator Di Natale, I would like to indicate that we do not intend to move the amendments as circulated following any second reading vote. Those amendments were on sheet 8493.


I will conclude my contributions by saying I do support this legislation. I think it's critically important that we give every human being the right to go on their own terms and to die with dignity. We should accept that death is a fact of life and we should deal with it in a mature and open way.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2018-08-15,"



Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (18:46):  The incorporated speech read as follows—


I support this bill, which removes a longstanding injustice done to citizens of the Northern Territory and the ACT.


And that's all it does.


It is not a bill that legalises medically assisted suicide.


Or which creates a system of safeguards to define and regulate the circumstances in which people may seek medical assistance to end their lives.


It may be argued that there are two separate issues:


Whether Australian citizens should be entitled to equal rights wherever they live.


And whether the states and territories should have the right to legalise medically assisted suicide. (The Commonwealth does not have the power to do that.)


My answer to both questions is yes, and I wish to state briefly the reasons why I believe this bill should be passed.


I am one of the few in this place who took part in the 1997 Senate debate on the legislation the bill seeks to overturn.


My view has not changed.


In 1997, I said:


""I am probably the last one in this chamber to argue that the state has no right to interfere in the lives of its citizens.


To the contrary, I believe that the role of the state is to provide some form of sensible regulation which is vital for the fair and equitable running of a society.


Therefore I won't say that the state has no right to tell a person when they can or cannot die, because I am aware that people are already making those decisions.


What I believe the state must do is ensure that people have access to safety, proper medical advice, and as much decent care and support as can be given.


There are others who also oppose the bill before us today on the grounds that the state has no right to restrict the freedom of an individual to seek their own death and to seek medical assistance to do that.


It gives me a sense of ironic pleasure to quote John Stuart Mill, who argues that 'the only justification for restricting freedom through law is to prevent harm to others'.


It puzzles me somewhat that so many of the free marketeers in this Parliament, who would normally proclaim the sanctity of the individual and invoke the name of Mill, are in this instance opposing the individual's right to self-determination.


I also acknowledge that many senators support this [1997] bill on genuinely held religious grounds ... However, Australia is a secular nation, and as its Parliament we have an obligation to make secular laws, not religious ones.""


One of the consequences of the 1997 Act was that it restricts equality before the law on the basis of where people live.


If you live in one of the states, your state's parliament is considered competent to legislate on euthanasia.


But if you live in the Northern Territory or the ACT, your territory's assembly is denied that competence.


The bill now before us removes that geographic inequality.


And in doing so, it would restore to the territories the right to allow their residents to seek medical assistance to end their lives if they are facing a protracted, painful death from incurable illness.


There is no justification for elected parliaments refusing to allow individuals to make that decision.


If you apply the John Stuart Mill test—that a restriction of freedom is only justified to prevent harm to others—who is harmed when the law denies individuals of sound mind the right to end their lives in the circumstances I have described?


The harm is done to the individuals whose autonomy has been denied.


They have lost control over their lives.


A law on assisted suicide should stipulate appropriate safeguards to ensure that personal autonomy is respected.


The Northern Territory law overturned in 1997 did have these safeguards.


That is also true of the assisted dying law recently enacted in Victoria.


It is important to be aware of this, because one of the most common cited reasons for opposing voluntary euthanasia is the fear that some people will not be choosing freely when they ask to be helped to die.


Perhaps, the opponents of assisted suicide say, because of subtle pressure from families who see them as a burden.


Or pressure from hospitals that are short of beds for patients who will recover.


These are familiar scenarios put forward in the course of any debate on euthanasia.


It is claimed that legalising voluntary euthanasia will start us on a slippery slope to a society of manipulation and abuse.


I do not accept the notion that we cannot devise laws to avoid such an outcome.


And I remind senators that the unregulated environment that applies in every Australian jurisdiction except Victoria is much more likely to result in the manipulation and abuse of the terminally ill.


We should not pretend that medically assisted suicides do not already take place, but without safeguards.


Opponents of medically assisted suicide like to evoke images of fascist regimes that used euthanasia to eliminate the unwanted.


That is not what the NT Act overturned in 1997 and the present Victorian Act allow.


Both those laws contain safeguards to prevent abuse — safeguards that do not exist in jurisdictions without such laws.


The NT law allowed medically assisted suicide only in strictly defined circumstances.


A person seeking assistance to die had to be an adult, and suffering from a terminal illness causing severe pain for which there was no treatment acceptable to the patient.


They had to have proper medical advice about the likely course of their illness, and about other options such as palliative care.


The doctor had to be satisfied that the patient was of sound mind and acting voluntarily, after due consideration and without restraint.


A second doctor with specialist qualifications in treating the patient's ailment had to confirm the first diagnosis.


A psychiatrist had to confirm that the patient was not suffering from treatable depression.


There had to be two cooling-off periods.


Seven days between the patient requesting medical assistance to die and the issuing of a certificate authorising that assistance.


And another 48 hours between the certificate being issued and being acted upon.


A request for assistance to end life could be rescinded by the patient at any time and in any form.


And, the law provided penalties for any person who attempted to influence a doctor to end the life of another person.


And for anyone who improperly induced another to sign or witness a form requesting medically assisted suicide.


Under the NT Rights of the Terminally Ill Act, no doctor or other health-care professional could be obliged to assist someone to die.


There was no attempt to force people to act against their moral beliefs.


A law with those stringent safeguards is not a law that de-values human life.


It is a law that respects the choices people make.


I support the principle that the will of the Senate should not be distorted.


If a senator is not able to attend because of ill-health, it is appropriate that pairing arrangements are made.


In this case, arrangements are made informally and not through the parties.


This is a conscience-vote bill.


Accordingly I have agreed to pair with Senator Sinodinos.


However, for the reasons I have set out I hope that this bill will be passed.


The Northern Territory and the ACT assemblies should be able to resolve this matter democratically, just as the parliaments of the states are able to do.


That is the question posed to us by this bill, and our answer should be yes.

"PRESIDENT, The",,2018-08-15,"



The PRESIDENT
 (18:46):  I'm taking this relatively rare opportunity to participate in debate as President. This is an issue that most people have a well-developed opinion of, based on deeply-held personal, philosophical and even political values, and experiences of loved ones and friends, as well as professional experiences and insights. Both sides of this debate are, I believe, motivated by the highest aspirations to care for our fellow citizens. Defending human dignity comes in various forms and there is nothing more difficult than caring for those most vulnerable in their last days, weeks or months.


Both perspectives on this issue are entirely respectable. I don't believe any should condemn another for holding the opposite view to that which they hold in this debate. But, in outlining my position and why I'll be opposing this legislation, I would like to explain the perspective I bring and the reasons I hold that view, both in principle, regarding the issue of euthanasia, and the administrative matter—the authority of this parliament in relation to the territory legislatures.


First, the matter of euthanasia. I am a liberal first and foremost. I start from the principle of limiting the actions of the state or the collective will of people limiting the autonomy of their fellow citizens. But I'm not a libertarian. A liberal believes in the existence of the state and that there are limits on the autonomy of individuals. The debate over where to draw this line is the defining one in a liberal democracy. Every instinctive liberal, at some point, comes across the writings of JS Mill, with his famous harm principle that, in short, provides the framework to assess whether a restriction on the choices an individual can make is legitimate and asks: does it bring harm to others?


On another matter, if Mill was correct—and I think he was—that there is a legitimate limit that someone cannot voluntarily submit themselves to slavery, then I think euthanasia needs to be considered differently to other matters of choice, because, when it comes to matters of ending life, there is a different element because of the finality of the consequences of any choice or incident.


I fear euthanasia not because I distrust individuals but because I distrust the state and the scope of it that now exists with the public health system we are all part of through a very strong and effective national insurance system and the public provision of health services. I fear it not because engaged citizens, like many of us in this chamber, are able to navigate the health and aged-care systems; I fear it because of the risks to the most vulnerable, who do not have the capacity for choice many of us have. I simply do not believe the checks and balances can guarantee that no innocent person will have their most important right, that of life, taken from them through the lack of care or even the feeling of being a burden upon those close to them or their fellow citizens. I also fear the inevitable expansion of this to those not equipped to make such a choice, let alone the pressure they may feel in the most difficult of circumstances. I happen to oppose capital punishment in all its forms, no matter the justification claimed, because I do not believe the state has a right to take a life and because I believe the risks of error are too grave to contemplate, and that thinking drives me in this particular instance as well. 


Second, I'd like to turn to the issue of territory rights. Territories and states don't have rights; people do. The territories have a different status in our constitutional arrangements than do the states. The people of the territories are in a different situation than are the people of the states. Therefore, we have a different set of responsibilities here than we do with respect to the states. I note that this parliament has previously legislated to prevent the states and territories from enacting capital punishment. While I agree that such a regime has no place in Australia, I find it difficult to accept as persuasive arguments about territory rights and disregard the fact that it's actually about the issue in question—in this case, euthanasia. I don't raise this to draw into question the motives of anyone, only to explain my own position.


We do have a different role with respect to the citizens of our territories than we do with respect to the citizens of our states. It is not about this parliament forcing its view on the territories; it is about my responsibility that I feel to the citizens of the territories. As someone who does not believe that euthanasia can be made safe, that there are risks of it causing the most grievous harm to the innocent, I have a responsibility to protect the citizens of the territories for whom this parliament is ultimately responsible. Accordingly, I will be voting against this bill.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2018-08-15,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (18:51):  In wrapping up the second reading debate on my Restoring Territory Rights (Assisted Suicide Legislation) Bill 2015, I wish to thank each senator for their contribution. We haven't had such a demonstration of individual honesty since the debate on same-sex marriage. In fact, I think this exceeds that debate. On the crossbench, we each form our own view about bills every day. But I understand this is a fairly novel experience for many in the major parties. I would particularly like to thank Labor and my crossbench colleagues for helping me bring this bill on for debate after it became clear that the Prime Minister was reluctant to stick to his deal with me. I have listened to as many of the speeches as possible, mostly while in my office, and I have been very impressed by the honesty and sincerity of my colleagues, if not necessarily all of their arguments. I know that the debate has been influential, with some senators changing how they were leaning in response to the contributions of other senators. That's good.


Now that I have the floor, I hope the debate continues to be influential, because I'd like to dispel some myths and misrepresentations that have been repeated during the debate. We've heard that we don't need assisted suicide legislation as long as we improve palliative care resources. In fact, palliative care is not an alternative to assisted suicide. You can have both. Indeed, in my opinion, you should have both. But what we haven't heard is how the best palliative care is ineffective for one in 20 patients with a terminal illness. Those Australians die a slow death in agony, and we are unable to help them.


We've heard how a nine-year-old girl was killed in Belgium, under the laws there. I'm personally not in favour of extending assisted suicide to children. But no mention was made when that subject was raised of the laborious processes taken to confirm consent. No mention was made of the untreatable brain tumour that, according to unanimous medical opinion, was to cause death in the near term, and no mention was made of the excruciating, untreatable pain.


We've heard a lot about slippery slopes but no mention of how the loose European laws have always been loose and how the tight law in Oregon has hardly changed over two decades—so, no slippery slope. We've heard how doctors can't be trusted but there has been no mention of how doctors deal, right now, with dying patients in an unregulated environment. Assisted suicide laws that require crystal clear consent can actually save lives from doctors who think they know best. There are many overdoses of morphine given with absolutely no consent. We've even heard claims that assisted suicide laws would reduce the willingness of Indigenous Australians to attend hospital, for fear of being killed against their wishes. This is insane. The only thing that could make any Australians fearful of being killed against their wishes is irresponsible and baseless fearmongering, unrelated to any law that could be legislated in Australia.


We will have an opportunity to further explore these issues in the committee stage, provided we pass this bill at the second reading. So I implore all senators: please question the fearmongering you have heard. Please ask yourself whether this fearmongering is coming from a source that knows what they are talking about, and please ask yourself what the basis of the fearmongering is, when this bill does not legislate for assisted suicide and the only legislation in Australia that does is the very tight legislation of the state of Victoria. But, contrary to what many have said, this bill is not about assisted suicide. It is about the freedom of the elected parliaments of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory to legislate on assisted suicide.


In 1995 the Northern Territory parliament adopted the world's first assisted suicide legislation. Four people took advantage of it to end their lives. However, in late 1996, with the debate extending into 1997, Mr Kevin Andrews introduced a bill into the Commonwealth parliament to overturn that legislation and to prevent the territories from legislating on assisted suicide. Twenty-one years later, that bill remains on the books, and yet, during that time, 14 jurisdictions have legalised assisted suicide in one form or another. Victoria is one of them. Other states, including WA, South Australia and New South Wales, have debated bills to legalise it and voted against it. However, the elected parliaments of the ACT and the Northern Territory can't do that. Big Brother, otherwise known as the Commonwealth government, doesn't allow it.


Surveys repeatedly show that between 75 per cent and 85 per cent of the public supports assisted suicide, including in the territories. It's the social issue with the most clear-cut public support. It's been that way for decades too, as this week's Australian newspaper confirmed. If this parliament were genuinely representative of the people, this bill wouldn't be necessary. The fact that we don't have assisted suicide in this country exposes a serious flaw in our democracy. It reminds me of the old joke about when the parliament and the people disagree with each other: some people believe we should change the people because the government can't be wrong.


I'm confident that there is majority support in this chamber for this modest bill and even greater support for the bill to at least reach the committee stage following the second reading. But I would like the support to be as strong as possible to reflect how this truly is a modest and reasonable bill. The time has come for this parliament to respect voters in the Northern Territory and the ACT. We in this parliament were all elected, but so were the members of the parliaments of the ACT and the Northern Territory. We are no smarter or more insightful than they are. We should not be denying them the ability to make decisions about a matter that their equivalents in Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, Tasmania, New South Wales and Western Australia can make. Whether we like the decisions those elected politicians make is not our concern. We can't decide whether assisted suicide should be permitted in the states, so what gives us the right to decide for those who are not in one of the states? I say we shouldn't make that decision. We should leave it to the people who were elected to represent them. I commend the bill to the chamber.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that the bill be read a second time.

The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Yes, a very strong one!




Senator McCARTHY:
  People of the Northern Territory, we're still here. We will not give up. I would like to speak about an important theme in July, in NAIDOC Week: Because of her, we can! NAIDOC across Australia was especially significant because of the celebration of the achievements of First Nations women. I had the honour of being present in NAIDOC in Sydney.


Firstly, I want to take the Senate to the Northern Territory and commend the many events that took place in Alice Springs, Tennant Creek, Katherine, Darwin and the many communities across the Northern Territory. I was there for the celebration and the opening and official launch in Borroloola, with the Yanyuwa, Garrwa, Mara and Gundanji peoples, where we celebrated the work and the wonders of our women. There are people like Dinah Norman Marmgawi, our senior elder of the Yanyuwa, who reminds the women of the gulf region and the Northern Territory of the importance of relationships with country, culture and kin. In Western ways, Dina is like our great-great-grandmother, and that is the relationship and kinship term in which I refer to her and her knowledge of the gudjiga and the songs, especially of the mermaid country. 'Mermaid' is 'ngardiji' in our language. We celebrated the importance of the women and the women dreaming, songs and stories. The young girls who danced with us at the beginning of NAIDOC Week danced as li-antha wirriyarra, which means 'our spiritual origin comes from the sea country'. There was a special significance in the theme, 'Because of her, we can'. These young girls, children, young women, older women, aunties and grandmothers felt a real sense of solidarity and pride with each other, and that was carried through the events of the week.


Then in Darwin, when I was on Larrakia country, we were able to again celebrate the importance of women—'Because of her, we can'. The celebration there took place on various areas across the Darwin and Palmerston community, culminating in a ball on the Saturday night. I want to commend the national NAIDOC committee, and I know that it is a farewell as well, for Anne Martin in particular, who has spearheaded the national NAIDOC committee for the last 10 years. I know that the theme 'Because of her, we can' holds special significance for Anne in terms of her own children and grandchildren. I want to take this opportunity to thank Anne and the NAIDOC committee for the work that they did.


It was beautiful to see the final culmination of national NAIDOC celebrations on Gadigal country and I pay my respects in particular, to the Gadigal clan of the Eora nation, but also to the Metropolitan Local Aboriginal Land Council, who hosted all participants of the gathering at the ball; thousands of people turned up that evening. The Chairperson of the Metropolitan Local Aboriginal Land Council is Yvonne Weldon. She is a Wiradjuri woman and she welcomed, on behalf of the Eora nation, all people who attended. 


It was an opportunity to see so many award winners, and I have a tremendous list of those award winners. I want to congratulate each and every person who was recognised by their peers across the country. I also want to say to all Australians that NAIDOC week is an opportunity in our country to respect the diversity of First Nations people. There are so many languages, so many different groups across this beautiful country we all call home, and it is an opportunity to get to know the people in your area. I certainly hope that senators had the opportunity to get to know the women, in particular, in their respective states, on this beautiful theme of 'Because of her, we can'.
