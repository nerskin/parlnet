Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (10:01):  Labor will be supporting this bill, the Social Services Legislation Amendment (No Jab, No Pay) Bill 2015. I reviewed the comments I made when we were talking in the last process and I saw that, at that stage in the debate, I pointed out a number of the concerns that I have with the legislation. I continue to have the concerns that I raised—about the need for education, the need for certainty, and the need to ensure that people and their views are respected effectively in our community—but it is very clear that Labor supports the legislation. We believe that there is a need to have strong immunisation policies in Australia. The evidence that we as a committee have received indicated that that was important and that it was real.


However, I also want to talk about some of the things that we need to get right in introducing this legislation because, as I said in the previous contribution, there will be a group of people in our community who reject immunisation, who do not believe in its effectiveness, and who are actually quite fearful about the processes. Those people will not change their views. Many people have spoken to parliamentarians about their concerns. The people who genuinely reject vaccination have strong views and will not change these. But we need to listen to the questions that are being asked, to respond effectively, and to ensure that the information process is accurate. I have spoken about my concern that I do not believe that the department was able to convince us effectively during the committee process that the education campaign which must go with this legislation is fully developed and effectively funded. In fact, to this day we still have not got the full budget to discuss in this place.


I know that there have been effective processes in Australia looking at the need for immunisation, and we pointed in the discussion to what had happened with some of the then Medicare Locals, where there was intensive effort put into particular regions to make sure that people knew about the value of immunisation, to talk about the safety issues, and to acknowledge that there was a need for people to make decisions and also to find out about the processes. That worked, Mr Deputy President—for the Medicare Locals which had this as a priority, we know that there were changes in the vaccination rates in those regions. Where this was not a priority, there continued to be a lack of effective information, and also fear—people were not certain about how the process worked, and about how it should work.


So, when you are introducing legislation as decisive as what is before the chamber today, what must go with that is the education and engagement program—well funded, well targeted and also done with respect so that people who have differing views are not excluded, demonised or ridiculed but have their views acknowledged with acceptance that there will not be agreement. That is important in ensuring that any program of change is effectively brought forward.


Another element is the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register. One of the parts of this legislation which has not been discussed as fully as others is the fact that now the registry vaccination program is there not just for early childhood but through until the late teens. We need to have an effective registration process for the whole of our lifetime of vaccinations. That has not been in place in the past. In fact there was considerable discussion around the way the current Australian Child Immunisation Register operates and there was a recent ANAO report which looked at the operations of that register and made suggestions for how the process could be improved.


Evidence that we received at our inquiry talked about some real concerns that the data was not always accurate, that there could have been multiple registrations made to this register and that by the evidence we received it was felt that perhaps it was not seen as a priority by the people who were putting this data into the system. We know this is an issue across the board in our systems with data collection and maintenance. If we are going to be sure that there is going to be real knowledge of what is happening with vaccinations across our nation, we have to have confidence that the data is accurate and that we will be able to use the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register effectively and with confidence.


That was part of the discussion we had during the committee process. We needed to ensure that the work which was done by the ANAO, which was looking at how the register was working now and also at the operations of the register into the future, would be accepted by the departments and by government and that there would be confidence that the register would be accurate. We did not at the inquiry because, naturally, the department that was in charge of the register was not there to provide evidence to our committee, but subsequent to the inquiry we did get evidence back from the Department of Human Services that said that they were meeting the time line of change, that they were confident that they had the resources and the skills to ensure that the register would be accurate and that we would be able to know that this register, which is kind of the infrastructure of vaccination, would be accurate. People would be able to have confidence that their details were accurate and that, when we have a system which is actually saying that you are not going to be able to receive payment unless you are up to date with your vaccinations, there is knowledge about what the vaccinations are, what is needed and what is required. The register would be able to confirm that you have received that process.


We accept the evidence provided by the department that they are aware of the needs, that they are working to cleanse the data and that they are ensuring that the site will be functional and secure by September 2017. There does seem to be a reasonable expectation that, if we bring the changes in on 1 January, it will take time to make sure that the system catches up and the register will be accurate.


In terms of ensuring that we actually know where there is genuine conscientious objection to using vaccines, the new system needs to have some consideration. This is something we discussed and put back to the department. We need to know where there is conscientious objection to vaccination so that we know where there are areas that may well have a lower vaccination protection rate. The department took that on board, and at this stage that is part of ongoing discussion to ensure that we do not lose contact, that we do not lose information about where there are and are not effective vaccination rates in the nation.


We know that this debate will continue. As I have said, there are people in our community who will not accept vaccination, and that is their right. Nothing in this legislation actually says that not taking up vaccination is illegal. What it does is change the family payment regime and the childcare benefit regime around having vaccination up to date. This is actually an extension of existing legislation, and we know that there have already been processes where we link access to family payments with vaccination, so this is not new, but it is wider and takes up more people. We need to ensure that we are working with the community to explain the reasons and to point out to them what the background to this process is and how it is going to operate.


During the committee process, the Labor Party recommended—and the committee took up this recommendation—that there would be reviews of how this legislation is operating after a year and after five years, with very intensive scrutiny of how this legislation operates—making sure the register process and the public campaigns of education and awareness are in place—and also of the impact of these changes on the childcare area, as I said. We do not think this is something that should just wait for the standard review process that is natural in departmental processes. I would be very interested to hear from the minister about whether there has been any agreement to the recommendations that the committee made about this concept of having a very intensive review, almost from the start, of how the legislation is impacting, who is affected and whether we get changes to ensure that the vaccination rates increase. It would be useless to introduce such a significant piece of legislation and not know how it is going and how it is working from the very start.


So I would be interested if in the minister's concluding comments and in committee, if it should go to committee, we can get some clear indication that the department will be taking up a very intensive review process which is linked to the necessary engagement with the community, with people who do not agree with vaccinations and, most importantly, with the almost seven per cent of people and families in our community who are non-vaccinators, who have not registered as conscientious objectors but have not vaccinated their children. That is the group that I believe will be most benefited by this change, but it will not happen if we do not work with them, if we do not have the engagement campaigns and public awareness campaigns targeted clearly, and if we do not get effective information out of the department about where the people are.


I think I have shown my frustration on a number of occasions during my contribution about the lack of information that we were able to extract from the various departments who have a role to play in this process. We need to have the data. We need to know where vaccinations are occurring and where they are not. Only then, when we find out where people are choosing not to vaccinate and why and we work in a targeted way with that group, will we be able to reach the kinds of results that this legislation is designed to do.

"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2015-11-23,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (10:13):  I rise today to speak to the Social Services Legislation Amendment (No Jab, No Pay) Bill 2015. The Australian Greens are very strong supporters of vaccination as an evidence-based approach to preventing disease, but we have some concerns about this specific legislation.


Immunisation is one of the great success stories of modern medicine and public health. Vaccinating against illness and disease is the easiest way a GP can protect people of all ages from vaccine-preventable disease. It is a proven method of reducing the incidence of deaths from causes such as measles, tetanus, diphtheria and Haemophilus influenzae type B. Measles, we know, can be fatal in young children. Tetanus is something that is almost nonexistent now, but people died from tetanus regularly. Diphtheria is another disease that led to the deaths of people, and Haemophilus influenzae is a cause of meningitis and pneumonia, a very serious cause of morbidity. We know that, since the introduction only recently of the vaccine against Haemophilus influenzae, we are seeing a reduction in the incidence of meningitis and pneumonia from that specific condition. And let's not forget, of course, polio. It was not that long ago that polio caused death and serious disease—a disease that resulted in muscle paralysis and ongoing problems with mobility and so on.


So we know that vaccines work and that they are effective, but of course they are only effective if we are able to immunise large numbers of the population, and vaccination rates over the last 20 years demonstrate that Australia has done a pretty good job of it. We have an excellent record of achievement in the prevention of vaccine-preventable diseases. It is a critical message for the community, though, where there is patchy immunisation coverage in places like the Northern Rivers in New South Wales and the Sunshine Coast in Queensland. It is very critical that this message be able to penetrate those communities, because we know that when immunisation rates fall below a particular level, in the 90 to 95 per cent range for a number of conditions, we lose that critical principle of what is called herd immunity.


Herd immunity is absolutely critical. What it means is that, when immunisation rates are low, illnesses like measles and whooping cough or pertussis can be much more easily spread. So, if we have a population where a large number of people are immune as a result of vaccine, the chain of infection can be disrupted or effectively stopped. The greater the number of people who are immune, the smaller the probability that those who are not immune will come into contact with the infection. So, once you reach that critical threshold and achieve herd immunity, you see the gradual elimination of a disease from a population, so you can actually eradicate the existence of that disease altogether.


What we saw with, for example, the eradication of smallpox in 1977 was exactly that. We were able to reach herd immunity and get a critical level of immunity across the population, and people now no longer die from smallpox, a hugely successful public health intervention. We are on the verge of eliminating polio altogether from the planet. What a wonderful thing that would be, and that is because of the huge investment that we are making across polio eradication in some of those very hard-to-reach populations. Of course, the final yards are the most difficult. The law of diminishing returns means you have to throw a lot at it to eliminate those final cases, but once we do that—and I am confident that we will—polio, much like smallpox, will be a thing of the past.


It is partly because of the success of immunisation that we are having the problems that we have with some communities deciding no longer to vaccinate children. Vaccination has been a victim of its own success in many ways. Because people are not exposed to these life-threatening illnesses, we do not have the level of knowledge and understanding that exists with exposure to diseases like polio and, of course, measles, diphtheria and so on. What that means is that people make the decision not to vaccinate their children because they are not aware of the consequences of those illnesses. Of course, it is a rational decision in some ways, because there is a very small risk associated with having a vaccine and, if we are talking about a population where herd immunity exists, you do not expose your child to the incredibly small risk of the vaccine and you get the benefit of herd immunity within that population. Those people are so-called free riders, and they benefit from the decision that other people make.


Now let us look specifically at the bill, which requires that families be up to date with the National Immunisation Program. They need to be up to date in order for either parents or guardians to be eligible for the family tax benefit part A, for the supplement and for childcare benefit and the childcare rebate. The rules that this bill—basically, the No Jab, No Pay bill—seeks to implement would remove the immunisation exemption categories for access to childcare benefit, childcare rebate and the family tax benefit part A supplement.


One of the positive things the government did as part of this initiative was provide a $26 million funding boost to the Immunise Australia Program to ensure that we saw doctors and immunisation providers identify and vaccinate kids in their practices who were overdue for their vaccinations. That is really important. It is a positive initiative and, if we can do more in boosting those programs that encourage doctors and other immunisation providers to identify kids who are not currently vaccinated, that is a positive thing.


The bill, as Senator Moore just said, does not remove the right to make a conscientious decision not to immunise. People will continue to have that choice. What it does is put a financial cost to that decision. The government's proposition is this: the disincentive of no longer being eligible for Centrelink payments may result in parents reassessing their conscientious objection or antivaccination stance. It is important to understand why people do not vaccinate. It is worth exploring that, because it really goes to the substance of whether this policy proposal is the right one. We know that there are people who do not vaccinate for all sorts of reasons. Interestingly, the majority of these families are not conscientious objectors. In fact, Professor Julie Leask told the inquiry into this legislation that the majority of families who do not vaccinate are not conscientious objectors. Of the eight per cent of people who are not vaccinating, only 1.5 per cent register as conscientious objectors. In her opinion, the remaining 6.5 per cent could benefit from other measures, and the best way to tackle those people is through supporting health professionals and, of course, ongoing education. That is one of the concerns we have with the bill: it does not focus enough on that large group of people who are not conscientious objectors but are not vaccinating their children for other reasons.


Professor Leask also told the inquiry that there need to be strategies to tackle those people who at present do not have fully vaccinated kids. She said that, when it comes to the issue of conscientious objectors, there are a number of what she called hesitant parents—people who are fence sitters and who are on the margins of vaccine acceptance. What we need to do with that group is ensure that there are community-based interventions and that there are provider-based interventions—things that we are working on the moment—and that we actually incentivise the interactions between those parents and the healthcare system. Under the current model, for someone to register as a conscientious objector they actually need to interact with the health system and get their forms signed by a health provider. That is the area in which we should be working. The real concern we have is that this is a very blunt measure. It limits the opportunities for engagement with people who might be at the margins of vaccine acceptance and their interaction with the healthcare provider.


I think it is important to note that the government's provision of $26 million in funding for Immunise Australia does include incentive payments to GPs who identify undervaccinated kids and initiate catch-up schedules. That is a good thing. Also, it improves public vaccination records, reminder systems and communication strategies to promote the benefit of vaccines. We welcome this recognition of the importance of reminder and recall strategies, and we look forward to seeing evidence of how these measures have led to an increase in the numbers of children who are vaccinated. That evaluation process is important. We also look forward to looking at how the reliability of the immunisation register, and their capacity to target Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island communities, has improved.


The bill provides that a child meets the immunisation requirements if a GP has certified, in writing, that the immunisation of the child would be medically contraindicated under the specifications set out in The Australian Immunisation Handbook. That is good; we think that is important. But we also think it is important also to recognise that the legislation says that if in the opinion of a GP a person has contracted a disease or diseases and that as a result has developed natural immunity, that that also is a factor. Importantly, GPs need to be able to use their clinical judgement in assessing children who are eligible for a medical exemption. As Dr Kidd testified to the inquiry, medical exemptions are rare, but with the guidance provided by the handbook and by using their own clinical judgement, GPs are the people who are best equipped to identify the small number of children who should not receive a vaccination.


Again, let me stress that point: that a GP can use their clinical judgement to determine whether somebody should receive a vaccination. But simply going to a GP and saying that you believe a vaccine is dangerous—that a vaccine will cause conditions such as autism—is not good enough. That will no longer qualify.


We do agree with the AMA's view:


All children have the right to be protected from vaccine preventable diseases. This includes infants who are too young to be immunised as well as those infants and children who are medically unable to receive immunisations. Immunising as many infants and children as possible affords these vulnerable infants and children the protection they deserve.


We do, however, as I said, have a concern that in order to register as a vaccine refuser under the current system you need to discuss that decision with a health professional. Often what we hear from health professionals is that sometimes it is a discussion that ends with the person changing their mind. It might not be about all vaccines, it might only be about some of them—but that interaction does create possibilities to influence somebody who is at the margins. We have concerns that removing that incentive for that encounter does deprive health professionals of the opportunity to encourage parents to reconsider that decision.


We also heard evidence from Dr Richard Kidd of the AMA, who said that there are occasionally severe reactions to vaccines. Depending on the degree of severity—we are talking about the extreme end—we are talking about cases that are close to one in a million. So, yes, there are minor reactions—I think that most parents will have had the experience of taking their child along to an immunisation provider and the child having a red, sore arm from the vaccine or, indeed, a little bit of a temperature overnight, but they recover reasonably quickly. But when we talk about serious vaccine injuries, we talk about in the order of one in a million or so. So we can expect a handful of serious vaccine complications to occur each year.


It is the Greens' view that it is a serious problem, and that in order to encourage greater acceptance of vaccines there should be a vaccine injury compensation scheme. We think that is really important. We heard evidence through the inquiry that the United States requires a compulsory levy on the manufacturers of vaccines that goes towards such a vaccine injury compensation scheme for those vanishingly small but very real and severe impacts associated with vaccines. We think that would lead to greater acceptance. Of course, that is at the opposite end of what some of the people who do not support vaccination claim is the consequence of vaccines. They cite links to autism, other mental health conditions and a range of conditions where there is absolutely no evidence of a connection between vaccines and those conditions.


We know that the AMA provided more detail about the Australian Immunisation Handbook and how that provides guidance about exemptions to immunisation. It also provides information on a range of contraindications and precautions for specific groups—those people who are at risk of anaphylaxis, those who are immunocompromised, those who are receiving particular blood products and so on.


One of the other things that we are concerned about is the accuracy and the quality of the data upon which the requirements for immunisation are enforced and, of course, the association with the removal of those particular benefits. The policy uses the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register as the primary data source. It is true that the ANAO did a performance audit of the register, and it reported that overall the administration of the register has been effective and that it has met or exceeded performance targets. That is a good thing. But we also acknowledge that there were concerns expressed through the hearing. Indeed, some were expressed by the Public Health Association of Australia, who documented some of the flaws in the register, which was developed in the 1990s. In evidence submitted on notice, the Department of Human Services wrote that:


In accordance with the phased expansion of the ACIR into a Whole of Life Australian Immunisation Register (AIR)—


and that is a good thing; to have a register that covers people right through their life—


a range of improvements will be implemented to the Register's functions and operations. This includes new functionality to enable providers to correct errors online through the AIR secure site, such as correction of an incorrect dose number or incorrect vaccine recorded. This will begin to be implemented in September 2017.


That is especially concerning. It is concerning because we have a scheme that is relying on data to remove payments from people, but we know that the system they are relying on will not be fully operational and accurate—in the way that we want to see it—until September 2017. That is why we think that if you are going to introduce this sort of legislation, you should at least do it once your data system is up to date. And that is why we are moving an amendment to delay the start date of this legislation until 1 January 2018, along with other specific amendments.


The Public Health Association of Australia told the committee that the government should seek to address the structural and practical barriers that exist, including socioeconomic reasons, and that explain why some children are not fully vaccinated. We absolutely agree with that, and we think that vaccination will be enhanced by supportive systems—reducing barriers to access, improving the reliability of the register, and further strategies that are specific to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. We absolutely look forward to seeing the impact of reminder and recall strategies, through a thorough evaluation. These strategies should include a national immunisation reminder system, catch-up campaigns, and local initiatives to improve coverage, as well as home-visiting programs and other actions to address some of the barriers to health care.


Finally, there is some confusion in the information that has been provided on the departmental websites. The Department of Human Services and the Department of Health websites actually differ in terms of information about which vaccinations that are required for people to be able to access family assistance payments. That needs to be clarified as a matter of urgency. We need to know absolutely clearly what is and what is not mandatory for eligibility for family assistance payments.


In conclusion, I move the Australian Greens second reading amendment on sheet 7798:


At the end of the motion, add:


""but the Senate:


(a) recognises that it is of critical importance that GPs remain able to use their clinical judgement in assessing children who are eligible for medical exemption; and 


(b) calls on the Government to clarify which vaccinations are mandatory to meet the immunisation requirements and make this clear on all their relevant websites and publicly available material"".

Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (10:33):  Since it is about time somebody did, I rise to ask: won't someone think of the childless? Politicians seem to be obsessed with families, so it may come as a surprise to many that most households in Australia are childless. A quarter of all households consist of an individual and more than a quarter of all households consist of an adult couple. There are also hundreds of thousands of households where unrelated adults live together. Childless households are also on the rise, in part because kids have grown up and moved out of their parents' homes, and because of the increasing propensity of couples to remain childless. To the childless people of Australia I want to say, on behalf of this parliament, 'Thank you for being childless.'


You work for more years and become more productive than the rest of Australia. You pay thousands and thousands of dollars more tax than other Australians. You get next to no welfare, and your use of public health services is minimal. But you pay when other people get pregnant; you pay when they give birth; you pay when they stay at home to look after their offspring; you pay for the child's food, clothing and shelter; you pay when the child goes to child care; you pay when the child goes to primary and secondary school; and then you pay when it goes to university.


Thank you, for all you do for others. I am sorry that rather than receiving thanks, you are often ignored, pitied, considered strange or even thought of as irresponsible. For your sake, I hope the children you are forced to support do not end up as juvenile delinquents and I hope that they get immunised so that you do not end up getting sick, because you will pay then too.


For this reason, amongst others, I support the Social Services Legislation Amendment (No Jab, No Pay) Bill 2015. This bill concerns parents who, on religious or conscientious grounds, refuse to immunise their children. The bill makes such parents ineligible for childcare subsidies and family assistance end-of-year supplements. This is as it should be. It is bad enough that people continue to bring wave upon wave of these little blighters into the world. The least they can do is immunise their bundles of dribble and sputum so they do not make the rest of us sick.


Withholding welfare payments from parents who fail to immunise their kids is entirely legitimate, including from a libertarian perspective. Immunisation generates a significant social benefit, and parents do not have a right to welfare payments. Such payments are, fundamentally, a gift from their fellow Australians. No work is done for the money, so there is nothing wrong with placing conditions on it. The fact is that most welfare payments to parents should be abolished, because people without children should not be forced to subsidise people with children.


Children generate great joy, warmth and meaning for their parents. They are a precious gift. What more do you want? It is unfair that people without children are forced to pay money to those people who have received the gift a child. Some people are childless by choice and are happy with that choice. There is no moral case to make them subsidise other people's choices. For some people, childlessness is not a choice; it is a great sadness. Forcing them to hand over money to more fortunate people is like charity in reverse. It is like making people in wheelchairs pay for other people's running shoes.


People without children are not freeloaders; they can look after themselves throughout their life through working, saving, and engaging in voluntary, mutually-beneficial exchanges. It would be weird to suggest that you need to pay for the upbringing and training of a baker just because one day you will want to buy bread. It is equally as weird to suggest that a childless person needs to pay for the upbringing and training of children just because they might want to buy services from those children in the future.


Some argue when taxpayers fund subsidies for today's children that this is a proxy for paying back the subsidies the taxpayers received when they were children. But this ignores the fact that some taxpayers received little or no subsidies when they were children. They have nothing to pay back. And forcing money on today's children, whether they need it or not, does not create any special obligations on them in the future either. And there are plenty of adults right now who pay little or no tax, so if they received subsidies when they were children they are not paying them back now. Overall, intergenerational wealth transfers are best achieved within families.


The Liberal Democrats support the abolition of childcare subsidies, coupled with deregulation of the childcare sector—including its excessive credentialism—to cut the costs of childcare. The Liberal Democrats support the abolition of taxpayer-funded paid parental leave, which is an arbitrary payment provided only to those new parents who were in employment in 10 of the prior 13 months. The Liberal Democrats believe that family tax benefit part A should be limited to low-income families, and that family tax benefits should end their march through the alphabet right there. Family tax benefit part B should be abolished, and, instead, we should have a flat income tax rate to ensure that families are not penalised if one member of a couple makes more money than the other. Parenting payment would remain only for low-income families with children who are not yet in school.


Some people may say that if this policy platform came to pass they would not be able to afford to have children. In response, let me make this very clear: people do not have a right to expect or force others to pay them to have children. The government is not your parent or your spouse. Get over it. In fact, do not just get over it; be thankful for it. The government does not make a good parent—just ask any ward of the state. What is more, when you allow the government to become a de facto parent it encourages the breakdown of traditional family units—something many politicians claim to support. Mark my words: when you treat the government like a parent, it will soon enough treat you like a child. The passage of the Social Services Legislation Amendment (No Jab, No Pay) Bill 2015 should help. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2015-11-23,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (10:41):  The issue of immunisation of children is highly emotive because it relates to our most treasured loved ones—our children. It is true that Australia is seeing a drop—many consider it a worrying drop—in immunisation rates and the herd immunity that comes with them. Australia has a vaccination rate across the nation of a little over 90 per cent, but in some parts of the community it has dropped well below that.


From 1 January 2016—just five weeks away now—this bill will introduce a requirement that children have up-to-date immunisation shots in order for the family to receive childcare benefits, childcare rebate or the family tax benefit part A supplement. The vast majority of families that would be affected by this bill already meet the immunisation requirements for their children at the appropriate age points—it is about 97 per cent. Figures provided by the Department of Social Services show that this 3 per cent of families represents an additional 18,000 children who would be required to undergo immunisation shots from 1 January 2016. But, crucially, this bill would also apply to children of all ages who do not have up-to-date immunisation shots. The parents of these children would need to have them undergo catch-up shots to the appropriate level for their age in order to continue receiving the childcare and FTB-A payments.


The bill also scraps the conscientious objection exemption to children's vaccinations. Exemptions will only be granted for valid medical reasons, such as when a GP certifies that the child already possesses a natural immunity from, say, previously contracting the disease in question. At this point it is worth mentioning that the Australian Greens second reading amendment seems, on balance, a sensible way to go forward—to allow GPs to make a judgement in these cases. It is a second reading amendment and it is not binding on the parliament, but, from a policy framework perspective, I think it is important that we do not ignore or shut out GPs who are on the ground, know the families and children and can make a reasoned judgement based on the medical evidence as to what is the best and most appropriate course of action to take.


Although we are talking about a small percentage of families, when added to those needing so-called catch-up shots and those families for which exemptions no longer apply, this bill will affect many thousands of Australian children and their parents. The DSS estimates that more than 200,000 children aged from one to 19—although if you are 19 you are not really a child, but I am relying on the DSS estimates—would need to be immunised to some level in the current financial year. That is 3.4 per cent of the total population of 5.9 million Australians in that age bracket of between one and 19. This is a large number of children, the future health of whom should be a priority for all of us. The arguments that weigh both sides of this debate cannot be discounted. I think we need to respectfully consider both sides of the debate. On one side of the equation there are parents who believe that their children will be at risk of contracting diseases because another child in the classroom has not been immunised. They say that that is unfair, despite any conscientious objection. These could be classmates at school or playmates in child care, or just kids that kick around together in the neighbourhood. On the other side of the equation, we should not discount the concerns of parents who do not want to see what they regard as pharmaceuticals injected into their children, even for the best intents and purposes, because there has been a concern that occasionally—rarely—there are adverse health impacts. There is a school of thought that has linked immunisation to autism. However, as reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association, this year there was a massive study of 95,000 children which found that the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine did not affect autism rates in a known risk group—those with autistic siblings. But I do understand that there are also contrary views in respect of that. It is not for me or for the Senate to repudiate what parents have observed in their children stemming from immunisation; I think that parents know their children best. There have been instances and evidence suggesting that vaccines are not risk-free. That is something that even the most ardent proponents of vaccination acknowledge—that there are, occasionally and rarely, adverse outcomes.


This year, the journal Vaccine reported that mistakes made in making Fluvax in bioCSL's Melbourne laboratory had led to dangerous side effects in children. Fluvax remains banned for children aged five and younger. The risks of injury from immunisation are very small but very real. I think there is a place for a statutory compensation scheme to cover the very small number of families who face a tragic outcome. And I note that, going back a number of years now, there have been calls for a vaccination injury compensation scheme. These are from people who support vaccinations; these are from advocates of vaccination who acknowledge that, where there is an adverse outcome and where that adverse outcome is linked to the vaccination, there ought to be such a scheme. My understanding is that Canada has had such a scheme in place for a number of years. That is something that we need to look at. That would appear to be a best-practice model. I ask the minister—and I would be satisfied if this were taken on notice—whether the government has looked at the Canadian approach, where vaccination programs are very much in place and supported by the community and where, for those rare cases of adverse outcomes, there is a compensation scheme.


I note that, back in 2011, Associate Professor Heath Kelly of the Melbourne University School of Population Health told Fairfax Media:


… although it was rare for children to be seriously harmed by vaccines, it was unfair not to compensate the few affected when there were known risks.


He is an advocate for vaccination, and he also said:


There is no doubt that the benefits of immunisation far outweigh the risks. However, on the very rare occasions that there is a serious complication, despite proper manufacture and administration of a vaccine, it is only fair that the community should provide for the individual suffering ... as there is a community benefit from as many people as possible being vaccinated.


That seems to be a measured view, which I think we ought to consider. But we also ought not to dismiss those who are critical of vaccinations; their views should be heard, and not derided.


We also need to ensure that the risks posed by future vaccines are closely monitored. Earlier this year, researchers writing in the PLOS Biology journal outlined the risks that vaccines against some of humanity's deadliest diseases, including HIV, Ebola and bird flu, can be 'leaky' and can lead to so-called 'super-bugs'.


For all the claims and counterclaims around this debate, I understand that this piece of legislation is about the risk of contracting diseases that have previously been eradicated, or largely eradicated, in Australia. I understand the government's argument about herd immunity, and that is a concern. But I also think it is important that we acknowledge the concerns of those who have said, 'we are worried about adverse outcomes'. We need to make sure that vaccines are produced to the highest possible standard. What happened with the Fluvax vaccine—where children were injured as a result of that situation—indicated, I think, a failure in appropriate quality controls. I also think that it is not unreasonable that there be ongoing monitoring of adverse effects of vaccines. We also need to look at what Canada has done for a number of years now with their statutory compensation scheme. That way, the issue is less about emotion, in a sense, and more about dealing with the facts that we have before us, on a scientific basis, so that we can ensure that our children are as safe as they can be, and free not only of disease but also of any unnecessary adverse impacts.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2015-11-23,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (10:50):  I support this bill, the Social Services Legislation Amendment (No Jab, No Pay) Bill, and I will be voting for it. I have no particular expertise in this area, but I accept what appears to be the overwhelming support of professionals and learned people who make immunisation and the control of diseases are a full-time study.


I was approached by a group of very sincere Australians who had an objection to this bill. Whilst I indicated to them that I did not necessarily support their arguments, I was very keen to ensure that they had the opportunity of putting their case and their concerns to the parliament—and through the parliament, to the general public. I was also pleased to see that the minister and the government allowed a committee investigation—which I note, Mr Acting Deputy President, that you were chairman of; as usual, a very distinguished chair. I note the recommendations of the committee which, broadly speaking, I support. The principal recommendation is that the bill be passed. The report contains recommendations that, in broad, call upon the government to keep the matter under review, to embark on education and communication strategies, and to look more closely at the question of conscientious objection. I note the thoughtful comments of the previous speaker in that regard. I will not take the time of the Senate by repeating a lot of those issues; suffice it to say, I think that the people who have a serious objection to the proposal are genuine. They are serious in their concerns and I think, in a country like Australia, we have the democratic right to make these views known. I was pleased that this group of people had that opportunity. I note that there were over 2,000 submissions to your committee's inquiry, Mr Acting Deputy President. I suspect and I see that quite a number of them were what we in this business call 'campaign letters' but, notwithstanding that, there is clearly a group of people who have concern about the compulsory nature of this.


In general, I am reluctant to impose these sorts of things on fellow citizens, particularly where there are serious objections, if—as most would say—not valid objections. I am a little bit uncomfortable about that. But I go along with the majority view—and Senator Xenophon mentioned this as well—that it is not just about the children involved: if particular children do not have these immunisations, there is a belief that this could impact unhealthily on other children in their sphere of influence.


I congratulate the committee on its report, and on its work in hearing the evidence and presenting this report to parliament. I think on balance that it is a bill that should be supported. However, I like the committee's urging—and I am paraphrasing here—that this matter should be kept under review, and perhaps some of the international incidences and experiences which have been spoken about in this debate should be looked at. I will be supporting the bill.

"Fifield, Sen Mitch",LP,2015-11-23,"



Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Digital Government) (10:54):  I thank those who have contributed and the spirit in which they have engaged not only in the debate in this place but also in the Senate committee inquiry. I think we can all agree that one of the great strengths of this institution is its committees, when they are directed to good purposes.


This bill will ensure that children fully meet the immunisation requirements before their family can access a childcare benefit, a childcare rebate or the family tax benefit part A supplement. Immunisation is an important health measure for children and families as it is the safest and most effective way of providing protection against disease. What is proposed is that from 1 January next year the government will extend the current immunisation requirements to include children of all ages. At present, a child's immunisation status is only checked at the age of one, two and five for family tax benefit part A supplement and up to the age of seven for childcare payments.


There has been a high degree of public interest in this policy, with a large number of submissions being made to the inquiry. A range of views from organisations and individuals have been presented. The government recognises that communication to medical professionals and families is a critical part of this policy, and that is something the Senate inquiry touched on. Materials provided to families will make it clear which vaccinations are necessary to meet the requirements, and communications to general practitioners will clearly stipulate how the catch-up program will operate.


While concerns have been raised in regard to this legislation's approach its intentions remain the same, and that is to prevent Australian children from preventable diseases—in particular, those who are unable to be immunised because they are too young or for valid medical reasons. Parents do have the right to decide not to vaccinate their children. However, if they decide to object to vaccination, this decision can no longer be supported with government financial assistance. The choice made by some families not to vaccinate their children is not supported by public policy or medical research, and nor should such an action be supported by taxpayers in the form of family assistance and childcare payments.


Crucially, the government is ending vaccine objection exemptions through this bill. This means that families who object to vaccination will no longer be able to access these family assistance payments. Exceptions to the policy will apply for valid medical reasons such as when a GP certifies that a child has a medical contra-indication or vaccination is not required as the child has natural immunity to a particular disease. Families with children participating in an approved vaccination study will be taken to have met the immunisation requirements for the duration of the study, and similar rules will apply where a vaccine is temporarily unavailable. The requirements will also be met if a recognised immunisation provider certifies that a child has an equivalent level of immunisation through an overseas vaccination program.


Lastly, the secretary of the department will be able to determine that a child meets the immunisation requirements in very limited circumstances after considering decision-making principles set out in a legislative instrument to be made by the minister. Such decisions of the secretary will be made on a case-by-case basis to address unusual situations—for example, where a grandparent or non-parent carer does not have legal authority to vaccinate a child in their care—but it cannot be used to give effect to exemptions on the grounds of vaccine objection. This policy will tighten up the rules and reinforce the importance of vaccination in protecting public health, especially for children.


I should point out that the government supports the Australian Greens second reading amendment, which records the Senate's recognition of the importance of the role of GPs in assessing medical exemptions and the need to record publicly which vaccinations are mandatory to meet the immunisation requirements. I commend the bill to my colleagues.

"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2015-11-23,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (11:00):  I move the Greens' amendment circulated on sheet 7797:


(1) Clause 2, page 2 (table item 2), omit ""1 January 2016', substitute "" 1 January 2018"".


The genesis of this amendment is the information that was presented at the Senate inquiry, where the Department of Human Services wrote: 'In accordance with the phased expansion of the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register into a whole-of-life Australian Immunisation Register, a range of improvements will be implemented to the register's functions and operations. This includes new functionality to enable providers to correct errors online through the Australian immunisation register secure site, such as correction of an incorrect dose number or, indeed, an incorrect vaccine recorded.' This will begin to be implemented in September 2017.


That is of significant concern to us because the decision to withdraw someone's support, that is child care rebate, family tax benefit A supplement, child care benefit, is entirely dependent on the data that is listed in the Australian Immunisation Register. If we have an acknowledgement from the Department of Human Services that there are some flaws currently within the system—and we know there are because, for example, there is no capacity to go online and directly make alterations to dose numbers, or indeed if an incorrect vaccine has been recorded—then somebody can have their support payments withdrawn on the basis of that incorrect information. That is concerning. I just cannot understand why we would have a scheme that is reliant upon quality data to see who is and who is not fully vaccinated if the systems that support that are not going to be fully operational until late 2017. That is absolutely critical.


Again, restating our support for immunisation: we do strongly support measures that will increase our immunisation coverage, but we do believe that if we are going to introduce measures as drastic as those that have been proposed here in this bill, that remove support and payments from individuals on the basis of a database that may be inaccurate, then that has the potential to cause very serious problems.


This amendment addresses that specific issue by delaying the start date of the legislation until 1 January 2018, when data systems are ready to provide confidence that the immunisation data is accurate and that providers are resourced to undertake an extensive history and checking of the information. It allows consumers and health professionals who are using the Australian Immunisation Register secure site to correct errors online. It is about ensuring confidence in the systems; again noting how important it is that accurate data is used if we are going to take measures as drastic as the removal of these support payments.

Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (11:04):  We are not supporting this amendment. We believe that the information we received, not always immediately from the departments in our examination through the committee process, gave us the confidence that we would be able to move forward with the legislation at this time, provided that there is the injection of resources into ensuring that the publicity and information campaigns and also the maintenance of the register are both put in place. So we have accepted the department's views that that will occur and will ensure that the starting date can be the original in the legislation.


But I would like to take the opportunity in this committee stage to ask the minister for some comments on the committee recommendation, which you know very well, Mr Acting Deputy President Seselja, that there will be a review process in the department to ensure, as Senator Macdonald pointed out in his contribution, the need for this particular legislation to have a quite specific review process through the department to ensure that it is working and that the objections that have been put forward by many people in the community are taken seriously—that this is an important element of our agreement to the whole process.

It seems to me a much more sensible approach would be to at least advise individuals that this change is coming. Family tax benefit A supplement is really important for a lot of families. It might pay for the schoolbooks for the coming year. It might pay for birthday and Christmas presents. It is a really important bit of family support. It just strikes me as a much more sensible measure. We have already expressed our concerns broadly with the bill. There could be some provision or allowance made for individuals to take corrective action before the payment is actually withdrawn. I just wonder whether any consideration has been given in terms of a warning, a grace period et cetera.

To be frank, that strikes me as completely impractical. I suspect the majority of the community who have children would not have the faintest idea about the existence of an immunisation register.

I cannot give you any more specific advice at this point about what period of time there might be between when someone receives a letter and something happening, because you have got the end-of-year supplement, which is a reconciliation at the end of the year.

The last thing we want is for the department to be withdrawing support to thousands of families on the basis of information that is just not accurate. So it is going to be a big test of that database. I think there needs to be a minimum period from notification to the individual families involved—and we can have a discussion about what that minimum notification period needs to be, but I would have thought at least a fortnight and probably closer to a month to allow people to take the necessary action to ensure that the register is updated. I would have thought a commitment from the department that there will be a minimum period for people to be able to update the information before the decision to withdraw the payment is made would be something that had already been dealt with—I am surprised it has not. Obviously, this is an opportunity to raise that specific issue and get some undertaking from the department that there will be a period of two or four weeks for people to respond to a notice that a withdrawal of payment will be made, if the information on the register is not updated.

We all know how difficult it is in some circumstances to access a GP, and certainly for something like this it may take a little longer. Will there be any provision within the current arrangements that will allow, for example, a family to contact their department to say that an error has been made and to put a hold on withdrawing the payment and providing the opportunity for the register to be corrected, even if it is not within that two-week time frame?

Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (10:01):  Labor will be supporting this bill, the Social Services Legislation Amendment (No Jab, No Pay) Bill 2015. I reviewed the comments I made when we were talking in the last process and I saw that, at that stage in the debate, I pointed out a number of the concerns that I have with the legislation. I continue to have the concerns that I raised—about the need for education, the need for certainty, and the need to ensure that people and their views are respected effectively in our community—but it is very clear that Labor supports the legislation. We believe that there is a need to have strong immunisation policies in Australia. The evidence that we as a committee have received indicated that that was important and that it was real.


However, I also want to talk about some of the things that we need to get right in introducing this legislation because, as I said in the previous contribution, there will be a group of people in our community who reject immunisation, who do not believe in its effectiveness, and who are actually quite fearful about the processes. Those people will not change their views. Many people have spoken to parliamentarians about their concerns. The people who genuinely reject vaccination have strong views and will not change these. But we need to listen to the questions that are being asked, to respond effectively, and to ensure that the information process is accurate. I have spoken about my concern that I do not believe that the department was able to convince us effectively during the committee process that the education campaign which must go with this legislation is fully developed and effectively funded. In fact, to this day we still have not got the full budget to discuss in this place.


I know that there have been effective processes in Australia looking at the need for immunisation, and we pointed in the discussion to what had happened with some of the then Medicare Locals, where there was intensive effort put into particular regions to make sure that people knew about the value of immunisation, to talk about the safety issues, and to acknowledge that there was a need for people to make decisions and also to find out about the processes. That worked, Mr Deputy President—for the Medicare Locals which had this as a priority, we know that there were changes in the vaccination rates in those regions. Where this was not a priority, there continued to be a lack of effective information, and also fear—people were not certain about how the process worked, and about how it should work.


So, when you are introducing legislation as decisive as what is before the chamber today, what must go with that is the education and engagement program—well funded, well targeted and also done with respect so that people who have differing views are not excluded, demonised or ridiculed but have their views acknowledged with acceptance that there will not be agreement. That is important in ensuring that any program of change is effectively brought forward.


Another element is the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register. One of the parts of this legislation which has not been discussed as fully as others is the fact that now the registry vaccination program is there not just for early childhood but through until the late teens. We need to have an effective registration process for the whole of our lifetime of vaccinations. That has not been in place in the past. In fact there was considerable discussion around the way the current Australian Child Immunisation Register operates and there was a recent ANAO report which looked at the operations of that register and made suggestions for how the process could be improved.


Evidence that we received at our inquiry talked about some real concerns that the data was not always accurate, that there could have been multiple registrations made to this register and that by the evidence we received it was felt that perhaps it was not seen as a priority by the people who were putting this data into the system. We know this is an issue across the board in our systems with data collection and maintenance. If we are going to be sure that there is going to be real knowledge of what is happening with vaccinations across our nation, we have to have confidence that the data is accurate and that we will be able to use the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register effectively and with confidence.


That was part of the discussion we had during the committee process. We needed to ensure that the work which was done by the ANAO, which was looking at how the register was working now and also at the operations of the register into the future, would be accepted by the departments and by government and that there would be confidence that the register would be accurate. We did not at the inquiry because, naturally, the department that was in charge of the register was not there to provide evidence to our committee, but subsequent to the inquiry we did get evidence back from the Department of Human Services that said that they were meeting the time line of change, that they were confident that they had the resources and the skills to ensure that the register would be accurate and that we would be able to know that this register, which is kind of the infrastructure of vaccination, would be accurate. People would be able to have confidence that their details were accurate and that, when we have a system which is actually saying that you are not going to be able to receive payment unless you are up to date with your vaccinations, there is knowledge about what the vaccinations are, what is needed and what is required. The register would be able to confirm that you have received that process.


We accept the evidence provided by the department that they are aware of the needs, that they are working to cleanse the data and that they are ensuring that the site will be functional and secure by September 2017. There does seem to be a reasonable expectation that, if we bring the changes in on 1 January, it will take time to make sure that the system catches up and the register will be accurate.


In terms of ensuring that we actually know where there is genuine conscientious objection to using vaccines, the new system needs to have some consideration. This is something we discussed and put back to the department. We need to know where there is conscientious objection to vaccination so that we know where there are areas that may well have a lower vaccination protection rate. The department took that on board, and at this stage that is part of ongoing discussion to ensure that we do not lose contact, that we do not lose information about where there are and are not effective vaccination rates in the nation.


We know that this debate will continue. As I have said, there are people in our community who will not accept vaccination, and that is their right. Nothing in this legislation actually says that not taking up vaccination is illegal. What it does is change the family payment regime and the childcare benefit regime around having vaccination up to date. This is actually an extension of existing legislation, and we know that there have already been processes where we link access to family payments with vaccination, so this is not new, but it is wider and takes up more people. We need to ensure that we are working with the community to explain the reasons and to point out to them what the background to this process is and how it is going to operate.


During the committee process, the Labor Party recommended—and the committee took up this recommendation—that there would be reviews of how this legislation is operating after a year and after five years, with very intensive scrutiny of how this legislation operates—making sure the register process and the public campaigns of education and awareness are in place—and also of the impact of these changes on the childcare area, as I said. We do not think this is something that should just wait for the standard review process that is natural in departmental processes. I would be very interested to hear from the minister about whether there has been any agreement to the recommendations that the committee made about this concept of having a very intensive review, almost from the start, of how the legislation is impacting, who is affected and whether we get changes to ensure that the vaccination rates increase. It would be useless to introduce such a significant piece of legislation and not know how it is going and how it is working from the very start.


So I would be interested if in the minister's concluding comments and in committee, if it should go to committee, we can get some clear indication that the department will be taking up a very intensive review process which is linked to the necessary engagement with the community, with people who do not agree with vaccinations and, most importantly, with the almost seven per cent of people and families in our community who are non-vaccinators, who have not registered as conscientious objectors but have not vaccinated their children. That is the group that I believe will be most benefited by this change, but it will not happen if we do not work with them, if we do not have the engagement campaigns and public awareness campaigns targeted clearly, and if we do not get effective information out of the department about where the people are.


I think I have shown my frustration on a number of occasions during my contribution about the lack of information that we were able to extract from the various departments who have a role to play in this process. We need to have the data. We need to know where vaccinations are occurring and where they are not. Only then, when we find out where people are choosing not to vaccinate and why and we work in a targeted way with that group, will we be able to reach the kinds of results that this legislation is designed to do.

"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2015-11-23,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (10:13):  I rise today to speak to the Social Services Legislation Amendment (No Jab, No Pay) Bill 2015. The Australian Greens are very strong supporters of vaccination as an evidence-based approach to preventing disease, but we have some concerns about this specific legislation.


Immunisation is one of the great success stories of modern medicine and public health. Vaccinating against illness and disease is the easiest way a GP can protect people of all ages from vaccine-preventable disease. It is a proven method of reducing the incidence of deaths from causes such as measles, tetanus, diphtheria and Haemophilus influenzae type B. Measles, we know, can be fatal in young children. Tetanus is something that is almost nonexistent now, but people died from tetanus regularly. Diphtheria is another disease that led to the deaths of people, and Haemophilus influenzae is a cause of meningitis and pneumonia, a very serious cause of morbidity. We know that, since the introduction only recently of the vaccine against Haemophilus influenzae, we are seeing a reduction in the incidence of meningitis and pneumonia from that specific condition. And let's not forget, of course, polio. It was not that long ago that polio caused death and serious disease—a disease that resulted in muscle paralysis and ongoing problems with mobility and so on.


So we know that vaccines work and that they are effective, but of course they are only effective if we are able to immunise large numbers of the population, and vaccination rates over the last 20 years demonstrate that Australia has done a pretty good job of it. We have an excellent record of achievement in the prevention of vaccine-preventable diseases. It is a critical message for the community, though, where there is patchy immunisation coverage in places like the Northern Rivers in New South Wales and the Sunshine Coast in Queensland. It is very critical that this message be able to penetrate those communities, because we know that when immunisation rates fall below a particular level, in the 90 to 95 per cent range for a number of conditions, we lose that critical principle of what is called herd immunity.


Herd immunity is absolutely critical. What it means is that, when immunisation rates are low, illnesses like measles and whooping cough or pertussis can be much more easily spread. So, if we have a population where a large number of people are immune as a result of vaccine, the chain of infection can be disrupted or effectively stopped. The greater the number of people who are immune, the smaller the probability that those who are not immune will come into contact with the infection. So, once you reach that critical threshold and achieve herd immunity, you see the gradual elimination of a disease from a population, so you can actually eradicate the existence of that disease altogether.


What we saw with, for example, the eradication of smallpox in 1977 was exactly that. We were able to reach herd immunity and get a critical level of immunity across the population, and people now no longer die from smallpox, a hugely successful public health intervention. We are on the verge of eliminating polio altogether from the planet. What a wonderful thing that would be, and that is because of the huge investment that we are making across polio eradication in some of those very hard-to-reach populations. Of course, the final yards are the most difficult. The law of diminishing returns means you have to throw a lot at it to eliminate those final cases, but once we do that—and I am confident that we will—polio, much like smallpox, will be a thing of the past.


It is partly because of the success of immunisation that we are having the problems that we have with some communities deciding no longer to vaccinate children. Vaccination has been a victim of its own success in many ways. Because people are not exposed to these life-threatening illnesses, we do not have the level of knowledge and understanding that exists with exposure to diseases like polio and, of course, measles, diphtheria and so on. What that means is that people make the decision not to vaccinate their children because they are not aware of the consequences of those illnesses. Of course, it is a rational decision in some ways, because there is a very small risk associated with having a vaccine and, if we are talking about a population where herd immunity exists, you do not expose your child to the incredibly small risk of the vaccine and you get the benefit of herd immunity within that population. Those people are so-called free riders, and they benefit from the decision that other people make.


Now let us look specifically at the bill, which requires that families be up to date with the National Immunisation Program. They need to be up to date in order for either parents or guardians to be eligible for the family tax benefit part A, for the supplement and for childcare benefit and the childcare rebate. The rules that this bill—basically, the No Jab, No Pay bill—seeks to implement would remove the immunisation exemption categories for access to childcare benefit, childcare rebate and the family tax benefit part A supplement.


One of the positive things the government did as part of this initiative was provide a $26 million funding boost to the Immunise Australia Program to ensure that we saw doctors and immunisation providers identify and vaccinate kids in their practices who were overdue for their vaccinations. That is really important. It is a positive initiative and, if we can do more in boosting those programs that encourage doctors and other immunisation providers to identify kids who are not currently vaccinated, that is a positive thing.


The bill, as Senator Moore just said, does not remove the right to make a conscientious decision not to immunise. People will continue to have that choice. What it does is put a financial cost to that decision. The government's proposition is this: the disincentive of no longer being eligible for Centrelink payments may result in parents reassessing their conscientious objection or antivaccination stance. It is important to understand why people do not vaccinate. It is worth exploring that, because it really goes to the substance of whether this policy proposal is the right one. We know that there are people who do not vaccinate for all sorts of reasons. Interestingly, the majority of these families are not conscientious objectors. In fact, Professor Julie Leask told the inquiry into this legislation that the majority of families who do not vaccinate are not conscientious objectors. Of the eight per cent of people who are not vaccinating, only 1.5 per cent register as conscientious objectors. In her opinion, the remaining 6.5 per cent could benefit from other measures, and the best way to tackle those people is through supporting health professionals and, of course, ongoing education. That is one of the concerns we have with the bill: it does not focus enough on that large group of people who are not conscientious objectors but are not vaccinating their children for other reasons.


Professor Leask also told the inquiry that there need to be strategies to tackle those people who at present do not have fully vaccinated kids. She said that, when it comes to the issue of conscientious objectors, there are a number of what she called hesitant parents—people who are fence sitters and who are on the margins of vaccine acceptance. What we need to do with that group is ensure that there are community-based interventions and that there are provider-based interventions—things that we are working on the moment—and that we actually incentivise the interactions between those parents and the healthcare system. Under the current model, for someone to register as a conscientious objector they actually need to interact with the health system and get their forms signed by a health provider. That is the area in which we should be working. The real concern we have is that this is a very blunt measure. It limits the opportunities for engagement with people who might be at the margins of vaccine acceptance and their interaction with the healthcare provider.


I think it is important to note that the government's provision of $26 million in funding for Immunise Australia does include incentive payments to GPs who identify undervaccinated kids and initiate catch-up schedules. That is a good thing. Also, it improves public vaccination records, reminder systems and communication strategies to promote the benefit of vaccines. We welcome this recognition of the importance of reminder and recall strategies, and we look forward to seeing evidence of how these measures have led to an increase in the numbers of children who are vaccinated. That evaluation process is important. We also look forward to looking at how the reliability of the immunisation register, and their capacity to target Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island communities, has improved.


The bill provides that a child meets the immunisation requirements if a GP has certified, in writing, that the immunisation of the child would be medically contraindicated under the specifications set out in The Australian Immunisation Handbook. That is good; we think that is important. But we also think it is important also to recognise that the legislation says that if in the opinion of a GP a person has contracted a disease or diseases and that as a result has developed natural immunity, that that also is a factor. Importantly, GPs need to be able to use their clinical judgement in assessing children who are eligible for a medical exemption. As Dr Kidd testified to the inquiry, medical exemptions are rare, but with the guidance provided by the handbook and by using their own clinical judgement, GPs are the people who are best equipped to identify the small number of children who should not receive a vaccination.


Again, let me stress that point: that a GP can use their clinical judgement to determine whether somebody should receive a vaccination. But simply going to a GP and saying that you believe a vaccine is dangerous—that a vaccine will cause conditions such as autism—is not good enough. That will no longer qualify.


We do agree with the AMA's view:


All children have the right to be protected from vaccine preventable diseases. This includes infants who are too young to be immunised as well as those infants and children who are medically unable to receive immunisations. Immunising as many infants and children as possible affords these vulnerable infants and children the protection they deserve.


We do, however, as I said, have a concern that in order to register as a vaccine refuser under the current system you need to discuss that decision with a health professional. Often what we hear from health professionals is that sometimes it is a discussion that ends with the person changing their mind. It might not be about all vaccines, it might only be about some of them—but that interaction does create possibilities to influence somebody who is at the margins. We have concerns that removing that incentive for that encounter does deprive health professionals of the opportunity to encourage parents to reconsider that decision.


We also heard evidence from Dr Richard Kidd of the AMA, who said that there are occasionally severe reactions to vaccines. Depending on the degree of severity—we are talking about the extreme end—we are talking about cases that are close to one in a million. So, yes, there are minor reactions—I think that most parents will have had the experience of taking their child along to an immunisation provider and the child having a red, sore arm from the vaccine or, indeed, a little bit of a temperature overnight, but they recover reasonably quickly. But when we talk about serious vaccine injuries, we talk about in the order of one in a million or so. So we can expect a handful of serious vaccine complications to occur each year.


It is the Greens' view that it is a serious problem, and that in order to encourage greater acceptance of vaccines there should be a vaccine injury compensation scheme. We think that is really important. We heard evidence through the inquiry that the United States requires a compulsory levy on the manufacturers of vaccines that goes towards such a vaccine injury compensation scheme for those vanishingly small but very real and severe impacts associated with vaccines. We think that would lead to greater acceptance. Of course, that is at the opposite end of what some of the people who do not support vaccination claim is the consequence of vaccines. They cite links to autism, other mental health conditions and a range of conditions where there is absolutely no evidence of a connection between vaccines and those conditions.


We know that the AMA provided more detail about the Australian Immunisation Handbook and how that provides guidance about exemptions to immunisation. It also provides information on a range of contraindications and precautions for specific groups—those people who are at risk of anaphylaxis, those who are immunocompromised, those who are receiving particular blood products and so on.


One of the other things that we are concerned about is the accuracy and the quality of the data upon which the requirements for immunisation are enforced and, of course, the association with the removal of those particular benefits. The policy uses the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register as the primary data source. It is true that the ANAO did a performance audit of the register, and it reported that overall the administration of the register has been effective and that it has met or exceeded performance targets. That is a good thing. But we also acknowledge that there were concerns expressed through the hearing. Indeed, some were expressed by the Public Health Association of Australia, who documented some of the flaws in the register, which was developed in the 1990s. In evidence submitted on notice, the Department of Human Services wrote that:


In accordance with the phased expansion of the ACIR into a Whole of Life Australian Immunisation Register (AIR)—


and that is a good thing; to have a register that covers people right through their life—


a range of improvements will be implemented to the Register's functions and operations. This includes new functionality to enable providers to correct errors online through the AIR secure site, such as correction of an incorrect dose number or incorrect vaccine recorded. This will begin to be implemented in September 2017.


That is especially concerning. It is concerning because we have a scheme that is relying on data to remove payments from people, but we know that the system they are relying on will not be fully operational and accurate—in the way that we want to see it—until September 2017. That is why we think that if you are going to introduce this sort of legislation, you should at least do it once your data system is up to date. And that is why we are moving an amendment to delay the start date of this legislation until 1 January 2018, along with other specific amendments.


The Public Health Association of Australia told the committee that the government should seek to address the structural and practical barriers that exist, including socioeconomic reasons, and that explain why some children are not fully vaccinated. We absolutely agree with that, and we think that vaccination will be enhanced by supportive systems—reducing barriers to access, improving the reliability of the register, and further strategies that are specific to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. We absolutely look forward to seeing the impact of reminder and recall strategies, through a thorough evaluation. These strategies should include a national immunisation reminder system, catch-up campaigns, and local initiatives to improve coverage, as well as home-visiting programs and other actions to address some of the barriers to health care.


Finally, there is some confusion in the information that has been provided on the departmental websites. The Department of Human Services and the Department of Health websites actually differ in terms of information about which vaccinations that are required for people to be able to access family assistance payments. That needs to be clarified as a matter of urgency. We need to know absolutely clearly what is and what is not mandatory for eligibility for family assistance payments.


In conclusion, I move the Australian Greens second reading amendment on sheet 7798:


At the end of the motion, add:


""but the Senate:


(a) recognises that it is of critical importance that GPs remain able to use their clinical judgement in assessing children who are eligible for medical exemption; and 


(b) calls on the Government to clarify which vaccinations are mandatory to meet the immunisation requirements and make this clear on all their relevant websites and publicly available material"".

Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (10:33):  Since it is about time somebody did, I rise to ask: won't someone think of the childless? Politicians seem to be obsessed with families, so it may come as a surprise to many that most households in Australia are childless. A quarter of all households consist of an individual and more than a quarter of all households consist of an adult couple. There are also hundreds of thousands of households where unrelated adults live together. Childless households are also on the rise, in part because kids have grown up and moved out of their parents' homes, and because of the increasing propensity of couples to remain childless. To the childless people of Australia I want to say, on behalf of this parliament, 'Thank you for being childless.'


You work for more years and become more productive than the rest of Australia. You pay thousands and thousands of dollars more tax than other Australians. You get next to no welfare, and your use of public health services is minimal. But you pay when other people get pregnant; you pay when they give birth; you pay when they stay at home to look after their offspring; you pay for the child's food, clothing and shelter; you pay when the child goes to child care; you pay when the child goes to primary and secondary school; and then you pay when it goes to university.


Thank you, for all you do for others. I am sorry that rather than receiving thanks, you are often ignored, pitied, considered strange or even thought of as irresponsible. For your sake, I hope the children you are forced to support do not end up as juvenile delinquents and I hope that they get immunised so that you do not end up getting sick, because you will pay then too.


For this reason, amongst others, I support the Social Services Legislation Amendment (No Jab, No Pay) Bill 2015. This bill concerns parents who, on religious or conscientious grounds, refuse to immunise their children. The bill makes such parents ineligible for childcare subsidies and family assistance end-of-year supplements. This is as it should be. It is bad enough that people continue to bring wave upon wave of these little blighters into the world. The least they can do is immunise their bundles of dribble and sputum so they do not make the rest of us sick.


Withholding welfare payments from parents who fail to immunise their kids is entirely legitimate, including from a libertarian perspective. Immunisation generates a significant social benefit, and parents do not have a right to welfare payments. Such payments are, fundamentally, a gift from their fellow Australians. No work is done for the money, so there is nothing wrong with placing conditions on it. The fact is that most welfare payments to parents should be abolished, because people without children should not be forced to subsidise people with children.


Children generate great joy, warmth and meaning for their parents. They are a precious gift. What more do you want? It is unfair that people without children are forced to pay money to those people who have received the gift a child. Some people are childless by choice and are happy with that choice. There is no moral case to make them subsidise other people's choices. For some people, childlessness is not a choice; it is a great sadness. Forcing them to hand over money to more fortunate people is like charity in reverse. It is like making people in wheelchairs pay for other people's running shoes.


People without children are not freeloaders; they can look after themselves throughout their life through working, saving, and engaging in voluntary, mutually-beneficial exchanges. It would be weird to suggest that you need to pay for the upbringing and training of a baker just because one day you will want to buy bread. It is equally as weird to suggest that a childless person needs to pay for the upbringing and training of children just because they might want to buy services from those children in the future.


Some argue when taxpayers fund subsidies for today's children that this is a proxy for paying back the subsidies the taxpayers received when they were children. But this ignores the fact that some taxpayers received little or no subsidies when they were children. They have nothing to pay back. And forcing money on today's children, whether they need it or not, does not create any special obligations on them in the future either. And there are plenty of adults right now who pay little or no tax, so if they received subsidies when they were children they are not paying them back now. Overall, intergenerational wealth transfers are best achieved within families.


The Liberal Democrats support the abolition of childcare subsidies, coupled with deregulation of the childcare sector—including its excessive credentialism—to cut the costs of childcare. The Liberal Democrats support the abolition of taxpayer-funded paid parental leave, which is an arbitrary payment provided only to those new parents who were in employment in 10 of the prior 13 months. The Liberal Democrats believe that family tax benefit part A should be limited to low-income families, and that family tax benefits should end their march through the alphabet right there. Family tax benefit part B should be abolished, and, instead, we should have a flat income tax rate to ensure that families are not penalised if one member of a couple makes more money than the other. Parenting payment would remain only for low-income families with children who are not yet in school.


Some people may say that if this policy platform came to pass they would not be able to afford to have children. In response, let me make this very clear: people do not have a right to expect or force others to pay them to have children. The government is not your parent or your spouse. Get over it. In fact, do not just get over it; be thankful for it. The government does not make a good parent—just ask any ward of the state. What is more, when you allow the government to become a de facto parent it encourages the breakdown of traditional family units—something many politicians claim to support. Mark my words: when you treat the government like a parent, it will soon enough treat you like a child. The passage of the Social Services Legislation Amendment (No Jab, No Pay) Bill 2015 should help. I commend the bill to the Senate.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (10:41):  The issue of immunisation of children is highly emotive because it relates to our most treasured loved ones—our children. It is true that Australia is seeing a drop—many consider it a worrying drop—in immunisation rates and the herd immunity that comes with them. Australia has a vaccination rate across the nation of a little over 90 per cent, but in some parts of the community it has dropped well below that.


From 1 January 2016—just five weeks away now—this bill will introduce a requirement that children have up-to-date immunisation shots in order for the family to receive childcare benefits, childcare rebate or the family tax benefit part A supplement. The vast majority of families that would be affected by this bill already meet the immunisation requirements for their children at the appropriate age points—it is about 97 per cent. Figures provided by the Department of Social Services show that this 3 per cent of families represents an additional 18,000 children who would be required to undergo immunisation shots from 1 January 2016. But, crucially, this bill would also apply to children of all ages who do not have up-to-date immunisation shots. The parents of these children would need to have them undergo catch-up shots to the appropriate level for their age in order to continue receiving the childcare and FTB-A payments.


The bill also scraps the conscientious objection exemption to children's vaccinations. Exemptions will only be granted for valid medical reasons, such as when a GP certifies that the child already possesses a natural immunity from, say, previously contracting the disease in question. At this point it is worth mentioning that the Australian Greens second reading amendment seems, on balance, a sensible way to go forward—to allow GPs to make a judgement in these cases. It is a second reading amendment and it is not binding on the parliament, but, from a policy framework perspective, I think it is important that we do not ignore or shut out GPs who are on the ground, know the families and children and can make a reasoned judgement based on the medical evidence as to what is the best and most appropriate course of action to take.


Although we are talking about a small percentage of families, when added to those needing so-called catch-up shots and those families for which exemptions no longer apply, this bill will affect many thousands of Australian children and their parents. The DSS estimates that more than 200,000 children aged from one to 19—although if you are 19 you are not really a child, but I am relying on the DSS estimates—would need to be immunised to some level in the current financial year. That is 3.4 per cent of the total population of 5.9 million Australians in that age bracket of between one and 19. This is a large number of children, the future health of whom should be a priority for all of us. The arguments that weigh both sides of this debate cannot be discounted. I think we need to respectfully consider both sides of the debate. On one side of the equation there are parents who believe that their children will be at risk of contracting diseases because another child in the classroom has not been immunised. They say that that is unfair, despite any conscientious objection. These could be classmates at school or playmates in child care, or just kids that kick around together in the neighbourhood. On the other side of the equation, we should not discount the concerns of parents who do not want to see what they regard as pharmaceuticals injected into their children, even for the best intents and purposes, because there has been a concern that occasionally—rarely—there are adverse health impacts. There is a school of thought that has linked immunisation to autism. However, as reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association, this year there was a massive study of 95,000 children which found that the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine did not affect autism rates in a known risk group—those with autistic siblings. But I do understand that there are also contrary views in respect of that. It is not for me or for the Senate to repudiate what parents have observed in their children stemming from immunisation; I think that parents know their children best. There have been instances and evidence suggesting that vaccines are not risk-free. That is something that even the most ardent proponents of vaccination acknowledge—that there are, occasionally and rarely, adverse outcomes.


This year, the journal Vaccine reported that mistakes made in making Fluvax in bioCSL's Melbourne laboratory had led to dangerous side effects in children. Fluvax remains banned for children aged five and younger. The risks of injury from immunisation are very small but very real. I think there is a place for a statutory compensation scheme to cover the very small number of families who face a tragic outcome. And I note that, going back a number of years now, there have been calls for a vaccination injury compensation scheme. These are from people who support vaccinations; these are from advocates of vaccination who acknowledge that, where there is an adverse outcome and where that adverse outcome is linked to the vaccination, there ought to be such a scheme. My understanding is that Canada has had such a scheme in place for a number of years. That is something that we need to look at. That would appear to be a best-practice model. I ask the minister—and I would be satisfied if this were taken on notice—whether the government has looked at the Canadian approach, where vaccination programs are very much in place and supported by the community and where, for those rare cases of adverse outcomes, there is a compensation scheme.


I note that, back in 2011, Associate Professor Heath Kelly of the Melbourne University School of Population Health told Fairfax Media:


… although it was rare for children to be seriously harmed by vaccines, it was unfair not to compensate the few affected when there were known risks.


He is an advocate for vaccination, and he also said:


There is no doubt that the benefits of immunisation far outweigh the risks. However, on the very rare occasions that there is a serious complication, despite proper manufacture and administration of a vaccine, it is only fair that the community should provide for the individual suffering ... as there is a community benefit from as many people as possible being vaccinated.


That seems to be a measured view, which I think we ought to consider. But we also ought not to dismiss those who are critical of vaccinations; their views should be heard, and not derided.


We also need to ensure that the risks posed by future vaccines are closely monitored. Earlier this year, researchers writing in the PLOS Biology journal outlined the risks that vaccines against some of humanity's deadliest diseases, including HIV, Ebola and bird flu, can be 'leaky' and can lead to so-called 'super-bugs'.


For all the claims and counterclaims around this debate, I understand that this piece of legislation is about the risk of contracting diseases that have previously been eradicated, or largely eradicated, in Australia. I understand the government's argument about herd immunity, and that is a concern. But I also think it is important that we acknowledge the concerns of those who have said, 'we are worried about adverse outcomes'. We need to make sure that vaccines are produced to the highest possible standard. What happened with the Fluvax vaccine—where children were injured as a result of that situation—indicated, I think, a failure in appropriate quality controls. I also think that it is not unreasonable that there be ongoing monitoring of adverse effects of vaccines. We also need to look at what Canada has done for a number of years now with their statutory compensation scheme. That way, the issue is less about emotion, in a sense, and more about dealing with the facts that we have before us, on a scientific basis, so that we can ensure that our children are as safe as they can be, and free not only of disease but also of any unnecessary adverse impacts.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (10:50):  I support this bill, the Social Services Legislation Amendment (No Jab, No Pay) Bill, and I will be voting for it. I have no particular expertise in this area, but I accept what appears to be the overwhelming support of professionals and learned people who make immunisation and the control of diseases are a full-time study.


I was approached by a group of very sincere Australians who had an objection to this bill. Whilst I indicated to them that I did not necessarily support their arguments, I was very keen to ensure that they had the opportunity of putting their case and their concerns to the parliament—and through the parliament, to the general public. I was also pleased to see that the minister and the government allowed a committee investigation—which I note, Mr Acting Deputy President, that you were chairman of; as usual, a very distinguished chair. I note the recommendations of the committee which, broadly speaking, I support. The principal recommendation is that the bill be passed. The report contains recommendations that, in broad, call upon the government to keep the matter under review, to embark on education and communication strategies, and to look more closely at the question of conscientious objection. I note the thoughtful comments of the previous speaker in that regard. I will not take the time of the Senate by repeating a lot of those issues; suffice it to say, I think that the people who have a serious objection to the proposal are genuine. They are serious in their concerns and I think, in a country like Australia, we have the democratic right to make these views known. I was pleased that this group of people had that opportunity. I note that there were over 2,000 submissions to your committee's inquiry, Mr Acting Deputy President. I suspect and I see that quite a number of them were what we in this business call 'campaign letters' but, notwithstanding that, there is clearly a group of people who have concern about the compulsory nature of this.


In general, I am reluctant to impose these sorts of things on fellow citizens, particularly where there are serious objections, if—as most would say—not valid objections. I am a little bit uncomfortable about that. But I go along with the majority view—and Senator Xenophon mentioned this as well—that it is not just about the children involved: if particular children do not have these immunisations, there is a belief that this could impact unhealthily on other children in their sphere of influence.


I congratulate the committee on its report, and on its work in hearing the evidence and presenting this report to parliament. I think on balance that it is a bill that should be supported. However, I like the committee's urging—and I am paraphrasing here—that this matter should be kept under review, and perhaps some of the international incidences and experiences which have been spoken about in this debate should be looked at. I will be supporting the bill.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Digital Government) (10:54):  I thank those who have contributed and the spirit in which they have engaged not only in the debate in this place but also in the Senate committee inquiry. I think we can all agree that one of the great strengths of this institution is its committees, when they are directed to good purposes.


This bill will ensure that children fully meet the immunisation requirements before their family can access a childcare benefit, a childcare rebate or the family tax benefit part A supplement. Immunisation is an important health measure for children and families as it is the safest and most effective way of providing protection against disease. What is proposed is that from 1 January next year the government will extend the current immunisation requirements to include children of all ages. At present, a child's immunisation status is only checked at the age of one, two and five for family tax benefit part A supplement and up to the age of seven for childcare payments.


There has been a high degree of public interest in this policy, with a large number of submissions being made to the inquiry. A range of views from organisations and individuals have been presented. The government recognises that communication to medical professionals and families is a critical part of this policy, and that is something the Senate inquiry touched on. Materials provided to families will make it clear which vaccinations are necessary to meet the requirements, and communications to general practitioners will clearly stipulate how the catch-up program will operate.


While concerns have been raised in regard to this legislation's approach its intentions remain the same, and that is to prevent Australian children from preventable diseases—in particular, those who are unable to be immunised because they are too young or for valid medical reasons. Parents do have the right to decide not to vaccinate their children. However, if they decide to object to vaccination, this decision can no longer be supported with government financial assistance. The choice made by some families not to vaccinate their children is not supported by public policy or medical research, and nor should such an action be supported by taxpayers in the form of family assistance and childcare payments.


Crucially, the government is ending vaccine objection exemptions through this bill. This means that families who object to vaccination will no longer be able to access these family assistance payments. Exceptions to the policy will apply for valid medical reasons such as when a GP certifies that a child has a medical contra-indication or vaccination is not required as the child has natural immunity to a particular disease. Families with children participating in an approved vaccination study will be taken to have met the immunisation requirements for the duration of the study, and similar rules will apply where a vaccine is temporarily unavailable. The requirements will also be met if a recognised immunisation provider certifies that a child has an equivalent level of immunisation through an overseas vaccination program.


Lastly, the secretary of the department will be able to determine that a child meets the immunisation requirements in very limited circumstances after considering decision-making principles set out in a legislative instrument to be made by the minister. Such decisions of the secretary will be made on a case-by-case basis to address unusual situations—for example, where a grandparent or non-parent carer does not have legal authority to vaccinate a child in their care—but it cannot be used to give effect to exemptions on the grounds of vaccine objection. This policy will tighten up the rules and reinforce the importance of vaccination in protecting public health, especially for children.


I should point out that the government supports the Australian Greens second reading amendment, which records the Senate's recognition of the importance of the role of GPs in assessing medical exemptions and the need to record publicly which vaccinations are mandatory to meet the immunisation requirements. I commend the bill to my colleagues.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (13:59):  by leave—In recent days, the world has been shocked and appalled by a wave of attacks by Islamist terrorists on innocent people in the Middle East, most particularly in Egypt, Lebanon and Iraq; in Africa, including in Nigeria and more recently in Mali; in Turkey; and in France. Every one of those attacks is horrifying. For most Australians, I dare say the shock was most particularly felt from the attacks in Paris on Friday 13 November, since so many of us have fond memories of that city. We acknowledge it to be one of the great centres of Western civilisation—the city of light, a bastion of liberty and one of the world's greatest centres of culture.


As has been said by many, this was an attack on freedom everywhere and on all humanity. People of goodwill, of all religions and none, around Australia and around the world are united in condemning this barbarism for which there can be no excuse and for which there can be no toleration. I echo comments made by the Prime Minister this afternoon in the other place in expressing the condolences of the Australian government and people to the people of France, and to all the victims of the attacks in other parts of the world as well.


We salute the inspirational courage and resolve of the French people. We mourn with them, just as we mourn for the victims of terrorism everywhere, including here in Australia. We stand shoulder to shoulder with the French people and with other people around the world in our resolve to defeat this evil. Our cooperation with France and with our other friends, which is already close, will be closer still.


In responding with utter resolve, with the eternal vigilance which is the price of liberty and with careful, considered thought and action, we will not allow these attacks nor any others to destroy the freedom and humanity for which we stand. These attacks give no reason for us to reduce our commitment to helping those who flee the barbarism of ISIL and other terrorists. Indeed, they demonstrate all the more graphically why it is right and necessary both to stand resolutely against ISIL and also to help as best we can its many innocent victims, including the 12,000 Syrian refugees we have rightly committed to take, and who will, of course, be subject to our usual thorough security screening.


Here at home, we know that we too continue to face the risk of terror. We have suffered three fatal terrorist attacks in a little over a year and our alert level rightly remains set at 'high'. We will, as we must, strengthen our counterterrorism laws in considered ways, and we will work ever harder with community leaders to prevent and remedy the extreme radicalisation which breeds terrorism. We also know that we have security intelligence services which are second to none in the world, appropriately supported by the government and by the parliament. As the Director-General of Security at ASIO, Duncan Lewis, has pointed out, they have disrupted six attempts to attack Australia and Australians since September of last year. As Director-General Lewis also says, all Australians can contribute to the defeat of terrorism by continuing to go about our lives in a normal way. To do otherwise, would be to give in to the threat, and that we will never do.


Protecting Australians and protecting freedom is, as the Prime Minister reminds us, a global battle. We stand together with the people of France and with all freedom-loving people in the battle against terrorism and in our solidarity with its victims. I thank the Senate.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (14:04):  by leave—The opposition joins with all in this chamber in our condemnation of all acts of terrorism, including recent terrorist attacks in Africa, Europe and the Middle East. We extend our deepest condolences to the families and friends of those killed in recent attacks, and we acknowledge the pain and suffering of victims. We commend military, law enforcement and emergency personnel that respond to acts of terrorism, and those who work so hard to prevent attacks taking place. We join with the government in encouraging all to maintain the values of tolerance and inclusion, which terrorists have assaulted with such awful consequence.


In the past few weeks, the world has been witness to a spate of despicable criminal acts. Murderous acts have resulted in the death of hundreds of innocents. In Egypt, on 31 October, a Russian airliner crashed over the Sinai Peninsula, almost certainly due to an explosive device. All 224 passengers and crew were killed. In Beirut on 12 November, we saw bombings outside a mosque and a bakery, killing many people and wounding more: a dreadful terrorist atrocity. And, of course, there were the dreadful events in Paris on 13 November: a coordinated shooting and bombing attacks at six locations in the heart of one of the great cities of the world and one of the world's oldest democracies—attacks which killed 130 people and injured over 300, including amongst the wounded a young Australian woman who was in the audience at the Bataclan theatre. We give thanks that she survived this ordeal. And most recently we saw events in Mali in West Africa, with people killed by gunmen in this latest attack.


Fourteen years ago, at the first sitting of the Senate after the September 11 terrorist attacks in the United States, the then Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Faulkner, stood in this place and observed that 'the fight against international terrorism is our fight'. I again say that today. The fight against international terrorism is our fight. Australians recognise that fact. We recognise that these attacks are attacks on our values—the values of freedom, democracy and peace, the values of tolerance and mutual respect for different cultures and different religious beliefs.


When terrorists attack people in Europe, in the Middle East or in Africa, they not only put at risk Australians who are visiting those places but they also attack our values, Australia's values. That is why Australia will stand with the people of France, Lebanon and Mali as they recover from these attacks and as they bring those responsible to justice. It is why Australia needs to be part of the fight against terrorism around the world. And it is why we need to work in our own communities to confront the messages of intolerance and hatred and to protect our young people from those who would seek to recruit them to this poisonous ideology.


For the opposition's part, I again express our profound sympathy for those whose lives were taken in these latest attacks, to those who have suffered injury and trauma and to those who have lost loved ones. I want to place on record our thanks to the officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade who have provided consular support to Australians caught up in these terrible events. I again take this opportunity to place on record the opposition's support for Australian law enforcement, security and emergency services personnel—and for our community leaders and community workers—involved in the fight against terrorism at home and abroad.

Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (14:08):  by leave—Sadly, Australians are familiar with mourning the dead and supporting the injured from acts of extremist violence. We remember the Bali bombings in 2002, when 202 people were killed and many more injured, among them Australians, Indonesians and people from more than 20 other countries. Just like in Bali, the attacks in Paris, in Beirut and in Bamako have broken hearts and torn neighbourhoods apart. To the families and friends of those killed, to the injured and their loved ones, we send our deepest sympathies for your loss, your pain, in this horrendous and senseless violence.


The recent wave of attacks brings the number of extremist violence incidents around the world this year to almost 300. We remember the victims of those attacks in Nigeria, Egypt, Mali, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, France, Iraq, Turkey, the Philippines, Ukraine, Israel, Libya, Pakistan—and the list goes on. Today we stand together to honour the lives of those killed and injured in the recent attacks in Paris, in Beirut and in Bamako. The actions of criminal groups perpetrating extremist violence are designed to scare, to silence and to suppress any manifestation of belief or culture that differs from theirs.


In taking time to reflect on lives lost and harmed, we remain steadfast in our resolve to defeat the threat of extremist violence and we remain steadfast in our resolve that democracy—predicated on liberty, on respect for diversity, on inclusion, on global cooperation—is essential for maintaining our way of life and rising to the challenge to defeat the criminals behind this violence. But let us also remember that to give into fear, to opt for division, is to hand a victory to these criminals. Hatred is the problem here; it is not the answer. Our thoughts today are with the people of Paris and all of the cities and towns across the world affected by this senseless violence.

 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (14:11):  by leave—I rise to associate the Nationals with the remarks already made in this place and offer my condolences to those impacted by these devastating events. The appalling terrorist attacks the world witnessed in Paris on 13 November have devastated not only France but also the world over. I personally and on behalf of the Nationals extend my deepest condolences to the families and loved ones of those 130 people tragically killed and the more than 350 injured. These are deliberately shocking and horrific attacks by individuals shamefully associated with a perverted interpretation of justice and religion. We have also seen devastating attacks in other parts of the world. The recent attacks in Iraq, Lebanon, Nigeria and Mali are crimes that have been perpetrated by a similarly perverted and insidious ideology. 


In these times of great hardship and sadness, a natural human response can be one of hatred and distrust. But these are the times, more than ever, that we as Australians must come together and hold true to our principles. We must continue to live by those values which our enemies so jealously despise, to live and promote our freedoms, to uphold our values and to celebrate what makes our country unique—that is, its welcoming and celebration of all cultures. We must all be particularly conscious that these terrorist attacks are not the action of a religious or cultural group as a whole but of a radical minority group that represent only their perverted world view.


Countering terrorism and violent extremism is a priority for all Australian governments. Collaboration between everyday citizens, police, state and federal law enforcement, intelligence and security forces is vital to countering and preventing violent extremism. This is a plea not to spy on one's neighbours but rather to get to know them, to come together and to keep our eyes, hearts and communities open. We must be diligent but not divisive, cautious but not changed. And we cannot forget those we have lost or who have been impacted by these terrible and appalling attacks. The Nationals offer our condolences to all those affected by these terrible atrocities, their families and their communities.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (14:14):  by leave—I support the comments of my colleagues and wholeheartedly agree with their sentiments. I stand in unity with the people of France, Egypt, Mali, Pakistan, Lebanon and so many other nations that have been victims of terrorism. We must repudiate unequivocally, unambiguously, what these attacks represent. The death of each victim is a tragedy, but these deaths in particular are murders with the most evil of motives. It demands strong and appropriate responses from governments. 


Last Monday I had a chance to give my condolences personally to Christophe Lecourtier, France's ambassador to Australia—a good man, who does his country proud, who was still visibly shaken by those events. He expressed that the places where he would go to have dinner with his friends, listen to music or to a sporting match were subject to terrorist attacks where people just wanted to go about their lives. 


In making this statement, I also want to join in a plea for unity and I think that the comments of everyone here today, our Prime Minister and our opposition leader reflect that plea for unity. I also want to quote a few words from broadcaster Waleed Aly, who is perhaps Australia's most prominent well-known Muslim who, on Network Ten, using quotes from ISIL's own publications and its strategy of dividing Western nations along religious grounds to foster what in their sick and twisted minds call the final great war, said: 


This evil organisation has it in their heads that if they can make Muslims the enemy of the West, then Muslims in France, England, America and here in Australia will have nowhere to turn, but to ISIL.


He went on to say: 


I'm angry at these terrorists. I'm sickened by the violence. I'm crushed for the families that have been left behind … I won't be manipulated.


We all need to come together. 


He also said:


… because it's exactly what ISIL doesn't want.


Our strength is our unity in our decency and our repudiation of these evil acts.

Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales) (15:19):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today.


We heard an extraordinary answer today from the Minister for Education and Training, Senator Birmingham, who came to this chamber and said in question time that not only is The Australian newspaper wrong—something I find hard to believe—but also that the Australian Childcare Alliance is wrong and that the Community Child Care Association is also wrong. Here is a minister who will have to come back at some point soon and, I suspect, eat his own words on this matter.


Let us be clear on what the government's position is, because some people may not have followed this as closely as others. There was a story in The Australian today that the government plans to force childcare centres to bill by the hour. The minister's response appears to be: 'We're not forcing anybody to do anything. We're going to put in place an incentive structure to encourage them to do that.' How they encourage them to do that and how onerous those encouragements are is yet to be seen, and hopefully we will be seeing shortly. But the simple fact is that the minister is looking at fundamentally changing, fundamentally reforming and fundamentally tearing apart child care and how these childcare centres operate. That is why the Australian Childcare Alliance has come out and said quite strongly that if they charge by the hour there will be a higher cost. There will be a higher cost because there will be a cross-subsidisation that will be taking place, and that is why we have had the Community Child Care Association say that a move to short-session billing would make child care less affordable for all families and exclude those who could not afford the increase completely and would potentially lead to the closure of some services in some areas.


The concern here is that prices are going to rise if these reforms are undertaken. The concern is that those who have existing places may lose some of those places, that some childcare centres may be forced to close and that some of those people who are most vulnerable, who struggle as it is to find spaces in child care, are not going to find them. These are real concerns and, frankly, a glib approach dismissing some of the key experts in this area I do not believe is an appropriate approach from this government.


We anticipate that in coming weeks—and we have been waiting a while now—we are going to see some of the details of the proposal that is going to be put forward by this government. It is being eagerly awaited by the entire sector, but I am worried and concerned when looking at the rhetoric that has been said today, and at what has been said so far by the minister, that there is no disadvantage test to be applied. I think that, frankly, if there were a proper no-disadvantage test to make sure that no childcare centre is disadvantaged, to make sure that no individual child with an existing space is disadvantaged and that, finally, no potential future child is disadvantaged from these reforms, it would go a long way to providing reassurance to the industry and also to families out there that they are not going to suffer as a result of these proposed reforms.


There are some other key issues that need to be explored as part of this debate. One is the changes proposed to reduce access to early-childhood education from 24 hours a week to 12 hours a week and what that is going to do not only to access but also to some of the hardest working but lowest paid workers in Australia. The fact is that the minister so far has never been able to guarantee that moving to hourly charging will not disadvantage the educators or lead to the casualisation of the educator workforce. There are big issues here. This is an important area of public policy. There is a big debate that needs to be had here; and, frankly, a glib approach to what is a fundamental area of policy is not what this nation needs and not what this Senate should accept.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2015-11-23,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (15:24):  In responding to the question asked by Senator McAllister of the defence minister, Senator Payne, I must put on my hat from previous days as chief executive officer of the bushfires board of Western Australia because I do have a level of familiarity with surfactants or suppressants. In fact, what Ms Alison Clifton said in Senate estimates was correct: it is not possible to remove the elements of that suppressant without disrupting the base at RAAF Williamtown. The reason simply is that most of that material would be either adjacent to or, indeed, possibly under the main runways or some of the buildings. The minister's response was that the residual contamination or contaminant does not break down. That is correct; it does not. It remains in an inert fashion when it is dry. It is only when it is rehydrated that the issue becomes a problem. The minister eloquently responded in her comment that the run-off of water from the base is under management. That is when the suppressant can be contained and removed. It is the case that, whilst that particular product is there, stable, not breaking down and dry, it is not at risk.


I now go with a great degree of pleasure to the commentary of Senator Dastyari in his questions of Minister Birmingham. It reminded me of his incompetence when he was the secretary of the New South Wales Labor Party and he spent all of the resources of the Labor Party in New South Wales at that time to keep Mr Craig Thomson in parliament in the other place, spending the funds on his legal costs to the extent, if I recall—and Senator Bernardi will correct me if I am wrong—that he actually had to borrow from another union to pay the wages and salaries of those in his own office.


Where Senator Dastyari went wrong—even in his quote of The Australian newspaper—was making comments like 'the childcare alliance, if it became compulsory' or 'if parties were forced to change to charge by the hour'. Senator Birmingham made it very clear in this place that there is absolutely no compulsion on anybody to move towards compulsory charging by the hour. Whoever it was that Senator Dastyari quoted, assuring us that it would be the end of the world as we know it and it would be an inevitable increase in costs, must surely be from the same school of economics as Senator Dastyari himself. The minister said there is no compulsion at all for the providers of childcare services to change. But how flexible it will be—in fact, how nimble it will be—for those providers in different areas. I speak particularly of rural areas of Australia, in which you know I have a very keen interest. That is the opportunity to offer a service for four to six hours a day rather than someone being charged for eight to 10 hours a day. Let us just imagine how improved a service that will be to families.


Senator Birmingham was kind enough to tell us about the $40 billion being spent in the sector and an additional $3.5 billion to make the whole system more affordable, to use his words, more flexible and simpler—to move from three different systems down to one simplified childcare subsidy.


In the few minutes left to me I cannot avoid the opportunity to respond to Senator Carr's question of Senator Birmingham. It is absolutely wonderful that in doing so he pointed out the absolute failure of the VET FEE-HELP system as it was introduced by the Labor government. I was actually chair of the Senate Education, Employment and Workplace Relations References Committee at the time. Deputy President, I think you may have been chair of the legislation committee. I vividly recall warning the then Labor government of all of the problems that Senator Birmingham is now being forced to solve. Senator Carr's question was, 'Well, you've been in for two years; why haven't you solved them?' How many years did it take the Howard-Costello government to solve the problems of Hawke and Keating? Now he is asking if in only two years we have solved the problems of the then Labor government. Senator Birmingham answered why the ACCC is involved. I thank Senator Carr for the opportunity.

"Lines, Sen Susan",ALP,2015-11-23,"



Senator LINES
 (Western Australia) (15:29):  I too rise to take note of answers given by Senator Birmingham to Labor's questions on early childhood education and care. It is very evident from the answers that Senator Birmingham gave today that those opposite know nothing about the early childhood sector in Australia. Not once did I hear the word 'quality'. Not once did I hear about the significant benefits that the early childhood sector provides to young Australians. Not once did I hear about the academic or science based evidence out there that good-quality early childhood services enable children to get a head start in life, really follow through, get familiar with what school is about and increase their brain development. Not once did I hear that. We heard about business models and we heard about markets, but we did not hear about quality.


Those opposite have never accepted the amazing reforms that Labor made, which go to quality, ratios and well-trained educators. What did those opposite do when they were first in government? They took away the package that Labor had put together to increase the wages of early childhood educators. What is happening—and it has got worse under those opposite—is that 30 educators leave the early childhood sector every week because they cannot afford to stay. Those opposite now want to casualise the early childhood industry. Where are the educators going to come from? They cannot afford to stay there now on full-time wages; heaven knows how they will be able to stay in the industry if they earn for two or three hours a day. Those opposite are kidding themselves. Where is this sea of educators coming from? Are we going to import more foreign workers—is that the answer to their question? Is that how they are going do it—by dumbing down the early childhood sector and not promoting Australian jobs? Make no mistake, what we heard today from Senator Birmingham was all about flexibility. Even Gwynn Bridge from the Australian Childcare Alliance, mates of those opposite, is criticising them. Even she is saying that this model is not going to work.


I saw one of the responses on The Australian's feed today. Someone had said, 'The fee is $110 a day, so that will make child care $10 an hour.' What a ludicrous suggestion—to think that you can provide quality care, quality education and quality educators for $10 an hour. It will not get cheaper. You will have to load up a casualised rate because you have to provide good-quality educators across the whole day, and even though they are low paid they are still a significant cost to an operator. We did not hear anything about the word 'quality' today.


I put the minister on notice after his answer to the first question. He answered two supplementary questions where he could have quickly thought, 'I didn't mention quality.' No—he continued to talk about market opportunity and business opportunity. This is about children, from very young babies up to the age of six. It completely goes over the heads of those opposite. This notion, to casualise early childhood care in this country, will be a backward step. All of those good-quality reforms and all of the work that Labor did on ensuring proper ratios will go out of the window. When the biggest private for-profit operator in the country says, 'This is not going to work,' they should sit up and listen. The ACA was one of the organisations that continued to oppose the quality reforms Labor put in place, and now it is opposing the casualisation of the sector. Who is calling for one or two hours of care a week? Nobody that I have heard. The government has made the activity test so hard for parents at home that they will not be able to use it either.


The fact is that there are already not enough early childhood services out there now, and the government are proposing to create some kind of new business model, devoid of quality and devoid of quality educators, to casualise an industry that is already in trouble. They say that it is going to reduce costs. What absolute nonsense! The Turnbull government are completely out of touch with quality early childhood education and care.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2015-11-23,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (15:34):  It gives me no pleasure to follow on from Senator Lines, but I do have to respond to what is a manufactured scare campaign by Senator Lines and her ilk on the other side of the chamber. I would make this point: when a senator walks into this chamber and does not have a hook to hang their hat on, they make stuff up. We have seen the race button pushed today by Senator Lines in a grubby display of xenophobia, in which she said that we are going to import foreign childcare workers, in an attempt to whip up some hysteria about something that has not even occurred yet. Of course, those on the other side have a sudden, new-found appreciation for the reporting of The Australian, which, when they were in government, they denoted as the hate media. They used to mock anyone who quoted from it. That shows you just how shallow and removed from reality they have become.


I would rather turn my attention to the important factual matters attached to protecting the long-term safeguards for the black-throated finch habitat and to preserving the ornamental snake and the yakka skink and making sure that they are in a protected area. That is what this government has done in going through the approval for the Adani coalmine in Queensland, a matter which has been widely approved of, agreed to and celebrated by the people of Queensland, including the Labor minister for mines, Anthony Lynham. In going through the approval process for that coalmine, there was the protection of 31,000 hectares of habitat that is important to the black-throated finch. On the other side, they may not think the black-throated finch is important, but I do. Similarly, I think the ornamental snake is absolutely important. One of the environmental processes that had to be met was that there were strong habitat protections for the ornamental snake. One hundred and thirty five hectares of habitat has been protected for that snake. I congratulate this government for taking into account not only the importance of coalmining for the Australian people, our export industry and the coalmining workers but also the environmental protections for the ornamental snake.


Similarly, it would be remiss of me not to mention the protections for the yakka skink, with which you would be familiar, Mr Deputy President. The yakka skink is important to protect for many reasons but there are 5,600 hectares of protected area for the yakka skink. These are important, because we have taken conservation advice. It just goes to show that we can walk and chew gum at the same time, unlike those on the other side of the chamber. We have put in place a circumstance where we have a large coalmine that has comprehensively guaranteed work, exports, employment and the economy while also putting in place these strong environmental protections.


I think that is an outstanding win-win. But what do we hear from the other side? Do we hear any praise at all for this government? Of course not—because that would be too bipartisan and it would mean we are working cooperatively to get positive outcomes for Australia. It is not just the fact that they do not care about the black throated finch or the ornamental snake. I have not heard one of them talk about the ornamental snake in my whole time here—or the yakka skink for that matter. Where are they when the yakka skink comes up? They are silent. It is a disgrace! They want to whinge, carp and whine but they will not stand up for our native habitat—and that is an environmental embarrassment for the Labor Party. Although they are not prepared to stand up for those who cannot speak for themselves, they are willing to manufacture scare campaigns to alarm people in important industries in this country. I say to those on the other side: reject the politics of fear, reject the vile xenophobic reactions that some of you will seek to play on, and look at the positives for both sides of the equation. We have got to balance our environment with the economy and balance work with flexibility. These are the challenges for the new millennium. (Time expired)

Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales) (15:39):  I am almost lost for words! I rise to take note of all answers to questions from Labor senators but I want to focus my remarks on the answers provided by Minister Payne in response to my questions about the Williamtown RAAF base and the pollution issue facing residents there. Minister Payne, in a rather shocking shutdown of her colleague in the other place the member for Paterson, said that the metaphors he used about 'a leaky boat' were not metaphors that she would use. I have bad news for the minister: the member for Paterson appears to be a master of the metaphor. The article in the Newcastle Herald from which the first metaphor was drawn is worth a look. It includes this gem:


If you were a petrol station leaking oils and pollutants from your site, the EPA would be all over you like a … kid in a candy shop.


That, of course, speaks to the lack of action on this issue. He went on to say—and here we go with another metaphor:


The state government and federal government need to work better in their arrangements so the left hand knows what the right hand is doing.


He is a master of the metaphor, and it would be funny if it were not actually such a serious issue. Since 4 September this year, residents around Williamtown RAAF base have been told to avoid drinking bore water. They have been told not to eat fish from that place and not to eat the eggs produced by the chickens in their backyards. That is a pretty frightening prospect for residents. I think everyone in this place understands that, when something like this happens, we need to approach it seriously and methodically. It is not something that ought to be the subject of scare campaigns and we ought not to make residents unnecessarily fearful. But it is the case that residents in this local area up in the Hunter are demanding clear answers from the Department of Defence, from the minister and from the New South Wales EPA.


In the last week we have seen news reports suggesting that there is a disturbing lack of clarity for residents about the proposed pathway to deal with what is emerging as a very serious problem in this area. The state member for Port Stephens, Kate Washington, has said that there is an ongoing disconnect between state agencies and Defence and a disconnect between Defence and the community. The community does not know what is happening. They are waiting for more information. They feel that information is being withheld from them—and, on all the evidence, it seems that it is. They are desperate to know whether they are safe in their own situation. They also desperate to know what will become of their livelihoods. Since September the state government has suspended oyster harvesting and fishing. On 27 October the state government announced there would be an additional closure of at least another eight months. There are families in that region who are absolutely dependent on fishing and oyster harvesting for their weekly incomes.


Finally, after a very long wait, a package has been announced to support people in that area. A local fisherman, Jason Hewitt, has been quoted as saying that a lot of people will go under by the end of the eight-month ban if this is all they can offer. We are talking about a regional community faced with a most serious pollution question that has existential consequences for them. Unfortunately, we are not seeing a coordinated response between the minister, her departmental staff at estimates hearings and the minister's New South Wales state government counterparts.


Fortunately, residents in this area can rely on the Labor MPs who are constantly raising these issues. My friend in the other place the member for Newcastle has made representations on behalf of local residents. She has sought briefings from the minister. She has convened community meetings in the Williamtown area. She has participated in the elected representatives reference group. She is working with colleagues in this place to ask the right questions to get the information for local residents so that they can have the information that they need to make plans for their families' financial security and health.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2015-11-23,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (16:05):  The dumping of Senator Brandis from the arts portfolio was the perfect opportunity for this government to dump its disastrous thought bubble of an arts policy. The National Program for Excellence in the Arts, the NPEA, was universally rejected by the arts community, and it was rejected for a number of very good reasons. Firstly, the policy was not evidence backed; it was not created in response to change. It was announced on the whim of the failed arts minister, Senator Brandis. Secondly, it was developed without any consultation with the arts sector or, sadly, even a basic understanding of how the arts sector works. Consequently, it has caused a large amount of fear and uncertainty in the Australian arts community and has led to organisations collapsing. Thirdly, the new program goes against the widely held and highly respected principle of arms-length funding for the arts.


The Australia Council has worked hard for over 40 years to develop a world's-best arms-length funding model that is the envy of the world. But, instead of dumping the NPEA, the government have rebranded and relaunched it as Catalyst. It is basically the same policy, but now they have covered it in glitter. The government has stolen the title from a Western Australian community arts fund and instead of focussing on some undefined notion of 'excellence', as we had with the NPEA, Catalyst now focuses on some undefined notion of 'innovation'. Presumably this is to make the policy sound 'cutting-edge' rather than 'elitist' like the NPEA did.


So, let us compare the old fund with the new. Is there any new funding for the arts sector? No, there is still no new funding. Will individuals be able to get funding? No, individuals are not able to apply for Catalyst funding. Is it evidence-backed policy? No. Can organisations use funding under the new program for operational funding? No, they cannot. Will the Australia Council have less money for grants than previously? Yes, the Australia Council will indeed have less money for grants than it did before the NPEA was announced. Finally, does the minister still get to make the decision about which organisations and projects get funding? Yes, Minister Fifield gets to make the final decision about funding under the Catalyst program.


It is quite clear that Catalyst is just a government slush fund and that this government does not believe in arm's-length arts funding. Former arts minister Brandis saw himself as a modern-day Medici whose God-given right was to fund 'excellence'. And although Minister Fifield had the opportunity to change that, unfortunately he has delivered a hopelessly outdated approach to arts funding using the catchy buzzword 'innovation'. But he is not fooling anyone.


Through the Senate public hearings, Senator Macdonald said on many occasions that if organisations want arts funding they should talk to their coalition member or senator. It cannot be clearer that Senator Macdonald and coalition senators think that arts funding should be the gift of a minister, a senator or a member to give to whatever arts organisations they have a particular affection for. This is not the way arts funding should be allocated in this country. For the coalition senators, arts funding has become a new opportunity for pork-barrelling—a contemporary 'regional rorts' program.


Under my questioning earlier today, ministry officials stated that there may be only a minimum of one independent assessor out of a minimum panel of three assessors. This means that department-appointed assessors could be in the majority when assessing every single applications under the Catalyst program. Not only does Minister Fifield have the final say as to what projects will receive final approval but also his departmental staff will be able to control which projects are recommended to the minister. This decision, sadly, has set Australian arts policy back 40 years. It is a completely retrograde move and is typical of the government's heavy-handed approach to policy development.


From the beginning, before even announcing the NPEA, the government should have consulted with the arts community about their thoughts on arm's-length funding, because artists across Australia have been universal in their praise for arm's-length funding and extremely critical of the ministerial slush fund model. At the Hobart hearing, Ms Gallagher of the Tasmanian Writer's Centre told the committee:


… the Australia Council, with all its faults, at least is peer-review, arm's-length. The money being pooled into the ministry for the arts means that we are subject to the political nuances of whoever happens to be in power. We do not have arm's-length support anymore. It creates an atmosphere of fear. People are afraid to speak out. 


We already know of a number of instances where there has been retribution. I am sure that the Biennale in Sydney has not been well received in the ministry of arts sector. We had reassurance from the Australia Council in terms of knowing that we had that arms-length. We did not have to worry so much about the political interference. 


This is quite critical evidence against the government's NPEA and now Catalyst arts slush fund. Similarly, Dr Angelo Loukakis of the Australian Society of Authors told the Committee in Sydney:


… these decisions have precious little connection with the system of government and governance we have developed in this country. We do not need arts tsars or pseudoculture ministers here. Ours is a democracy. In this democracy, we have developed an excellent system for decision making about cultural and artistic affairs as well in the form of peer reviewed, arms-length funding via a statutory body insulated from direct political interference in its day-to-day operations.


Professor Edgar Snell, Chair of University Art Museums Australia, told the Perth hearing:


With the abandonment of arms-length funding policy and its replacement by a ministerial decision-making process, it is difficult to see how decisions made under this new regime will not be contaminated by the spectre of pork-barrelling, personal prejudice and undue influence.


Whatever the name of the slush fund—NPEA, Catalyst, dog's breakfast—it is a bad idea. This government's ideological attacks on the arts has caused untold confusion, anger and heartbreak. It has caused companies and organisations to close.


The changes will be particularly felt in my home state of Tasmania. Tasmania has a wonderful, vibrant, innovative and extremely talented arts industry. It is full of extraordinarily passionate artists that strive to tell the stories of our home state to a world-class standard. But this government has failed them. Individual artists are particularly negatively affected by the government's creation of a slush fund. Individuals are not eligible to apply for funding under the Catalyst program, yet they will be competing for a smaller pool of Australia Council grant funding against small to medium organisations that cannot receive operational funding from Catalyst.


It is clear that the government has put into jeopardy the careers of thousands of individual artists. These hardworking artists are the backbone of arts organisations, yet they have been totally left out to dry. While small to medium organisations can receive project funding under the Catalyst program, organisations still need operating funding to survive. The place for small to medium organisations to turn to for operational funding is the Australia Council grants pool, which has been cut to pay for Catalyst. While the government says that Catalyst will prioritise project funding for small to medium organisations, the truth is that the lack of operational funding will mean that many small to medium organisations will fold. It is also clear that the government is discriminating against certain art practices in the design of its new slush fund. Visual arts in particular are affected by these changes. Writing, painting and photography are most often solitary activities. Australian writers, painters and photographers are producing innovative new work yet cannot apply under the new slush fund.


Does the government not consider these artists as 'innovative'? There is a clear bias against these individual practices, and this government has failed these artists. This government and this minister has failed all Australia's artists. They have sought to destroy the arm's-length funding model that has served Australia so well. They have destroyed the Australia Council's visionary plan for six-year funding, a change that the sector overwhelmingly supported. And the new minister has failed to dump his failed predecessor's slush fund and has simply rebranded it. It is time for the government to truly listen to the arts sector and return all of the funding to the Australia Council and to dump their slush funds once and for all. I will just say to that side of the chamber, it is time to sharpen your pencils, guys. Give Australian artists a fair go, and especially give individuals a fair go when applying for arts funding.

Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (16:15):  This afternoon's debate hinges on just two points. Firstly, is there an alternative way to be funding Australian arts? I absolutely agree there is an alternative way, and we should not be shy from having those sorts of discussions. Secondly, should we be broadening the base for Australians to go and witness those cultural and artistic pursuits and, indeed, broadening the opportunity for small- and medium-sized cultural and arts organisations to get funding? Clearly, the answer is 'yes' to both of those questions.


Fulminations and faux outrage from Labor senators this afternoon—



Senator Bilyk interjecting—




Senator SMITH:
  It must be the beginning of another sitting week here in the Australian Senate. But I have to confess that I am very surprised that in a week where security issues and concerns would be top of mind for most Australians, even those with artistic interests, it is the question of arts funding that the Labor Party wishes to focus its efforts upon. But, of course, that is their prerogative today.


There is no argument that Australians currently enjoy the full range of artistic and cultural pursuits. What the government has decided to do is to deepen and broaden the opportunities that are available to them and to arts organisations. What has occurred here, as the minister has already noted, is precisely what was always intended to occur. The government said it would consult with the Australian artistic community about these changes and what the government announced last Friday stems directly from those conversations and consultations that Minister Fifield has been engaged in.


The government announced a proposal earlier in the year and said we would consult with the arts sector. The Labor Party complained. Now that those consultations have concluded, a decision has been reached which has been welcomed by significant figures across the arts community—and I will come to that in a moment. Again, the Labor Party is still complaining. Yet what we have not heard from those opposite is their concrete alternative plan. It is all very well to sit in the cheap seats and throw popcorn at the screen, which is what the Labor Party has been doing on this—



Senator Bilyk interjecting—




Senator SMITH:
  and on many other budget measures, but where is your alternative plan, Senator Bilyk? The government clearly has a plan.



Senator Bilyk interjecting—




Senator SMITH:
  We are contemplating the already substantial levels of public investment in the arts in Australia by establishing a new $12 million annual arts funding program called Catalyst, the Australian Arts and Culture Fund, which is designed to complement existing arts funding initiatives. I note that the chief complaint in this MPI from the opposition today is that the government is launching an attack on arms-length funding. That is just utter nonsense.




Senator Bilyk:
  You were there this morning!




Senator SMITH:
  I was there this morning. It was utter nonsense this morning and it is utter nonsense this afternoon! Applications to receive funding support from Catalyst will be made by independent assessors and staff in the Ministry for the Arts. These funding decisions are not being made by the minister. I think it is important to highlight that point—



Senator Bilyk interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Bernardi
):  Order! Senator Bilyk!




Senator SMITH:
  because either the opposition do not understand it, or they are wilfully misrepresenting the facts. The minister or his delegate—in this case, his delegate; in the future, perhaps her delegate—will approve funding based on those independent recommendations. That is entirely consistent, and this is an important point, Mr Acting Deputy President Bernardi, with existing programs administered by the Department of Communications and the Arts. Indeed, it is also consistent with arrangements for funding in every state and territory government.


What is especially exciting about Catalyst is that it is consistent with this government's core policy objective of promoting innovation. This fund will provide financial resources to support projects conceived by galleries, by libraries and by the museum sector. Many of these are not usually eligible for grants from the Australia Council, so we are diversifying their funding sources. As the guidelines make clear, funding is only made available to organisations, not to individuals, and it is only for specific projects. It cannot be used by organisations for operational funding.


But, as I was saying earlier, these proposals have been developed following consultation with a wide range of people active in our arts and creative industries. Catalyst will recognise the important contribution made to the vitality of Australia's arts scene by small and medium-sized organisations, most particularly those active in regional communities around the nation—indeed, regional communities across my home state of Western Australia. Funds can also be used to attract further private sector investments for arts projects, including infrastructure. I think that is an important and valuable point. All too often in Australia we have overlooked the significant cultural investments made by businesses in the private sector, but they too play a crucial role.


Grants made will be capped at a maximum level of $500,000 a year, which will help to make certain that more projects from more regions can be funded. The program will have $12 million available to it each year. Of course, there is still significant financial support available to individual artists, as well, through the Australia Council. And as a result of the government's decision last week, $32 million will now be made available to the Australia Council over the period of the forward estimates, bringing a total of $783 million over the four years across the forward estimates so that the Australia Council can continue its work.


But what we did not hear today, what we did not hear this afternoon—or certainly not yet—in contrast to the belly-aching attitude adopted by those opposite, was that this measure has been welcomed by the Australia Council's chief executive, who said in a statement that these decisions would allow the council:


… to increase investment in the two core grant rounds for 2015-16, …


This is news that I am sure will be welcomed by individual artists who need support for their new works. Likewise, Nicole Beyer of ArtsPeak, a major representative body in the arts sector, said on ABC Radio last week, 'It's great. You know we're really pleased this is happening.'



I know these sorts of comments are intensely irritating to those opposite, because the Labor Party like to think that they are the party for the arts community. In Australian political mythology, which is stoked at every opportunity by those opposite, the nation was covered in darkness before December 1972. It was only when Gough Whitlam moved into the Lodge that the nation suddenly discovered its creative side. That is what Labor senators would have you believe . In actual fact it was the Liberal government under John Gorton that first provided prominent public funding support for the arts in Australia and really breathed life into the Australia Council that we know— (Time expired).

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2015-11-23,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia—Co-Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (16:22):  As much as I was enjoying that contribution by Senator Smith, time is up! It is ironic to have a coalition senator demanding to know from the opposition frontbenchers what their alternative plan is—he is leaving the chamber now—when the fact is: Senator George Brandis broke something that did not need fixing. The alternative plan is to have not established this $100 million vanity project which has been condemned from one end of the country to the other. 


I have been to a lot of Senate inquiries in my brief time in this place, and I have never seen this degree of unanimity of representation from one end of this country to the other. Senator Bilyk and I have been chasing the inquiry that Senator Lazarus has been chairing for a couple of months now. I have never seen such a diversity of witnesses with such a unanimous of point of view. The NPEA, which has now been renamed, rebranded, as Catalyst, is uniformly despised. I should say that it is almost universally despised. We did find one witness, who gave evidence on a rainy afternoon in Parramatta a couple of weeks back, who had been knocked back for Australia Council funding a couple of years ago, who had a gripe and who thought this new thing could be good. 


Apart from that, we heard from contemporary performing arts companies, dance companies, theatre companies, the local music industry, visual artists and designers, writers, digital artists, community and regional arts centres, practitioners and those who support them, arts lawyers, community arts centres, regional arts centres, peak representative bodies, publishers and teachers the length and breadth of the country and of Australia's extraordinarily diverse and powerful arts sector who thought that this should never have happened in the first place. In fact, they thought that they should not have been brought into the Senate inquiry, into this format where they had to defend something that had been broken when it simply did not need fixing—by Senator George Brandis or by anybody else. 


This was an announcement that happened in May and the Australia Council found out about it on budget day, when Senator Brandis condescended to give the head of the Australia Council a phone call to let them know that the government had ripped this money out of the Australia Council's peer-reviewed process—which allows all comers to put forward their creative proposals—and put it into this isolated slush fund. There were a couple of draft guidelines that followed a few weeks later that simply made the problem worse and made the apprehension and the misgivings even worse. 


We saw 2,260 submissions made to that inquiry. Senator Smith is right: if you comb through them, you will find a very small handful—you will find one or two; you will not find more than a dozen—of those 2¼ thousand submissions that supported the idea, for various reasons—that is fine; they have the right to submit to these inquiries as well—and an avalanche of dissent to this proposal. We have held 10 hearings across the country, and 218 organisations have presented, with this extraordinary opposition. We saw something last week from Minister Fifield—and, give him his due; there was a selective sigh of relief around the country when Senator Brandis lost that portfolio; go and concentrate on other stuff and leave the arts the hell alone. There was a bit of a sigh of relief because you could not miss the intent. The intent, laid on Senator Fifield's broad shoulders is: 'Fix this mess. Make this go away.' 


So now, instead of a $20 million Senator Brandis slush fund, we have a $12 million Senator Fifield slush fund. They have clawed back a little over one-third of the funding and put it back into the Australian Council's peer-reviewed process, where it belongs. That still leaves $12 million in this new Catalyst entity that nobody can figure out what it is for. We held a hearing for a couple of hours this morning with some of the senior bureaucrats from Senator Fifield's department trying to explain where the idea had come from. Where did the name come from? Where did the idea come from? Where did the figure of 12 million bucks come from? Where did any of this come from? Why is this happening at all? They were not able to describe why, but we know what is going on here. This is damage control. This is just to throw the arts sector a bone: 'What is the minimum that we can get away with throwing at people that will just have them shut up and will stop the dissent to what's been going on and stop the opposition?'


The one-third of the funds going back to the Australia Council's process is welcome, but we cannot welcome it unreservedly and unconditionally. Other options were open to Senator Fifield. Those officers this morning were good enough to inform us a couple of times—they were asked a number of times—that all options were on the table. I and a couple of other senators pressed them on this. The options included reversing this ridiculous idea and just pretending it had never happened. We would have let it go. I would have been happy to pretend that this whole sorry episode had never happened. That indeed was an option that would have been put to the government. Senator Fifield had the opportunity of fixing this mess. 


Now it is going to have to go into future budget rounds, when people suddenly realise that there is this duplication of bureaucracy going on. This new Catalyst entity, which still will not be able to fund individual artists, is going to be in the mix with its $12 million, duplicating the work of the Australia Council, without the peer-reviewed oversight, without the six-year funding cycle, without the ability to fund individual artists, without the ability, for some reason, to fund certain kinds of digital art, including interactive work. It is very, very strange. This thing that just fell out of the sky on top of the arts sector on budget night is still with us—make no mistake. They have changed the name—well, gold star for that; it is a good bit of rebranding there, but it is not going to fool people. They have taken some of the money back, which you might as well acknowledge. It is a shame that Senator Smith did not. This is an acknowledgement—it is not a tacit one; it is an open acknowledgement—that this was a mistake, that some of the money has been returned.


It is very firmly the view of the Australian Greens that all of the money should be returned so that the Australian artistic community can get on not with making Senate inquiries, not with doing submissions to parliament, not with lobbying, not with drafting petitions or responding to guidelines but with making art. People do not go into this community in order to interface with this place. They have done so in good faith over a period of many years in order to hone the way that the Australia Council disburses precious taxpayers' money to creative endeavour. That engagement has been there, and we saw it come out and absolutely flourish. But that is not why people join the arts community, friends. That is not why they do it. So let us let them get back to it with as much money as this parliament, in its budget processes, can put to it, rather than establishing these vanity projects—a massive waste of people's time. 


The only good thing that has come out of this process is that I think the arts community found its voice and found its strength. I thank all of those people from right across the country who took the time out from their work—and people working in this community do not earn huge amounts of money. This is a sector that runs on love not money—although the money is obviously appreciated. But they came out in numbers, and we discovered along the way that the arts sector is well represented. It is well informed. It is well and truly disgusted with the establishment of this fund but it is an extremely vibrant, lively community that spoke for itself very, very well. 


The only good thing that has come from this process is that the sector got to link arms, see who it was and speak out. In all my time chasing Senate inquiries around the country, two things are very rare—one is rare and one is unique. The thing that was rare was that the public galleries were full. This is a community that supported its witnesses, advocates and people who came forward to give evidence. That was lovely, because we knew as senators—government senators certainly knew—that what we were doing was being watched, recorded and documented. That is good, because the last thing you want is for these processes to be happening in isolation. The second thing that happened, which is not merely rare but unique, was a warm round of applause after each of the witnesses had given their testimony for the heartfelt way in which they had put their point of view to the government: 'Wrong way. Go back. This is not what we need. We don't need more bureaucracy. We don't need disguised funding cuts; we just need a simple peer reviewed six-year funding cycle that can fund all comers—the big companies, the majors, the small to medium enterprises that are the backbone of creative endeavour in this country and the individual artists working on unique pieces of work that are not going to see the light of day any other way'. That is what these people want to be doing. Let's let them get on with it. 


This story, unfortunately, is not finished. I thank and congratulate the opposition for bringing this motion forward. It is important that we address this today at the first opportunity, but this story is not done yet because Senator Fifield blinked. He could have fixed this as Senator Brandis would certainly not have been able to do. Senator Fifield could have fixed this and he did not, so there is more to tell. But, in the short term, I want to thank all of those who have added their voices and the strength of their creative work to this debate while we restore a little bit of sanity to arts funding in this country.

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2015-11-23,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (16:32):  I rise today to contribute and support this motion via the opposition and to discuss the future of Australian creativity, and the uncertain fate of many thousands of jobs, careers and community contributions in our community. Because, when we discuss this government taking $104 million from the Australia Council and returning only $32 million—or less than a third—as part of Minister Fifield's partial arts funding backflip, it is those many thousands of jobs, careers and contributions that are at stake.


When we discuss this government taking arts funding decisions out of the hands of qualified independent experts—a process that has worked very well for many, many years in this country—and, instead, making final decisions by ministerial decree, with all the political interference and favouritism that invites, it is those many thousands of jobs, careers and creative contributions that are at stake. Again, when we discuss this government's callous exclusion of individual artists from accessing its newly rebadged funding pool, it is those many thousands of jobs, careers and those individuals' contributions to our creative industries that are at stake.


The small to medium arts sector in Australia is currently on its knees. A huge swathe of the arts sector's federal funding through the Australia Council has been removed and instead placed in a separate fund, known as of last week as Catalyst, under the arts minister's ultimate control. While independent assessors will make recommendations—I think it is three independent assessors from a pool of 300 on that program—the guidelines for that program explicitly state 'the Minister for the Arts or delegate in the Department will make the final decision regarding any funding awarded'.


Thanks to these changes, small to medium arts groups are now racked with uncertainty and unable to plan ahead. Despite the so-called change from the NPEA process under the previous minister to this new program called Catalyst, there is still the minister's discretion to make the final decision on what arts programs and group funding will be provided. It deeply lacks any kind of accountability and transparency. It gives the minister an incredible amount of power to make decisions about funding to the arts in this country at whim.


On top of that not only are small to medium arts groups in an incredible space of uncertainty and lacking stability but they have also been pitted against each other, competing for significantly reduced Australia Council funding. When it comes to recovering that lost funding via the minister's new discretionary fund, they are faced with a restrictive and politicised new system they know little about and which seems unfairly stacked against them. These challenges are most severe in my home state of Tasmania, where virtually the entire arts sector is classified as small to medium. It is no exaggeration to say the entire health and wellbeing of the Tasmanian arts community is threatened by these funding changes. 


The new arts minister will now bear almost sole responsibility for the imminent collapse of any small to medium arts groups, following revelations in a Senate committee hearing with the Ministry for the Arts. We learnt this morning that Minister Fifield had one last chance to do the right thing by Australia's small to medium arts community and, inexplicably, failed to do so. The executive director of the Ministry for the Arts, Sally Basser, appeared today before the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee's inquiry into the Impact of the 2014 and 2015 Commonwealth budget decisions on the arts. Ms Basser informed senators about the new system imposed on her department by this government. 


In considering how to unscramble the mess created by first the former minister and now the current minister, Minister Fifield, Ms Basser confirmed that Minister Fifield was presented with a range of bureaucratic options. He was presented with a range of options, and one of those options was to return the funding to the Australia Council. We know that that is the option that some 300 or more submissions from the arts sector in this country put to this government and were calling for—that is, returning the full $104 million to the Australia Council; not having this separate administrated fund out of the ministry of the arts; and having the transparent and accountable process that the Australia Council provides by having independent experts evaluate each submission.


But, no, that was not the choice that the minister made. He decided to kind of tweak the former minister's NPEA and create his new program and give it a new name, Catalyst. And there we have it; we are pretty much in a similar position to that we were in under the previous minister. There may be some slight reprieve. Yes, the Australia Council has been given $8 million a year back to its bottom line, but that is in no way near the $104 million that it has lost and that it has been able to provide some to 148 small to medium Australian arts companies as well as 28 major organisations that have been funded by the Australia Council.


Despite evidence showing that, between 2010 and 2012, those 148 small to medium companies produced 2,897 new Australian works, which equates to 88 per cent of the body of work, while the majors produced 299 new works, which equates to 12 per cent, Basser again confirmed there are no guarantees that small to medium groups will receive the majority of the Catalyst funding. And despite being pressured to nominate a token budget restoration of $8 million, the Australia Council for the Arts still faces an incredible funding shortfall that will hit individuals and small applicants hard—particularly individuals because they have been left out of being able to apply for the Catalyst funding themselves. Australia's small to medium arts sector has made it very clear that funding decisions should be made by independent experts, not by a political slush fund at the minister's whim. Decisions that are made by independent experts is what is currently provided by the Australia Council through a very transparent process.


I do give some credit to Minister Fifield's for his partial backflip, but he has not gone far enough. It was a step in the right direction, Minister, but you need to take it a little bit further. It is not enough to restore certainty and stability to the small to medium arts sector. It is only returning to the Australia Council a third of the funding removed from the Australia Council, which will have a detrimental impact on individuals and on small to medium arts companies and groups, which are the backbone and the majority of contributors to our arts sector in this country. And, of course, the majority of that funding is still going to be allocated through the minister's final political whim, his own fund, known as Catalyst, instead of by independent experts and having a transparent process.


I agree that the arts community has found its voice and its strength through this process. But it should not have had to have gone through this. An incredible vibrant community came together with vigour, colour, love and passion for what they create and what they provide to Australia—a creative voice; our creative voice; our creativity—which makes Australia such a beautiful place to live. I do not want to see that creativity put in jeopardy. I am urging the minister to take this a step further and restore funding to the Australia Council for the Arts.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2015-11-23,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (16:42):  I am pleased to be able to provide a reality check to this debate, which has so far been highlighted by deliberate misinformation and deliberate distortion of the facts of the matter. So I am delighted to be able to enter the debate, in the same way that I am pleased that Senator Brandis was able to initiate a reality check of arts funding in Australia—after all, the hundred million dollars plus that goes to arts funding is taxpayers' money. Taxpayers elect governments to look after their money. They do not elect governments to hand the money over to non-elected, non-accountable groups like the Australia Council.


I hasten to add that I have the highest regard for Mr Rupert Myer, the chair of the Australia Council. I think, generally speaking, the Australia Council do a good job, and I am a fan of Mr Tony Grybowski, the CEO of the Australia Council. But what is so wrong about a government elected by the people, accountable to the voters, having just a little tiny bit of a say in which Australian artist or art groups and which region of Australia should actually get some benefit from the taxpayers largesse in the arts funding arena?


The totally political basis of this inquiry, set up by the Greens, the Labor Party and Independent senator, Senator Lazarus, was very obvious from the speeches today. It appears that, when state Labor governments in Victoria, South Australia and Queensland distribute their funds in a certain way, that is okay—and there is not one word of complaint from the Greens and Labor—but, when the Commonwealth government does it exactly the same way, all hell breaks loose and the world is coming to an end! That just shows the hypocrisy and the downright political nature of this inquiry. At today's hearing public servants said in answer to a question, 'We looked at what all the states did. This is how the states do it, and that is how we thought we would arrange this new direction of the Commonwealth program.' 


I emphasise that more than 80 per cent of the funding for the arts is still going through the Australia Council. The representatives of the people, of the taxpayers, who are accountable to the taxpayers only deal with a small amount of funding. And I might say that some of that funding has already been with the government over many years under the Labor government, under the current government and under previous governments. So it was okay when the Labor government was doing it that way, but suddenly, because a coalition government wants to do it, it is the worst thing in the world. It shows the hypocrisy of the arguments raised.


I congratulate Senator Brandis for bringing this program forward and for issuing draft guidelines so that he could consult with people. People could have a look at them. If they did not like them or if they had suggestions they could get back to him, and that is exactly what has happened. I congratulate Senator Fifield on taking notice of the consultation. I know Senator Fifield involves himself in consultations with the arts community and he has listened to them and come to a conclusion—a conclusion which was actually suggested by the group of Australian artists who would have benefitted most from the NPEA that Senator Brandis proposed. They said, 'Let's have it. Let's introduce it incrementally, though. Not $20 million this year. A smaller bit this year and perhaps we can look at other things into the future.' That is what Senator Fifield has done.


You have heard others say that, 'Every witness came along and they all were as one in supporting the opposition to this.' Of course, again I should tell you that the witnesses are selected by the committee. The committee consists of Labor, Greens and a Green independent chairman. Usually, the meetings in the early stage were held on the days when neither of the two only government senators were available. So the people who were selected to come forward were those that the Greens and the Labor Party knew had a certain view on the issue. As it happened, a couple of others did come forward but—lo and behold!—their submissions had not been published. It was only when they contacted a committee member that the submissions were actually made public and belatedly the committee agreed to hear just one of them. But to assume that the total arts community were against this is just as fatuous and false as the rest of the arguments.


During the many hearings we had into this I also raised the issue of the principle—the philosophy—behind funding the arts. We in Australia have a wonderful arts community. We have some very talented people across the range and across the spectrum. We also have talented scientists. We have talented sportsmen. We have talented people in many fields. But you have to ask the question: why is it in the arts community that these talented people say, 'Taxpayers, I have a passion for this art. I am desperately interested in this. I am good, but I want you to pay me for my passion. I want you to pay me for doing what I love doing.'?


During one of the hearings I raised the position of the chairman of this committee, Senator Lazarus. He was not a bad footballer, but I am sure he did not go out in his early days and say, 'Hey, government, I have a passion for football. Can you look after me for five or six years until I make the big time and start earning the big bucks as a national rugby league player?' You have to keep it in perspective.


There are many that say—not necessarily me—that the arts community is a little closed group. The same assessors look after the same people; they are all in the Sydney-Melbourne sort of group. Those of us who do not live in Sydney or Melbourne sometimes have a slightly different view on who should be getting arts funding and who should not be. I do not make this as a criticism of the board or the CEO of the Australia Council, but it is interesting that the same people pop up all the time.


We heard today that if you happen to get the job as an independent assessor for the Australia Council you get 400 bucks a day for the job plus travelling allowance—the same as parliamentarians get—and I am sure they work for it. But there is this little group of assessors—there is this little group in Sydney and Melbourne—who know each other, and some of us who live outside of those circles sometimes think that perhaps a government, and perhaps a minister who is accountable to all Australians and to all taxpayers, should have a little bit of a say in where the taxpayers' money goes.


As I said, it works in the Labor states of Victoria, South Australia and Queensland. It seems to work well there but suddenly it does not work in the Commonwealth. To hear Senator Singh, who I understand was once a minister in the last long-forgotten—thank goodness—Labor government in Tasmania, would have been part of the government that actually handed out the arts money in Tasmania all those years ago when she was a minister. But that was okay then because she comes from the Labor party and she is supported by the Greens—so that is okay. But if you have independently minded people, very competent ministers like Senator Brandis and Senator Fifield do it, suddenly it becomes a real problem, even although time after time the Greens and the Labor Party were told by public servants that most of the work done in these programs that the Commonwealth do are run by public servants with independent assessors. That is exactly the same, in many instances, as the Australian Council does and certainly exactly the same as happens with the state Labor governments that currently have the same sort of system.


This whole inquiry was a political farce organised by the Labor Party, the Greens and the Green independent in this chamber to try to build up a groundswell of support against the coalition government. It will not work. Australian taxpayers want their money spent well and I am sure all sensible people in the arts community understand why these changes have been made.

Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (16:52):  After listening to that contribution, I am sure there are people out there who would take what Senator Macdonald said at face value, but the reality is that every single senator in this place, other than the coalition senators, voted for the inquiry because they were concerned that there was outrage in the community about the slush fund set up by Senator Brandis. The other point I wish to make is that every single senator in this place can be a participating member of a Senate committee and to suggest—




Senator Canavan:
  Do they get a vote?




Senator CAROL BROWN:
  There would not have been a vote. Anyone who has been on a Senate committee here knows that people who want to go forward, to give evidence, are accommodated. Senator Canavan and Senator Macdonald would like you to think that the people who showed concern were somehow just naturally anti the government, but this is not the case. The case is there was overwhelming concern in the community, not only by those people who work in the arts sector but by those who support the arts sector, who enjoy going to events, going to look at the art being made all around Australia. There was concern all over the place. So for Senator Macdonald to come in here and to suggest that the Senate committee was stacked is an affront to the Senate. As I said, every single senator, other than members of the coalition, voted to establish the committee because of the slush fund that Senator Brandis put together. Senator Brandis has united every single non-government's senator in this place on this matter. He wanted to choose who was getting the money and that it was at his discretion. Not much has changed with Senator Fifield's new program, Catalyst. 


We have seen rebranding and retooling of the Abbott-Turnbull government's arts slush fund as announced by Senator Fifield last Friday. That really says it all. They made the announcement on a Friday with not much fanfare either by Senator Fifield, who does not mind a bit of fanfare. When they put this out last week, we saw that it suffers the same fatal flaws as the program set up under Senator Brandis—I should say he sought to establish it because it was such a dud in the arts sector that they had to drag the portfolio from Senator Brandis to Senator Fifield to see if he could fix it up and he has fallen far short of that mark. What we had in Australia prior to the coalition coming to government was an arms-length peer-reviewed arts funding system.


The minister may have changed, the program name may have changed but at the end of the day the new arts program is still a ministerial slush fund under the personal and direct control of the Minister for the Arts. This has not changed and a significant proportion of the arts funding will remain the plaything of the Minister for the Arts. The arts sector is vital to our national cultural identity and they deserve better than this. I would say that we need more than a rebranded slush fund. We need this— (Time expired)

"Reynolds, Sen Linda",LP,2015-11-23,"



Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia) (16:57):  I rise today to speak on what I would call this so-called matter of public importance. Barely three hours ago in this place the leaders of all parties addressed a very serious issue of national security. It was a big disappointment that instead of addressing issues of national security and other genuine matters of public importance, we now have this issue again rehashed. Contrary to the shameless and blatant political scare campaign from those opposite, which absolutely and completely misrepresents the facts, the government's new $12 million Catalyst arts and culture fund will in fact for broaden the arts funding environment and will create more opportunities for the Australian arts community. Using emotive and misleading word such as 'plaything',' slush found', ' ripped out', 'fallen from the skies' and 'reductions', none of those terms equate with the facts. Rather than using emotional rhetoric, let us have the facts of this program.


Catalyst will in fact complement the work of other government arts funding organisations by focusing on small and medium arts organisations and encouraging innovation and collaboration in their programs. Contrary to the assertions of those opposite, it does not duplicate the work of the Australia Council. Further, Catalyst will encourage recipients to explore shared funding arrangements with the philanthropic and private sectors, which has to be a good thing to help them find more funding for their programs. The program also aims to forge new creative partnerships and to promote new ways to build participation by all Australians in our rich cultural life. This is a good thing. If those opposite had put forward this proposal in government, they would be saying exactly the opposite now. They would be trumpeting this fantastic new program to help small to medium arts organisations in this country. They cannot stand the fact that those on this side of the chamber put forward, not only for the environment but also for the arts, positive, innovative new programs to broaden support to the arts community. The Australia Council provided $175 million in funding in the 2012-13 financial year, while during that same period $21.2 million was provided to support arts in regional and remote Australia. The Catalyst program is also seeking to address inequitable per capita distribution of Australia Council funding to the states and territories. Those opposite now say that, while the Australia Council does some fantastic things, it is not equitable. For example, my home state of Western Australia receives $5 per capita per year and Queensland receives $3.40 per capita per year in comparison to Victoria with $6.80 per capita year and New South Wales with $7.80 per capita per year. That is not equitable and it is not fair, and it needs to be addressed. This new funding model is a new approach designed to support new artistic endeavours.


To highlight the absurdity of the opposition's claim that the government is attacking peer reviewed arts funding—I think Senator Ludlam referred to it as 'the arts community run on love, not money'—this government is committing $783 million to the Australia Council over the forward estimates. That is over three-quarters of a billion dollars, so I would say to Senator Ludlam; that is not just love; that is a lot of taxpayers' funding. As Senator Macdonald said, it is absolutely critical that we make sure that this taxpayers' money is spent as wisely as possible.


What are we doing? This government, despite its fiscal restraints, has not reduced arts funding in this country. Despite the rhetoric that you hear day after day from those opposite, from which you would think that that funding has been reduced, it has not. Almost $200 million per year still goes from the Australia Council to our many arts organisations. But it is not just the Australia Council; I have examples of at least seven other programs that are funded by this government. Screen Australia, as we all know, is a fantastic organisation that is behind a lot of the blockbuster TV and film programs in this country, including our No. 1 film at the moment, a wonderful film, The Dressmaker. There is the Regional Arts Fund, which supports sustainable cultural development in regional and remote Australia. The Creative Partnerships Australia is another program that helps to connect private, philanthropic and social arts donors with the arts community. Sounds Australia, Arts Access Australia, the National Cultural Heritage Account, are other organisations that are strongly supported by this government—again, completely contrary to what those opposite have been saying. I would hardly call this government's policy an assault on arts funding. Not only have we maintained the funding but we are also providing a wider range of arts organisations within this country to access these funds.


Those opposite keep mentioning this inquiry by the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee, which I also sat on for a while and I participated in the hearings. In my personal opinion, this inquiry is probably one of the most disgraceful abuses of the Senate committee process I have witnessed so far in this place. In the last budget the government maintained arts funding. What they did was reallocate just over 15 per cent of that funding from the Australia Council to another program—another program that is absolutely consistent with the way states and territories allocate their arts funding. 


Instead of just introducing the program and saying, 'Here are the guidelines,' the government issued draft guidelines and made them open for the entire arts community to make submissions on, which they did. This Senate inquiry has had, I believe, up to 10 hearings around this country. I can think of no other inquiry in recent times that has had 10 hearings around the country, and on an absurd situation—on draft guidelines that had already been subject to public consultation. I do not think there is anything—national security, tax reform, health, education, welfare reform—that has had 10 hearings around the country. To me that is an abuse of the Senate process. Again, just because those opposite say it is unfair and use all of these emotive words, it does not make it so.


One of the things I particularly like in this program is that there is a specific international and cultural diplomacy funding stream which will further promote Australia's talents and interests overseas. It will also support Australian arts organisations to bring art and artists to Australia to broaden the range and the exposure Australian audiences have to overseas performers. 


The Catalyst funding model is a welcome new concept, and one that aligns with the government's agenda to deliver innovative arts funding to provide the most public benefit. It does not conflict with the Australia Council funding. Just because it is different and just because those opposite have not suggested it, does not mean that it is a bad thing. The facts simply do not support the disingenuous rhetoric of those opposite. As much as it may gall those opposite, we are looking after the Australian arts community in a very tight fiscal environment. We have maintained arts funding and broadened it.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (21:50):  Last week, Dr James Raymond Bourke MG, AM, Doctor of Philosophy and a retired Lieutenant Colonel, would have turned 73. I know not many of my Senate colleagues would be familiar with his name, but there would be more than a few who would be aware of his remarkable, honourable and courageous efforts as the initiator and driver behind a highly successful, emotional journey in the early 2000s to bring home the bodies of six Australian soldiers who never made it back from the Vietnam War.


Unfortunately, the Vietnam veteran and war hero, who dedicated his later years to repatriating bodies of his fallen comrades, died just two months short of his 73rd birthday. Tonight I would like to honour his memory and reflect on his wonderful achievements, most notably Operation Aussies Home.


The story of retired Lieutenant Colonel Jim Bourke began in my own home town of Ayr in 1943. Jim was only a few years older than I and, similarly, was raised and educated in the Burdekin. In fact he was school captain in 1961 at the Ayr State High and Intermediate School, a role that I was privileged to hold two years after Jim. He also achieved two other significant awards at the school, awards which I confess I could never have achieved: the coveted Burstall Award for all-round academic and leadership excellence and the Award for the Best Senior—read grade 12—Pass.


As an older boy, Jim Bourke was a bit out of my sphere of personal contact, but I do remember him as a quietly spoken, very much understated leader, in all aspects of the word, and a real gentleman. In later years I certainly became more than familiar with his achievements as one of the country's most respected war veterans. It was in 1963 that the then 19-year old joined the Army. He served in various postings, rising to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel before retiring in 1986. In 1988 he was awarded the Medal of Gallantry—more than 30 years after an act of bravery in which, as platoon leader, he rescued injured comrades while under enemy fire in Vietnam as a member of the 1st Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment. He was himself severely injured at the time; he was shot in the face, the bullet tearing through his mouth and exiting below his left ear.


That was not to be his last mission, of course. He served a second tour of duty in Vietnam in 1968. And four decades later he led a privately funded team to locate and retrieve the remains of six missing Australians—Richard Parker, Peter Gillson, David Fisher, Michael Herbert, Robert Carver and John Gillespie—who were left behind in Vietnam where they fell. This mission was to become the renowned 'Operation Aussies Home'. Jim spent many thousands of hours researching every last detail ahead of this final journey and almost as much time lobbying politicians and bureaucrats for support. When his pleas fell on deaf ears, he went ahead with his plans anyway. Together with a small team, he set off to Vietnam once more in an effort to find the remains of those six soldiers who never made it home.


Operation Aussies Home was by all accounts highly successful, achieving what many now admit governments at the time had not be willing or able to. When asked why he dedicated his later years to Operation Aussies Home, investing so much of his own time and money, Jim admitted that the pain, loss and suffering of not being able to witness the funeral of his own father, his 'best mate', who died when Jim was just 13 years of age, had played heavily on his mind for many decades and may in some way have triggered his need to return to Vietnam to provide some sense of finality for the families of those missing soldiers.


After successfully completing his final mission, which the government did eventually support and fund, Jim turned his attention to his thesis, which he was able to finish shortly before his death. 'Living with Unresolved Grief and Uncompleted Tasks: Achieving Closure around Ambiguous Loss and Traumatic Events During Wartime' was a 110,000-word thesis that Jim dedicated to his father. In it, he documented the story of Operation Aussies Home—the many interviews with the families of those soldiers he helped to repatriate, along with his own thoughts, experiences and memories.


Along the way, the accolades continued. Jim was named Anzac of the Year in 2009. In the same year, he was recognised with an Order of Australia award for his service to veterans and their families. According to journalist Hedley Thomas of The Australian, who had the honour of doing one of the last interviews with Jim before he died, Jim's one and only regret before his death was that he was not able to undertake the same mission for the 42 Australians who went missing in the Korean War, who, similarly, never made it home. Vale Jim Bourke. Not only has our nation lost a distinguished, honourable veteran, but my own community mourns the loss of a legend.
