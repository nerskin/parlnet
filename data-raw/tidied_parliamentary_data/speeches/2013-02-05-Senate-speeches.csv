Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (12:32):  Welcome back, Mr Deputy President, and congratulations, Senator Conroy. There must have been no-one else in the ballot. What we have here before us with the Water Amendment (Water for the Environment Special Account) Bill 2012 is basically a process that the Labor government have used to placate the Greens and to get to a magical number of 3,200 gigs. You can see the authenticity of how much they actually want to achieve this because, in the $1.77 billion that this requires, they have only allocated $50 million over the forward estimates. Therefore, this is more rhetoric than a reality.


As rhetoric, it falls well into line with everything else that has been insufficient about the government's current process in dealing with the water issue—insufficient insofar as we do not have currently a state intergovernmental agreement. They are state assets. We do not know how the states are going to do this. The states have not signed off on anything to do with this. We do not actually have an environmental water plan.


If this is correct, we will have 450 gigs from this, we have got 2,750 from the Basin Plan—there is your magical figure of 3,200 gigs—and we have already received about 962 gigs from the Living Murray and other state based plans. So we have got 4,162 gigs that have been returned to the river, of which 3,200—if you believe this—are going to be managed by the environmental water holder. That is a rather sizeable dam. That is a lot of water. That would be one of the biggest dams in Australia if it were all held in that dam. But what are they going to do with it? How does it actually work? How do they get this water to their assets? Where do they store it? What are the rights of other people near those dams where they store water? What happens if it pushes out the water that is being stored there for irrigation?


In my area, in the north, it is kind of ridiculous, because what they are doing is buying water that would have otherwise gone down the river to the Culgoa floodplain and the Narran lakes. And after they have purchased it, the water will still go down the river to the Culgoa floodplain and the Narran lakes. They are busily buying water that, in some instances, was never going to be used in any case. But, anyway, it helped some people and got them out of some rather large loans with the bank. They have laughed all the way to the bank—and that is fair enough.


This account is part of a rhetorical process more than it is part of an actual process. How are they managing even the water that they have got at the moment? We know from their tests that they have been trying to get water to South Australia but they actually cannot do it because of restrictions. There are so many issues pertaining to this that make it awfully convoluted. It will just become part of this political debate. It is not worth compromising the plan for an addendum which really is of no real consequence, because there is very little money, if any, actually allocated to this over the forward estimates.


As part of this process, the coalition will be looking to move amendments to reinforce our position so that, if we get the honour of becoming the government, the Australian people will have a strong idea about what we intend to do. Our amendments will remove buyback. We do not believe in buyback. We believe that, if you want to get water back into the river, you should do it the clever way. You should be trying to do it through infrastructure, through on-farm works and measures, through using laterals where you can, through more efficient mechanisms of storage and deeper cells. These are the sorts of things that a clever country would do. Just buying back the water and sending towns and communities broke is not clever. We in the coalition, in the National Party and in the Liberal Party, actually rate people above frogs—based on the Maslow hierarchy of needs—and believe that we are actually in this parliament to try as best we can to represent the 2.1 million people who live in the basin and make sure we protect their economic base. We will also be moving an amendment so that it goes back to what it initially said. This initially said 'up to 450 gigalitres' but, of course, that changed. Do you know why it changed? It changed because the Australian Greens wanted it to change. This is part of this 'Captain Chaos' government, which is currently being dispensed by the Australian people—now being dispensed by people on their own side—because, if you try to serve two masters, you end up serving none. In trying to serve the Greens, the right wing of the Labor Party and the left wing of the Labor Party, it has once more managed to create a piece of policy which is merely rhetoric because it discusses something that we have not actually allocated the money for. It talks things way off into the never-never. It talks it in a form where we are currently $262 billion in gross debt, so wherever this money comes from it is only borrowed money. If the nation does not have the money, what are your prospects of getting your hands on the money if we are so far in debt?


The coalition will be moving an amendment—to make sure that we specifically talk about the current process, because this goes back to the plan—to cap buybacks so that they do not go beyond 1,500 gigalitres. I cannot stress that enough. If you are going to steal from a town, you do it by actually taking the water licence off them. Once you take the water licence off them then maybe the farmers would be happy—because they will collect the cheque, go to the coast and live happily ever after—but the tyre business in the town just goes broke. Maybe they go to the bank to borrow $800,000, $900,000, $1 million or $2 million to build a motel, but all of a sudden the economic base of their business, their rug, is pulled out. These people do not get compensated. 


This is why you have to be so careful: because any government that is going to an election talking about economic prudence—talking about having the capacity to get the economy going—is going to look awfully odd if one of its front-and-centre pieces is a policy to actually shut down economies. When you really think about it, the way it is going about this is that it is  borrowing money from overseas. We are in debt by $262 billion, and 86 per cent of that money that we have borrowed comes in from overseas—from the good people of China and from the people in the Middle-East. All of these prudent people saving their money send it over to us because we cannot make our incomes meet our expenses and our debt gets bigger and bigger—we borrowed in excess of $2 billion last week—and ultimately we have to pay these people back. But when you think about it, when you really drill down to it, we are borrowing money from overseas not to create a productive asset that can pay things off—not to actually build a new factory or a new dam or to increase our capacity to meet our debts. We are borrowing money from overseas to shut the factories down and to shut the towns down. It is a double whammy. We are borrowing the money and we are reducing the size of the economic component that is supposed to pay it off. It is a very, very strange and peculiar thing. It is a job for Inspector Clouseau, something we must investigate more closely. It needs a rather large magnifying glass to work out why we are doing this. 


But we have always said that it is for the environment. Of course people say: 'Well, it's your policy. It's the coalition's policy'. The difference is that we brought this policy about when we actually had money in the bank. That is the difference. Now we do not have money in the bank; we just have massive debts. We are very mindful of the fact that, yes, we must deal with the environmental issue where that was pertinent, but we must not deal with it in a way that destroys the economic fabric of the 2.1 million people living in the basin. We are very aware of and very alive to issues such as the 600 dairy farmers that turned up in Victoria the other day—we are very alive to that. We are very alive to what the pressures are on these people's lives. One is the overcentralisation of the retail market and the fact that they are being exploited by dollar-a-litre milk—we acknowledge that. Another thing is that we have this crazy policy where the government is now basically going into areas and buying out the water, becoming the biggest competitor in their own water market, shutting down their towns and putting extra pressure on them because of a fascination with frogs and moths. We will be part of this process, but we will not do it to the extent that it creates a mechanism for the destruction of the communities that we are supposed to represent and it becomes symbolic of a process that shows that you have no economic credibility whatsoever in that you were going to areas to shut economies down rather than build them up.


In showing a process of cautiously working with the government and in close discussions with our state colleagues, we will go down this path, but we will do it in such a way that we will be moving amendments to clearly show to the Australian people what our views are on this issue. There really needs to be a lot more work that goes into this whole plan. It is a plan that, in some areas, is completely incongruous to the outcome. There is no water. We are probably going to be ending up with about 150,000 to 180,000 megalitres per day going through St George. I can assure you that that water will never, ever get to South Australia—not a chance. Some of it may get to the Menindee storage lakes. There was this view at the start of this debate that Australia was this interconnected garden hose where, if you just tip a bit of water in at Toowoomba and wait long enough, it arrives at the Lower Lakes. That is an absurdity. As I said at the start of this debate some years ago, it is a big old dry carpet. This plan does not properly reflect the hydrology of it. The latest tests that they have done in trying  to move and shepherd water have emphasised quite clearly the impracticalities of trying to shepherd water, whether it is from Copeton Dam in northern New South Wales or, even more ridiculously, virtually from central Queensland down to South Australia. It is just impractical; it will not do it. What really were the issues that we were trying to address with this? How did we get ourselves into a position where we are so far down the track? When are we actually going to see an environmental watering plan? When is this document going to turn up? Why is it that we have been in a position where the biggest irrigator with the biggest water asset in our nation will now be the government? Others may be irrigating things that actually produce money, whether it is cotton or rice or apricots or apples or onions or potatoes, but the government are going to be watering swamps and forests and moss. That is marvellous, but the government are now the biggest irrigator and the water asset that they have on the books would be the biggest water asset held by anybody. It is a massive asset. But you do not get any sense of comfort when you think, therefore, that these people better be absolutely competent and on their game. What sense of competence do you get from a government when you find out that they bought a property, Toorale Station, near Bourke, and the Commonwealth taxpayer shelled out $23.75 million. The closest that this government ever got to that place was 30,000 feet on their way to Darwin. They never set foot on it.


The story goes that this place was going to auction and someone from the government rang up and said: 'We may have an interest in that place. What is your reserve?' The sellers said, 'We do not tell you the reserve before we sell a place.' I know that Senator Fifield, who used to work in the Treasurer's office, will be fascinated by this. The government said, 'We are really interested.' They went back and had a meeting and said, 'The government has just rung up and wants to buy Toorale, wants us to tell them the reserve.' The bloke said, 'Tell them to go jump.' Anyway, the number they actually had in mind was $16 million but they said, 'If they ring back, just say 23.' Guess what! They rang back and said, 'It is 23.' They thought they would drive a really hard deal. So do you know what they said then? They said, 'But it has still got cattle on it.' They said, 'They have to go and that will cost more.' So it cost the Australian taxpayer $750,000 to remove the Commonwealth's stock off their own place and have them sold.




Senator Nash:
  It is ludicrous.




Senator JOYCE:
  It is. These people are running the country. They say, 'Oh, this is a one-off.' They cannot possibly have bought the place without seeing it. Well, they did. At that stage the minister was Penny Wong. She only turns up once in your life and when she turns up you just have to make the most of her! Then the government came back into the market because after Toorale they went and bought Twynam's water from Johnny Kahlbetzer. I went to college with him. He is a clever man. They bought all his water licences, the whole $303 million. There were other people in tenders up and down, offering it cheaper. But this is the government and this is why the government are so far in debt. This is why I have no confidence whatsoever that these people will be competent enough to complete on this plan.


We started this process in good faith, that there was an environmental issue there and we would try as best we could to address it. We put the money on the table when we had money in the bank. We knew full well from the word go that, if the coalition were not at the table, this rambling disorderly nonsense which is apparently standing in proxy for a government instead of talking to us would talk to the Greens. You will see one of these amendments coming up: rather than saying they want 'up to', they want a minimum of 450 gigs from this. That is what we would have to contend with. They said at the start they wanted in excess of 7,000 gigs to be taken out of communities and put back into the environment. That would absolutely decimate the Murray-Darling Basin. They were kicking and screaming, they were never happy.


It was force majeure for us because we knew full well, if we were not the participants to try and placate the excesses of this ludicrous scheme, who would be doing it—the Australian Greens, as orchestrated from inner suburban Adelaide. That would have not been doing the right thing by our people, by those 600 dairy farmers who were protesting the other day, by the people of Bourke, by the people of Parkes, by the people of Goondiwindi, by the people of St George, where I live. This river goes literally past my front door. I can throw a rock from my front yard into the river without much effort whatsoever. In fact, in a couple of days I will be able to almost kick it into the river.


To be honest, we are extremely reluctant participants in an incompetent government, but we do it because we know that the alternative is disaster. We will be moving amendments that clearly state our position should we come to government. Make no mistake about our position. There will be a cap at 1,500 gigs on buyback. We will make sure that the operations of the environmental water holder do not disturb the market but, if there is the opportunity at times for water that is not going to be used, that people have the capacity to use that productively. These are the sorts of logical things that have to happen. With a sense of scepticism and erring, we cautiously move forward with this bill.

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2013-02-05,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (12:52):  I rise to speak on the Water Amendment (Water for the Environment Special Account) Bill 2012 as well. This bill has had to be brought forward by the government because the plan that was ticked off by this chamber and by both the government and the coalition did not deliver enough water in order to save the Murray-Darling Basin and restore it to the health that it needs in order to allow communities and the environment to flourish.


Last November the government and the coalition passed the plan. It did not deliver that guaranteed water. In fact, it was a standout failing of the plan, because it started with recovering only 2,750 gigalitres for the environment. When you take into account the adjustment mechanism that will be applied in 2016, that water recovery figure could be even lower than 2,000 gigalitres, which is nowhere near the levels we need in order to save the Murray-Darling Basin and put it on a healthy path to a healthy future. 


The government and the coalition passed the plan last year knowing full well that 2,750 gigalitres would not return enough water to save the river. They knew full well that it would not be enough water to allow the communities that rely on it that certainty that they need. They knew full well that 2,750 gigalitres, as outlined in the plan, would not be enough to secure the water that would be needed during the dry times and when drought comes back. Just as an interesting note, obviously Adelaide relies very heavily on the healthy water flows of the Murray-Darling Basin in coming down to the southern end of the system, and only last week it was recorded that Adelaide's water reservoirs are lower at this time of year than they have been in a decade. So despite all of the rainfall that we have had over the last three years, Adelaide's water security is at higher risk in February than it has been for the last 10 years, and we know that part of the big problem here is that this plan never included any impacts on climate change. We know that the plan does not set the management of the system up for a drying climate and for less water to be available overall in the system.


Knowing this, we had the Prime Minister and the water minister come down to Goolwa in my home state in South Australia in October last year and promise an extra 450 gigalitres. They did not put it in the plan even though we knew that it needed to be benchmarked, that we needed that extra water and it should have been the starting point for how the river would be managed—the amount of water to be returned back to the system. Rather than putting it in the plan, they decided they would leave it out and put in a separate piece of legislation, and that is what we are speaking to today. That extra 450 gigalitres is meant to be the top-up that is needed to reach a figure of 3,200 gigalitres, which is the absolute bare minimum that is needed if we are to save the system.


Australia's top scientists tell us we need 4,000 gigalitres, and yet even with this extra 450, as allocated in this bill, we will not even get to 4,000—we only get to 3,200. But the clincher in all this is that even in this bill, despite the promises from the Prime Minister and the big fanfare about giving extra water--that this was going to be the day that we save the river system—there is no guarantee in this current legislation as it is drafted before us today that that extra 450 gigalitres will even come. It is an aspiration. It is not a gold-clad guarantee. We know that governments like promising things that they then, further down the track, realise that they no longer wish to deliver, which is why we will be moving amendments to this legislation; to guarantee that 450 gigalitres is returned to the river and that we do not have to stick by that pushed-out time frame of 2024. Despite the fact that scientists are telling us we drastically have to manage our water system better, that we need more water allocated to the environment and that we have to give the river back its fair share, there are no guarantees that any of this amount will actually be returned to the river anywhere before 2024—far too late to really save the system.


It has been very disappointing to see how both the government and the coalition have worked together on delivering such a pathetic plan. It does not set the river up for a healthy future. This bill before us does not even have strong enough environmental protections. It allocates $1.8 billion from the Australian taxpayer to the most expensive and least effective water recovery methods, and it puts off finding that water until 2024, which allows for the very dangerous position of that $1.8 billion being frittered away before even reaching the figure of 450 gigalitres. We need to guarantee that that amount will be returned. We need to bring in the time frame so we are not asking communities, such as mine in my home state of South Australia, to wait for another 11 years before the river is given back the water it desperately needs. If we all agree—and the water minister has said that he does, the Prime Minister has said that she does and the Premier of South Australia says that he does—that the absolute minimum amount of water for the river should be 3,200 gigalitres then that is what we should be delivering. If that is the minimum then let us deliver it. Why do we need these get-out clauses and weasel words in the legislation if it is not only to allow the government of the day off the hook if they decide they want to put the interests of big business ahead of the protection of our environment and the water security of our communities?


As I have said, we will be moving amendments. We are willing to work with the government to try to fix this mess. The government agrees that 3,200 gigalitres is what is needed. Let us lock it in, secure it and make sure that Tony Abbott and his coalition cannot fritter it away with their big business mates on day one after the next election. We need to lock this in as a floor.


Let us go to a couple of the specific amendments that we will move when we get to the committee stage in this debate. We know that South Australia suffered terribly during the millennium drought. Many of my South Australian Senate colleagues will probably participate in this debate. I see Minister Wong sitting on the front bench here. Minister Wong understands how vital it is to ensure that South Australia gets this extra water. If we do not get this extra water, if it is not guaranteed, then we will have just wasted five years negotiating the Murray-Darling Basin Plan only to have to revisit it in 10 years time.


We have to lock that figure in. In order to do that we have to insert the words 'at least'. We cannot say 'up to 450 gigalitres'; we need to say 'at least 450 gigalitres' because that is the only way we are going to be able to guarantee that the river gets the water that it actually needs. Our amendments will fix this. We will ensure that we get at least 450 gigalitres. With $1.8 billion of Australian taxpayers' money we can do that. In fact, we have already been doing that. We know that we have been buying significant amounts of water—since 2008 over 1,300 gigalitres have been already returned to the river—so securing at least 450 gigalitres with $1.8 billion will not be very difficult. It can be done. We just need the political will to do it.


We also need to make sure that we are spending this money as wisely as possible, which is why the Greens will be moving amendments in relation to auditing and accountability. $1.8 billion is a lot of money. If we were to buy back those water entitlements, we could be getting four or five times more water for that figure. The way this bill has been structured is to allow $1.8 billion to be spent in the most ineffective and most inefficient way. We need to make sure that there are proper balances and checks to ensure that taxpayers' money is not wasted.


The Greens do not want to see the special account become nothing more than an ATM for big business and foreign owned cotton growers. We do not want to see $1.8 billion of Australian taxpayers' money handed out as sweeteners to the big irrigators in Barnaby Joyce's electorate. We want to make sure that $1.8 billion is actually spent returning the water that the river needs. If we are serious about getting to that 3,200 gigalitre figure then there should be no argument about making sure that those guarantees are locked in.


As I have said many times in this place, we know that buying back water is four to five times more effective than spending the same dollar amount simply on infrastructure that cannot guarantee the volume of water to be returned to the river. When a government buys a water entitlement it knows how much water will be returned. Despite repeated reviews proving this and audits that have shown that you recover less water at a more expensive rate by just spending that money on concrete and pipes rather than on real water, that is not what is currently in this bill, so we need to fix it. Our amendments still leave the government of the day all of the options for different methods of finding water, including on-farm infrastructure, while also reopening the door to buybacks. We know that if we are to return 450 gigalitres it cannot be guaranteed that it is going to be delivered through infrastructure. We need to be able to buy those water entitlements as well.


We are not sure what is going to happen in the future. Scientists are suggesting that the climate is drying and there will be less run-off throughout the system. We need to make sure that we can buy the water back that we need in the most cost-effective and most successful way to ensure that Australian taxpayers are not having their precious money frittered away. Our amendments to this legislation also put more rigorous limits on how saline South Australia's Lower Lakes and Coorong are able to become. We know that this is important because we need proper triggers in order to ensure that the government of the day does act on returning the water that is needed. We know that in the last drought the extremely salty water left native flora and fauna struggling to survive. In fact, a quick visit to the southern lagoon in South Australia's Coorong shows you that, despite more water being in the system over the last few years, the system was so crippled by a lack of water during the drought—massive over allocation throughout the whole system—that the environment just has not been able to recover. It is still struggling to survive. We know that very, very salty water has made our wetlands a breeding ground for tube worms which has obviously made a massive impact on the native flora and fauna, in particular the freshwater turtles that live in the Lower Lakes and along the shores of the Coorong.


We almost lost all of South Australia's local industries and dairy farms during the dry period. We went from 40 farms around the Lower Lakes to now four. It had a crippling impact on the local economy in South Australia. We cannot let this happen again. If this is about setting up a management system for the river for the future—for the river itself and for the environment—to care for the local communities who rely on that healthy system then we need to make sure that these things are locked into legislation. This is why we need salinity targets to be legislated—in law—so that there are no weasel words and ways out just because the government of the day decides that the environment is not that important after all. 


I am guided in this place by my deep concern about the rights of South Australians and our state's passion for the river Murray. We rely on it. We drink its water. Our kids swim in the lakes, paddle in the Coorong and swim in the river. Our industries rely on it. Our local communities desperately need water security—healthy water security. In South Australia we lead the country with our water efficiency targets. We are the driest state in the driest continent on earth, and we have had to learn to use water in the most wise and efficient way. But, despite all of the work that South Australians have put in, we know that the Murray-Darling Basin is managed across the country. South Australia cannot fix this on our own which is why scientists have always argued for the minimum amount of water to be guaranteed by the federal parliament. Three thousand two hundred gigalitres is the absolute bare bones of what needs to be returned. We have already heard that the minister agrees with that. We know that the Prime Minister agrees with that; so let us lock it in. Let us make sure that this is not a promise that will end up being broken. 


I think the idea of the special accounts bill is a good one in order to try and ensure that that happens—that it is locked in. But only if the detail is actually correct. This is why we need those amendments because otherwise it is just a hollow promise and, as we know in this place time and time again, South Australians will continue to miss out once the levels of water in the river drop, once the hard, dry times come back. It is South Australians that will be hung out to dry. I will be moving those amendments when we get to committee stage, and I would also like to indicate that the Greens will not be supporting any of the Coalition's amendments which obviously only serve to undermine this entire process.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2013-02-05,"



Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Minister for Finance and Deregulation) (13:11):  I rise as a senator of South Australia to speak to this bill. For the purposes of making sure the chamber is clear, I am obviously not the minister closing the debate and I think Senator Birmingham would be quite grouchy if I did. Senator Farrell is obviously handling this debate for the government. I did think it was an important bill for me to speak on given the history of this area of policy and the importance of this issue to South Australians. While the health of the Murray River is important to the whole of Australia—and certainly to the eastern seaboard—it is in South Australia that the impact is most acute, and so I am very pleased that we are debating this bill—one more step towards water security for people from my home state. 


As people in the chamber would know, in this last decade we saw the worst drought in the nation's history. The Labor government was elected during this drought crisis and it is probably useful at this point to recall some of the challenges that faced us at that time. It was not only the environment that was suffering; the future of our irrigation communities was also under threat. Consecutive years of low water allocations from 2006-7 onwards—for example, in South Australia's Riverland—risked thousands of hectares of perennial plantings. For rice growers in Deniliquin, the drought resulted in water allocations of zero for two years running. Across the basin water levels were reaching critical lows. From 2007 to 2009, the annual amount of water flowing into the river Murray system for each of those years was just one-fifth of the long-term average. This was the period for most of which I was water minister. Obviously I did not have much luck in getting it to rain. 


Hyper-salinity was affecting aquatic and plant life and changing ecosystems. A lack of water was putting at risk environmental sites across the basin with wetlands being isolated from rivers because of low water levels, and the Murray mouth was closing up. Flows down the river Murray were so limited that silt was not been flushed out to sea, and Goolwa locals could walk across its mouth. Ferry crossings were closed in the Riverland as water levels dropped, and long heat waves were evaporating six to seven billion litres of water each day from the Lower Lakes. Compounding the impacts of the drought, and in spite of multiple warnings from experts over many years, too much water was being taken out of the basin without proper regard for the consequences. Since the 1950s basin governments had tripled the amount of water that they could take out of the system. Old infrastructure which was leaking vital water failed to be replaced as new technologies came online. For too long we allowed the lack of water to stress native wildlife to the point of no repair and to damage valuable ecosystems. For too long the heartache of drought and the uncertainty of water supply placed considerable stress on the many communities which rely on the Murray-Darling. For too long the overallocation of water in the Murray-Darling Basin meant we failed to properly manage our precious water resources, and for far too long governments lacked the courage to secure the Murray's future. They were too timid to find the balance, a fine balance, between what our farmers required and what the environment needed. So over the years we have seen much talk. We have seen promises made and promises broken, and we have seen report after report, but we did not see action. That is why this Labor government made it a priority, where those that preceded us had failed, to action a sustainable path to manage our water and river systems, because, fundamentally, whether it is in this policy area or in terms of our fiscal policy, the onus is on a generation to leave things in good shape.


As a South Australian, and as I think all South Australians in this parliament know, I felt keenly the need for reform of the basin. We could see the effects drought and overallocation were having on the basin in ways many others could not—the strain on the Coorong and the Lower Lakes; concerns over Adelaide's ongoing water supply; the plight of Riverland farmers, who have become as efficient as possible, to make their diminishing water resources stretch further. It was a privilege to serve as water minister for 2½ years; a privilege to take up the fight for basin reform and to start the work to find a position of consensus with the states. It was by no means easy because management of the basin is never the sole responsibility of one government. Governments always need to work together to achieve an enduring solution, bringing together those on opposite ends of the political spectrum, and moving past the 'not in my backyard' approach, which for too long has dominated the politics and policy of the Murray-Darling Basin and consigned the last 100 years of inaction to the records of history.


The Labor government considered finding a solution to the Murray to be one of our most important environmental reforms, and we worked hard to secure agreement of the states to allow the Commonwealth to proceed with cross-border planning, and we got it for the first time in our nation's history. We succeeded in getting this agreement in early 2008, less than six months after coming into office. We created a single agency charged with the responsibility for planning the integrated management of water resources across the basin. The agreement also launched state-led projects, which are now assisting irrigators with the challenge of continuing their ongoing viability with a smaller pool of available water to modernise irrigation systems, develop new technologies or consider different approaches requiring less water. While carrying out these tough and often protracted negotiations with the states we also got on with the job of returning water to the rivers, to return a greater share of water to the basin rivers when it became available. It is never about the health of just one wetland or one particular ecosystem; it is about improving the overall health of the basin. By the eve of the federal election in 2010 federal Labor had purchased over 900 billion litres of water entitlements for the basin's rivers. We did this without resorting to compulsory acquisition because we considered such an action would diminish the property rights of farmers.


There has been criticism on both sides about the pace at which the government carried out water purchasing and the extent to which we did. What I would say is that, without this significant purchase of water entitlements, the implementation of the Basin Plan would have been much harder. If we had not purchased water in those years, the implementation of the plan, which the chamber is debating, would have been much harder. These purchases laid the foundation of lasting reform and demonstrated to communities that an agreement could be done. It would have been made harder had we not undertaken the task of bridging the gap—bridging the gap between the amount of water we take out of the basin and the amount of water the authority determined that the basin needed to survive.


Late last year my colleague and successor as water minister, Tony Burke, signed into law the final Murray-Darling Basin Plan in the presence of the Prime Minister. After 100 years we finally have an agreement to return a stipulated amount of additional water to the environment. I congratulate Minister Burke on this huge achievement. He has delivered what many thought was impossible—a plan for the Murray-Darling Basin. Members on this side of the chamber should be very proud of what has been achieved by this Labor government. We secured in law through the Basin Plan a base amount of 2,750 gigalitres of water for the environment. The government's view was that more should be done in order to ensure greater environmental outcomes. We wanted to maximise those outcomes by delivering additional water but not at the expense of social or economic outcomes.


The bill we are debating here today formalises the Labor government's commitment to deliver an additional 450 gigalitres to the basin. Along with this additional water the government will also fund projects which remove the existing constraints that stop high flows of water being delivered to environmental assets in an efficient way. Constraint removals include actions such as providing for flood easements, securing agreements with landholders or raising bridge heights. To put this plan into action funding of $1.77 billion has been committed from 2014-15. That funding will be contained within a separate account with money appropriated each year, because we believe the setting up of a special account is an important mechanism to ensure a long-term funding stream. It is a long-term funding stream that delivers long-term benefits and ensures that the future health of the basin could not be undermined by governments ransacking its funds to balance its budget. It is a plan that has been carefully designed to recognise the concern of Murray-Darling Basin communities.


I want to respond briefly to comments that Senator Hanson-Young made about water buybacks. I would make the point that this government has to balance not only the environmental outcome but also community outcomes. Whilst it is the case that you could spend the entirety of the money only on water buybacks, that would not give the desired outcome for communities and industries that rely on the rivers and which is in the national interest.


This bill is the final piece of our plan for restoring the basin. Along with the finalised Murray-Darling Basin Plan and the sustainable diversion limit adjustment legislation it sets out our plan to return the basin to health. It is unfortunate, on what should have been an issue worthy of cross-party support, that some of those in the parliament have not engaged to achieve agreement. Clearly those opposite remain divided. The member for Riverina stated: 'It will certainly not get my support. It needs to be discarded because it's poor policy.' The member for Murray, Dr Sharman Stone said: 'I'm going to stand up and say ""no"", and I'm going to try, having said ""no"", when we are in government to start again.'


I do acknowledge that Senator Birmingham with his South Australian colleagues sought to be a voice of reason, but I do make also note of their dubious efforts to claim credit for this reform in the South Australian media. I do remind the chamber that it was not the coalition who negotiated with the states, it was not the coalition who started buying back water and it was not the coalition who delivered a plan for management of the whole basin. In 11 years under Prime Minister Howard the Liberal Party had an opportunity for over a decade to reform their basin. It was only in their last year of office that they finally sought to act.


Then there are, of course, those who seem more interested in protesting than in delivering meaningful change, those who oppose reform on the basis that it does not go far enough. Governing is always about balancing the needs of competing interests, and that is not a concept just applicable to this debate. For the basin there are the competing needs of the environment, irrigation communities and critical human needs or the needs of a state at one end of the vast system to be balanced against the needs of another. To oppose this bill on the grounds that it does not do enough for the basin is to oppose both the greater returns of water to the environment and the security of the funding mechanism proposed. To oppose this bill is to deny farmers in the basin additional funding to improve their water efficiency.


For South Australia and its representatives here in the federal parliament, this is an opportunity to turn around the cumulative inaction of 100 years of decision making. I think South Australians would hope that their parliamentary representatives could vote with one voice in favour of this reform.


If the chamber would indulge me, I do want to makes some comments about the work of many people over successive parliaments who have contributed to this reform like Tony Burke and his staff. I acknowledge the work of Mr Turnbull, the Member for Wentworth, for starting the process of change in 2007 with the first Water Act. For officials in the environment department—the name of which has changed on many occasions—some of whom are here in the chamber today, I thank you for having served the government of the day to deliver a reform that will be looked upon as one of the most significant environmental achievements of our nation. There are many people to acknowledge, but I particularly want to acknowledge the work of officials who served me well in my time as water minister: Robyn Kruk, James Horne, Mike Taylor, Rob Freeman, Mary Harwood, Tony Slatyer and Ian Robinson. To Mike Kelly: I thank him for his work as Parliamentary Secretary for Water to me in my first time as minister. I also thank my personal staff from the previous term of this government who, because of the work they put in place, helped shape the policy we see today and laid down important foundations for long-lasting reform. To Tim Fisher, Don Frater, John Olenich, Samka Thach and Ilsa Colson: your dedication is reflected in this final policy.


We cannot be fooled into thinking that Australia will not enter another period of drought in the near future, and when the next drought comes we need to be better equipped to handle the stress of less water. The best help we can give the environment is through the basin plan and important supporting legislation such as this bill. Successive governments and legislators failed the basin, its environment and its residents for over 100 years, and we are moving on from this disappointing legacy. Water reform has never been an endeavour that can be achieved over the short term. It is multi-government, decadal reform. No-one ever expects—although sometimes the media does—an instantaneous flow of water or wetlands to suddenly spring into life as a result of any one government's actions, but action now will ensure we see results in the future. As parliamentarians we have the enormous privilege of leadership and a great responsibility, and in the future, parliamentarians will also be required to lead and to ensure this plan comes into fruition. The basin plan is the blueprint, but the execution of it, the reality of it, is in the hands of future parliamentarians and future governments, state or federal. I hope that they live up to the expectations not only of Australians but particularly of South Australians from my home state.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (13:26):  Thank you very much Mr Acting Deputy President. It is a pleasure to note that the debate is not being closed and that I do not need to go through the same processes we did at the end of last year in seeking some leave from the chamber to make a contribution as I had to on the basin plan disallowance motion. On that note, it is important to recall where it is that we finished last year, because there has been a lot of action in the water space over the period of months leading up to the end of last year, and of course that continues through to the debate of this bill before the chamber today. It is important to recall that last year both chambers passed amendments to the Water Act; amendments that allowed for the implementation of an adjustment mechanism; a mechanism that will allow greater flexibility in the operation of the sustainable diversion limits set by the basin plan; a mechanism and amendments that were supported by parties across the chamber, through both chambers at that time and that facilitated getting the type of agreement that was necessary between the states and cooperation to finalise the basin plan. I am pleased that the coalition was able to give support to the government and that the government was able to work with states of different political persuasions to construct an adjustment mechanism that achieved that cross-party support.


Most importantly and significantly, at the end of last year both chambers voted down a disallowance motion—voted to reject a motion to disallow the basin plan. The plan was the subject of much of Senator Wong's commentary as it provides the very firm underpinnings and the great basis upon which this bill builds. I gave a speech not dissimilar in some regards to Senator Wong's late last year. I am not going to revisit all of that territory in terms of what happened historically to get us to the point of having that basin plan or the importance that it has to our home state of South Australia, but it is important to note that it is the bedrock that underpins the bill that we are debating today. I do acknowledge the work of Senator Wong amongst many others in getting to that point and in her time as water minister. That is not to say that Senator Wong and I did not have some fierce disagreements in that time and that I do not continue to have policy disagreements with Senator Wong, Mr Burke or the government about the way aspects of water reform are handled. I do think that South Australia should acknowledge that, in the main, its parliamentary representatives, over a significant period of time, in both chambers have come to this place and fought for the interests of their state in getting water reform. But they have done it inside their parties and inside this parliament, and they have had some significant victories as a small state—as the smallest of the mainland states—against some of the larger states to achieve significant reform in that time.


Minister Burke, in speaking on the disallowance motion late last year, acknowledged that the work could be traced back to the Keating government's adoption of some principles through COAG to try to address overallocation. He also rightly acknowledged the very, very important 2004 amendments of the National Water Initiative which finally sought to establish a functioning water market, and that of course then provided a capacity to start looking at how you may deal with issues of overallocation. Then there were the 2007 national reforms of the Howard government that led to the passage of the Water Act itself.


Senator Wong in her remarks, though generously acknowledging me and other South Australian Liberals—and I thank her for that—did equally claim that it was only in the last year of the Howard government that those reforms were passed. I acknowledge that it was only in the last year of the Howard government that the Water Act was passed, but it was with a great deal of work done in advance to set the basis for that. More particularly, I note, that of course it was not the Labor Party's policy at the time for such sweeping national intervention into the Murray-Darling Basin. It was only because John Howard took the brave step of saying that it was time for national management that the federal Labor Party then adopted that as their policy as well. Never before then had we heard federal Labor suggesting that it was going to be their policy. Only thereafter did it become their policy, and even then in the period of time between John Howard's Australia Day announcement in 2007 and the 2007 election it was the Victorian Labor state government that held up reform so very much.


I also note that Senator Wong tried to say that it was not the coalition that delivered the plan with regards to the fact that South Australian Liberal members rightly highlighted to the South Australian electorate the support given by the coalition to the development and establishment of the basin plan. It was the coalition and the Howard government that provided the legislation that made the plan a possibility. It was the coalition and the Howard government that took the brave step of standing up to the states and saying, 'Enough is enough of the state management of the system. We need to have national management.' Given the many failings we have seen of the reform agenda adopted by this government, if that act had not been passed under the Howard government I am far from convinced that it would ever have seen the light of day from those opposite. Again, to remind the chamber, until it was adopted by the Howard government it was never even mooted as a potential Labor Party policy. But I acknowledge that the government finally got a plan in place, and I will turn back to some of the issues around delays and concerns that I have in just a couple of moments perhaps. 


I want to reflect very briefly on Senator Hanson-Young's contribution prior to Senator Wong. I again remind the chamber of what occurred late last year when across the parliament the only party that consistently opposed the adoption of the Basin Plan was the Australian Greens. In this chamber we saw the Greens vote against it, whilst Labor senators, Liberal senators, National Party senators and Senator Xenophon all supported the plan's adoption. Perhaps there were varying degrees of reservation, but all acknowledged that it was an important step forward and that we should not allow the perfect to be the enemy of the good despite our various reservations. It was the Greens that moved a motion in this place to disallow the plan. It was the Greens that voted in the other place—with, yes, a couple of coalition members and Mr Katter—to oppose the Basin Plan. It was perhaps a very strange and eclectic collection of voices against it in the other place. The coalition stood firm to say, 'This is a reform we started, it is a reform we are proud of, and it is a reform we will stand by into the future.' We should not forget that it is the need to make those difficult decisions rather than making sanctimonious speeches sometimes that is important in achieving reform in this place.


Reflecting on the time since we debated that on the last sitting day of last year, I am concerned though that we have not seen further progress in the development and implementation of the Basin Plan and in particular the finalisation of the intergovernmental agreements required for its implementation between the Commonwealth and states. I am concerned that in some ways there seems to be a deafening silence coming from the government at this point in terms of where we are with the finalisation of the Basin Plan's implementation and agreements that need to be struck with the different state governments. 


I do hope that in the closing parts of this debate we will hear from Senator Farrell and that he will be able to tell the chamber just why there seems to be this delay. Or, if I am mistaken, perhaps he will tell us that there is no delay and give us a firm timeline for when we can expect finalisation of the remaining elements around the implementation of this plan. We did see at the time of the release of Basin Plan's Environmental Water Recovery Strategy for the Murray-Darling Basin, a draft of consultation, and I understand that that will form at least part of those discussions with the states as to how the Basin Plan is to be implemented. My concerns about the delays we are seeing are perhaps driven as much by the track record of the government when it comes to delays in this space as by the two months that have elapsed since we saw the disallowance motions rejected in this place. I recall that at the very outset of the life of this government, with the Water Act freshly minted in 2007, it took then Minister Wong 18 months just to appoint the chair and members of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority—a terrible delay right at the outset. I recall that the original timeline was to have the Murray-Darling Basin Plan finalised in 2011 and that we were to have seen a draft of the actual plan before the 2010 federal election. Instead, we did not see a draft of the actual plan before the 2010 federal election, and even after the election all we ended up getting was a guide to the draft, an outline of it, which proved to be one of the very tragic steps in the development of the Basin Plan. We know that it was more than a year after the original deadline was set that we finally saw the finalisation of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. So, once again, delays are proving to be a consistent theme through this important reform under this government, which drives my concern today about the silence from the government since we saw the rejection of the disallowance motions to the Basin Plan and the adoption of the Basin Plan late last year.


On the infrastructure projects side we have the iconic project of fixing the Menindee Lakes, so often talked about as having the potential to allegedly save up to 200 gigalitres of water—a very significant potential reform. In Labor's policy document at the 2007 election it was listed as the top priority amongst their infrastructure projects. Here we are in 2013 and not a single sod of soil has been turned and, as far as I am aware, agreement is something that is still being worked upon. I know there are difficulties with the state government in getting that off the ground. Of course, initial delays did not exactly help in that regard and, perhaps, if agreements had been struck earlier we may have seen action by now. Whether it is that project, the 2008 promise of the Sunraysia modernisation project or the chronic underspending in the budget when it comes to water infrastructure, the government has a track record of just not delivering. It is those delays and those failures to deliver that feed my concern about where the current process may or may not be up to. I do hope that we will see the government drive this hard to ensure that they get the necessary agreements in place rather than allow things to set in and drift, as appears to have happened on far too many previous occasions.


The topic of infrastructure projects allows me to turn to some of the detail of the Water Amendment (Water for the Environment Special Account) Bill 2012 and how it will operate. I think it is fair to say that this is an unusual bill. It is unusual for the chamber and this parliament to appropriate funds so far in advance, and this bill appropriates annual allocations all the way through to 2024. At face value, that is an act that I would have a concern with; however, understanding the interrelationship between this legislation and the Basin Plan I can understand why this step has been taken. The Basin Plan essentially sets out that 2,750 gigalitres of water must be recovered to meet the new targets for sustainable diversion limits. That water simply must be recovered. If governments of either persuasion are to honour the promises that we have all made not to have compulsory acquisitions or the like, we simply have to find the budget to undertake the actions to get to that 2,750 level.


We then have the decision that, despite some changes to the wording of the legislation in the other place, we are going to try to get another 450 gigalitres on top of that to get to a 3,200-gigalitre reduction. To ensure that the government of the day actually does try and actually does have the capacity to get through this process and get to the end of that 450 gigalitres if possible, the money is being set down. Had the 450 gigalitres been included as part of the Basin Plan, and had there actually been a 3,200-gigalitre reduction in the Basin Plan, then, quite clearly, appropriating this money in advance would not have been necessary. But because it is being done as an addendum, as an additional target to try to achieve, I can see that there is some case to budget those funds.


I am not 100 per cent convinced whether the funds in question will prove to be enough, but I note the assurances of the government that it believes the sums do stack up to get a potential 450-gigalitre target. I particularly note, though, that there is a real inconsistency in what Minister Burke argues when it comes to how the 2,750 gigalitres is achieved versus how this 450 gigalitres is achieved. When it comes to the 2,750 gigalitres, the government rejects the cap on buybacks because it says that, basically, you need to maintain the threat of buybacks so as to get the state governments to deliver the water infrastructure projects and ensure that they occur. Yet, when it comes to the 450 gigalitres and this bill before us, it prevents the use of buybacks and says that it must be via infrastructure projects, with some allowances to recover all of the water saved under those infrastructure projects through buybacks. But it requires infrastructure projects in the first place with no threat of buybacks existing as an incentive.


So there is a serious inconsistency in the argument made when Minister Burke or others say they oppose the request of the New South Wales government or the policy proposition of the coalition to cap buybacks and say, 'We will definitely deliver on infrastructure policies and projects'. They seem to argue that cannot possibly be done. And yet when it comes to this legislation, it is very clear that they believe it can be done. So if it can be done for the 450—if you can say that you can get all 450 without recourse to buybacks, that it can be done through infrastructure projects—then very clearly you should be able to do likewise as outlined in the targets of this water recovery strategy. Those targets should be enshrined.


As Senator Wong rightly said today, the reason to reject buybacks across the board—I wish she had done a little more of this as minister—is because you have to balance the environment with the communities. That is why this is so important.


This bill earns the support of the coalition because it balances the environment with the communities. In the end, it makes clear—the government has made clear—that infrastructure comes first to deliver the water savings for the environment; that you try to achieve the win-win outcomes that get water for the environment without decimating the economic fabric or productive capacity of the communities along the way. That is the reason we are supporting this bill. I welcome it as the next step in this process and, of course, welcome here the government perhaps responding to some of the questions I posed.

"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2013-02-05,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia) (13:46):  I rise too to speak on the Water Amendment (Water for the Environment Special Account) Bill 2012. As a South Australian, and as an irrigator, I understand intimately the importance of a healthy river system, with sufficient water flowing into South Australia to ensure our future. One can only hope that if the South Australian environment is healthy then all the environments of the states upstream will be in a similar condition.


We supported the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, when we eventually got it. We supported the adjustment mechanism to allow the moving up and down of the amount of water that will be available, should it be proven that it is insufficient or too much. We will support this bill. But the attitude that you 'just add water' really does need to be looked at a little bit more carefully. In my opinion, it is not about the amount of water or the numbers; it is about where you get the water from and how you use that water once you have it.


We need to be smarter about delivering the best possible outcomes by taking the least amount of water out of productive use, and by having the least amount of impact on the lives and the assets of the people who rely on the river—the people who produce our food and the people who, like everybody else in this state, have a right to be able to earn a living without having something taken away from them unnecessarily. It is not just by innovating and the like for irrigation practices; it is also about being innovative about a broad range of things that we do to ensure that we deliver the best possible outcome for the least amount of negative impact on our communities.


The water delivered by the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, and the additional water that is proposed to be delivered by this bill, does give us a huge opportunity to do much good. We must not waste that opportunity or the water that we are getting. Like so many things, the devil is always in the detail. The ability of the additional water that is identified in this bill to be used effectively will require very, very careful management by those who are entrusted both at a federal level and in the respective states on how they use that water, and what they do with it.


One small example—well, not a small example for the people who were involved—that was highlighted during a Senate hearing into the impacts of the plan was actually raised by the Murray River Action Group. They gave evidence that the impacts of flows of 40,000 megalitres per day in the Kiewa River, upstream from Albury and from releases from the Hume Dam, will have absolutely devastating impacts on their area. We need to remember that these guys are not irrigators, so do not place the blame on irrigators and say, 'Well, you know, the irrigators have taken the water'. These people are actually dryland farmers; they just happen to be in an area where they have had reasonable levels of rainfall so they end up being quite wet dryland farmers. They go on to say in their submission:


Pastures underwater in Spring for long periods of time will result in pastures being totally wiped out for 7 - 8 months at a time …


They refer to the fact that with flows of 40,000 megalitres a day, many bridges and approaches within the district will actually deny access both to their land and their stock.


Obviously, there is an increased risk of exacerbated flood damage. If you are actually doing controlled releases of water at a time that you get high rainfall, then all of a sudden you have turned what was apparently going to be a controlled flood into something that could be entirely devastating to the region. It is not just the things I have said above about loss of access and loss of crop but also loss of livestock.


Another thing: we are talking about looking after the environment. There are huge red gum forests up there, and red gum forests that spend their lives with wet feet, which potentially could happen, actually will die, so we will have a negative environmental impact. That was just one example from a community that is along the Murray-Darling river system.


I suppose one thing that we really do need to note in all this is the issue of compensation. It is not the government that pays compensation; it is actually the taxpayers of Australia who pay that compensation. So we need to be very, very careful that we cover ourselves off and that we do not actually cause a worse set of problems by trying to solve one problem.


That is just one example. Further downstream, the removal of constraints does have the potential to have a major impact. Like a chain, the river is only as strong as its weakest link. By removing these constraints we have a very serious potential that we could cause other problems. I would really like the department to answer, 'Does anybody really know what the impacts of an 80,000 megalitre-a-day flow at the South Australian border is going to mean for the upstream states?'


You have to remember that this water is being released from dams at the top end of the system. It is not just being caused by run-off from rain along the entire river system, so the water is not gathering as it comes down; it is actually one lump that is being let go. Another example is: how are the suggested quantities of water that are coming down from these upstream reservoirs going to get past such natural impediments as the Barmah Choke? All of these issues need to be addressed before we try and stuff all this water down our river corridor. The taxpayers of Australia have stumped up an awful lot of money for this reform package, and they will stump up a whole heap more before it is finished. But already we are starting to see that some of our state governments are seeing it as a way of reducing their commitment to the Murray-Darling Basin Authority. We need to deal with this issue now.


One of the issues that has resulted from this reduction of funding coming out of the states is very close to the heart of many people in South Australia—that is, the Native Fish Strategy. Minister Burke last year announced that the Native Fish Strategy would not be funded from the middle of this year. This has occurred, according to his department, because the state governments have reduced their funding. In particular, he said that New South Wales had reduced its funding, which had normally triggered the dollar-for-dollar funding that would normally go into this strategy; hence, if the New South Wales government and the South Australian governments were not going to put the funding into this strategy then the federal department was not going to either. Given that native fish populations are a true indicator of the health of a river system, surely, with all of this money that the taxpayers of Australia have put up to try and achieve a healthy river system, there is the capacity in the project mix that we have put forward to allow this small amount of money—we are talking a couple of million dollars a year—to continue.


Such a program provides critical support across the whole of the basin—it is not just a state activity—and it delivers a huge amount of positive outcomes for the basin: the restoration of the riverine connectivity, advances in integrated pest management, the delivery of demonstration reaches across the basin, the initiation of knowledge generation projects, the harmonisation of fisheries management and related natural resource regimes, and community education and engagement. Native fish populations and fish communities basin wide remain severely depleted, and to stop this program now just does not make any sense to me. Demonstrably healthy river native fish populations are a key signal to the basin's human communities and the Australian people that the river is healthy and that the management of the river is being effective. So, once again, it is a very easy and effective way for us to check whether the projects being put forward and the delivery of this Basin Plan and its associated instruments are actually working. Achieving a healthy, working Murray-Darling Basin Plan requires a broader focus than just water management. Without the support of these complementary management actions we will be wasting the opportunity to maximise the outcomes of the water that this very bill seeks to deliver.


Another way that we can achieve the best outcomes is through encouragement of innovation. In the electorate in which I live, we have an example where the community has positively embraced the action to look after the river. The Loxton Waikerie council is a small council in the Riverland of South Australia and on their own, off their own bat, they took up the initiative of constructing a 25-megalitre dam in the town of Loxton to capture the town's stormwater. The council hopes that this dam will not just reduce the town's reliance on the Murray for its water but take it completely off the system. A similar project has been planned for Waikerie, the other major town within this council area. This $9.5 million project has significant benefits for the local community. It certainly takes off the draw on the river. It increases the knowledge bank within the community. It increases the capacity of that community to manage flood mitigation during times of high volume, and it also gives them the opportunity to manage their own land management plans in a much more effective and innovative way.


There are myriad projects that we could be looking at that would enable the water that is being recovered here and returned to the river environment to be used and maximised. In South Australia we were lucky enough to get $265 million from the federal government towards a project which has been referred to as the Water Industry Alliance. I would like to acknowledge that eventually, after many, many years of the South Australian community demanding recognition for the fact that they have been the most responsible water users in the basin forever—



Honourable senators interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Ludlam
):  Order, Senators! Senator Ruston still has a few minutes left on the clock. Could we keep the chatter to a minimum.




Senator RUSTON:
  With recognition of the irrigation water efficiency and things like the compliance on the water cap in South Australia, we have been really quite delighted to see that after seven years we have been acknowledged for it. In the acknowledgement of this and the allocation of the $265 million, we have seen the capacity for us to spend money that otherwise would have been allocated to either specific water-saving infrastructure upgrades or water buybacks and put it to better use on projects that will increase the efficiency of agricultural productivity within the region. We are looking forward to seeing the outcome of the process of defining what those projects are through the Water Industry Alliance. The fact that this 450 gigalitres of additional water will not be secured by buyback is a huge relief for the people of South Australia. The plan and this bill are supported because they can do good, and we must make sure that they do do good, by implementing the plan in such a way that the beneficial outcomes are maximised for all stakeholders: the environment, the economy and the river communities that rely on it so heavily.

Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (12:32):  Welcome back, Mr Deputy President, and congratulations, Senator Conroy. There must have been no-one else in the ballot. What we have here before us with the Water Amendment (Water for the Environment Special Account) Bill 2012 is basically a process that the Labor government have used to placate the Greens and to get to a magical number of 3,200 gigs. You can see the authenticity of how much they actually want to achieve this because, in the $1.77 billion that this requires, they have only allocated $50 million over the forward estimates. Therefore, this is more rhetoric than a reality.


As rhetoric, it falls well into line with everything else that has been insufficient about the government's current process in dealing with the water issue—insufficient insofar as we do not have currently a state intergovernmental agreement. They are state assets. We do not know how the states are going to do this. The states have not signed off on anything to do with this. We do not actually have an environmental water plan.


If this is correct, we will have 450 gigs from this, we have got 2,750 from the Basin Plan—there is your magical figure of 3,200 gigs—and we have already received about 962 gigs from the Living Murray and other state based plans. So we have got 4,162 gigs that have been returned to the river, of which 3,200—if you believe this—are going to be managed by the environmental water holder. That is a rather sizeable dam. That is a lot of water. That would be one of the biggest dams in Australia if it were all held in that dam. But what are they going to do with it? How does it actually work? How do they get this water to their assets? Where do they store it? What are the rights of other people near those dams where they store water? What happens if it pushes out the water that is being stored there for irrigation?


In my area, in the north, it is kind of ridiculous, because what they are doing is buying water that would have otherwise gone down the river to the Culgoa floodplain and the Narran lakes. And after they have purchased it, the water will still go down the river to the Culgoa floodplain and the Narran lakes. They are busily buying water that, in some instances, was never going to be used in any case. But, anyway, it helped some people and got them out of some rather large loans with the bank. They have laughed all the way to the bank—and that is fair enough.


This account is part of a rhetorical process more than it is part of an actual process. How are they managing even the water that they have got at the moment? We know from their tests that they have been trying to get water to South Australia but they actually cannot do it because of restrictions. There are so many issues pertaining to this that make it awfully convoluted. It will just become part of this political debate. It is not worth compromising the plan for an addendum which really is of no real consequence, because there is very little money, if any, actually allocated to this over the forward estimates.


As part of this process, the coalition will be looking to move amendments to reinforce our position so that, if we get the honour of becoming the government, the Australian people will have a strong idea about what we intend to do. Our amendments will remove buyback. We do not believe in buyback. We believe that, if you want to get water back into the river, you should do it the clever way. You should be trying to do it through infrastructure, through on-farm works and measures, through using laterals where you can, through more efficient mechanisms of storage and deeper cells. These are the sorts of things that a clever country would do. Just buying back the water and sending towns and communities broke is not clever. We in the coalition, in the National Party and in the Liberal Party, actually rate people above frogs—based on the Maslow hierarchy of needs—and believe that we are actually in this parliament to try as best we can to represent the 2.1 million people who live in the basin and make sure we protect their economic base. We will also be moving an amendment so that it goes back to what it initially said. This initially said 'up to 450 gigalitres' but, of course, that changed. Do you know why it changed? It changed because the Australian Greens wanted it to change. This is part of this 'Captain Chaos' government, which is currently being dispensed by the Australian people—now being dispensed by people on their own side—because, if you try to serve two masters, you end up serving none. In trying to serve the Greens, the right wing of the Labor Party and the left wing of the Labor Party, it has once more managed to create a piece of policy which is merely rhetoric because it discusses something that we have not actually allocated the money for. It talks things way off into the never-never. It talks it in a form where we are currently $262 billion in gross debt, so wherever this money comes from it is only borrowed money. If the nation does not have the money, what are your prospects of getting your hands on the money if we are so far in debt?


The coalition will be moving an amendment—to make sure that we specifically talk about the current process, because this goes back to the plan—to cap buybacks so that they do not go beyond 1,500 gigalitres. I cannot stress that enough. If you are going to steal from a town, you do it by actually taking the water licence off them. Once you take the water licence off them then maybe the farmers would be happy—because they will collect the cheque, go to the coast and live happily ever after—but the tyre business in the town just goes broke. Maybe they go to the bank to borrow $800,000, $900,000, $1 million or $2 million to build a motel, but all of a sudden the economic base of their business, their rug, is pulled out. These people do not get compensated. 


This is why you have to be so careful: because any government that is going to an election talking about economic prudence—talking about having the capacity to get the economy going—is going to look awfully odd if one of its front-and-centre pieces is a policy to actually shut down economies. When you really think about it, the way it is going about this is that it is  borrowing money from overseas. We are in debt by $262 billion, and 86 per cent of that money that we have borrowed comes in from overseas—from the good people of China and from the people in the Middle-East. All of these prudent people saving their money send it over to us because we cannot make our incomes meet our expenses and our debt gets bigger and bigger—we borrowed in excess of $2 billion last week—and ultimately we have to pay these people back. But when you think about it, when you really drill down to it, we are borrowing money from overseas not to create a productive asset that can pay things off—not to actually build a new factory or a new dam or to increase our capacity to meet our debts. We are borrowing money from overseas to shut the factories down and to shut the towns down. It is a double whammy. We are borrowing the money and we are reducing the size of the economic component that is supposed to pay it off. It is a very, very strange and peculiar thing. It is a job for Inspector Clouseau, something we must investigate more closely. It needs a rather large magnifying glass to work out why we are doing this. 


But we have always said that it is for the environment. Of course people say: 'Well, it's your policy. It's the coalition's policy'. The difference is that we brought this policy about when we actually had money in the bank. That is the difference. Now we do not have money in the bank; we just have massive debts. We are very mindful of the fact that, yes, we must deal with the environmental issue where that was pertinent, but we must not deal with it in a way that destroys the economic fabric of the 2.1 million people living in the basin. We are very aware of and very alive to issues such as the 600 dairy farmers that turned up in Victoria the other day—we are very alive to that. We are very alive to what the pressures are on these people's lives. One is the overcentralisation of the retail market and the fact that they are being exploited by dollar-a-litre milk—we acknowledge that. Another thing is that we have this crazy policy where the government is now basically going into areas and buying out the water, becoming the biggest competitor in their own water market, shutting down their towns and putting extra pressure on them because of a fascination with frogs and moths. We will be part of this process, but we will not do it to the extent that it creates a mechanism for the destruction of the communities that we are supposed to represent and it becomes symbolic of a process that shows that you have no economic credibility whatsoever in that you were going to areas to shut economies down rather than build them up.


In showing a process of cautiously working with the government and in close discussions with our state colleagues, we will go down this path, but we will do it in such a way that we will be moving amendments to clearly show to the Australian people what our views are on this issue. There really needs to be a lot more work that goes into this whole plan. It is a plan that, in some areas, is completely incongruous to the outcome. There is no water. We are probably going to be ending up with about 150,000 to 180,000 megalitres per day going through St George. I can assure you that that water will never, ever get to South Australia—not a chance. Some of it may get to the Menindee storage lakes. There was this view at the start of this debate that Australia was this interconnected garden hose where, if you just tip a bit of water in at Toowoomba and wait long enough, it arrives at the Lower Lakes. That is an absurdity. As I said at the start of this debate some years ago, it is a big old dry carpet. This plan does not properly reflect the hydrology of it. The latest tests that they have done in trying  to move and shepherd water have emphasised quite clearly the impracticalities of trying to shepherd water, whether it is from Copeton Dam in northern New South Wales or, even more ridiculously, virtually from central Queensland down to South Australia. It is just impractical; it will not do it. What really were the issues that we were trying to address with this? How did we get ourselves into a position where we are so far down the track? When are we actually going to see an environmental watering plan? When is this document going to turn up? Why is it that we have been in a position where the biggest irrigator with the biggest water asset in our nation will now be the government? Others may be irrigating things that actually produce money, whether it is cotton or rice or apricots or apples or onions or potatoes, but the government are going to be watering swamps and forests and moss. That is marvellous, but the government are now the biggest irrigator and the water asset that they have on the books would be the biggest water asset held by anybody. It is a massive asset. But you do not get any sense of comfort when you think, therefore, that these people better be absolutely competent and on their game. What sense of competence do you get from a government when you find out that they bought a property, Toorale Station, near Bourke, and the Commonwealth taxpayer shelled out $23.75 million. The closest that this government ever got to that place was 30,000 feet on their way to Darwin. They never set foot on it.


The story goes that this place was going to auction and someone from the government rang up and said: 'We may have an interest in that place. What is your reserve?' The sellers said, 'We do not tell you the reserve before we sell a place.' I know that Senator Fifield, who used to work in the Treasurer's office, will be fascinated by this. The government said, 'We are really interested.' They went back and had a meeting and said, 'The government has just rung up and wants to buy Toorale, wants us to tell them the reserve.' The bloke said, 'Tell them to go jump.' Anyway, the number they actually had in mind was $16 million but they said, 'If they ring back, just say 23.' Guess what! They rang back and said, 'It is 23.' They thought they would drive a really hard deal. So do you know what they said then? They said, 'But it has still got cattle on it.' They said, 'They have to go and that will cost more.' So it cost the Australian taxpayer $750,000 to remove the Commonwealth's stock off their own place and have them sold.




Senator Nash:
  It is ludicrous.




Senator JOYCE:
  It is. These people are running the country. They say, 'Oh, this is a one-off.' They cannot possibly have bought the place without seeing it. Well, they did. At that stage the minister was Penny Wong. She only turns up once in your life and when she turns up you just have to make the most of her! Then the government came back into the market because after Toorale they went and bought Twynam's water from Johnny Kahlbetzer. I went to college with him. He is a clever man. They bought all his water licences, the whole $303 million. There were other people in tenders up and down, offering it cheaper. But this is the government and this is why the government are so far in debt. This is why I have no confidence whatsoever that these people will be competent enough to complete on this plan.


We started this process in good faith, that there was an environmental issue there and we would try as best we could to address it. We put the money on the table when we had money in the bank. We knew full well from the word go that, if the coalition were not at the table, this rambling disorderly nonsense which is apparently standing in proxy for a government instead of talking to us would talk to the Greens. You will see one of these amendments coming up: rather than saying they want 'up to', they want a minimum of 450 gigs from this. That is what we would have to contend with. They said at the start they wanted in excess of 7,000 gigs to be taken out of communities and put back into the environment. That would absolutely decimate the Murray-Darling Basin. They were kicking and screaming, they were never happy.


It was force majeure for us because we knew full well, if we were not the participants to try and placate the excesses of this ludicrous scheme, who would be doing it—the Australian Greens, as orchestrated from inner suburban Adelaide. That would have not been doing the right thing by our people, by those 600 dairy farmers who were protesting the other day, by the people of Bourke, by the people of Parkes, by the people of Goondiwindi, by the people of St George, where I live. This river goes literally past my front door. I can throw a rock from my front yard into the river without much effort whatsoever. In fact, in a couple of days I will be able to almost kick it into the river.


To be honest, we are extremely reluctant participants in an incompetent government, but we do it because we know that the alternative is disaster. We will be moving amendments that clearly state our position should we come to government. Make no mistake about our position. There will be a cap at 1,500 gigs on buyback. We will make sure that the operations of the environmental water holder do not disturb the market but, if there is the opportunity at times for water that is not going to be used, that people have the capacity to use that productively. These are the sorts of logical things that have to happen. With a sense of scepticism and erring, we cautiously move forward with this bill.

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2013-02-05,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (12:52):  I rise to speak on the Water Amendment (Water for the Environment Special Account) Bill 2012 as well. This bill has had to be brought forward by the government because the plan that was ticked off by this chamber and by both the government and the coalition did not deliver enough water in order to save the Murray-Darling Basin and restore it to the health that it needs in order to allow communities and the environment to flourish.


Last November the government and the coalition passed the plan. It did not deliver that guaranteed water. In fact, it was a standout failing of the plan, because it started with recovering only 2,750 gigalitres for the environment. When you take into account the adjustment mechanism that will be applied in 2016, that water recovery figure could be even lower than 2,000 gigalitres, which is nowhere near the levels we need in order to save the Murray-Darling Basin and put it on a healthy path to a healthy future. 


The government and the coalition passed the plan last year knowing full well that 2,750 gigalitres would not return enough water to save the river. They knew full well that it would not be enough water to allow the communities that rely on it that certainty that they need. They knew full well that 2,750 gigalitres, as outlined in the plan, would not be enough to secure the water that would be needed during the dry times and when drought comes back. Just as an interesting note, obviously Adelaide relies very heavily on the healthy water flows of the Murray-Darling Basin in coming down to the southern end of the system, and only last week it was recorded that Adelaide's water reservoirs are lower at this time of year than they have been in a decade. So despite all of the rainfall that we have had over the last three years, Adelaide's water security is at higher risk in February than it has been for the last 10 years, and we know that part of the big problem here is that this plan never included any impacts on climate change. We know that the plan does not set the management of the system up for a drying climate and for less water to be available overall in the system.


Knowing this, we had the Prime Minister and the water minister come down to Goolwa in my home state in South Australia in October last year and promise an extra 450 gigalitres. They did not put it in the plan even though we knew that it needed to be benchmarked, that we needed that extra water and it should have been the starting point for how the river would be managed—the amount of water to be returned back to the system. Rather than putting it in the plan, they decided they would leave it out and put in a separate piece of legislation, and that is what we are speaking to today. That extra 450 gigalitres is meant to be the top-up that is needed to reach a figure of 3,200 gigalitres, which is the absolute bare minimum that is needed if we are to save the system.


Australia's top scientists tell us we need 4,000 gigalitres, and yet even with this extra 450, as allocated in this bill, we will not even get to 4,000—we only get to 3,200. But the clincher in all this is that even in this bill, despite the promises from the Prime Minister and the big fanfare about giving extra water--that this was going to be the day that we save the river system—there is no guarantee in this current legislation as it is drafted before us today that that extra 450 gigalitres will even come. It is an aspiration. It is not a gold-clad guarantee. We know that governments like promising things that they then, further down the track, realise that they no longer wish to deliver, which is why we will be moving amendments to this legislation; to guarantee that 450 gigalitres is returned to the river and that we do not have to stick by that pushed-out time frame of 2024. Despite the fact that scientists are telling us we drastically have to manage our water system better, that we need more water allocated to the environment and that we have to give the river back its fair share, there are no guarantees that any of this amount will actually be returned to the river anywhere before 2024—far too late to really save the system.


It has been very disappointing to see how both the government and the coalition have worked together on delivering such a pathetic plan. It does not set the river up for a healthy future. This bill before us does not even have strong enough environmental protections. It allocates $1.8 billion from the Australian taxpayer to the most expensive and least effective water recovery methods, and it puts off finding that water until 2024, which allows for the very dangerous position of that $1.8 billion being frittered away before even reaching the figure of 450 gigalitres. We need to guarantee that that amount will be returned. We need to bring in the time frame so we are not asking communities, such as mine in my home state of South Australia, to wait for another 11 years before the river is given back the water it desperately needs. If we all agree—and the water minister has said that he does, the Prime Minister has said that she does and the Premier of South Australia says that he does—that the absolute minimum amount of water for the river should be 3,200 gigalitres then that is what we should be delivering. If that is the minimum then let us deliver it. Why do we need these get-out clauses and weasel words in the legislation if it is not only to allow the government of the day off the hook if they decide they want to put the interests of big business ahead of the protection of our environment and the water security of our communities?


As I have said, we will be moving amendments. We are willing to work with the government to try to fix this mess. The government agrees that 3,200 gigalitres is what is needed. Let us lock it in, secure it and make sure that Tony Abbott and his coalition cannot fritter it away with their big business mates on day one after the next election. We need to lock this in as a floor.


Let us go to a couple of the specific amendments that we will move when we get to the committee stage in this debate. We know that South Australia suffered terribly during the millennium drought. Many of my South Australian Senate colleagues will probably participate in this debate. I see Minister Wong sitting on the front bench here. Minister Wong understands how vital it is to ensure that South Australia gets this extra water. If we do not get this extra water, if it is not guaranteed, then we will have just wasted five years negotiating the Murray-Darling Basin Plan only to have to revisit it in 10 years time.


We have to lock that figure in. In order to do that we have to insert the words 'at least'. We cannot say 'up to 450 gigalitres'; we need to say 'at least 450 gigalitres' because that is the only way we are going to be able to guarantee that the river gets the water that it actually needs. Our amendments will fix this. We will ensure that we get at least 450 gigalitres. With $1.8 billion of Australian taxpayers' money we can do that. In fact, we have already been doing that. We know that we have been buying significant amounts of water—since 2008 over 1,300 gigalitres have been already returned to the river—so securing at least 450 gigalitres with $1.8 billion will not be very difficult. It can be done. We just need the political will to do it.


We also need to make sure that we are spending this money as wisely as possible, which is why the Greens will be moving amendments in relation to auditing and accountability. $1.8 billion is a lot of money. If we were to buy back those water entitlements, we could be getting four or five times more water for that figure. The way this bill has been structured is to allow $1.8 billion to be spent in the most ineffective and most inefficient way. We need to make sure that there are proper balances and checks to ensure that taxpayers' money is not wasted.


The Greens do not want to see the special account become nothing more than an ATM for big business and foreign owned cotton growers. We do not want to see $1.8 billion of Australian taxpayers' money handed out as sweeteners to the big irrigators in Barnaby Joyce's electorate. We want to make sure that $1.8 billion is actually spent returning the water that the river needs. If we are serious about getting to that 3,200 gigalitre figure then there should be no argument about making sure that those guarantees are locked in.


As I have said many times in this place, we know that buying back water is four to five times more effective than spending the same dollar amount simply on infrastructure that cannot guarantee the volume of water to be returned to the river. When a government buys a water entitlement it knows how much water will be returned. Despite repeated reviews proving this and audits that have shown that you recover less water at a more expensive rate by just spending that money on concrete and pipes rather than on real water, that is not what is currently in this bill, so we need to fix it. Our amendments still leave the government of the day all of the options for different methods of finding water, including on-farm infrastructure, while also reopening the door to buybacks. We know that if we are to return 450 gigalitres it cannot be guaranteed that it is going to be delivered through infrastructure. We need to be able to buy those water entitlements as well.


We are not sure what is going to happen in the future. Scientists are suggesting that the climate is drying and there will be less run-off throughout the system. We need to make sure that we can buy the water back that we need in the most cost-effective and most successful way to ensure that Australian taxpayers are not having their precious money frittered away. Our amendments to this legislation also put more rigorous limits on how saline South Australia's Lower Lakes and Coorong are able to become. We know that this is important because we need proper triggers in order to ensure that the government of the day does act on returning the water that is needed. We know that in the last drought the extremely salty water left native flora and fauna struggling to survive. In fact, a quick visit to the southern lagoon in South Australia's Coorong shows you that, despite more water being in the system over the last few years, the system was so crippled by a lack of water during the drought—massive over allocation throughout the whole system—that the environment just has not been able to recover. It is still struggling to survive. We know that very, very salty water has made our wetlands a breeding ground for tube worms which has obviously made a massive impact on the native flora and fauna, in particular the freshwater turtles that live in the Lower Lakes and along the shores of the Coorong.


We almost lost all of South Australia's local industries and dairy farms during the dry period. We went from 40 farms around the Lower Lakes to now four. It had a crippling impact on the local economy in South Australia. We cannot let this happen again. If this is about setting up a management system for the river for the future—for the river itself and for the environment—to care for the local communities who rely on that healthy system then we need to make sure that these things are locked into legislation. This is why we need salinity targets to be legislated—in law—so that there are no weasel words and ways out just because the government of the day decides that the environment is not that important after all. 


I am guided in this place by my deep concern about the rights of South Australians and our state's passion for the river Murray. We rely on it. We drink its water. Our kids swim in the lakes, paddle in the Coorong and swim in the river. Our industries rely on it. Our local communities desperately need water security—healthy water security. In South Australia we lead the country with our water efficiency targets. We are the driest state in the driest continent on earth, and we have had to learn to use water in the most wise and efficient way. But, despite all of the work that South Australians have put in, we know that the Murray-Darling Basin is managed across the country. South Australia cannot fix this on our own which is why scientists have always argued for the minimum amount of water to be guaranteed by the federal parliament. Three thousand two hundred gigalitres is the absolute bare bones of what needs to be returned. We have already heard that the minister agrees with that. We know that the Prime Minister agrees with that; so let us lock it in. Let us make sure that this is not a promise that will end up being broken. 


I think the idea of the special accounts bill is a good one in order to try and ensure that that happens—that it is locked in. But only if the detail is actually correct. This is why we need those amendments because otherwise it is just a hollow promise and, as we know in this place time and time again, South Australians will continue to miss out once the levels of water in the river drop, once the hard, dry times come back. It is South Australians that will be hung out to dry. I will be moving those amendments when we get to committee stage, and I would also like to indicate that the Greens will not be supporting any of the Coalition's amendments which obviously only serve to undermine this entire process.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2013-02-05,"



Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Minister for Finance and Deregulation) (13:11):  I rise as a senator of South Australia to speak to this bill. For the purposes of making sure the chamber is clear, I am obviously not the minister closing the debate and I think Senator Birmingham would be quite grouchy if I did. Senator Farrell is obviously handling this debate for the government. I did think it was an important bill for me to speak on given the history of this area of policy and the importance of this issue to South Australians. While the health of the Murray River is important to the whole of Australia—and certainly to the eastern seaboard—it is in South Australia that the impact is most acute, and so I am very pleased that we are debating this bill—one more step towards water security for people from my home state. 


As people in the chamber would know, in this last decade we saw the worst drought in the nation's history. The Labor government was elected during this drought crisis and it is probably useful at this point to recall some of the challenges that faced us at that time. It was not only the environment that was suffering; the future of our irrigation communities was also under threat. Consecutive years of low water allocations from 2006-7 onwards—for example, in South Australia's Riverland—risked thousands of hectares of perennial plantings. For rice growers in Deniliquin, the drought resulted in water allocations of zero for two years running. Across the basin water levels were reaching critical lows. From 2007 to 2009, the annual amount of water flowing into the river Murray system for each of those years was just one-fifth of the long-term average. This was the period for most of which I was water minister. Obviously I did not have much luck in getting it to rain. 


Hyper-salinity was affecting aquatic and plant life and changing ecosystems. A lack of water was putting at risk environmental sites across the basin with wetlands being isolated from rivers because of low water levels, and the Murray mouth was closing up. Flows down the river Murray were so limited that silt was not been flushed out to sea, and Goolwa locals could walk across its mouth. Ferry crossings were closed in the Riverland as water levels dropped, and long heat waves were evaporating six to seven billion litres of water each day from the Lower Lakes. Compounding the impacts of the drought, and in spite of multiple warnings from experts over many years, too much water was being taken out of the basin without proper regard for the consequences. Since the 1950s basin governments had tripled the amount of water that they could take out of the system. Old infrastructure which was leaking vital water failed to be replaced as new technologies came online. For too long we allowed the lack of water to stress native wildlife to the point of no repair and to damage valuable ecosystems. For too long the heartache of drought and the uncertainty of water supply placed considerable stress on the many communities which rely on the Murray-Darling. For too long the overallocation of water in the Murray-Darling Basin meant we failed to properly manage our precious water resources, and for far too long governments lacked the courage to secure the Murray's future. They were too timid to find the balance, a fine balance, between what our farmers required and what the environment needed. So over the years we have seen much talk. We have seen promises made and promises broken, and we have seen report after report, but we did not see action. That is why this Labor government made it a priority, where those that preceded us had failed, to action a sustainable path to manage our water and river systems, because, fundamentally, whether it is in this policy area or in terms of our fiscal policy, the onus is on a generation to leave things in good shape.


As a South Australian, and as I think all South Australians in this parliament know, I felt keenly the need for reform of the basin. We could see the effects drought and overallocation were having on the basin in ways many others could not—the strain on the Coorong and the Lower Lakes; concerns over Adelaide's ongoing water supply; the plight of Riverland farmers, who have become as efficient as possible, to make their diminishing water resources stretch further. It was a privilege to serve as water minister for 2½ years; a privilege to take up the fight for basin reform and to start the work to find a position of consensus with the states. It was by no means easy because management of the basin is never the sole responsibility of one government. Governments always need to work together to achieve an enduring solution, bringing together those on opposite ends of the political spectrum, and moving past the 'not in my backyard' approach, which for too long has dominated the politics and policy of the Murray-Darling Basin and consigned the last 100 years of inaction to the records of history.


The Labor government considered finding a solution to the Murray to be one of our most important environmental reforms, and we worked hard to secure agreement of the states to allow the Commonwealth to proceed with cross-border planning, and we got it for the first time in our nation's history. We succeeded in getting this agreement in early 2008, less than six months after coming into office. We created a single agency charged with the responsibility for planning the integrated management of water resources across the basin. The agreement also launched state-led projects, which are now assisting irrigators with the challenge of continuing their ongoing viability with a smaller pool of available water to modernise irrigation systems, develop new technologies or consider different approaches requiring less water. While carrying out these tough and often protracted negotiations with the states we also got on with the job of returning water to the rivers, to return a greater share of water to the basin rivers when it became available. It is never about the health of just one wetland or one particular ecosystem; it is about improving the overall health of the basin. By the eve of the federal election in 2010 federal Labor had purchased over 900 billion litres of water entitlements for the basin's rivers. We did this without resorting to compulsory acquisition because we considered such an action would diminish the property rights of farmers.


There has been criticism on both sides about the pace at which the government carried out water purchasing and the extent to which we did. What I would say is that, without this significant purchase of water entitlements, the implementation of the Basin Plan would have been much harder. If we had not purchased water in those years, the implementation of the plan, which the chamber is debating, would have been much harder. These purchases laid the foundation of lasting reform and demonstrated to communities that an agreement could be done. It would have been made harder had we not undertaken the task of bridging the gap—bridging the gap between the amount of water we take out of the basin and the amount of water the authority determined that the basin needed to survive.


Late last year my colleague and successor as water minister, Tony Burke, signed into law the final Murray-Darling Basin Plan in the presence of the Prime Minister. After 100 years we finally have an agreement to return a stipulated amount of additional water to the environment. I congratulate Minister Burke on this huge achievement. He has delivered what many thought was impossible—a plan for the Murray-Darling Basin. Members on this side of the chamber should be very proud of what has been achieved by this Labor government. We secured in law through the Basin Plan a base amount of 2,750 gigalitres of water for the environment. The government's view was that more should be done in order to ensure greater environmental outcomes. We wanted to maximise those outcomes by delivering additional water but not at the expense of social or economic outcomes.


The bill we are debating here today formalises the Labor government's commitment to deliver an additional 450 gigalitres to the basin. Along with this additional water the government will also fund projects which remove the existing constraints that stop high flows of water being delivered to environmental assets in an efficient way. Constraint removals include actions such as providing for flood easements, securing agreements with landholders or raising bridge heights. To put this plan into action funding of $1.77 billion has been committed from 2014-15. That funding will be contained within a separate account with money appropriated each year, because we believe the setting up of a special account is an important mechanism to ensure a long-term funding stream. It is a long-term funding stream that delivers long-term benefits and ensures that the future health of the basin could not be undermined by governments ransacking its funds to balance its budget. It is a plan that has been carefully designed to recognise the concern of Murray-Darling Basin communities.


I want to respond briefly to comments that Senator Hanson-Young made about water buybacks. I would make the point that this government has to balance not only the environmental outcome but also community outcomes. Whilst it is the case that you could spend the entirety of the money only on water buybacks, that would not give the desired outcome for communities and industries that rely on the rivers and which is in the national interest.


This bill is the final piece of our plan for restoring the basin. Along with the finalised Murray-Darling Basin Plan and the sustainable diversion limit adjustment legislation it sets out our plan to return the basin to health. It is unfortunate, on what should have been an issue worthy of cross-party support, that some of those in the parliament have not engaged to achieve agreement. Clearly those opposite remain divided. The member for Riverina stated: 'It will certainly not get my support. It needs to be discarded because it's poor policy.' The member for Murray, Dr Sharman Stone said: 'I'm going to stand up and say ""no"", and I'm going to try, having said ""no"", when we are in government to start again.'


I do acknowledge that Senator Birmingham with his South Australian colleagues sought to be a voice of reason, but I do make also note of their dubious efforts to claim credit for this reform in the South Australian media. I do remind the chamber that it was not the coalition who negotiated with the states, it was not the coalition who started buying back water and it was not the coalition who delivered a plan for management of the whole basin. In 11 years under Prime Minister Howard the Liberal Party had an opportunity for over a decade to reform their basin. It was only in their last year of office that they finally sought to act.


Then there are, of course, those who seem more interested in protesting than in delivering meaningful change, those who oppose reform on the basis that it does not go far enough. Governing is always about balancing the needs of competing interests, and that is not a concept just applicable to this debate. For the basin there are the competing needs of the environment, irrigation communities and critical human needs or the needs of a state at one end of the vast system to be balanced against the needs of another. To oppose this bill on the grounds that it does not do enough for the basin is to oppose both the greater returns of water to the environment and the security of the funding mechanism proposed. To oppose this bill is to deny farmers in the basin additional funding to improve their water efficiency.


For South Australia and its representatives here in the federal parliament, this is an opportunity to turn around the cumulative inaction of 100 years of decision making. I think South Australians would hope that their parliamentary representatives could vote with one voice in favour of this reform.


If the chamber would indulge me, I do want to makes some comments about the work of many people over successive parliaments who have contributed to this reform like Tony Burke and his staff. I acknowledge the work of Mr Turnbull, the Member for Wentworth, for starting the process of change in 2007 with the first Water Act. For officials in the environment department—the name of which has changed on many occasions—some of whom are here in the chamber today, I thank you for having served the government of the day to deliver a reform that will be looked upon as one of the most significant environmental achievements of our nation. There are many people to acknowledge, but I particularly want to acknowledge the work of officials who served me well in my time as water minister: Robyn Kruk, James Horne, Mike Taylor, Rob Freeman, Mary Harwood, Tony Slatyer and Ian Robinson. To Mike Kelly: I thank him for his work as Parliamentary Secretary for Water to me in my first time as minister. I also thank my personal staff from the previous term of this government who, because of the work they put in place, helped shape the policy we see today and laid down important foundations for long-lasting reform. To Tim Fisher, Don Frater, John Olenich, Samka Thach and Ilsa Colson: your dedication is reflected in this final policy.


We cannot be fooled into thinking that Australia will not enter another period of drought in the near future, and when the next drought comes we need to be better equipped to handle the stress of less water. The best help we can give the environment is through the basin plan and important supporting legislation such as this bill. Successive governments and legislators failed the basin, its environment and its residents for over 100 years, and we are moving on from this disappointing legacy. Water reform has never been an endeavour that can be achieved over the short term. It is multi-government, decadal reform. No-one ever expects—although sometimes the media does—an instantaneous flow of water or wetlands to suddenly spring into life as a result of any one government's actions, but action now will ensure we see results in the future. As parliamentarians we have the enormous privilege of leadership and a great responsibility, and in the future, parliamentarians will also be required to lead and to ensure this plan comes into fruition. The basin plan is the blueprint, but the execution of it, the reality of it, is in the hands of future parliamentarians and future governments, state or federal. I hope that they live up to the expectations not only of Australians but particularly of South Australians from my home state.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (13:26):  Thank you very much Mr Acting Deputy President. It is a pleasure to note that the debate is not being closed and that I do not need to go through the same processes we did at the end of last year in seeking some leave from the chamber to make a contribution as I had to on the basin plan disallowance motion. On that note, it is important to recall where it is that we finished last year, because there has been a lot of action in the water space over the period of months leading up to the end of last year, and of course that continues through to the debate of this bill before the chamber today. It is important to recall that last year both chambers passed amendments to the Water Act; amendments that allowed for the implementation of an adjustment mechanism; a mechanism that will allow greater flexibility in the operation of the sustainable diversion limits set by the basin plan; a mechanism and amendments that were supported by parties across the chamber, through both chambers at that time and that facilitated getting the type of agreement that was necessary between the states and cooperation to finalise the basin plan. I am pleased that the coalition was able to give support to the government and that the government was able to work with states of different political persuasions to construct an adjustment mechanism that achieved that cross-party support.


Most importantly and significantly, at the end of last year both chambers voted down a disallowance motion—voted to reject a motion to disallow the basin plan. The plan was the subject of much of Senator Wong's commentary as it provides the very firm underpinnings and the great basis upon which this bill builds. I gave a speech not dissimilar in some regards to Senator Wong's late last year. I am not going to revisit all of that territory in terms of what happened historically to get us to the point of having that basin plan or the importance that it has to our home state of South Australia, but it is important to note that it is the bedrock that underpins the bill that we are debating today. I do acknowledge the work of Senator Wong amongst many others in getting to that point and in her time as water minister. That is not to say that Senator Wong and I did not have some fierce disagreements in that time and that I do not continue to have policy disagreements with Senator Wong, Mr Burke or the government about the way aspects of water reform are handled. I do think that South Australia should acknowledge that, in the main, its parliamentary representatives, over a significant period of time, in both chambers have come to this place and fought for the interests of their state in getting water reform. But they have done it inside their parties and inside this parliament, and they have had some significant victories as a small state—as the smallest of the mainland states—against some of the larger states to achieve significant reform in that time.


Minister Burke, in speaking on the disallowance motion late last year, acknowledged that the work could be traced back to the Keating government's adoption of some principles through COAG to try to address overallocation. He also rightly acknowledged the very, very important 2004 amendments of the National Water Initiative which finally sought to establish a functioning water market, and that of course then provided a capacity to start looking at how you may deal with issues of overallocation. Then there were the 2007 national reforms of the Howard government that led to the passage of the Water Act itself.


Senator Wong in her remarks, though generously acknowledging me and other South Australian Liberals—and I thank her for that—did equally claim that it was only in the last year of the Howard government that those reforms were passed. I acknowledge that it was only in the last year of the Howard government that the Water Act was passed, but it was with a great deal of work done in advance to set the basis for that. More particularly, I note, that of course it was not the Labor Party's policy at the time for such sweeping national intervention into the Murray-Darling Basin. It was only because John Howard took the brave step of saying that it was time for national management that the federal Labor Party then adopted that as their policy as well. Never before then had we heard federal Labor suggesting that it was going to be their policy. Only thereafter did it become their policy, and even then in the period of time between John Howard's Australia Day announcement in 2007 and the 2007 election it was the Victorian Labor state government that held up reform so very much.


I also note that Senator Wong tried to say that it was not the coalition that delivered the plan with regards to the fact that South Australian Liberal members rightly highlighted to the South Australian electorate the support given by the coalition to the development and establishment of the basin plan. It was the coalition and the Howard government that provided the legislation that made the plan a possibility. It was the coalition and the Howard government that took the brave step of standing up to the states and saying, 'Enough is enough of the state management of the system. We need to have national management.' Given the many failings we have seen of the reform agenda adopted by this government, if that act had not been passed under the Howard government I am far from convinced that it would ever have seen the light of day from those opposite. Again, to remind the chamber, until it was adopted by the Howard government it was never even mooted as a potential Labor Party policy. But I acknowledge that the government finally got a plan in place, and I will turn back to some of the issues around delays and concerns that I have in just a couple of moments perhaps. 


I want to reflect very briefly on Senator Hanson-Young's contribution prior to Senator Wong. I again remind the chamber of what occurred late last year when across the parliament the only party that consistently opposed the adoption of the Basin Plan was the Australian Greens. In this chamber we saw the Greens vote against it, whilst Labor senators, Liberal senators, National Party senators and Senator Xenophon all supported the plan's adoption. Perhaps there were varying degrees of reservation, but all acknowledged that it was an important step forward and that we should not allow the perfect to be the enemy of the good despite our various reservations. It was the Greens that moved a motion in this place to disallow the plan. It was the Greens that voted in the other place—with, yes, a couple of coalition members and Mr Katter—to oppose the Basin Plan. It was perhaps a very strange and eclectic collection of voices against it in the other place. The coalition stood firm to say, 'This is a reform we started, it is a reform we are proud of, and it is a reform we will stand by into the future.' We should not forget that it is the need to make those difficult decisions rather than making sanctimonious speeches sometimes that is important in achieving reform in this place.


Reflecting on the time since we debated that on the last sitting day of last year, I am concerned though that we have not seen further progress in the development and implementation of the Basin Plan and in particular the finalisation of the intergovernmental agreements required for its implementation between the Commonwealth and states. I am concerned that in some ways there seems to be a deafening silence coming from the government at this point in terms of where we are with the finalisation of the Basin Plan's implementation and agreements that need to be struck with the different state governments. 


I do hope that in the closing parts of this debate we will hear from Senator Farrell and that he will be able to tell the chamber just why there seems to be this delay. Or, if I am mistaken, perhaps he will tell us that there is no delay and give us a firm timeline for when we can expect finalisation of the remaining elements around the implementation of this plan. We did see at the time of the release of Basin Plan's Environmental Water Recovery Strategy for the Murray-Darling Basin, a draft of consultation, and I understand that that will form at least part of those discussions with the states as to how the Basin Plan is to be implemented. My concerns about the delays we are seeing are perhaps driven as much by the track record of the government when it comes to delays in this space as by the two months that have elapsed since we saw the disallowance motions rejected in this place. I recall that at the very outset of the life of this government, with the Water Act freshly minted in 2007, it took then Minister Wong 18 months just to appoint the chair and members of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority—a terrible delay right at the outset. I recall that the original timeline was to have the Murray-Darling Basin Plan finalised in 2011 and that we were to have seen a draft of the actual plan before the 2010 federal election. Instead, we did not see a draft of the actual plan before the 2010 federal election, and even after the election all we ended up getting was a guide to the draft, an outline of it, which proved to be one of the very tragic steps in the development of the Basin Plan. We know that it was more than a year after the original deadline was set that we finally saw the finalisation of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. So, once again, delays are proving to be a consistent theme through this important reform under this government, which drives my concern today about the silence from the government since we saw the rejection of the disallowance motions to the Basin Plan and the adoption of the Basin Plan late last year.


On the infrastructure projects side we have the iconic project of fixing the Menindee Lakes, so often talked about as having the potential to allegedly save up to 200 gigalitres of water—a very significant potential reform. In Labor's policy document at the 2007 election it was listed as the top priority amongst their infrastructure projects. Here we are in 2013 and not a single sod of soil has been turned and, as far as I am aware, agreement is something that is still being worked upon. I know there are difficulties with the state government in getting that off the ground. Of course, initial delays did not exactly help in that regard and, perhaps, if agreements had been struck earlier we may have seen action by now. Whether it is that project, the 2008 promise of the Sunraysia modernisation project or the chronic underspending in the budget when it comes to water infrastructure, the government has a track record of just not delivering. It is those delays and those failures to deliver that feed my concern about where the current process may or may not be up to. I do hope that we will see the government drive this hard to ensure that they get the necessary agreements in place rather than allow things to set in and drift, as appears to have happened on far too many previous occasions.


The topic of infrastructure projects allows me to turn to some of the detail of the Water Amendment (Water for the Environment Special Account) Bill 2012 and how it will operate. I think it is fair to say that this is an unusual bill. It is unusual for the chamber and this parliament to appropriate funds so far in advance, and this bill appropriates annual allocations all the way through to 2024. At face value, that is an act that I would have a concern with; however, understanding the interrelationship between this legislation and the Basin Plan I can understand why this step has been taken. The Basin Plan essentially sets out that 2,750 gigalitres of water must be recovered to meet the new targets for sustainable diversion limits. That water simply must be recovered. If governments of either persuasion are to honour the promises that we have all made not to have compulsory acquisitions or the like, we simply have to find the budget to undertake the actions to get to that 2,750 level.


We then have the decision that, despite some changes to the wording of the legislation in the other place, we are going to try to get another 450 gigalitres on top of that to get to a 3,200-gigalitre reduction. To ensure that the government of the day actually does try and actually does have the capacity to get through this process and get to the end of that 450 gigalitres if possible, the money is being set down. Had the 450 gigalitres been included as part of the Basin Plan, and had there actually been a 3,200-gigalitre reduction in the Basin Plan, then, quite clearly, appropriating this money in advance would not have been necessary. But because it is being done as an addendum, as an additional target to try to achieve, I can see that there is some case to budget those funds.


I am not 100 per cent convinced whether the funds in question will prove to be enough, but I note the assurances of the government that it believes the sums do stack up to get a potential 450-gigalitre target. I particularly note, though, that there is a real inconsistency in what Minister Burke argues when it comes to how the 2,750 gigalitres is achieved versus how this 450 gigalitres is achieved. When it comes to the 2,750 gigalitres, the government rejects the cap on buybacks because it says that, basically, you need to maintain the threat of buybacks so as to get the state governments to deliver the water infrastructure projects and ensure that they occur. Yet, when it comes to the 450 gigalitres and this bill before us, it prevents the use of buybacks and says that it must be via infrastructure projects, with some allowances to recover all of the water saved under those infrastructure projects through buybacks. But it requires infrastructure projects in the first place with no threat of buybacks existing as an incentive.


So there is a serious inconsistency in the argument made when Minister Burke or others say they oppose the request of the New South Wales government or the policy proposition of the coalition to cap buybacks and say, 'We will definitely deliver on infrastructure policies and projects'. They seem to argue that cannot possibly be done. And yet when it comes to this legislation, it is very clear that they believe it can be done. So if it can be done for the 450—if you can say that you can get all 450 without recourse to buybacks, that it can be done through infrastructure projects—then very clearly you should be able to do likewise as outlined in the targets of this water recovery strategy. Those targets should be enshrined.


As Senator Wong rightly said today, the reason to reject buybacks across the board—I wish she had done a little more of this as minister—is because you have to balance the environment with the communities. That is why this is so important.


This bill earns the support of the coalition because it balances the environment with the communities. In the end, it makes clear—the government has made clear—that infrastructure comes first to deliver the water savings for the environment; that you try to achieve the win-win outcomes that get water for the environment without decimating the economic fabric or productive capacity of the communities along the way. That is the reason we are supporting this bill. I welcome it as the next step in this process and, of course, welcome here the government perhaps responding to some of the questions I posed.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,1,2,speech
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2013-02-05,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia) (13:46):  I rise too to speak on the Water Amendment (Water for the Environment Special Account) Bill 2012. As a South Australian, and as an irrigator, I understand intimately the importance of a healthy river system, with sufficient water flowing into South Australia to ensure our future. One can only hope that if the South Australian environment is healthy then all the environments of the states upstream will be in a similar condition.


We supported the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, when we eventually got it. We supported the adjustment mechanism to allow the moving up and down of the amount of water that will be available, should it be proven that it is insufficient or too much. We will support this bill. But the attitude that you 'just add water' really does need to be looked at a little bit more carefully. In my opinion, it is not about the amount of water or the numbers; it is about where you get the water from and how you use that water once you have it.


We need to be smarter about delivering the best possible outcomes by taking the least amount of water out of productive use, and by having the least amount of impact on the lives and the assets of the people who rely on the river—the people who produce our food and the people who, like everybody else in this state, have a right to be able to earn a living without having something taken away from them unnecessarily. It is not just by innovating and the like for irrigation practices; it is also about being innovative about a broad range of things that we do to ensure that we deliver the best possible outcome for the least amount of negative impact on our communities.


The water delivered by the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, and the additional water that is proposed to be delivered by this bill, does give us a huge opportunity to do much good. We must not waste that opportunity or the water that we are getting. Like so many things, the devil is always in the detail. The ability of the additional water that is identified in this bill to be used effectively will require very, very careful management by those who are entrusted both at a federal level and in the respective states on how they use that water, and what they do with it.


One small example—well, not a small example for the people who were involved—that was highlighted during a Senate hearing into the impacts of the plan was actually raised by the Murray River Action Group. They gave evidence that the impacts of flows of 40,000 megalitres per day in the Kiewa River, upstream from Albury and from releases from the Hume Dam, will have absolutely devastating impacts on their area. We need to remember that these guys are not irrigators, so do not place the blame on irrigators and say, 'Well, you know, the irrigators have taken the water'. These people are actually dryland farmers; they just happen to be in an area where they have had reasonable levels of rainfall so they end up being quite wet dryland farmers. They go on to say in their submission:


Pastures underwater in Spring for long periods of time will result in pastures being totally wiped out for 7 - 8 months at a time …


They refer to the fact that with flows of 40,000 megalitres a day, many bridges and approaches within the district will actually deny access both to their land and their stock.


Obviously, there is an increased risk of exacerbated flood damage. If you are actually doing controlled releases of water at a time that you get high rainfall, then all of a sudden you have turned what was apparently going to be a controlled flood into something that could be entirely devastating to the region. It is not just the things I have said above about loss of access and loss of crop but also loss of livestock.


Another thing: we are talking about looking after the environment. There are huge red gum forests up there, and red gum forests that spend their lives with wet feet, which potentially could happen, actually will die, so we will have a negative environmental impact. That was just one example from a community that is along the Murray-Darling river system.


I suppose one thing that we really do need to note in all this is the issue of compensation. It is not the government that pays compensation; it is actually the taxpayers of Australia who pay that compensation. So we need to be very, very careful that we cover ourselves off and that we do not actually cause a worse set of problems by trying to solve one problem.


That is just one example. Further downstream, the removal of constraints does have the potential to have a major impact. Like a chain, the river is only as strong as its weakest link. By removing these constraints we have a very serious potential that we could cause other problems. I would really like the department to answer, 'Does anybody really know what the impacts of an 80,000 megalitre-a-day flow at the South Australian border is going to mean for the upstream states?'


You have to remember that this water is being released from dams at the top end of the system. It is not just being caused by run-off from rain along the entire river system, so the water is not gathering as it comes down; it is actually one lump that is being let go. Another example is: how are the suggested quantities of water that are coming down from these upstream reservoirs going to get past such natural impediments as the Barmah Choke? All of these issues need to be addressed before we try and stuff all this water down our river corridor. The taxpayers of Australia have stumped up an awful lot of money for this reform package, and they will stump up a whole heap more before it is finished. But already we are starting to see that some of our state governments are seeing it as a way of reducing their commitment to the Murray-Darling Basin Authority. We need to deal with this issue now.


One of the issues that has resulted from this reduction of funding coming out of the states is very close to the heart of many people in South Australia—that is, the Native Fish Strategy. Minister Burke last year announced that the Native Fish Strategy would not be funded from the middle of this year. This has occurred, according to his department, because the state governments have reduced their funding. In particular, he said that New South Wales had reduced its funding, which had normally triggered the dollar-for-dollar funding that would normally go into this strategy; hence, if the New South Wales government and the South Australian governments were not going to put the funding into this strategy then the federal department was not going to either. Given that native fish populations are a true indicator of the health of a river system, surely, with all of this money that the taxpayers of Australia have put up to try and achieve a healthy river system, there is the capacity in the project mix that we have put forward to allow this small amount of money—we are talking a couple of million dollars a year—to continue.


Such a program provides critical support across the whole of the basin—it is not just a state activity—and it delivers a huge amount of positive outcomes for the basin: the restoration of the riverine connectivity, advances in integrated pest management, the delivery of demonstration reaches across the basin, the initiation of knowledge generation projects, the harmonisation of fisheries management and related natural resource regimes, and community education and engagement. Native fish populations and fish communities basin wide remain severely depleted, and to stop this program now just does not make any sense to me. Demonstrably healthy river native fish populations are a key signal to the basin's human communities and the Australian people that the river is healthy and that the management of the river is being effective. So, once again, it is a very easy and effective way for us to check whether the projects being put forward and the delivery of this Basin Plan and its associated instruments are actually working. Achieving a healthy, working Murray-Darling Basin Plan requires a broader focus than just water management. Without the support of these complementary management actions we will be wasting the opportunity to maximise the outcomes of the water that this very bill seeks to deliver.


Another way that we can achieve the best outcomes is through encouragement of innovation. In the electorate in which I live, we have an example where the community has positively embraced the action to look after the river. The Loxton Waikerie council is a small council in the Riverland of South Australia and on their own, off their own bat, they took up the initiative of constructing a 25-megalitre dam in the town of Loxton to capture the town's stormwater. The council hopes that this dam will not just reduce the town's reliance on the Murray for its water but take it completely off the system. A similar project has been planned for Waikerie, the other major town within this council area. This $9.5 million project has significant benefits for the local community. It certainly takes off the draw on the river. It increases the knowledge bank within the community. It increases the capacity of that community to manage flood mitigation during times of high volume, and it also gives them the opportunity to manage their own land management plans in a much more effective and innovative way.


There are myriad projects that we could be looking at that would enable the water that is being recovered here and returned to the river environment to be used and maximised. In South Australia we were lucky enough to get $265 million from the federal government towards a project which has been referred to as the Water Industry Alliance. I would like to acknowledge that eventually, after many, many years of the South Australian community demanding recognition for the fact that they have been the most responsible water users in the basin forever—



Honourable senators interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Ludlam
):  Order, Senators! Senator Ruston still has a few minutes left on the clock. Could we keep the chatter to a minimum.




Senator RUSTON:
  With recognition of the irrigation water efficiency and things like the compliance on the water cap in South Australia, we have been really quite delighted to see that after seven years we have been acknowledged for it. In the acknowledgement of this and the allocation of the $265 million, we have seen the capacity for us to spend money that otherwise would have been allocated to either specific water-saving infrastructure upgrades or water buybacks and put it to better use on projects that will increase the efficiency of agricultural productivity within the region. We are looking forward to seeing the outcome of the process of defining what those projects are through the Water Industry Alliance. The fact that this 450 gigalitres of additional water will not be secured by buyback is a huge relief for the people of South Australia. The plan and this bill are supported because they can do good, and we must make sure that they do do good, by implementing the plan in such a way that the beneficial outcomes are maximised for all stakeholders: the environment, the economy and the river communities that rely on it so heavily.

And today I can assure every Australian that their Budget will be back in surplus in 2013.


I also refer to the Prime Minister's speech last week at the National Press Club, in which she reported that Australian families were saving a lot more and spending a lot less than they were before the global financial crisis hit 4½ years ago.

Is it economic illiteracy to say that getting the budget back to surplus is necessary to relieve cost-of-living pressures on Australian families? That is what the Prime Minister said some two years ago. Does the leader still agree with this statement and, if so, what does he say to Australian families for continuing to deliver budget outcomes that actually increase their cost-of-living pressures?

The minister is right: it does get worse in Tasmania, which has had a state Labor government for over a decade. I refer the leader to the Prime Minister's statement at a town hall meeting just two days before the 2010 election, at which the Prime Minister said that failure to deliver a surplus was 'not an option'. Can the minister confirm to the Senate that failure is now an option for this Prime Minister and her government?

For three years those opposite have said, 'We'll tighten the belt further; we'll have a bigger surplus than you.' 'We'll have a bigger surplus than you,' has been the refrain. Yet within 24 hours Mr Hockey and Mr Abbott had entirely different positions. In the 'Real Solutions' plan there was no commitment whatsoever. Mr Abbott does an announcement—a mini faux launch—and there was nothing about it. Yet Mr Hockey, within 24 hours, contradicts Mr Abbott about the surplus saying, 'And we'll be in surplus,' and Mr Abbott, dragged to reality by Mr Hockey, decides he has nowhere to go.


What we have in this country at the moment—as you can see if you look at the front page of the Age—is a state government in Victoria that has brought the state of Victoria to a standstill. What do the statistics out of the state of Victoria say? More than 12,000 construction jobs have been lost and more are at risk. The reduction in jobs in Victoria's construction sector is twice that of the national average. We have a state Liberal government, that those opposite fully support, that has ground the state of Victoria to a standstill. (Time expired)

In Victoria 12,000 construction jobs are gone—twice the national average. In Queensland, since Mr Campbell Newman was elected in March 2012, Queensland has lost 17,000 jobs. So 29,000 Australian families have a much, much tougher living because of the state Liberal governments in Queensland and Victoria.


The unemployment rate in this country would have come down but for the Queensland state Liberal-National government. If the Newman government's employment performance was taken out of the national figures, the national unemployment rate would be 5.2 per cent. But it gets worse. (Time expired)

I seek leave to incorporate the answer.


Leave granted.




The answer read as follows—



MINISTER FOR SUSTAINABILITY, ENVIRONMENT, WATER, POPULATION AND


COMMUNITIES


(Senate Question without Notice)


On 29 November 2012 during question time, Senator McKenzie asked me a question as Minister representing the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities:


The ACT Labor government continues to use grazing as a fuel reduction measure, recent media reports indicate. Indeed, in the last fire season, the Fire management Unit stated: 'Grazing is a crucial component of the ACT's hazard reduction program'. As we head into summer do your support the ACT Labor government's continued use of strategic grazing to keep the territory safe from fire?""


The Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities has provided the following answer to the honourable Senator's question:


On 22 October 2011, a regulation came into effect which removed any doubt that grazing of domestic stock within the Australian Alps National Parks and Reserves has a significant impact on the values of that place.


This reinforces the Australian government's commitment to ensuring appropriate protection is in place for the unique environment of the Australian Alps National Parks and Reserves.


The ACT Government's 2011/12 Bushfire Operations Plan outlines the hazard reduction strategies to be employed throughout ACT parks and reserves. While the ACT proposes to use grazing as a hazard reduction strategy across more than 7,000 hectares of the ACT, it will not be used in the two parks or reserves which are part of the Australian Alps National Parks and Reserves. These are the Namadgi National Park (the ACT's only national park) and Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve.


I note that the only fuel reduction activities planned in these parks/reserves are burning and slashing. I am advised that grazing is not used for hazard reduction in any areas of particular conservation and recreational value within the ACT.

Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Deputy Leader of The Nationals) (15:07):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy (Senator Conroy) and the Minister for Finance and Deregulation (Senator Wong) to questions without notice asked by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Abetz), Senator Brandis, the Leader of The Nationals in the Senate (Senator Joyce) and Senator Sinodinos today relating to the Budget.


Today marks the first day of parliament since Julia Gillard sent Wayne Swan to dump the government's—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Scullion, refer to the Prime Minister by her correct title, please.




Senator SCULLION:
  Today marks the first day of parliament since the Prime Minister sent Wayne Swan to dump the government's 'come hell or high water', 'failure is not an option' guarantee to return the budget to surplus in 2013.




Senator Wong:
  You are sensitive about Tony Abbott. Show the same courtesy.




Senator SCULLION:
  I was not sensitive about anyone, Senator.




Senator Wong:
  You are; you are very sensitive.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Scullion and Senator Wong, you need to refer to members of the other place by their correct titles.




Senator SCULLION:
  I will correct that and refer to Wayne Swan as the Treasurer, Mr Deputy President. So we have had this litany of garrulous assertions from both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. I understand that the government as a whole—and Senator Wong has obviously made her contribution. I understand that on some 142 occasions she promised that a surplus would be delivered in 2012-13. We have heard today that, across government, 650 promises, the same promise, were made. Absolutely certain that this would be delivered, the entire government has come behind this promise.


The Prime Minister has promised this on 165 occasions since becoming the Prime Minister on 24 June. 'Failure is not an option' was the catchcry. It is probably a little like 'You won't have a carbon tax under a government I lead'. Something that is said with the sort of gravitas that the Australian people should believe. She followed up by guaranteeing that. 'Guarantee' is a word that people associate with something that is not going to be wishy-washy. This was a core and fundamental promise. The Treasurer then went on to promise it on another 366 occasions. On 366 occasions the Treasurer stood up and said that he would deliver it 'come hell or high water'—again using the sort of vernacular that is woven around something that is absolutely core and something that Australians can trust. It is the sort of wording they can put their trust in.


The Prime Minister said, 'You can't run this country if you can't manage its budget.' That makes sense. If you cannot manage a budget you cannot run the country, and we would agree with the Prime Minister on that. I am sure a lot of other Australians thought that was very sensible. The Prime Minister then went on to say: 'We've saved jobs, we've stayed out of recession and'—prophetically—'we are back in surplus.' 'We are back in surplus!' Not something that has actually been forecast but we are actually back in surplus. Many Australians would have thought: 'Well, I haven't been following politics but that's a relief. That is a relief. I do know that the Prime Minister does bang on a bit about the cost of living, interest rates and all those things that an unbalanced budget can provide, so I am probably feeling a bit relieved.'


That was to the McKell Institute on 4 July, and we all know now that that was complete rubbish. Why? Quite sensibly it is because it will help with relieving cost-of-living pressures. This is the rationale. Wayne Swan said, 'Coming back to surplus is about making sure we help those people sitting around the kitchen table figuring out how to make ends meet.' In that regard, he said:


We'll be back in the black by 2012-13, on time, as promised. The alternative - meandering back to surplus - would compound the pressures in our economy and push up the cost of living for pensioners and working people.


He went on to say, 'It's important we bring the budget back to the black in 2013 because we don't want to exacerbate price pressures in the economy during the period.' Those are matters that were continued by the Prime Minister, who said it was important for families and that 'It's the best thing we can do for families under cost-of-living pressures not add to inflation pressures and ensure that in this budget we won't.'


Of course people were quite relieved about this. In my view, this is clearly an acknowledgement that their decision to abandon the policy of delivering a surplus will lead to additional inflationary pressures, will lead to additional increases in the cost of living and the pain for every single Australian. Everybody understands that the pain in the wallet at the moment is the toughest pain. If the Australian people could not trust the Prime Minister on the carbon tax and the surplus guarantee, how can they now be asked to believe her when she says, 'We care about any element of the cost-of-living pressures on families,' or in fact believe any promise she now makes on the eve of this new election?

"Gallacher, Sen Alex",ALP,2013-02-05,"



Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (15:13):  I rise to participate in this debate to take note of answers to questions without notice today. The situation we are in is, I suppose, very open and clear. We have an opposition that is pursuing a budget surplus and we have a government that is pursuing a budget surplus, with an underlying net debt position at the moment of 10 per cent of GDP—that is, one-tenth the level of most other advanced economies. So, in a nutshell: do not worry about the economy, do not worry about the people who work in it and do not worry about the people in it who need to be educated or looked after. Get a surplus. On the other hand, we have a responsible position, taking into consideration all of the global factors. If we were just to look at one simple global factor which has come to light today: the seasonally adjusted trade deficit of $427 million in December 2012 is an 85 per cent improvement on the revised $2.8 billion November deficit. The volatility that exists outside our control is what impacts on the budget.


I am sure those opposite know this fully well. They know it better than the average punter out there who votes. But they see no tactical or political advantage in telling the truth or putting the real case up. They want to confect a situation where they malign the reputation of the Treasurer, malign the reputation of the Prime Minister and advance their ruthless, short-term political aims.


Basically, they lost the last election and never got over it; two of their mates came to the right side of the table and from that day forward everything has been about destruction. Nothing has been positive. Last night we saw swinging voters say, 'We know the position on deficit; we know the position on surplus. Can you cost a policy and tell us about it?' And the answer was, 'No, we're not going to. We will do something before September 14, but we are not going to tell the average voter anything at all about what our policies cost, or what we would be doing.'


All I can say as a very new senator is that I have seen the results of some of the spending. I have travelled the length and breadth of the electorate of Grey. I have seen and heard from the small business operators who kept apprentices on. They have built trade training centres, they have built Building the Education Revolution libraries and science facilities. And that stimulus funding has kept people in rural communities, and a lot of Liberal-held seats, in the game—in the economy.


Let us look at some of the simple things that the Labor government is doing with parental leave. Parental leave is great for the time that you enjoy to have your child at home and either partner looks after it. But what is it really about? It is about people participating in the economy. It is about participation rates; it is about women participating at a greater level than they have been. It is about them enjoying paid employment, contributing to the economy and growing the size of the pie.


As with the NDIS: the Productivity Commission highlights the fact that we can get a genuine economic benefit out of putting these very notable and worthwhile reforms into our economy. And there is a cost, but the cost will be paid over the long term.


I think, really, that the situation we are in is that Labor governments do not walk away from the economy, their constituents or the population in pursuit of a symbol of a surplus. We want a surplus, and we will deliver a surplus. The reality is that we do not ditch people, we do not gut the economy and we do not stagnate the economy. We prime the economy because it is in the best interests of all Australians to be able to contribute, to earn, to work, to have a useful life, to pay their taxes and to provide for their children.


I think that is the ultimate difference between the debate on this side and the debate from the other side, which is purely short-term electoral advantage. The vomit principle is alive and well on the other side. If they continue to repeat their untruths and their statements, they believe the electorate will suddenly wake up and say, 'I've heard that 1,400 times—it must be true'.

Senator HUMPHRIES
 (Australian Capital Territory) (15:18):  I am grateful to Senator Gallacher for putting those matters on the table and explaining what he feels the benefits are of Labor's administration. But as questions in question time today very amply demonstrated, the problem with making promises like paid maternity leave, NDISs and so forth is that, worthy though they might be, you have to deliver them sustainably. And to deliver those sorts of promises sustainably to the Australian people, you have to have balanced budgets. That is at the very nub of these sorts of processes, because without balanced budgets you end up having to borrow money.


The coalition has made very clear that we stand for the kind of fiscal management which brings Australia back to sustainable, continuous budget surpluses of the kind that Australians saw almost without interruption throughout the days of the Howard government. That is the kind of process which brings Australians the real benefits that Senator Gallacher has spoken about.


This government inherited a very strong fiscal position. Effectively, it inherited $45 billion of assets tucked away. It inherited no net debt and it inherited a budget in surplus. Of course, it has turned that around in just a few short years into massive deficits and into enormous amounts of debt—$107 billion worth of debt today, climbing upwards at the rate of about $100 million a day. One hundred million dollars a day! A billion dollars every 10 days that this government is in office.


The problem for the government is, of course, that today it faces a struggle toward the light to reach its surplus. It was supposed to be delivered this financial year; it was promised faithfully that it would be delivered. In fact, it was promised on more than one occasion that it had actually been delivered. I received in my letterbox a note from Senator Lundy, Community News—I gather along with everybody else in the ACT—in which she said:


The 2012 Federal Budget has not only returned to surplus as promised – it has ensured that families and small business will share in the benefits of the resources boom.


Well, the budget has not been returned to surplus. Presumably, she is referring there to the mining tax delivering benefits of the resources boom to families and small business. Of course, we know that the mining tax has delivered nothing to the Australian people today. Not one penny! She went on to say at the bottom of the page:


How do we compare on jobs and the economy?


…   …   …


Under Labor:


…   …   …


Our Budget has been returned to surplus in 2012/13.


We find a few weeks or months after that page was delivered into everybody's letterbox in the ACT that in fact it has not been returned to surplus. The budget is very much still in the red, and it looks like being in the red for quite some time to come.


I think that Senator Gallacher and others on that side of the chamber who extol the virtues of the government's budget process need to understand that getting to a surplus this year, or next year or whenever it is going to be, if they ever do it—and I have my doubts—is just the beginning of their problems. Because, once they get to a surplus, they have then got to start to use whatever that surplus is to pay for the mountain of promises which the government have already made to the Australian people and for which there is no plausible means of delivering.


You have promised an NDIS, at a cost of $10½ billion a year, once fully operational. You are then paying another $3.7 billion in new money over five years for aged care. You have promised low-paid workers another $1 billion. You have promised to buy a number of key assets in defence—$36 billion for submarines and $16 billion for Joint Strike Fighters. You have not promised but you have had to find the money to pay for your mistakes in border protection. You are now paying $2.1 billion to reopen the Nauru and Manus Island refugee processing centres. You are increasing the refugee intake, costing the Australian taxpayer $1.4 billion over the forward estimates. There are also the Gonski recommendations, costing $6½ billion a year once fully operational. Today, you cannot even reach a budget surplus five years after weathering a fiscal crisis—five years ago the GFC happened. You still cannot get to a simple budget surplus, a wafer-thin budget surplus of $1.1 billion. How are you going to pay for those promises? This does not add up. Labor is off the rails with this and all Australians can see that. (Time expired)

Senator THORP
 (Tasmania) (15:23):  It confuses and bewilders me on certain levels why it is that the opposition focuses so much on one single issue when it comes to describing what is the Australian economy, an economy that the Prime Minister rightly referred to as 'one of the seven economic wonders of the world'. Our strong fiscal management has meant that we are the envy of treasurers the globe over. It was the Australian Labor government that bullet-proofed the Australian economy and kept it out of recession during the worst economic downturn in three quarters of a century, which those opposite seem incapable of grasping.


Since December 2007, when Labor came to power, the Japanese economy has shrunk around 1½ per cent. The euro area economy has shrunk almost two per cent, the US economy has grown by merely 1.25 per cent, yet the Australian economy has grown around 13 per cent over the same time. That meant that we were able to protect jobs and can still protect jobs, as we did during the global financial crisis. In fact, around 840,000 jobs have been created since we were first elected. In contrast to that, the completely irresponsible Newman Liberal-National government in Queensland has been shedding jobs at an average of 65 jobs per day. Mr Abbott himself, the Leader of the Opposition, has referred to the outstanding job being done by Campbell Newman and his band of what I would only describe as economic illiterates. If this is the template by which the opposition leader intends to govern the country, should he ever have the privilege of taking the position of Prime Minister, we should all be very nervous.


As far as interest rates are concerned, it is this government's strict fiscal discipline that puts downward pressure on interest rates. Interest rates are now at three per cent, compared to 6.75 per cent when those opposite left office. Compared to when the Liberals were last in government, a family with a mortgage of $300,000 is now saving around $5,000 a year on a mortgage. 


We are actually giving working families a tax cut—from July last year—so that they get more money in their fortnightly pay cheques. Currently, we are experiencing a record investment of more than $36 billion in projects around the country. With this obsession about a surplus, those opposite are failing to recognise that Labor has done a remarkable job of steering the country through the financial crisis. We are one of the strongest economies in the world, we have low unemployment, contained inflation, solid growth, record levels of investment and low debt. Tony Abbott has no plan for the country, just destructive negativity—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Thorp, 'Mr Abbott,' please.




Senator THORP:
  Mr Deputy President, I beg your pardon: Mr Abbott. 'Misterabbit' just runs off the tongue. He comes from a strong tradition of irresponsible economic management. The International Monetary Fund itself—



Senator Fifield interjecting—




Senator THORP:
  Those opposite may find this interesting. The International Monetary Fund itself has run a fine tooth comb through the financial records of 55 countries over 200 years. It has identified only two periods of wasteful spending in Australia in recent years, both in the period of the Howard Liberal government.


In contrast, Nobel Laureate economist Joseph Stiglitz has said: 'The federal Labor government saved the country from the worst of the global financial crisis and only Labor has the proven credentials to maintain economic strength in the face of adversity.'


Although our economy remains resilient, we also know that the impact on taxes caused by global volatility and uncertainty, lower commodity prices and the high dollar means that tax revenue is way down. But this government is responsible and does not believe that cutting harder or filling a hole in tax revenue that jeopardises jobs is the way to go. We believe in a very strong future. As a Tasmanian, my main concern is what would happen should the economic policies of those opposite ever be applied to my dear state of Tasmania, taking over $600 billion per year out of our coffers.

Senator RYAN
 (Victoria) (15:28):  Senator Thorp, who spoke before me, commenced her address by expressing some degree of confusion as to why the opposition focuses on this issue. I will tell you why the opposition focuses on this issue: because every dollar borrowed is a dollar of future taxation. Every dollar borrowed is pushing off the cost of what you wish to do today to future generations. And what this government is doing, with the much-lauded Schoolkids Bonus it was talking about in question time today, is actually borrowing from the very kids whose parents are receiving it, just like it did with the stimulus to build overpriced school halls that crowded out the schoolyard—




Senator Wong:
  That you guys turned up to the openings of!




Senator RYAN:
  I went to one: the school my mother teaches at. I plead guilty that I actually went to one. Just as this government did with the disastrous stimulus program of 2009 where money was borrowed from the kids in schools, in the very halls, to build those halls at a cost higher than any other school halls had ever—



Senator Wong interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order, Senator Wong! Resume your seat, Senator Ryan.



Senator Wong interjecting—



Senator Carol Brown interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order, Senator Wong and Senator Brown! Senator Ryan, you have the call and please do not acknowledge interjections. Direct your remarks to the chair.




Senator RYAN:
  For the information of Senator Wong, I actually did explain to the principal and deputy principal of the school that I voted against it—I did; at the very opening. It happened to be the school I went to and my mother teaches at. So, if you want to begrudge me that, Senator Wong, do not question my honesty.


Why this betrayal of a surplus promise is so important is that it continues the pattern of excuses provided by this government as they seek to justify what has been an unprecedented increase in spending—one of the fastest run-ups in spending by a Commonwealth government since the Whitlam era. The government like to talk about the burden of taxation but they do not want to talk about the burden of taxation plus what they are borrowing. We now have hundreds of billions of borrowings, to which Australia is now exposed. We are a capital-importing country, and to have a capital-importing country add government debt to the burden of private sector debt exposes this country to risk.


What we have seen is excuse after excuse. We saw the global financial crisis. The write-down initially in revenues in that year, I believe, was marginally greater than the surplus the government were actually bequeathed by the previous government. We have seen the government complain about the very resources investment that Senator Thorp talked about earlier. Last year we had the government complaining that it was this very investment that was depressing tax revenues and making it harder for the government to balance the books.


But the truth is this: revenues for this government today are more than $70 billion higher this year than in the year they came to office—$70 billion more this year than when they came to office. What that tells the people is that the government have a spending problem—a huge spending problem. The government are unable to restrain themselves, not just in spending increasing tax revenues; they are unable to restrain themselves from borrowing to pork-barrel and borrowing to send out money to favoured groups at the expense of future taxpayers in this country.


This surplus was the litmus test this government set themselves. This surplus was bragged about during the stimulus debates of early 2009. I remember two budgets ago the headline in one of our newspapers was 'Back in the black'. Whenever anyone on this side questioned whether or not they would bring forward a surplus, they were pilloried. They were accused of being economically irresponsible and, ironically, not having faith in the Treasury. But we now know that the government were bluffing all along, because all we hear is excuse after excuse as to why they have been unable to control their spending.


We are going to hear more, I imagine, in the lead-up to the next budget about savings or 'saves'—to use the jargon the government try to use to sound like they have some control over the budget. But we know that more than two-thirds of the savings this government brought in here have actually been tax hikes on the Australian people. And now we are seeing a big target placed over the future of every Australian who wants some independence in retirement. We are now seeing a big target, a big bullseye, to actually say, 'We are coming after your money—money you have saved; money the government have in fact prohibited you from accessing through the compulsory superannuation scheme; money the government have done deals in the past with unions whereby you might not receive a pay rise but you get a super payment.' Now the government are going to say to those on an income of $50,000 a year—which is what a million dollars would buy a 65-year-old—'We are going to go after that pile of money that is yours merely to feed our incredible spending problem.' The government have shown that they cannot be trusted, and this surplus is the greatest betrayal of all.

 (Tasmania—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:43):  There is no doubt that this government is the most chronically dysfunctional in our nation's history. This Labor regime will go down as the government that finally made the Whitlam Labor government look good. The current debacle is the Whitlam experiment on steroids. This is a government whose strategy is twofold: first, buy themselves back into power whilst attacking Mr Abbott. Labor are mortgaging the long-term future of Australians in a desperate bid to buy their short-term personal future. What has happened to date is bad enough; just wait until Labor start on the superannuation of ordinary Australians, raiding the personal future of individual Australians for Labor's short-term benefit. Superannuation will simply be yet another broken promise.


From the carbon tax to same sex marriage to the surplus, we have a government that will say one thing before an election and then do exactly the opposite afterwards. We have a Prime Minister that was the chief defence counsel for Mr Craig Thomson for year after year and who praised him and said that she hoped he would be the member for Dobell for many years to come.


Indeed, we were told by her spin doctor Mr McTernan and others that she gave her best ever, most powerful speech to the parliament recently. It was not about her vision for the country, it was not about a policy issue about which she felt strongly. No, it was to defend none other than Mr Peter Slipper in a pathetic attempt to attack Mr Abbott, a speech that we now know was actually written by a man, yet she claims she will call misogyny whenever she sees it.


This is a government that has seen a record increase in the cost of living for our fellow Australians. On a personal basis, the Prime Minister calls for loyalty to her and her government. One assumes she means the same loyalty she extended to Mr Rudd and Senator Trish Crossin. In relation to Senator Crossin, she says, 'It was the captain's call.' Well, so was Mr Slipper. That was also a captain's call. Each time the Prime Minister makes a captain's call or makes a decision, the Australian people say her judgement needs to be questioned and they question her judgement.


In relation to Senator Crossin, let us not pretend that this was about a long-term concern by the Prime Minister to get an Aboriginal into the parliament. She had that opportunity with Mr Warren Mundine from New South Wales, where there was a vacancy available, and she deliberately sidelined Mr Mundine to get Mr Bob Carr out of naphthalene and parachute him into the Senate. We, on this side, have already had a distinguished senator, Neville Bonner, and the great local member in Ken Wyatt in the House of Representatives. Gillard thought she had to play catch-up. But what she did yet again in her clumsy way was to say, 'I am going to overcome an injustice by creating another injustice.' Indeed, if Senator Crossin was an employee of Ms Gillard, she would be off to Fair Work Australia for unfair dismissal and the damages would be flowing.


This is typical of this government. The Prime Minister will say one thing and demand a certain standard of the employers of this country and then do exactly the opposite in relation to the people she is in charge of. Labor are so good at saying to us, 'Do as we say, but then not as we do.' The government's failures are legion and I am sure others contributing to this debate will be able to point to other examples. 


I want to say to the Australian people that there is good news in all this because there is a better way. The coalition does have a plan to deliver a stable and prosperous economy and a safe and secure Australia. On the current figures we would have the budget in surplus. Why? Because we are fiscally responsible. We know that you cannot borrow your way out of debt and we agree with Ms Gillard who, in one of her lucid moments, acknowledged the fact and the self-evident truth that getting back to surplus is 'necessary to relieve cost-of-living pressures on families'.


We agree and that is why we say the budget should be in surplus, not because of some economic theory but because it reduces the cost of living for Australian families. Ms Gillard said that failure to bring the budget back into surplus was not an option. We agree, but of course now we know that failure for this government is in fact an option. We would also abolish the carbon tax. That would see a decrease in the cost-of-living pressures for families, keeping in mind that their electricity bills have increased by 15.2 per cent since the introduction of the carbon tax.


The Labor Party go on about job security. Well, if they had any concern for the manufacturing sector, they would see the positive nature of abolishing the carbon tax. Every single Australian made car has a reverse tariff of $400 per unit on it, courtesy of the carbon tax. So every motor vehicle imported from South Korea and Japan has a $400 head start on price competitiveness compared to Australian made cars—and Labor claim that they are somehow concerned about jobs.


In all of this, there is not a squeak from the union bosses who get hundreds of dollars from each of the manufacturing workers of this country each year as union fees. Where are these union officials? Why are they not standing up for Australian manufacturing jobs and saying that the carbon tax should be abolished? I will tell you why: because they are more concerned about their Labor Party preselection for the future rather than looking after the interests of Australian workers. It is not only in the manufacturing sector. The dairy industry is another industry where family farms are being hit with an impost with this carbon tax of about $10,000 per annum.


Our positive plan also includes implementing a properly funded, paid parental leave scheme because we believe that such a scheme is a genuine workplace entitlement and not a social security benefit. We will cut green and red tape and save small business about $1 billion per annum, which will see them being able to reduce their prices and, as a result, reduce the cost of living for Australians. We will secure our borders, saving Australians billions of dollars and, might I add, delivering justice to those waiting patiently in refugee camps around the world.


We have an affordable infrastructure program to improve the roads for our nation. We are, in fact, internally stable. There is no doubt that Mr Abbott will be leading us to the next election. We have a clear plan. We have solid, stable leadership. We have a vision for this country, knowing that Australia can do so much better than she is doing now. The thing that is holding Australia back is not the Australian people, it is not the environment and it is not the economy: it is the government of this country that has so failed the Australian people. We, as a coalition, look forward to making 14 September 2013 the real Clean Up Australia Day.

"Thistlethwaite, Sen Matt",ALP,2013-02-05,"



Senator THISTLETHWAITE
 (New South Wales) (15:53):  The motion that we debate this afternoon is another waste of time—another exercise in futility by those opposite. I often wonder what Australians who watch Senate proceedings on television at home, or indeed those in the public gallery, think of motions such as this one that we debate this afternoon. Often you can see it on the faces of those present in the gallery when they are watching the proceedings. You can see that they are thinking that these proceedings are childish, a waste of time, and in some respects, egocentric. Every year when parliament begins we come in here hopeful that the standards of contribution from the opposition will improve; that they will realise the main game in this place is policy and policy development and who has the better plan for our nation; the contest of ideas; a better future for our country. But no, I read the MPI this morning and I see again another exercise in futility—what is, in essence, another high school debating topic that the parliament is going to waste the next hour on. 


A couple weeks ago I had the great pleasure, or fortunate opportunity, to tour Coonabarabran with the Prime Minister in the wake of the devastating bushfires that ravaged that area. I toured the area with the mayor, Peter Shinton, and the member for Parkes, Mark Coulton. We met some great Australians: people like Bob Fenwick, a Rural Fire Service captain who, when his own house was burning down, was not present because he was up the road saving one of his neighbours' houses. I saw and met some of the families that are struggling to cope with the fact that they have lost it all—lost their home and their belongings, lost their stock, lost a lot of memories. They wanted support from government. They wanted support to help them get through and they got it. The Prime Minister was there, I was there, Mark Coulton was there. All levels of government were represented. Kevin Humphries was there, and Centrelink officers were there to meet with people every day to reassure them that they would have the support of government. We announced a national disaster recovery payment, immediately available for those families that needed help. We announced that donations to the mayor's appeal would be tax-deductible. 


When Queensland was ravaged by floods once again over the last couple of weeks, they wanted support from government and they got it. When a couple years ago many people were left without insurance from the floods in Queensland they wanted action from the government and they got it when Bill Shorten banged the heads of the insurance companies together, sat them down and made them work out a definition of 'flood' to ensure that those people could enjoy insurance for what is unfortunately becoming an annual event in the north of Australia.


If those Australians could see what goes on in this parliament at times, some of the puerile issues that we debate, I think they would be horrified and, most importantly, unfortunately, I think they would feel let down. I am not opposed to having an argument, not at all. I am not opposed to having a debate. That is the great beauty of this place, but it should be about ideas. It should be about who has the better policy. Let us at least make those disagreements about who has a better future for our nation. The main game is policy and when you look at and analyse the policies of this government we have done a good job. We have made progress for Australia. 


When we came to government our economy was the 15th largest in the world. Because of this government's economic management it is now the 12th largest economy in the world. We have gone past South Korea, we have gone past Mexico and we have gone past Spain. The Australian dollar is the fourth most traded currency in the world. Why? Because we have a stable democracy and we have a strong economy; people see value in trading the Australian dollar and they see it, most importantly, as safe. We have managed our economy in a manner that is fair.


The most important security you could provide a family is a job, and since we have come to government we have created 700,000 new jobs in this economy. In a time when most economies, particularly those of Europe and the United States, have lost jobs and have gone backwards, this has not happened in Australia. We have maintained our position as a strong economy and provided a means to support families through having a job. But we have not only been giving people jobs, we have made those jobs fairer because we introduced the Fair Work Act to ensure that people could not be forced onto individual contracts and have their conditions ripped away from them. 


We have supported families in all that we have done through the taxation system to make it fairer through the process of introducing a carbon price. It has been about supporting families to ensure that as our economy progresses those on low to middle incomes have the opportunity to better themselves and provide a better education for their kids and a better healthcare system in their local community, and that is what we have fought for. We have provided tax cuts. Most recently we have provided about $300 a year in tax cuts for those who are on less than $80,000 a year. We have increased the tax-free threshold from $6,000 to $18,000, providing a massive tax break for those on low incomes. We have introduced a school kids bonus because we understand that parents struggle to meet the costs of sending kids to school each year. We have helped them with that.


We have rebuilt every single school in this country. We spent $16 billion in the best way you can spend government money—on education, on a better future and on a more productive economy through the Building the Education Revolution. We put new computers in nearly every school in this country. We have built trade training centres to ensure that kids who are not academically minded have the opportunity to begin a trade whilst they are at school. 


Climate change is the most significant challenge of our time. This government has introduced a policy that has seen emissions in our economy reduce, ensuring that we provide a better future for our children. Importantly, we have done this in the most efficient and least costly way for our economy. Guess what? It is working in the manner in which the government modelled it—the cost is less than one per cent on the consumer price index and families have got support to make that transition to a clean energy future.


Our economy faces a major challenge with the ageing of our population. Over the next couple of decades there will be a dramatic reduction in the number of people who are working in our economy to support our retirees. We are planning for that. We have reformed our superannuation system, pushing compulsory superannuation contributions from nine per cent to 12 per cent over the next eight years, to ensure that people retire with an adequate savings bank so that there is less of an impost on our social security system, our healthcare system and our aged-care system.


For those on low incomes we have effectively wiped out tax on superannuation through the low-income superannuation contribution. Anyone who earns less than $37,000 in our economy pays no tax on their superannuation—none at all. That provides an incentive for those people to go to work rather than to go out of work and go on welfare. What is the coalition's approach to that policy? Last week at the National Press Club when Tony Abbott was asked by a journalist, 'Would an Abbott-led government scrap the low-income superannuation contribution?' his words were, 'Yes, that stands.' They will get rid of the low-income superannuation contribution, imposing a tax increase on 3.5 million workers in this country. The lowest paid, those earning less than $37,000, will pay more tax under a Liberal Abbott government. Unfortunately, most of those are women who work part time. As if they are not doing it tough enough, they will be kicked in the guts by an Abbott-led government. Just last night we saw Christopher Pyne on Q&A—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Thistlethwaite, I let it go a moment ago, but address members of the other house by their correct titles please.




Senator THISTLETHWAITE:
  I saw Mr Christopher Pyne, a member of the House of Representatives, contradict Tony Abbott in saying that they now will not get rid of that policy. Senator Brandis can perhaps tell us if Tony Abbott is right or if Christopher Pyne is right.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2013-02-05,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (16:03):  I follow that rather sad and essentially valedictory contribution by Senator Matt Thistlethwaite, one of the proteges of the New South Wales Right of the Labor Party, to which I will return. Throughout the length and breadth of Australia today people have a sense that the government is in crisis, that it is in terminal decline, that it is utterly divided and that the wheels are falling off. This happens to all governments with the passage of time and today it is happening to the government of Julia Gillard. So deep are the divisions within this government that this morning's newspapers carried reports leaked from the Labor Party caucus meeting yesterday that the Prime Minister warned her own troops that their greatest enemy was the enemy within. The greatest enemy of the Labor government is the people within the Labor government, so divided have the government become against themselves. It is a government which has lost its way, which lacks integrity, which entirely lacks a vision for Australia and, indeed, which lacks the elementary competency to govern.


Last Wednesday Ms Gillard inflicted upon the Australian people the very last thing they wanted or needed—that is, a 227-day-long election campaign. This catastrophic error of political judgement was variously described by members of her own Labor caucus—and they were quoted without attribution in the weekend newspapers—as 'pathetic', 'suicidal' and 'bizarre'. Since that day the government has lurched from crisis to crisis. Within 24 hours the de facto Labor member for Dobell, Mr Craig Thomson, had been arrested and charged with 149 counts of fraud. This is the man upon whom the Gillard government relies for its existence. When Ms Gillard was asked at that Press Club address by a journalist: 'Will there be days for governing and days for campaigning?' she said: 'Yes, there will be. Some days will be days for governing and some days will be days for campaigning.' I think Ms Gillard needs to add a third category. There will be days set aside for governing, there will be days set aside for campaigning and there will be days set aside—a lot of days set aside—for court appearances. Because in the coming weeks and months, these are the various Labor party politicians, supporters and affiliates who face serious allegations of fraud now before the courts. 


I have mentioned Mr Craig Thomson's 149 counts of fraud. These are on top of the Fair Work Australia proceedings to seek restitution from the hundreds of thousands of dollars that Fair Work Australia found, after inquiry, he had thieved from low-paid workers of the Health Services Union, presently stayed pending the criminal charges. As yet, we have yet to see the outcome of Strike Force Carnarvon; the New South Wales police investigation into other allegations of bribery and secret commissions against Mr Craig Thomson, the member for Dobell, upon whose vote the Gillard government depends. Meanwhile, in the coming week there are the fraud charges against the other man upon whose vote the Gillard government depends, Mr Peter Slipper. Meanwhile, there are the fraud charges against Mr Michael Williamson. Mr Michael Williamson was the federal president of the Australian Labor Party who gave the green light to the installation of Ms Gillard as Prime Minister in a midnight political coup on 23 June 2010, when an elected prime minister—the Hon. Kevin Rudd—was removed by the faceless men. Mr Williamson is not so faceless these days; we see his face in the line-up. On top of all that, there is the ongoing scandals touching the Prime Minister herself concerning the AWU slush fund—not my words, but hers. Who could possibly imagine that a government so corrupted, so mired in sleaze and criminality could possibly conduct the affairs of the nation?


Just when one thought that it could not get any worse for Ms Gillard, on Friday night, again in the dark of night—this government has a propensity to do things in the dark of night—two senior ministers, our colleague Senator Evans and my opposite number—the minister whom I shadow—the Attorney-General, Ms Roxon, resigned suddenly. I can take at face value Senator Evans's explanation of his retirement. He has served in the Senate for 20 years and has led the pack of zombies—Senator Doug Cameron's words, not mine—who sit behind him for eight years. I can believe that Senator Chris Evans might have had enough. I do not believe that of Ms Roxon. As Lady Bracknell may have said: to lose one senior minister is a misfortune, but to lose two seems like carelessness. Well, in fact, worse than carelessness—catastrophe. The Australian public knows that the wheels are falling off this government and so do its members when not only Senator Evans but Ms Roxon and Mr Robert McClelland—her predecessor as Attorney-General—decide there is no point in contesting the next election. 


At least they got to go under their own steam. Unlike our colleague, Senator Trish Crossin, who was politically butchered by one of the most brutal acts of political butchery any of us have ever seen, dismissed from her position by prime ministerial fiat because—on the Prime Minister's own admission—the Australian Labor Party had failed to preselect one Indigenous person to sit in the Australian parliament. Some 42 years after my late friend, the great Neville Bonner, first sat in this chamber as a representative of the Queensland Liberal Party, the Australian Labor Party had to butcher one of their own to force the preselection of an Indigenous Australian. 


I would not like these dramatic political events—the events suggestive of chaos and terminal decline that we have witnessed in the last few days—to be allowed to obscure or let pass unnoticed an even more significant contribution: the speech on Saturday of the current federal Vice President of the Australian Labor Party, Mr Tony Sheldon, to the Young Labor conference. This is the Labor Party's federal vice president, not a Liberal politician. He said the Labor Party was in a 'catastrophic' situation. Tony Sheldon said:


Our crisis is more than just a crisis of trust brought on by the corrupt behaviour of property scammers and lobbyists. It's a crisis of belief brought on by lack of moral and political purpose.


He said 'there must be no understating the gravity of the crisis here' in New South Wales, 'no blame shifting and no dodging of responsibility to set things right'. And, significantly, although placing the primary blame on the New South Wales branch of the Australian Labor Party, Mr Tony Sheldon said this is a crisis that affects every state and every faction of the Australian Labor Party. 


When your own immediate past federal president stands in the dock of the court facing serious allegations of criminal fraud, and your current federal vice president says your government is—his word, not mine—a catastrophe which represents a party which lacks a moral or political purpose, then that seems to me a description of a government and a political movement in terminal decline. So worried are they about themselves—this endless conversation about the eternal, broiling miasma that is the modern Australian Labor Party—no wonder they cannot deliver on a single promise. No wonder they cannot, in particular, get the budget back into surplus.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2013-02-05,"



Senator FAULKNER
 (New South Wales) (16:13):  Well, another year, another waste of parliamentary time. Yet another matter of public importance from the opposition, yet more relentless bellyaching negativity. It may be a new parliamentary year, but of course there is nothing new from the opposition. Today we have heard from Senator Brandis that the opposition is concerned about the retirement of long-serving ministers from federal parliament. He says that this is a sign of political dysfunction. Both Senator Evans and Ms Roxon have served in senior cabinet portfolios for over five years. Let us get real: they both had long parliamentary careers. Neither will cause a by-election by resigning from parliament, neither of them will stick the taxpayers for the cost of a by-election at the conclusion of their parliamentary career. This is rather a different course of action to that taken by senior members of the Liberal and National parties in recent years. Mr McGauran, from the National Party, resigned and caused a by-election. Mr Downer resigned and caused a by-election. Mr Vaile, the leader of the National Party, resigned and caused a by-election. Dr Brendan Nelson, a very recent leader of the Liberal Party, resigned and caused a by-election. And Mr Peter Costello, who is of course Senator Brandis's political hero, resigned and caused a by-election. So it is true that people do resign and move on in politics. It is the way of things. But I consider that it is appropriate for a minister to announce their intentions prior to an election. I did it myself before the last election because I consider it to be the right thing to do. But I do not recall Mr McGauran, Mr Downer, Mr Vaile, Dr Nelson or former Treasurer Costello doing that. 


In the case of my colleague Senator Evans, he has led his party in this chamber for eight years. Few have served so long in leadership positions and I think few can match the contribution that he has made. When anyone in the Liberal Party can do so, I will be the first to say that they are in a position to pass judgement. Until then, I suggest the opposition take a more dignified approach and simply congratulate Senator Evans for his long and meritorious service.


There has been a lot of talk, and we have just heard it, about the Prime Minister's announcement of the timing of the 2013 federal election. She has announced that the writs will be issued on Monday, 12 August, with the election being held on Saturday, 14 September. I am a longstanding supporter of fixed-term elections. I am pleased that weeks of political debate in this country this year will not be focused on mindless speculation about when the election will be called and held. Hopefully this will mean that there will be more focus on the merits of the candidates and parties who contest the election. We should not forget that New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory all have fixed election dates. So the situation really is not going to be any different in relation to this year's federal election. I personally happen to think this is a good development.


In this matter of public importance the opposition again accuse the government of chronic dysfunction and maladministration. They make that claim lacking insight into their own obvious shortcomings. They make this claim without any capacity for self-reflection, without any acknowledgement that the opposition is a policy-free zone, without any admission of their own deficiencies, their own manifest weaknesses. Who could forget the leaked internal coalition documents that showed that the Liberals would have to make $70 billion in cuts to the budget over four years to pay for their promises? Who could forget Mr Abbott, Mr Hockey and Mr Robb tying themselves in knots trying to explain that disaster away? And we are still waiting for their explanation; I suspect it will not be forthcoming. We know that $70 billion in cuts would be the equivalent of stopping family tax benefit payments for three years or cutting the age pension for two years. In the absence of any policies, all we really know about Mr Abbott and his colleagues on the other side of the chamber is that they would threaten jobs and saddle Australians with the impact of a massive budget black hole. We know that they would continue to keep their heads in the sand in relation to the disastrous impacts of climate change.



Senator Joyce interjecting—




Senator FAULKNER:
  I know you laugh at that, Senator Joyce, but you are well known as a climate change denier. You are entitled to that view. You are entitled to stand up against all the science and maintain your position. Good luck to you—you will need it. We know that the coalition will ignore the Gonski recommendations and strip away millions from education, and destroy the NBN, leaving businesses and households without the benefit of a 21st century communications network. Mr Abbott and the opposition's belligerent and merciless negativity will never be a substitute for the policies needed to secure Australia's future. Senator Brandis can fulminate as much as he likes, but we all know that in September this year Australians will make a choice. Regardless of the carping of Senator Brandis and the opposition, I can assure you that the government will continue to argue its strong case—



Opposition senators interjecting—

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",Nats,2013-02-05,"



Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (16:23):  I hope building a strong Australia is nothing like the Building the Education Revolution. You go through this, and where do you start? I have just been jotting a few notes down and I thought, 'Chaos is what we need to talk about', so this should be interesting. In the historical section we have: ceiling insulation—that is where they set fire to 194 houses and, tragically, four people died; school halls were another disaster; and Grocery Watch, this voyeuristic belief that somehow staring at something changes the price. That was not good enough, so we went to Fuel Watch. Then we had the green loans. Then we had the East Timor solution. Then there was the Malaysian solution. Then there was your mate Rudd, the member for Griffith, who was removed at midnight by the faceless men, and we got the free character assessment from his colleagues: from Conroy, who has now been promoted to leader for his character assessment; from Swan, who is the Treasurer; from Crean—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Joyce, refer to those members by their correct names and titles.




Senator JOYCE:
  —the Treasurer, Mr Swan—I suppose you can call him a treasurer. Still on their historical form you have the carbon tax promise: 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead'—and then there was. We had the crazy association of this Labor-Green-Independent alliance, Green-Labor Party alliance, glee club or whatever you like to call it. Then we had the surplus promise that turned into the deficit promise. We had the live cattle debacle where we got our biggest neighbour and decided to try and make them our biggest enemy overnight. If you were not on the microform, we have the purchase of Toorale Station for $23.75 million—I have mentioned it before—without even setting a foot on the place. They observed the place from 30,000 feet as they flew to Darwin. Then we have, of course, Mr Thomson, who was going to be the member for Dobell for a long, long time. Then we had their appointment of Peter Slipper. We had the AWU slush fund. If you go right back to the start, I can remember Mr Rudd leaking the conversation that he had with the President of the United States to the front page of the paper. It just goes on. It is no wonder that it is manic. It is no wonder that it is out of control.


Then you think, 'Well that is all in the past; they have had an epiphany; they fell off their donkey on the road to Damascus, and everything is better now.' This is the only crowd who can stuff things up at work without actually being there. Before they have even come back, I turn on the television and, so help me, they have taken some person who is not even a member of the Labor party and made them the senator for the Northern Territory. Where does that come from? How do you dream these things up? We could not possibly do that to you; you're too good! We should have stayed away for weeks! You would be out of government if you had stayed away for another couple of weeks. You would have finished yourselves off. Where else are we going to have a captain's pick? I bet you they are worried in the ACT—we might get a captain's pick down here. Who are you going to pick as your senator down here? Who would know? What else is the captain's pick? It sounds almost unsanitary what she is picking!


Then we have senior ministers just resigning—they are dying like flies. Of course we get this every time: 'Don't worry. It's all under control.' The Attorney-General of the Commonwealth of Australia goes 'pop' and disappears. The 3IC—the third in charge—of the running of our nation goes 'pop' and disappears. They are just gone, and they have all got these gracious reasons of why they have got to go. I can never work out why the Attorney-General became the Attorney-General, because apparently a year ago she knew she was not going to be the Attorney-General. She must have just wanted a temporary posting in that role, because that is what the Commonwealth needs: a temporary person to run the legal system and jurisprudence of this nation! That's so logical! As soon as the Prime Minister knew about it, she should have said, 'Yes, you're going to be so important for 12 months you must stay in that role.' No, that is a completely believable situation! I am completely on board with that. Of course now we have got Mr Thomson—149 charges. I think he is over there. He is still in the building. It just goes on. All it needs is the Monty Python theme song.


On a more serious note, we have the debt that I have been talking about over and over again. The gross debt is now in excess of $262 billion, and I admit that I started banging on about this when it was $80 billion, so I have a bit of a concern about this. Since we have been here, I have seen this crowd go through the $75 billion overdraft limit, the $200 billion temporary overdraft limit, the quarter-trillion dollar limit, and now we have a $300 billion limit. Last week you borrowed $2.2 billion just for the week. It just rolls off the tongue. I will tell you that there are 2,155 companies on the Australian Stock Exchange and 2,064 of them have a capitalisation less than what you borrowed last week. Ninety-six per cent of them have a capitalisation less than what you borrowed last week. And you think that is sane? If you were buying houses in regional Australia you would buy between 6,000 and 7,000 houses with what you borrowed just last week—and that is supposed to be sane. When there was a change of government, the net financial worth—which is your financial assets less liabilities—was about $18 billion in the red. Our net worth position, which is total assets less liabilities, was actually in credit by $70 million. 


But I can tell you where we are now. In the budget papers—the general government sector net financial worth—the net financial worth of our financial assets less our liabilities is now $¼ trillion out the back door. That is our position. These are your own figures. It is going to be worse than that, because that was on the basis that this year there would be a surplus. But of course this year is going to be a deficit so it just gets worse and worse and worse.


In the meantime, whilst all this is happening, we have this scenario. I can assure you that when people hear our Prime Minister speak now, they just turn off the television. They cannot stand it. When they see our Treasurer they almost cry; they cannot believe that this person is in a role of responsibility. It is out of control. Then you hear that apparently they cannot deal with the fact that 600 farmers are being done over by an overcentralised retail market with $1 for milk. The government cannot deal with that—that is all too complicated—but they can change the temperature of the globe! With a carbon tax they can change the temperature of the globe! 


Senator Faulkner says that I deny climate change. I do not deny climate change at all. I just deny that they have the capacity to change it back. I was watching the weather intently over the Christmas break and since the carbon tax it seems to be around about where we left it last time. I thought that it was all going to be better now that the carbon tax is in. I thought that we had climate nirvana, but it is about where we left it. I want my money back. What happened to the weather? It was supposed to be fixed up by now after the carbon tax!


Dairy farmers are being ripped off. Small businesses are so much under the pump. The high street is so much under the pump. They are doing it tough. As for the infrastructure, where is inland rail? What happened to it? They put $30 million towards it. They put more towards advertising than they do towards looking after regional Australia's crucial infrastructure. This is the result of what we have got.


I once had a boss who, when he looked at a set of books, would always say to me, 'If you did not laugh, you would cry,' and that is how we feel about our nation at the moment. It is pathetic. It is so out of control that if you did not laugh, you would cry. And grinning over it all is the Cheshire cat, Kevin the cat. We can see what is going to happen. We can see it a mile away. The press are around him—they are leaking; it is all coming back. They have just come to the epiphany that they are about to lose their job, and all of a sudden we can see turmoil and craziness about to break out into its next stage. When I see a big smiley face on the member for Griffith, I know that he is not going anywhere but back into an office that is between here and the other chamber on the other side on the blue carpet. 

",Senate,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Gillard Government</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,10,1,speech
"Urquhart, Sen Anne",ALP,2013-02-05,"



Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania) (16:33):  I rise to speak on today's matter of public importance submitted by the opposition on the record of the Gillard Labor government. I am particularly proud of this record and particularly proud of Labor's plan for Australia's future. We have just heard a lengthy diatribe from those opposite, seeking to talk down this record as though working to secure the jobs of hardworking Australian families through the greatest economic challenge since the Great Depression is a bad thing. This government has stayed focused on securing the jobs of working Australians throughout our term, and what better marker of ongoing success than the creation of more than 800,000 jobs during the worst of economic times around the globe. When nations around the world were putting their hands in the air, this Labor government got on with the job of governing, of assisting the community to build vital roads and classrooms and assisting business to create jobs. Everyone in this place knows the fantastic job done throughout the global financial crisis by the Labor government. Labor's fast, targeted action to stimulate the economy has seen our economy now 10 per cent larger than before the GFC, while many other advanced economies are still smaller than they were before the global crisis.


I would like to list five economic statistics that show that as things stand Australia's economy is tracking along quite nicely. They are: (1) annual GDP growth is 3.1 per cent, around the long-term target of three per cent; (2) the annual inflation rate is 2.2 per cent, nicely within the Reserve Bank's target range; (3) the unemployment rate is 5.4 per cent and, while never low enough, it is well below the average of the Howard government; (4) the annual wage-price index is at 3.7 per cent, just 1.5 per cent higher than the inflation rate, giving working Australians more opportunities each year, and; (5) the standard variable mortgage rate is 6.45 per cent, which is making home ownership affordable for many Australians. These five statistics highlight that the Australian economy is tracking very well.


And just for the fun of it, I would like to add a sixth, a sixth that definitely would not be possible without the interventionist approach the Labor government took in 2008 and 2009 to stimulate the Australian economy. The sixth is that starting with the Hawke-Keating Labor government, Australia has achieved 21 years of consecutive economic growth. During these 21 years, with roughly half under a Labor government and half under a Liberal government, sustained reforms began with the Hawke and Keating governments, continued through to the Rudd and Gillard governments—like the reforms and quick action we took in 2008 and 2009 to stimulate the economy—and continue to set Australia up as a great place to work, to do business and to raise a family. I would like to turn my focus to the great achievements of the Rudd and Gillard Labor governments for the electorate of Braddon, in north-west Tasmania, where I live. We have had achievements across health, education, roads, rail and ports, tourism, industry development and innovation. North-west Tasmania always does better with a Labor government. Federal Labor has delivered two GP superclinics for north-west Tasmania, one in Burnie and one in Devonport. It was interesting to read in our local paper, the Advocate, earlier this week when Senator Colbeck was caught knee-deep in the mud. Senator Colbeck was caught trying to sling mud at the proprietors of the Devonport superclinic for not accepting new patients when a quick call to the clinic would have alleviated his concern. In fact there are three new doctors now taking new patients at the clinic. Together with the Burnie clinic, the strain is being taken off the emergency departments at the North West Regional Hospital and the Mersey Community Hospital. People who do not need the high level of care of an emergency department are being seen within the community—a Labor reform that is saving the community money and keeping people from the stress of going to hospital.




Senator Brandis:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order that is directed to relevance. I know that there is a lot of latitude given in these MPI debates and that the topic is broad, but the topic in fact is about the incompetence and dysfunction of the Gillard government. I am a little at a loss to see how an attack on Senator Richard Colbeck in relation to the Mersey hospital is relevant at all to the topic of the MPI.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Bernardi
): Senator Urquhart, I would draw your attention to the topic of the MPI.




Senator URQUHART:
  I was, in my opinion, getting to the topic, and I will keep going.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Getting to the topic is not sufficient; you need to be on the topic.




Senator URQUHART:
  I was on the topic, with respect, and I will continue. While keeping people out of hospital is the goal, Labor has significantly refurbished the only Commonwealth owned hospital, the Mersey Community Hospital in Latrobe. Labor committed in 2007 to following through with the Commonwealth takeover of the hospital and, since then, has ensured that it is a valuable community asset. With over $200 million in investment, a significant boost on previous agreements for the hospital, there have been major refurbishments and the purchase of new equipment. Where the Coalition has seen and used this hospital as a political plaything, Labor has got on with the job of delivering a funding boost and ensuring that the people of north-west Tasmania get access to the quality health care they deserve. Importantly, the hospital is being run by the Tasmanian government as part of the north-west Tasmanian health system. With two quality hospitals within 40 minutes' drive, the Tasmanian hospital system is able to provide specialist care and services in either one facility or the other. This maximises the services available to north-west Tasmanians.


Labor has not stopped with just a refurbishment to suit existing conditions and existing staff. Ever with an eye to the future, we have invested over $1 million in a centre of excellence in clinical education at the Mersey hospital. This centre of excellence is ensuring that existing staff at the hospital are continuing their professional development, and it allows for the training of doctors and nurses and for allied health professionals to access quality training in their discipline.


Along the coast, in Burnie, Labor is on track to deliver a regional cancer clinic to provide treatment and support to north-west and west coast residents suffering from cancer. This $16½ million investment is the result of tremendous lobbying by the member for Braddon, Mr Sid Sidebottom, and the community at large, which unfortunately has the second-highest incidence of cancer in the country. When it opens, most north-west Tasmanians will not have to travel that distance away from their support networks, while those in the remote parts of the region will have less distance to travel.


Turning to education, no-one can drive across north-west Tasmania without noticing the 65 schools that were enhanced through the Building the Education Revolution. From the over $6 million invested in new classrooms at the amalgamated Romaine Park Primary School, in Upper Burnie, to the new $2 million science centres at Ulverstone High School and Yolla District High School that are giving students hands-on experience at botany, biology and applied science, these are real investments in the learning environment of students and in facilities for teachers. They are not overpriced school halls that the opposition so often shout about in this place. It is interesting that, when they are in here or when we catch them on a news interview, those opposite are more than happy to talk down these investments in school infrastructure which they know provided a much-needed boost to the schools both in Braddon and right across the country.


My advice to those opposite in this election year is simple: do not talk about them. Just pretend they do not exist, because we are really proud of them on this side of the chamber and we know millions of Australian children and their parents are proud of them too. Take the multipurpose halls and libraries that were built across the north-west coast, including at Spreyton Primary School. These halls are now the pride of a community like Spreyton, and they can be used after hours by other groups and on weekends to run events. A new library provides a warm and welcoming environment for students to become excited by reading, setting them up for a lifetime of learning. 


Across the north-west, Labor's Nation Building Program has boosted the economic infrastructure that gets the fantastic goods our region produces to market and the social infrastructure of sporting halls and facilities and nature reserves. The new swimming pool at Devonport will enable year-round swimming lessons and recreation in an undercover pool for the people of the north-west. The shared pathways built from Ulverstone to Turners Beach and from Burnie through to Somerset are a now vital piece of community infrastructure connecting outer suburbs, with little or no public transport, to the larger centres. To see the hundreds of children and their families using these paths after school and on the weekends is evidence that they are worth every cent—families that no doubt receive the Schoolkids Bonus, a twice yearly payment designed specifically to help with cost-of-living pressures associated with raising a family and getting kids back to school. Most of these same families that use this pathway and benefit from the Schoolkids Bonus are benefitting now from the low-income superannuation co-contribution and cuts to taxes delivered by Labor. These are measures that this Labor government has implemented to make it easier for families to make ends meet, but those opposite would take them all away. They would take away the tax cuts, take away the boost to retirement savings and take away the cash assistance to help with the costs of raising kids.


Today the issue raised is about dysfunction, and we are here to talk about dysfunction. It is well and truly on display with the priorities of those opposite.

The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Bernardi
) (16:44):  In accordance with the usual practice and with the concurrence of the Senate the government response will be incorporated in Hansard.




The 
response
 read as follows—





Government response to the recommendations in the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade
'
s inquiry into Australia
'
s trade and investment relations with Asia, the Pacific and Latin America





APEC





Recommendation 1





Work towards the admission of India to membership of APEC as soon as possible.



Australia supports India's membership of APEC and will consider the manner in which we might support India in gaining membership.


The Government notes that while the moratorium on new APEC members expired in 2010, APEC economies have not yet agreed to re-open the issue. A number of economies have expressed interest in joining APEC. The admission of any new member would require consensus amongst all APEC economies.




Recommendation 2





That Australia continues to strongly support the work in APEC on the identification and elimination of choke points in regional supply chains and the development of modern and efficient communications networks.



Australia has taken a lead role in this work in APEC through the development of APEC's supply-chain connectivity work program. At its November 2010 Summit, APEC Leaders endorsed eight Supply-chain Action Plans to improve logistics in the APEC region. APEC Leaders also set a 10 per cent improvement target for the performance of regional supply-chains by 2015, taking into account each economy's circumstances. A mid-term assessment of progress toward this goal is due in 2013.


Australia worked closely with other APEC economies, particularly Singapore, Japan and the United States, to identify chokepoints to the smooth flow of goods, services and business travellers throughout the region.


The Supply-chain Action Plans aim to:


make logistics regulations more transparent;


address inadequate logistics infrastructure;


provide capacity-building for logistics sub-providers;


improve goods clearance at the border;


reduce burdensome customs procedures;


build capacity in multi-modal transport networks;


address variations in cross-border communications standards; and


improve regional cross-border customs transit arrangements.


Australia is leading work on the Action Plans dealing with inadequate logistics infrastructure and variations in cross-border communications standards. Australia is working on three projects relating to logistics: a review of best practice in logistics associations in APEC economies; development of standards for safe use of heavy road vehicles; and a proposal to address deficiencies in information infrastructure linking major seaports. In pursuing work under these Action Plans, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade works closely with the Department of Infrastructure and Transport and the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, and other government agencies.


As lead economy for the Action Plans on cross-border communications standards, Australia has coordinated work programs to improve means for maintaining the resilience of submarine telecommunications cables and, through cyber security initiatives, promoted a trusted and safe online environment.




Recommendation 3





That Australia continues to set an example to other APEC member economies by: (i) maintaining its momentum towards trade liberalisation; and (ii) encouraging the APEC membership to push strongly for a positive and forward-looking outcome in the Doha Round,



The Government is working actively to ensure that Australia remains a model economy in APEC by continuing its trade liberalisation program.


In 2011 the World Trade Organization's (WTO) Trade Policy Review concluded that Australia has one of the most open economies in the world, and a trade policy framework characterised by an unusually high degree of transparency. Unilateral reductions in tariffs have reduced the average applied ""most favoured nation"" tariff rate to 3.1 per cent, from 3.8 per cent in 2006; further unilateral reductions will continue through to 2015.


Australia remains strongly committed to trade liberalisation — negotiation of improved access for Australian exporters to overseas markets to generate prosperity — as well as ongoing domestic reform. The Government's domestic reform agenda (skills enhancement, better infrastructure, taxation reform, a seamless national economy and innovation) will help ensure that Australian exporters are internationally competitive and can take advantage of the opportunities offered by trade liberalisation.


Australia has a strong record in encouraging the APEC membership to push strongly for a positive and forward-looking outcome in multilateral trade liberalisation negotiations_ At the Vladivostok APEC Summit in September 2012, APEC Leaders called for fresh thinking to explore new and credible approaches to the WTO Doha Round negotiations. Australian efforts helped secure this approach, which included the possibility of advancing parts of the Doha agenda, such as trade facilitation, based on consensus. APEC Leaders also reaffirmed their pledge against protectionism, through a standstill on trade barriers through to 2015.




Trade Facilitation





Recommendation 4





That the Australian Government commit itself to a concerted effort to lift Australia into the top 20 countries in the World Bank
'
s list of economies having the easiest trade access.



The Government agrees with the Committee's recommendation that it is important to do more to improve and enhance Australia's trade access through trade facilitation measures.


Promoting trade facilitation through a commitment to a regulatory environment that minimises barriers to business is a priority for the Government.


The Government is delivering an effective border protection regime for the Australian community by regulating and facilitating legitimate trade. The strategies undertaken to achieve this goal include:


minimising the regulatory burden at the border so that goods are delivered in the most efficient and cost-effective way;


co-designing Australian trade, industry and border protection policies with strategic partners in a way that minimises the impact on legitimate trade;


intelligence-led risk-based interventions at the border to detect and prevent the import or export of prohibited items;


the effective delivery of industry assistance through advance rulings on classification, valuation and origin and tariff concession arrangements;


encouraging Australia's trading partners to minimise regulatory burden at the border through capacity building activities and bilateral and multilateral trade negotiations; and


implementing and managing Australia's international commitments under free trade agreements, the International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System, and WTO agreements.


In APEC, Australia is a strong supporter of work to improve trade facilitation. APEC economies were able to achieve reductions in trade transaction costs (by five per cent between 2002 and 2006 and a further five per cent by 2010) through a range of initiatives targeting movement of goods, alignment of standards, business mobility and electronic commerce. The World Bank estimates that APEC-driven improvements in customs procedures, regulatory cooperation, logistics and infrastructure delivered US$58.7 billion in savings for business between 2007 and 2010..


Australia continues to lead work on trade facilitation in APEC economies including through supporting the Services Trade Access Requirements (STAR) Database and APEC's supply chain connectivity agenda. The STAR database is a business-friendly, on-line tool to help services providers from all APEC economies take advantage of new export opportunities by increasing their awareness of the regulatory requirements to trade and invest.


In the WTO, Australia is pushing strongly for an agreement on trade facilitation. Potentially 44 per cent of the benefits of the Doha Round are estimated to emanate from a trade facilitation agreement. The trade facilitation negotiations would lead to more modern, efficient customs clearance procedures and better cooperation between the customs authorities of WTO Members. This would markedly reduce the time it takes for goods to be processed and cleared, resulting in real reductions in the costs of trading.




Recommendation 5





That Australia work towards the complete introduction of paperless trading as soon as possible and that it encourage and, where necessary, assist its trading partners to achieve the same outcome.



The Australian Government commenced work in 2005 to examine the feasibility of introducing an agreed international trade data standard supported by information technology systems, including a single window that would enable linking of trade data across government and industry to facilitate data re-use and pre-population.


Work continued through the International Trade Cluster of the Standard Business Reporting (SBR) initiative, led by Treasury in 2007. A Business Case concluded that the Integrated Cargo System (ICS), implemented in 2005 and operated by Australian Customs and Border Protection Service, already provided a single window for the bulk of international trade-related reporting to Australian Government for import and export cargo.


At the border the ICS facilitates paperless clearance for 99.5 per cent of imports and 99.7 per cent of exports transactions. For a small proportion of transactions, border agencies request the presentation and sighting of trade documents to complete risk assessment. In some instances, exporters and importers may present trade documents electronically to border agencies. Ongoing work on paperless interaction includes advanced testing of the feasibility to electronically submit declarations in the postal environment and for household personal effects, which are currently paper based transactions. The aim is that electronic solutions would constitute 100 per cent of postal declarations and around 68 per cent of personal effects consignments.


Other initiatives are currently being investigated across Government to improve the range of electronically accessible trade documents, including permits, which would then further facilitate electronic clearance.


Drawing on the experience and lessons learned in developing and implementing the ICS as the Australian national single window paperless trading capability, Australian Government agencies are active participants in bilateral discussions and international forums. Such opportunities both leverage and assist Australia's efforts for success in paperless trading and facilitate timely dissemination and adoption of ""best practice outcomes"" by Australia and its trading partners.




Recommendation 6





That Australia should strongly encourage the complete acceptance of the APEC Business Travel Card by the remaining members of APEC; and also explore the possibility of establishing a similar arrangement with other trading partners, e.g. non APEC economies in Latin America, the EU and India.



The Government agrees that Australia should be encouraging the acceptance of the APEC Business Travel Card by the remaining members of APEC.


Through the APEC Business Mobility Group, Australia and other APEC economies have strongly encouraged the small number of APEC economies that have yet to finalise arrangements to transition to full membership of the APEC Business Travel Card scheme.


The Government continues to explore facilitative visa arrangements with Australia's trading partners in APEC and other regions, including with India, and with countries in Latin America and in the European Union.




Recommendation 7





That Australia should take a leading role in working towards the improvement of supply-chain processes in APEC and in encouraging other trading partners to undertake a similar program.



Australia is playing a leading role in improving supply chain processes in APEC.


The Department of Infrastructure and Transport (DIT) is undertaking an AusAID funded project to enable Indonesia, Papua New Guinea (PNG) and Vietnam to develop their own industry-based logistics associations in partnership between industry and government. Australia, Singapore and Thailand are providing expert advice to the project. The project seeks to enhance information flows and coordination among government agencies on policies affecting the logistics sector. It will develop a National Logistics Association (N LA) generic template and deliver a compendium of NLA best practices and benefits.


This project has been a catalyst for PNG to establish its first National Logistics Association (PNG-LA). The Australian Logistics Council is assisting PNG develop sound governance and reporting arrangements. The PNG-LA will act as a single voice for PNG's supply chain industry needs in interacting with relevant PNG authorities on key logistics issues.


In addition, DIT has played a leading role in developing a methodology for measuring progress towards the goal agreed by APEC leaders of achieving 10 per cent improvement of supply-chain performance in terms of reduction of time, cost and uncertainty by 2015.




Recommendation 8





That, in view of the benefits arising from the Export Market Development Grants Scheme, it should continue indefinitely and be fully funded to 
provide certainty for exporters seeking to widen their overseas market focus.



The Government has extended the Export Market Development Grants (EMDG) Scheme to the 2015-16 grant year and is committed to working with industry to maximise the benefit of the EMDG Scheme within the total funding that is available.


In the Mid-year Economic and Fiscal Outlook 2012-13, the Government announced it would retarget the Export Market Development Grants program towards emerging and frontier markets, with a focus on Asian markets. This measure complements the recent review of Austrade, which recommended that Austrade's export promotion work be undertaken in the world's emerging and frontier markets as this is where Australian businesses can benefit most from government support.




Latin 
America





Recommendation 9





The Sub-Committee considers that the introduction of electronic visa applications would be an excellent, and inexpensive, way to assist in improving trade and investment relations with the countries of Latin America. It would have valuable spin-off benefits for the tourism industry and would also facilitate business travel to Australia.



The Government agrees, and believes that the introduction of electronic visa applications would be an inexpensive way to assist in improving trade and investment relations with the countries of Latin America.


For foreign nationals intending to visit Australia for business or other reasons, including for citizens from countries in Latin America, the Government, through the Department of Immigration and Citizenship, has increased the number of visa categories accessible through electronic lodgement in recent years. In particular, the Government has extended electronic lodgement to client groups who have demonstrated compliance with visa conditions.


On 15 February 2012 Argentine and Brazilian nationals became eligible to apply online for a Tourist visa (Subclass 676), known as ""e676"". Chilean nationals became eligible to access the e676 service on 20 September 2011.


In 2013-14, the Government intends to progressively roll out online visitor visa applications to citizens of all countries.




Recommendation 10





The Sub-Committee recommends that the Government review the processing of applications by skilled migrants and, where appropriate, seek ways to fast track the recognition of their skills.



The Government continues to review procedures to achieve the most responsive processing times possible to enable employers to meet their skilled employment needs. In May 2011 the Government committed A$10 million over four years to fund a new processing centre with the aim of reducing the median processing time of Temporary Business (Long Stay) visas (Subclass 457) to 10 days for ""decision-ready"" applications.


Australia has a transparent and accountable system for processing applications for recognition of the skills of migrants to Australia. There is a national system of legally authorised organisations for nominated skilled occupations that process applications by individuals for recognition of qualifications for skills gained overseas. These assessing bodies are legally independent, professional organisations, and in general terms the Government has no statutory role in their assessment processes. DIAC continues to work with the various third parties involved in assessing aspects of visa applications (including skills assessments) to ensure that these processes are as transparent and responsive as possible.




Recommendation 11





The Sub-Committee also recommends that urgent attention he given to achieving mutual recognition of university qualification between Australia and the countries of Latin America. This would assist the efforts of Australia
'
s universities to attract post
­graduate students, who might otherwise go to American or British universities. It would also assist tourism through attracting the relatives and friends of such students to visit Australia.



The Government notes the desirability of achieving mutual recognition of university qualifications. To this end, Australia has signed Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) on mutual recognition of qualifications with Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Peru.


Australia is a signatory to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Lisbon Recognition Convention and as such has in place policies and procedures for transparent, timely and defensible recognition of foreign qualifications, including those from Latin America.


In 2011 there were 31,450 student enrolments from Latin American countries. Of these, 12.4 per cent were in the higher education sector, 31 per cent were in the vocational, education and training (VET) sector and 53.7 per cent were in the English Language Intensive Courses for Overseas Students (ELICOS) sector. By country of origin, the top four student enrolments were from Brazil (15,266 enrolments or 48.4 per cent), Colombia (8,923 or 28.3 per cent), Peru (1,985 or 6.3 per cent) and Chile (1,974 or 6.3 per cent).


In 2011 there were 2,042 students from countries in Latin America enrolled in post graduate degrees at Australian universities. This represented an increase of 2.5 per cent on the 2010 post graduate enrolments from Latin America.


Australia established the Australian Education International-National Office for Overseas Skills Recognition (AEI-NOOSR) as its National Information Centre after signing the UNESCO Lisbon Recognition Convention in 2002. The National Information Centre promotes international student and labour market mobility through qualifications recognition, including qualifications gained by individuals from accredited educational and training institutions in Latin America. The National Information Centre is an easily accessible information resource that responds to inquiries about recognition overseas of Australian degrees and provides advice on authorised processes in Australia that assess qualifications gained by individuals in institutions in other countries.


In Australia, admission to professional practice may require registration at the national or state and territory level, or membership of the relevant professional body. Recognition of professional qualifications for the purposes of admission to practice, including qualifications gained overseas, is carried out by professional bodies which assess individuals and their qualifications against the relevant professional standards. Admission to professional occupations in Australia requires a specialised academic higher education qualification at degree level and, in some cases, relevant experience. In Australia, national, state and territory authorities regulate a number of professional occupations, relying on professional standards developed in conjunction with the relevant professional bodies. Professional bodies responsible for recognition processes often accredit higher education programs in the relevant disciplines and maintain close relationships with higher education institutions.


Australian professional bodies can and do establish their own mutual recognition agreements with their overseas counterparts.


AEI-NOOSR has a supportive relationship with higher education institutions and professional bodies. The National Information Centre provides broad information support services about the comparability of overseas qualifications in Australia, including through Country Education Profiles (CEP) Online, an easily accessible information resource designed as a general recognition guideline. CEP Online describes the education systems of overseas countries and provides assessment guidelines on the comparability of many overseas qualifications to Australian qualifications on the Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF). In Australia, foreign qualifications are compared to qualifications on the AQF (www.aqf edu.au).


The CEP guidelines provide information on qualifications in 13 countries in Latin America. For countries that are not included in CEP Online, AEI-NOOSR provides information on the recognition of overseas qualifications to institutions and individuals.




Recommendation 12





Allied to the previous recommendation, the Sub-Committee recommends the adoption of a 
""
working holiday
""
 scheme for visitors from Latin America. At present, visitors from 27 countries 
can access such arrangements, but of the Latin American countries only Chile is included in that list.



The Government agrees that adding more Latin American countries to the ""working holiday"" scheme would be of benefit to Australia. The Government concluded a review of the Working Holiday Maker program in 2010. Based on the review's conclusions, the Government initiated a work program of negotiations with several countries for new reciprocal Work and Holiday (Subclass 462) visa arrangements. The Government may add other countries to the negotiations schedule in the future, subject to wider bilateral considerations and Australian economic and labour market conditions.


Foreign Governments may register interest in Australia's reciprocal Work and Holiday (Subclass 462) visa arrangements through contact with the Australian Department of Immigration and Citizenship, or through contact with an Australian embassy, high commission or consulate overseas.


Australia and Argentina implemented new reciprocal Work and Holiday visa (Subclass 462) arrangements in February 2012. Australia and Mexico commenced negotiations in late 2010 for a capped Work and Holiday visa arrangement. Australia responded to Mexico's queries on proposed legislative limitations, and negotiations on a draft text are progressing well. Australia is currently in the final stages of negotiations with Uruguay on a Work and Holiday Memorandum of Understanding. The new arrangements are expected to commence early 2013.


Recommendation 13




All of the Latin American Ambassadors indicated how much they appreciated visits by Ministers, particularly at the head of business delegations, and by Parliamentary representatives. The Sub-Committee recommends that increased priority be assigned to visits such as these to the countries of Latin America — in line with the





Government 
'
s declared intention to engage more closely with Latin America and the Caribbean.



The Government sees value in increased visits to Latin America by Ministers and Parliamentary representatives.


In June 2012 Prime Minister Julia Gillard visited Mexico and Brazil. Prime Minister Gillard and Brazil's President Dilma Rousseff announced that the Australia-Brazil relationship would be elevated to the level of a strategic partnership.


In December 2011 Australia's then Minister for Foreign Affairs (Kevin Rudd) visited Mexico and El Salvador. He also visited Mexico in September 2011, and again in February 2012 for the G20 informal Foreign Ministers' Meeting.


In April 2012 Australia's Minister for Trade and Competitiveness, Dr Craig Emerson, visited Brazil, Chile and Colombia, with business delegations, for bilateral discussions, and attended the G20 Trade Ministers' Meeting in Mexico.


Parliamentary Secretary Richard Marles visited Uruguay in December 2011 and Venezuela and the Caribbean in January- February 2012, and the Caribbean again in May and September 2012.


In January 2012 the Prime Minister's Special Envoy (for Latin America and the Caribbean) visited Mexico, Nicaragua and Guatemala. In May 2012 the Special Envoy visited the Dominican Republic, Panama, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay.


At the Parliamentary level, Senate President Senator the Hon John Hogg has played a strong role supporting Australia-Latin America relations. He hosts two functions annually for the Latin American Ambassadors and parliamentary colleagues. In 2009, he visited Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Mexico. In 2011, he visited Peru.


The Government will continue to identify opportunities for Australian Ministerial and Parliamentary visits to countries in Latin America.




Recommendation 14





That COAG make improved cooperation between the Commonwealth and the States, and between the States themselves, a high priority — to achieve higher levels of efficiency in the transport and logistics supply chains, provision of infrastructure, and trade facilitation.



The Council of Australian Governments (COAG) seeks to improve cooperation between the Commonwealth and the States and Territories to respond to the challenges facing Australia. One of the strategic themes agreed by COAG in early 2011 to focus its agenda is a national economy that is driven by our competitive advantages. Under this theme, COAG is pursuing a number of microeconomic reforms; regulatory and competition reforms; infrastructure investment; and the use of new digital technologies to drive productivity.


In September 2011 COAG established the Standing Council on Transport and Infrastructure (SCOTI). Members of SCOTT are Commonwealth, State, Territory and New Zealand Ministers with responsibility for transport and infrastructure issues, and a representative, at Councillor level, of the Australian Local Government Association. The Council pursues and monitors issues of national significance which require sustained, collaborative effort in the areas of transport, logistics and infrastructure. An example of this is the recent completion of the National Land Freight Strategy.




The Pacific





Recommendation 15





The Sub-Committee expressed its satisfaction that AusAID has given some emphasis to gender issues in negotiations with the Pacific Islands Forum countries. It proposes that these issues should continue to be advanced by DFAT and AusAID as a priority.



The Government continues to advance gender issues and gender equality in Forum Island countries. In September 2011, Prime Minister Julia Gillard appointed Australia's first Global Ambassador for Women and Girls. The Ambassador works to support Australia's objective to empower women and girls around the world.


Australia has offered assistance to Forum Island countries for country specific research on the Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations (PACER) Plus. While Australia does not determine the scope of these reports, gender is one issue that Forum Island countries may address. Gender awareness is also integrated into Australian funded trade training for Pacific Island trade officials.


In addition, the Prime Minister announced a new $320 million, 10 year commitment to expand Australia's support to empower women and promote gender equality across the Pacific. Announced at the 2012 Pacific Islands Forum, this initiative aims to increase:


the number of women in leadership and decision making roles at national and local levels by training and mentoring current female MPs and candidates;


economic opportunities for women through improving access to financial services and produce markets; and


safety for women through improved services, violence prevention and access to justice.


This work will be supported by efforts to:


change social attitudes about roles and status; 


increase advocacy for women's equality; and


improve health and education outcomes for women and girls.


This builds on support Australia currently provides for gender equality in the Pacific. It includes efforts to improve access to finance, reduce barriers to women's participation in business, leadership training and efforts to eliminate violence against women.

Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (16:46):  I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the response by the Premier of South Australia and the New South Wales Minister for Industrial Relations to the motion on domestic violence.


Leave granted.




Senator RHIANNON:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the response.


I welcome the commitments made by the New South Wales industrial relations minister and the South Australia premier in response to the Senate motion on women, employment and domestic violence. Any progress in improving work conditions and entitlements for women experiencing domestic violence and their rights at work are obviously welcome.


While great work has been done to achieve the situation whereby currently one million Australian workers are covered by some type of domestic violence clause or policy in the enterprise bargaining agreement or award, progress has been piecemeal—agreement by agreement. State governments have also been working to introduce provisions, including New South Wales, Tasmania, South Australia and the Northern Territory.


As a result of the bargaining, some workers have access to dedicated, additional and paid family and domestic leave. Domestic violence clauses can also provide such things as protections against adverse action and access to flexible work arrangements. But what is sorely needed is national action to support these women, and that was the essence of our motion. Even of these one million workers covered by domestic violence provisions, only a portion are protected by all seven ideal principles of a domestic and family violence clause as set out and endorsed by the ACTU.


While a woman may be able to access leave for domestic violence matters, she may have no recourse if her employer dismisses her for domestic violence related issues such as a dip in productivity or being late for work. We need national requirements and standards rather than a drip process whereby individual workplaces make positive changes.


The Australian Law Reform Commission has recommended that the federal government consider including paid domestic violence leave and other provisions as a right in the National Employment Standards. Again, this is backed by the ACTU. We also need antidiscrimination protection to help address the stigma and fear of disclosure at work.


This is the time, before the next election, for real action on this issue by the Labor government to support the between 15 and 17 per cent of women who are affected by domestic violence. Allowing women to remain at work is essential to reduce the effects of this violence.


To finish: I would like to share a real-life story set out in a recent article in the Human Rights Defender by the Safe at Home, Safe at Work project.


Sylvia worked as a community support worker. She was experiencing domestic violence from her husband who also came into her workplace. She was often late for work and the violence was impacting on her performance generally. Sylvia was eventually terminated for performance issues (lateness). Sylvia then left the relationship. She obtained a domestic violence protection order against her husband which covered her in her workplace.


Sylvia applied to work at another organisation. She did very well at the interview and was sure they would offer her work which they did. The new employer then rang the former employer for a reference. He told them that she'd had heaps of personal and family problems, that there'd been issues with attendance and that the abusive husband had been coming on to work premises causing problems.


This paints a clear picture of white national action is urgently needed.


Question agreed to.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (17:08):  On behalf of Senator Boyce, the deputy chair, I present the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Service Providers and Other Governance Measures) Bill 2012, together with the Hansard record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.


Ordered that the report be printed.




Senator CORMANN:
  by leave—I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


This is the fourth tranche of the so-called MySuper package of bills. This package of bills seeks to create a legislated and regulated default superannuation product and prescribe in legislation the features that any default superannuation product has to comply with in order to be eligible for registration as a default super product named MySuper. The first observation is that this has been a very disjointed process. Instead of being able to consider this initiative as a whole—an initiative that we have, incidentally, supported in principle—the government has been coming forward with one bit of legislation after another, which has been very disruptive to the industry and very disruptive to people in superannuation. Having said that, this is meant to be the last MySuper bill and is meant to bring to a conclusion the legislating of the government's MySuper default superannuation initiative. So we on the coalition side are more concerned about what is not in the legislation than what is actually on the table in front of the Senate right now.


One of the big omissions from this legislation is the provision to ensure that superannuation boards across Australia have appropriate provision for independent directors. You would be aware that, as part of the corporate governance arrangements in superannuation, industry funds currently operate under what is called the equal representation model. We have heard much about the union dominated nature of that approach and some of the concerns that flow from that. Do not take our word on this—do not take our word about the need for concern about union dominated super funds. This is a concern that came from no less than Mr Jeremy Cooper, who, on behalf of the current Labor government, chaired a review into superannuation. If I can put this into context, we on the coalition side think that we need to continue to work towards achieving the most efficient, most transparent and most competitive superannuation system possible with appropriately high corporate governance standards. Only when we have the most efficient, the most transparent and the most competitive superannuation system, with appropriately high corporate governance standards where conflicts of interest are properly managed and there is appropriate corporate governance in terms of the independence of directors on these boards and so on, will we be able to ensure that the retirement savings of people across Australia are properly looked after and maximised.


I will quote some of the findings of the Cooper review, which Minister Shorten and the Labor government have steadfastly ignored because they are more focused on the vested interests of the union movement than on the public interest when it comes to corporate governance arrangements in superannuation. Mr Cooper, of the Cooper review, made these findings in relation to the current corporate governance arrangements and described the reasons as to why the current system is no longer contemporary or appropriate. He said:


The superannuation system has moved substantially away from single‐employer defined benefit funds that were dominant in 1993—


which is when these arrangements first came into play. He went on to say:


The introduction of fund choice, together with the prevalence of defined contribution funds today, materially changes (and in many cases severs) the close relationship that previously existed between the employer and the super fund.


The … representatives on many trustee boards are … are nominated by third party organisations, such as … trade unions. Current employment and industrial relations practices mean that these organisations do not necessarily represent all employers or all employees. Thus, the democracy that the equal representation policy appears to embed in the governance of superannuation funds is not always present in reality. The equal representation model also could result in a perception that individual trustee‐directors are required to answer to the organisation that appointed them in respect of trustee decisions or that they are dictated to by that organisation.


That is, of course, exactly what is happening and that is exactly what we are concerned about on the coalition side. He continued:


The large number of employers, employer organisations and employee organisations related to a fund can sometimes result in trustee boards being far larger than makes sense for efficient governance of that fund.


Equal representation leaves significant groups 'unrepresented.' Key among these are members who are pensioners … and members who have joined the fund because they exercised fund choice. These groups of members, already sizeable in some funds, can be expected to grow in the future.


This is the point: superannuation now is big business. We need to make sure that the corporate governance arrangements and standards reflect the changed nature of superannuation. Just because the union movement wants to desperately hold on to this legacy power and influence—this legacy hold that they have had over people's superannuation—is not a good enough reason for the parliament to protect those sorts of arrangements of the past. It is time to move forward; it is time to ensure that the corporate governance arrangements for superannuation are more contemporary and that they reflect the 21st century circumstances and context. We will be moving amendments when this legislation comes before the Senate to give effect to the Cooper review recommendation that there should be appropriate provision for independent directors on superannuation boards.


Furthermore, this legislation does not address a significant inadequacy that was previously raised by stakeholders right across the board in a bipartisan fashion, dare I say it. Retail funds, industry funds, self-managed super fund representatives—everybody who has talked to us about this legislation—say that it is unfair that at present it super fund trustees are not allowed to cap the fees that are being charged to Australians that find themselves in MySuper funds, these default super funds.


The proposition is this: under the legislation as it currently stands and as it has been put forward by Minister Shorten, if you have $1,000 in an account you might end up paying $30 in fees on a percentage basis of 0.3 per cent, say. If you have $10,000 in that account, you will end up paying the same percentage; if you have $1,000,000 in that account you pay the same percentage. You might end up paying $3,000 where somebody else pays $300 or $30 when the increased value that you receive from the service that is provided is not equivalent to that increased level of fee. Up to a point, it might be appropriate to have an increased fee with increased account balances. But there should be an opportunity for super fund trustees to cap that at an appropriate level. At the point when the fee in dollar terms becomes so high that it no longer reflects the cost of providing the service the super fund trustee should be able to act in the best interests of members who find themselves in default superannuation—and these are members who have not made active choices. The super fund trustee should be able to cut those fees. We will be moving amendments to that effect.


Let me make the general point that this government has had overall a very bad track record when it comes to superannuation. They have imposed more than $8 billion in additional taxes on people saving for their retirement over the last four years. And that is so far. The Labor Party will get all excited by that, because they think that they have something. They think that they can attack us because we have said for a very long time that we would not be proceeding with their low-income superannuation tax offset, which they linked to the mining tax. But it is not funded. It is a measure that, if this government were re-elected at the next election, they would scrap because they would have to. They would scrap it because it is not funded; they would scrap it because the mining tax has not raised any meaningful revenue.


Senator Thistlethwaite will jump up and down and say, 'No, we won't; no, we won't'—just like they said that we will not have a carbon tax under the government led by Julia Gillard and like they said in 2008 that they would not change superannuation, proceeding to reduce the government superannuation co-contribution scheme from $1,500 down to $500, targeting low-income earners. And like they said in 2010 that they would never, ever tax superannuation payments for people over 60. Now they are looking at doing exactly that. You cannot ever trust what Labor says before the election. They will tell everyone that they are targeting the rich and the wealthy but after the election they will target the middle class and low-income earners, as they always do. (Time expired)

Senator THISTLETHWAITE
 (New South Wales) (17:19):  I rise to make a short contribution on the report of the Joint Committee on Corporations on Financial Services regarding its inquiry into the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Service Providers and Other Governance Measures) Bill. This bill is the fourth tranche of the government's MySuper reforms. It deals with governance elements in the stronger super reform package. Australia's superannuation system was a very complex beast, and the architecture reflected the wealth of changes that have been made since 1992, often reflecting the different ideological views of the major parties regarding retirement incomes policy in this country. As it changed it became more and more complex, and as it became more and more complex fund managers and product writers found new ways to make money, often at the expense of innocent and ignorant members—the so-called beneficiaries of the superannuation system, the members.


As the system became more and more complex they became more confused, more ignorant and, unfortunately, more disengaged regarding superannuation. We got to situations where it was not uncommon to see a young worker with four or five different superannuation accounts, with two or three of those accounts inactive, receiving no contributions but paying fund managers, commissions, paying for products and paying fees for money that was essentially an asset for them but was doing them no good over the longer term.


When this government came to office we pledged to make the superannuation system fairer. We recognised that the system had gotten out of control and needed to be simplified, and that is what we have done through the Stronger Super reforms, in particular the introduction of the MySuper products. We have made it such that the system is now operating in the interests of members. Rather than operating in the interest of fund managers and product writers, it is now very much balanced in the interests of members. And, as Senator Cormann outlined, this came about as a result of the government's Cooper review, the most comprehensive study into the health and wellbeing of our superannuation system since its inception in 1992. A major part of that is the MySuper reforms, which at their heart ensure that there is a simple, easy-to-understand, easily comparable product available for all superannuation fund members in this country. This is the final tranche in that set of reforms.


The government has approached this in the tradition of making superannuation fairer and simpler. Overwhelmingly the Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services is supportive of this bill and its passage, and that is reflected in the committee's report. The bill strengthens the governance and integrity of the superannuation system. For example, many superannuation fund rules to date allow trustees to appoint or use a particular service provider on behalf of members, most notably in respect of insurance products. Their rules will say that you must use a particular insurance product that is often related to or has some relationship with that particular fund, even though in many respects it was not in the best interests of the members. There were particular rules that ensured that occurred. Now this is outlawed. No longer will trustees be obliged and mandated to use particular service providers when it comes to deciding which products to offer its members—and on behalf of members. This is consistent with the government's approach to reform in this area, of ensuring that the superannuation system operates in the best interests of members.


The reforms also provide for APRA to issue infringement notices for certain breaches of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act. They require persons to seek leave of the court before bringing actions against an individual director for a breach of their duties. The reforms extend legal defences available for trustees and directors to proceedings involving breaches of MySuper obligations. They also require trustees to provide reasons for decisions made in relation to a complaint and they increase the time limit for members to lodge complaints with the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal.


Throughout the process of these reforms the government has been conscious to consult widely with players in the industry. I was pleased to hear in the hearings that related to the inquiry into this particular bill that many of, or in fact most of, the players in the industry were satisfied with the government's level of consultation. I would like to draw the Senate's attention to a quote from a representative of the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees when he appeared before the committee. He said:


AIST acknowledge the preparedness of government and Treasury to consult with the industry about all of the Stronger Super changes and in particular the matters that are contained within this bill. That is reflected in the changes between the consultation draft and this bill, and it is also reflected in the overwhelmingly positive comments that we and others have made about the legislation in our submissions.


That is the view of industry—those who work in the superannuation game in this country—about the government's approach to these important reforms. They have been met with overwhelming positive responses and vindication of this government's approach to making superannuation simpler and fairer and in the interests of members.


Senator Cormann raises his bugbear once again—the thorn in the saddle for the opposition—that unions have positions on superannuation fund boards; that workers are represented in managing their funds in this country. They have never got over the fact that since 1992, when the compulsory superannuation system was established in this country, workers have a hand in managing such large pools of investment funds in this country. Not only do they have a hand in managing such large pools of investment funds but they do a great job. Consistently since 1992, union and employer managed super funds, commonly known as industry funds, have produced lower fees and better results for members when it comes to comparing the performance of those funds with more expensive company based funds and other corporate funds. The opposition have never got over that fact. Every time they speak about superannuation they bring up that old chestnut that they cannot get over: the fact that workers have a say in the management of superannuation funds in this country and that they have done a good job.


The approach to superannuation and the difference between the parties is highlighted by one of the policies that Senator Cormann raised in his concluding remarks, and that is the Low-Income Superannuation Contribution scheme. When we came to government we ensured that the concessions available in superannuation were targeted well and truly at the lower end of incomes in this country, that low- to middle-income workers would receive the appropriate incentives to ensure that they saved for their retirement, and that reflects the fact that we have an ageing population and we need to plan for adequate retirement savings in this country. We instituted the Low-Income Superannuation Contribution, ensuring that anyone who earns less than $37,000 in this country effectively pays no tax on their superannuation, as an incentive to ensure that they remain in the workforce rather than drop out onto welfare, and provides for adequate retirement savings as their working years move on. But what is the approach of the opposition to this important policy? They will get rid of it if they are elected. That was confirmed by Tony Abbott, the Leader of the Opposition, in his National Press Club speech last week in response to a question by a journalist. He said that they will get rid of the low-income superannuation contribution—a tax increase for 3.5 million workers in this country, the lowest paid workers in this country. They are predominantly women who are working part-time. That exemplifies the differences between a Labor government and a coalition government when it comes to retirement incomes.

The introduction of fund choice, together with the prevalence of defined contribution funds today, materially changes (and in many cases severs) the close relationship that previously existed between the employer and the super fund.


The … representatives on many trustee boards are … are nominated by third party organisations, such as … trade unions. Current employment and industrial relations practices mean that these organisations do not necessarily represent all employers or all employees. Thus, the democracy that the equal representation policy appears to embed in the governance of superannuation funds is not always present in reality. The equal representation model also could result in a perception that individual trustee‐directors are required to answer to the organisation that appointed them in respect of trustee decisions or that they are dictated to by that organisation.


That is, of course, exactly what is happening and that is exactly what we are concerned about on the coalition side. He continued:


The large number of employers, employer organisations and employee organisations related to a fund can sometimes result in trustee boards being far larger than makes sense for efficient governance of that fund.


Equal representation leaves significant groups 'unrepresented.' Key among these are members who are pensioners … and members who have joined the fund because they exercised fund choice. These groups of members, already sizeable in some funds, can be expected to grow in the future.


This is the point: superannuation now is big business. We need to make sure that the corporate governance arrangements and standards reflect the changed nature of superannuation. Just because the union movement wants to desperately hold on to this legacy power and influence—this legacy hold that they have had over people's superannuation—is not a good enough reason for the parliament to protect those sorts of arrangements of the past. It is time to move forward; it is time to ensure that the corporate governance arrangements for superannuation are more contemporary and that they reflect the 21st century circumstances and context. We will be moving amendments when this legislation comes before the Senate to give effect to the Cooper review recommendation that there should be appropriate provision for independent directors on superannuation boards.


Furthermore, this legislation does not address a significant inadequacy that was previously raised by stakeholders right across the board in a bipartisan fashion, dare I say it. Retail funds, industry funds, self-managed super fund representatives—everybody who has talked to us about this legislation—say that it is unfair that at present it super fund trustees are not allowed to cap the fees that are being charged to Australians that find themselves in MySuper funds, these default super funds.


The proposition is this: under the legislation as it currently stands and as it has been put forward by Minister Shorten, if you have $1,000 in an account you might end up paying $30 in fees on a percentage basis of 0.3 per cent, say. If you have $10,000 in that account, you will end up paying the same percentage; if you have $1,000,000 in that account you pay the same percentage. You might end up paying $3,000 where somebody else pays $300 or $30 when the increased value that you receive from the service that is provided is not equivalent to that increased level of fee. Up to a point, it might be appropriate to have an increased fee with increased account balances. But there should be an opportunity for super fund trustees to cap that at an appropriate level. At the point when the fee in dollar terms becomes so high that it no longer reflects the cost of providing the service the super fund trustee should be able to act in the best interests of members who find themselves in default superannuation—and these are members who have not made active choices. The super fund trustee should be able to cut those fees. We will be moving amendments to that effect.


Let me make the general point that this government has had overall a very bad track record when it comes to superannuation. They have imposed more than $8 billion in additional taxes on people saving for their retirement over the last four years. And that is so far. The Labor Party will get all excited by that, because they think that they have something. They think that they can attack us because we have said for a very long time that we would not be proceeding with their low-income superannuation tax offset, which they linked to the mining tax. But it is not funded. It is a measure that, if this government were re-elected at the next election, they would scrap because they would have to. They would scrap it because it is not funded; they would scrap it because the mining tax has not raised any meaningful revenue.


Senator Thistlethwaite will jump up and down and say, 'No, we won't; no, we won't'—just like they said that we will not have a carbon tax under the government led by Julia Gillard and like they said in 2008 that they would not change superannuation, proceeding to reduce the government superannuation co-contribution scheme from $1,500 down to $500, targeting low-income earners. And like they said in 2010 that they would never, ever tax superannuation payments for people over 60. Now they are looking at doing exactly that. You cannot ever trust what Labor says before the election. They will tell everyone that they are targeting the rich and the wealthy but after the election they will target the middle class and low-income earners, as they always do. (Time expired)

Senator THISTLETHWAITE
 (New South Wales) (17:19):  I rise to make a short contribution on the report of the Joint Committee on Corporations on Financial Services regarding its inquiry into the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Service Providers and Other Governance Measures) Bill. This bill is the fourth tranche of the government's MySuper reforms. It deals with governance elements in the stronger super reform package. Australia's superannuation system was a very complex beast, and the architecture reflected the wealth of changes that have been made since 1992, often reflecting the different ideological views of the major parties regarding retirement incomes policy in this country. As it changed it became more and more complex, and as it became more and more complex fund managers and product writers found new ways to make money, often at the expense of innocent and ignorant members—the so-called beneficiaries of the superannuation system, the members.


As the system became more and more complex they became more confused, more ignorant and, unfortunately, more disengaged regarding superannuation. We got to situations where it was not uncommon to see a young worker with four or five different superannuation accounts, with two or three of those accounts inactive, receiving no contributions but paying fund managers, commissions, paying for products and paying fees for money that was essentially an asset for them but was doing them no good over the longer term.


When this government came to office we pledged to make the superannuation system fairer. We recognised that the system had gotten out of control and needed to be simplified, and that is what we have done through the Stronger Super reforms, in particular the introduction of the MySuper products. We have made it such that the system is now operating in the interests of members. Rather than operating in the interest of fund managers and product writers, it is now very much balanced in the interests of members. And, as Senator Cormann outlined, this came about as a result of the government's Cooper review, the most comprehensive study into the health and wellbeing of our superannuation system since its inception in 1992. A major part of that is the MySuper reforms, which at their heart ensure that there is a simple, easy-to-understand, easily comparable product available for all superannuation fund members in this country. This is the final tranche in that set of reforms.


The government has approached this in the tradition of making superannuation fairer and simpler. Overwhelmingly the Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services is supportive of this bill and its passage, and that is reflected in the committee's report. The bill strengthens the governance and integrity of the superannuation system. For example, many superannuation fund rules to date allow trustees to appoint or use a particular service provider on behalf of members, most notably in respect of insurance products. Their rules will say that you must use a particular insurance product that is often related to or has some relationship with that particular fund, even though in many respects it was not in the best interests of the members. There were particular rules that ensured that occurred. Now this is outlawed. No longer will trustees be obliged and mandated to use particular service providers when it comes to deciding which products to offer its members—and on behalf of members. This is consistent with the government's approach to reform in this area, of ensuring that the superannuation system operates in the best interests of members.


The reforms also provide for APRA to issue infringement notices for certain breaches of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act. They require persons to seek leave of the court before bringing actions against an individual director for a breach of their duties. The reforms extend legal defences available for trustees and directors to proceedings involving breaches of MySuper obligations. They also require trustees to provide reasons for decisions made in relation to a complaint and they increase the time limit for members to lodge complaints with the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal.


Throughout the process of these reforms the government has been conscious to consult widely with players in the industry. I was pleased to hear in the hearings that related to the inquiry into this particular bill that many of, or in fact most of, the players in the industry were satisfied with the government's level of consultation. I would like to draw the Senate's attention to a quote from a representative of the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees when he appeared before the committee. He said:


AIST acknowledge the preparedness of government and Treasury to consult with the industry about all of the Stronger Super changes and in particular the matters that are contained within this bill. That is reflected in the changes between the consultation draft and this bill, and it is also reflected in the overwhelmingly positive comments that we and others have made about the legislation in our submissions.


That is the view of industry—those who work in the superannuation game in this country—about the government's approach to these important reforms. They have been met with overwhelming positive responses and vindication of this government's approach to making superannuation simpler and fairer and in the interests of members.


Senator Cormann raises his bugbear once again—the thorn in the saddle for the opposition—that unions have positions on superannuation fund boards; that workers are represented in managing their funds in this country. They have never got over the fact that since 1992, when the compulsory superannuation system was established in this country, workers have a hand in managing such large pools of investment funds in this country. Not only do they have a hand in managing such large pools of investment funds but they do a great job. Consistently since 1992, union and employer managed super funds, commonly known as industry funds, have produced lower fees and better results for members when it comes to comparing the performance of those funds with more expensive company based funds and other corporate funds. The opposition have never got over that fact. Every time they speak about superannuation they bring up that old chestnut that they cannot get over: the fact that workers have a say in the management of superannuation funds in this country and that they have done a good job.


The approach to superannuation and the difference between the parties is highlighted by one of the policies that Senator Cormann raised in his concluding remarks, and that is the Low-Income Superannuation Contribution scheme. When we came to government we ensured that the concessions available in superannuation were targeted well and truly at the lower end of incomes in this country, that low- to middle-income workers would receive the appropriate incentives to ensure that they saved for their retirement, and that reflects the fact that we have an ageing population and we need to plan for adequate retirement savings in this country. We instituted the Low-Income Superannuation Contribution, ensuring that anyone who earns less than $37,000 in this country effectively pays no tax on their superannuation, as an incentive to ensure that they remain in the workforce rather than drop out onto welfare, and provides for adequate retirement savings as their working years move on. But what is the approach of the opposition to this important policy? They will get rid of it if they are elected. That was confirmed by Tony Abbott, the Leader of the Opposition, in his National Press Club speech last week in response to a question by a journalist. He said that they will get rid of the low-income superannuation contribution—a tax increase for 3.5 million workers in this country, the lowest paid workers in this country. They are predominantly women who are working part-time. That exemplifies the differences between a Labor government and a coalition government when it comes to retirement incomes.

"Feeney, Sen David",ALP,2013-02-05,"



Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (17:30):  I table a revised explanatory memorandum relating to the bill and move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



This bill amends the Migration Act 1958 in accordance with the report of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers, which recommended that arrival anywhere in Australia by irregular maritime means should provide individuals with the same status. That is, arrival anywhere in Australia in these circumstances should make the person liable to regional processing arrangements. 


At the forefront of the Panel's reasoning in making this recommendation was the need to reduce any incentive for people to take even greater risks with their lives by seeking to reach the Australian mainland to avoid being subject to regional processing arrangements.


Under the existing excision framework, unauthorised arrivals in excised offshore places are prevented from making valid applications for visas in Australia and are liable to be taken to a designated country for regional processing. Unauthorised arrivals who arrive at the Australian mainland are not currently subject to these provisions.


As the Panel emphasised—and the Government has reiterated – the recommendations in the report are an integrated set of proposals. To be effective in discouraging asylum seekers from risking their lives, the incentives and disincentives the Panel recommended must be pursued in a comprehensive manner. The legislative amendments proposed in this bill are part of this integrated approach. 


Under the amendments proposed, all non-citizens who arrive in Australia by irregular maritime means – to be known as ""unauthorised maritime arrivals"" – will be subject to the regional processing framework inserted by the Regional Processing Act in August 2012, unless they are specifically excluded. 


Certain persons not intended to be subject to regional processing arrangements will be excluded from these arrangements. These excluded classes of persons include certain New Zealand citizens and permanent residents of Norfolk Island who do not need visas to travel to Australia.


The bill also provides the power to prescribe further classes of excluded persons in the Migration Regulations in the future should it become clear that further classes need to be excluded from regional processing arrangements. 


Excluded persons will not be subject to regional processing. Nor will they be subject to a statutory bar on applying for a visa. 


In addition, the important safety valve provided under section 198AE of the act remains. This provides the Minister with a personal, non-compellable power to determine that an unauthorised maritime arrival should not be taken to a designated regional processing country if the Minister thinks it is in the public interest to exempt them. This section will continue to provide flexibility to exempt individuals or classes from regional processing. Unlike excluded classes, exempt individuals or classes will still be subject to a statutory bar on applying for a visa unless the Minister also decides to lift this bar.


Sound border management requires such flexibility, in recognition of the range of complex circumstances that can apply to a person's arrival in Australia by sea without a visa. For example, a person who has been rescued at sea, and who has inadvertently engaged these provisions by arriving in Australia without a visa, could be such a case. The person may have had no intention to come to Australia, and their circumstances may warrant a more flexible approach.


The bill also amends the definition of a 'transitory person' in the act to provide flexibility to transfer persons back from a regional processing country to Australia for a temporary purpose. This amendment will allow the Government to bring people assessed to be refugees – but who have not yet met the 'no advantage' principle – back to Australia for a temporary purpose such as medical treatment, and then return them to a designated regional processing country pending provision of a durable outcome.


The application of the 'no advantage' principle is to ensure that no benefit is gained through circumventing regular migration pathways. This, combined with an increased refugee intake from offshore, is designed to remove the attractiveness of attempting an expensive and dangerous irregular boat journey to Australia.


The bill also repeals section 198C of the act. The current effect of this section is that transitory persons may request the Refugee Review Tribunal to assess whether they are a refugee if they are bought to Australia under section 198B of the act and remain here for a continuous period of six months. This provision encourages transitory persons to attempt to extend their stay in Australia in order to gain access to the Refugee Review Tribunal and the courts and therefore should be amended.


This bill also makes amendments to section 189 of the act to provide for discretionary immigration detention of Papua New Guinea (PNG) citizens who are unlawful non‑citizens and are in a protected area of the Torres Strait. 


Prior to the commencement of the Regional Processing Act in August 2012, the immigration detention of all unlawful non-citizens in an excised offshore place was discretionary. However, the Regional Processing Act amended section 189 of the act to change the immigration detention of these persons to mandatory. The exception is allowed inhabitants of the Protected Zone in the Torres Strait who are unlawful non-citizens. The act recognises the special status of PNG citizens who are 'allowed inhabitants of the Protected Zone' under the Torres Strait Treaty by including provision to permit their visa free travel within a protected area in certain circumstances. However, there are other PNG citizens who are not 'allowed inhabitants' of the Protected Zone, and are not provided for under the Treaty. 


Due to the complex relationships, long standing cultural connections and way of life of the communities in and adjacent to a protected area, the bill extends discretionary immigration detention provided for in section 189 of the act to persons in a protected area who are citizens of PNG and are unlawful non-citizens. This provision will only apply to PNG citizens while they are in a protected area of the Torres Strait.


The bill also includes a clarifying amendment to section 198AE of the act to provide an express power for the Minister to vary or revoke a determination that a person is not subject to regional processing, if it is in the public interest to do so. The Government's view is that this power is already implied but, for avoidance of legal doubt, it is preferable to make this power explicit.


The bill provides for consequential amendments arising from the amendments relating to unauthorised maritime arrivals and transitory persons. 


Finally, the bill also includes an amendment moved by the Honourable Member for Lyne, Rob Oakeshott, and supported by the Government in the House, that will require the Minister, as soon as practicable after 30 June in each year, to provide each House of Parliament with a report on the activities conducted that year as part of the Bali Process. The report must update each House on the progress made in regards to combatting people smuggling, human trafficking and related transnational crime, focusing particularly on the Regional Cooperation Framework agreed in Bali in March 2011.


This bill marks an important further step in giving full effect to the recommendations of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers. It removes the incentive for asylum seekers to take greater risks with their lives to reach the Australian mainland.


I commend the bill to the chamber.

Senator THORP
 (Tasmania) (18:53):  I would like to take this opportunity to reflect upon the tragic bushfires that engulfed my home state of Tasmania in recent weeks. It was a summer where we were once again reminded of the brutal strength of Mother Nature and of the amazing power of banding together to support each other in the face of disaster. From the start of the new year, it seemed something was brewing. Fires were already burning in some parts of the state, and we heard forecasts of temperatures in the high 30s. But no-one will forget 4 January, when the mercury shot past these predictions, swelling to an all-time high of 41.8 degrees in Hobart. At that time it looked bad, but we did not know how just how bad it would be and what it would mean for our state. With over 3.1 million hectares of native forest, our great natural abundance was soon to become a perilous risk and many thousands of people, communities and businesses would be under threat.


The situation deteriorated rapidly and, at the peak, almost 40 fires engulfed Tasmania. Very few parts of the state were unaffected. Fires were burning in the north-east on the edge of the Ben Lomond National Park; in the north-west, at Montumana; on the east coast, at Bicheno; and in central Tasmania, at Lake Repulse. The worst of the infernos ravaged the south-eastern Tasman and Forestier peninsulas, where communities were forced to flee as fires raged from the north, cutting road access and threatening hundreds of properties. These were terrifying times. The intensity was unbelievable. Many had to abandon plans to stay and defend their homes against the might of the flames, often escaping with only minutes to spare. One of the most poignant images for me is that of Tammy Holmes from Dunalley, who fled her home with her five grandchildren, all under 11 years of age. With road blockages and violent fires preventing escape, Tammy and the children had no choice but to shelter in the bay under the local jetty near Dunalley while husband Tim went to find help. With only 20 or 30 centimetres of breathable air above the water, the family had to submerge themselves up to their necks just to survive. They stayed for hours amidst raging fires until Tim returned with a dinghy to ferry them to safety.


This blaze ultimately razed 30 per cent of the properties in Dunalley. The police station, the school and the local bakery, all vital cornerstones of the community, were gone. By the time the fire had subsided, 203 properties were lost, 30 businesses were damaged or destroyed and more than 95,000 hectares were burnt out.


But all the numbers in the world cannot describe the true weight of the devastation borne by local communities. As a seventh generation Tasmanian, these are places that have helped make me who I am, and the people I have shared the best and worst of life with. I cannot begin to describe to you the feeling of anxiety and helplessness. For over 10 years, I had the privilege of serving as the Legislative Council Member for Rumney, which includes the affected communities of Boomer Bay, Connelly's Marsh, Copping, Dunalley, Eaglehawk Neck, Forcett, Murdunna, Primrose Sands, Sommers Bay, Susans Bay and Taranna. On the night of 4 January, after having settled close family friends to bed after their evacuation from Dodge's Ferry, I stood on my front deck and quite literally felt I was watching all my beloved Rumney burn. Many of the older residents were painfully reminded of the catastrophic Tasmanian fires of 1967, when more than 2,500 square kilometres were burnt out in southern Tasmania. Tragically, 62 people died, 900 were injured and 7,000 were rendered homeless.


If there is something that we can be grateful for, it is that this year's fires were not marked by this terrible loss of life. In saying this, I do not want to in any way diminish the tragic loss of Victorian firefighter, Peter Ronald Cramer, who lost his life while undertaking back-burning in Tasmania. I would like to express my deepest sympathy for the family and friends of Mr Cramer and to recognise the excellent work of the fireys across the country who came to our aid.


In quieter moments since the emergency, I have also had time to reflect on the differences between this year's devastation and the 2009 Victorian bushfires, where 173 people, sadly, died. It is fair to say that Tasmania took on board the lessons of these fires and went to great lengths to limit the possibility of a tragedy of this scale happening again. I am pleased that the Tasmanian state government, of which I was a part at the time, recognised the importance of the recommendations that came out of the royal commission into the bushfires and took heed. We acted quickly to implement these recommendations, with a very clear focus on preventing future deaths. Of course, the best plans could never have prevented the cruel heatwave that bore down on us, but it did mean that we managed to limit the loss of our most important asset—people. While the fires brought into sharp focus the fragility of our existence and the brutal force of Mother Nature, the days that followed also highlighted the strength of our local communities.


It has often been noted that there is something special about Australians in the face of disaster. It is almost as if 'helping a mate' is ingrained into our national DNA. However, nowhere is this truer than in Tassie, with its vast number of small, close-knit regional communities. My admiration and thanks go to the Phil Soleys of our community. Phil and dozens like him put aside personal loss and worked for days without sleep to help others.


I would also like to recognise the hard work of community organisations that worked tirelessly to help Tasmanians get through this difficult time. Organisations like the Australian Red Cross provided registration services and support to more than 3,000, who were forced to flee when the fires hit, and their work continues today.


At the same time, local, state and federal governments were also working around the clock to ensure that people got the help and information they needed, no matter where they were. There was a massive sea rescue operation launched for thousands of evacuees who sought safety on beaches, in boats and at Port Arthur. More than 2,000 people were ferried to safety, and another 2,000 took refuge at the community centre at Nubeena. It was almost Tasmania's Dunkirk.


The Australian government's most important role was to support local and state governments and to provide direct payments to affected individuals and businesses affected by the fires. So far, bushfire affected Tasmanians have received $6.7 million in federal disaster recovery payments of $1,000 cash for adults and $400 for children. We should also remember that under our longstanding natural disaster arrangements with the states, the federal government meets 75 per cent of the costs after major disasters. These are all important safety nets that have given Tasmanians short-term assistance and faith that their communities will be supported as they travel the long road to recovery.


So what about the future? As the news stories subside, it is easy to forget that the tragic effects of this disaster have not receded for thousands of Tasmanians. Farmers have lost stock, crops have been devastated, people have lost homes and businesses have been brought to their knees. The fires may be over, but the recovery has only just begun. It will be a long road for these communities to get back to where they were only a few short weeks ago.


I urge my fellow members to get behind efforts to help Tasmanians get back on their feet. You can contribute by donating to the Australian Red Cross bushfire appeal at their website. Already, $5 million has been raised in this manner. But the damage bill is much higher, so I urge to you dig deep in the knowledge that every single cent from the fund will go to where it is needed most.


I also want to make it clear that despite these setbacks, Tasmania is well and truly open for business. Look out for our world-class agricultural products; the fruit, the vegetables, the seafood and the wine on your own shop shelves. Or if you are in the market for an unforgettable getaway, make Tasmania the first place on your list to visit. All the roads are open and our tourism operators cannot wait to welcome you.
