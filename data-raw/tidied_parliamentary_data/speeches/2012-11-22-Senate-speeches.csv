"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2012-11-22,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (09:31):  I am very pleased that this chamber is finally able to debate the Low Aromatic Fuel Bill 2012, because unfortunately, despite the very serious and sustained efforts to end it, petrol sniffing is still persistent in some areas of Australia.


Over the past 20 years it has been the subject of reports, coronial and other inquiries and research projects. The impact of petrol sniffing on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander individuals and communities is very well documented and well known. The petrol-sniffing inquiry, in fact, was one of the first committee inquiries that I participated in in this place back in 2005-2006. The committee recognised that the situation with petrol sniffing in Australia was dire, and since that inquiry I am very pleased that there has been considerable movement on this issue.


We do now have a petrol-sniffing strategy and we have seen great progress all over Central Australia in dealing with this problem. There are very good programs that are supporting communities in their goal to eradicate petrol sniffing. Most fuel stations in the targeted areas have switched to low-aromatic, non-sniffable fuel or, as it is known, Opal fuel, resulting in a 94 per cent drop in petrol sniffing. That is according to the government's assessment of the success of the program.


But, unfortunately, there is still petrol sniffing occurring, and there are recurring outbreaks. One example that CAYLUS, which is the Central Australian Youth Link Up Service, spoke to Lateline about when they were presenting submissions and evidence to the latest inquiry, the inquiry into this bill, is:


There was one outbreak that sort of spread like wildfire through the Western Desert, which was 12-year-olds, the average age was 11 or 12. A kid came in and showed other kids how to do it and off it took.


When it was managed to be stopped in one community, one of the kids went to the next community and started it up there, and there were another 12 kids sniffing there. It took a couple of months of serious work by a lot of people to bring that one back under control.


As I said, that was some of the evidence that CAYLUS gave to the inquiry.


This occurred because, unfortunately, sniffable fuel is still readily available in some places. These outbreaks are very closely linked to gaps in the rollout of a non-sniffable fuel. These gaps exist because up until now we have relied on suppliers signing up to this process voluntarily. Currently, the government designates target areas under the strategy for non-sniffable fuel use, and then works and lobbies petrol station owners to have Opal or non-sniffable fuel replace regular unleaded fuel. Of course communities and service stations can also receive Opal on request, and this is part of the strategy for rolling it out. However, where petrol suppliers fail or refuse to collaborate, the problem of petrol sniffing and its associated horrors is more likely to occur; in communities close to those petrol stations that refuse to engage with supplying Opal fuel, you can track outbreaks.


CAYLUS provided an example from my home state of Western Australia where, up until the rollout of Opal in Laverton, the owner of one particular service station there had been refusing to stock Opal for a number of years. Fortunately, there was a change of ownership and the new owners agreed to stock Opal. That has had a dramatic impact in reducing the number of sniffers. The association between dealing with petrol sniffing and the rolling out of Opal is very clear.


We have been gathering evidence on this for quite some time. The Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry into this bill has clearly documented the success of the rollout of the Opal fuel program. But it has also shown firsthand that the categorical rejection of Opal fuel by a small minority, with what some witnesses called a 'pig-headed response', is where we have been struggling. As I have articulated, that is where we have the gaps. This is why we believe that it is very important that the government have the power to mandate the use of low-aromatic fuel. We believe it is essential, because we absolutely need that power to be able to plug these gaps in the sniffing strategy.


As of February this year, there were at least eight, and possibly more, retailers who have consistently refused to stock low-aromatic fuel. Evidence collected by CAYLUS suggests that these refusals have resulted in further sniffing incidents. We heard about those during the Senate inquiry.


According to CAYLUS, there have been areas of concern in Papunya, Lake Nash, Titjikala, Alice Springs, Kintore, Ti Tree, Canting Creek and a number of other places. These are the current places where we understand—the evidence has come in over the last six months—that there have been sniffing outbreaks. For example, Lake Nash is very close to a pub over the border in Queensland, Urandangi, which stocks sniffable fuel. That is, sniffable fuel is run into Lake Nash, which is trying really hard to deal with issues around petrol sniffing. Because cars can carry it across the border, it is really easy to bring it into Lake Nash. Because petrol sniffing does not contain itself within state borders, there needs to be a national approach to mandating fuel supply in designated zones rather than leaving it up to individual states and territories, as the federal government has previously proposed. We believe that it is essential to have a nationally coordinated response.


The Senate inquiry heard evidence to this effect from the Warlpiri Youth Development Aboriginal Corporation, who said:


Warlpiri families come and go across state borders so, for maximum impact, we would like to see this legislation applied to Western Australia, Queensland and South Australia as well as the Northern Territory. We know that Opal fuel has proven effective but, unless the sale of Opal is mandated, and across the broader region, there is a real danger of sniffing outbreaks and devastating consequences.


The evidence I have heard for over seven years now clearly shows that controlling access to sniffable fuel can have, and does have, a significant impact on the ability of communities to prevent harm coming to their young people. Organisations in Central Australia, health and drug services, and individuals from affected communities have all voiced their support for this particular legislative approach, and that was very clear through the inquiry process but also from sustained lobbying over a number of years. This has been on the cards for a long time because we know there have been significant gaps in the strategy. 


I am not for one minute at all trying to run down what has been achieved so far. It has been an outstanding program of success. It is one of those programs where we can all stand really proudly and say that there has been multiparty support for this and it has been a success. So why not capitalise on that success? We are almost there in dealing with this problem of petrol sniffing.


Although we have had this comprehensive program provided, there are gaps. We know that Opal fuel on its own cannot achieve the stamping-out of petrol sniffing. We know that it has to be part of a comprehensive approach. It is absolutely crucial, because it buys time in order to get in with youth diversionary programs and the other support programs such as drug and alcohol support programs. We know that it is successful but we also know that, unless we deal with these areas of outbreak associated with sniffable fuel, we will continue to undermine that success. 


As has been articulated to the Senate inquiry and to me personally, the gains achieved to date through the rollout of Opal fuel are critical and crucial, but they are also fragile. We currently have a generation of children in much of the region who have grown up free of a sniffing culture. However, due to what we believe are the irresponsible decisions of some retailers, the sniffing culture appears to be once again rearing its head in some sites. We know from hard experience that sniffing, once established in an affected community, can rapidly spread. It is an epidemic we do not wish to relive. Again, that was evidence from CAYLUS during the Senate inquiry.


Though the provision of low-aromatic fuel is not on its own a solution, it is absolutely critical to a holistic approach. CAYLUS has had long experience in the field—and I think senators who have had any dealings with CAYLUS will know that they are one of the most respected youth services in Central Australia and that they have played a critical role in dealing with the issue of petrol sniffing. As CAYLUS said:


We were doing this before Opal, and we would try all the other measures. You could start a youth program in a community and you would get a lot of the sniffers to stop but not all of them. But once you have Opal in a community the sniffing stops and then the youth programs can really go because they are not competing against people who are off their faces all the time. 


The importance of Opal has been clearly demonstrated. All it has lacked is the final part to ensure that the petrol-sniffing strategy has the capacity to proceed in the face of consistent denial from the petrol station owners. As Andrew Stojanovski, who was awarded the Order of Australia Medal for his work at Yuendumu in setting up the Mount Theo Petrol Sniffing Prevention Program, told the committee: 


Opal is a solution that governments and communities can readily  implement. Its use in Central Australia has really taken the pressure off communities and provides a breathing space where community workers can actually focus on programs that address the personal and social issues underlying petrol sniffing. When sniffing is rife in a community it is near impossible to do this, the power, violence and dysfunction caused by sniffing is too overwhelming.


This is why I have introduced this bill as a private member's bill—because we have spent so long working in a collective effort to address the issues of petrol sniffing. This is the element that the communities have said is missing from the strategy. They have been lobbying for a long time for this. We have had three Senate inquiries. The Senate inquiry in 2009 found that the Opal program was overwhelmingly successful but it identified this gap and said that if retailers were refusing to stock Opal fuel or low-aromatic fuel the government should proceed to mandate the stocking of Opal fuel. 


This is why I am bringing this bill to the chamber. The government has not brought it on. There is overwhelming support. I was lobbied very heavily by the communities in Central Australia, who need this vital element to make sure that they can control petrol sniffing in their communities. This is also a very powerful tool. The communities have also been lobbying heavily for this so that they can then implement their other youth programs, the diversionary programs, and work to really address the underlying causes of petrol sniffing. 


This bill will give the minister the power to mandate low-aromatic fuel and make it an offence to supply regular fuel in these places. It will also give the minister the power to create fuel control areas by legislative instrument, which will give the minister the capacity to tailor the measures to the particular community—after consulting them.


Consultation and flexibility are at the heart of these measures because this bill is about helping communities affected by petrol sniffing by complementing the existing strategies and programs. Consultation has been a very big part of the development of this bill. I believe this has been an effective process. We developed the bill in consultation with and with feedback from communities. We made sure it got referred to a Senate inquiry. The overwhelming number of submissions to the Senate inquiry supported this bill and very strongly endorsed this approach. We have taken on board the feedback from the Senate inquiry and subsequently will amend the bill. We have consulted again on those measures. We have talked to as many of the stakeholders as we possibly can and, as I said, we have received overwhelming support for these measures.


I will discuss the purpose of the amendments in the committee stage, but I want to acknowledge the many people who participated in the Senate inquiry. We were pleased to see the proper process of consultation and committee inquiry work here—the idea being that, when you bring a bill to the Senate, it goes off to inquiry, you get feedback and you make amendments in response to that feedback. So, where a bill is not perfect, in response to very sensible review and comment you can make amendments that reflect the feedback from the community. I stress again: this bill has the strong support of Aboriginal organisations, health organisations, community organisations, individuals and communities. They want the minister to have the power to mandate the supply of low-aromatic fuel because it is absolutely critical to dealing with the scourge of petrol sniffing.


I have been in communities and seen for myself the impact that taking away sniffable fuel has. As CAYLUS said, it provides the window of opportunity for people to get in and deal with the other, underlying causes of petrol sniffing. During the committee inquiry, some of the concern was that, if you take away sniffable fuel, people will switch to other forms of substance abuse. The evidence in fact does not support that. The evidence supports the idea that this does provide a window of opportunity to give youth in particular another chance to address those underlying causes and have sufficient diversionary programs so that these youths can move completely away from substance abuse.


When petrol stations just pig-headedly refuse to stock Opal fuel, this bill gives the government or the minister, after they have carefully consulted, the capacity to say, 'You know what? You really need to stock non-sniffable fuel.' As the evidence to the committee inquiry overwhelmingly demonstrated, when people can get access to sniffable fuel and run that into communities, that is where you get petrol-sniffing outbreaks. Again, the evidence overwhelmingly shows that that is the case. Once somebody starts petrol sniffing in a community, it is very easy to get other kids sniffing, and then it moves on to other communities.


As I said, this bill has the overwhelming support of the community organisations that we have consulted. We have consulted them extensively and, under the bill, the minister will be required to consult as well. So it is not as if this is something that the minister can apply willy-nilly to the states and territories in Australia. The minister will need to consult under this bill. It is the missing piece to finally dealing with petrol sniffing, which can so devastate our communities. Petrol sniffing has largely occurred in Central Australia, but it does occur elsewhere and it is increasingly occurring in the north of the Northern Territory and in Western Australia around Warburton, Laverton, which I have already discussed, and in some places in the Kimberley. We need the minister to have the power of mandate where we see this sort of thing happening and where service stations are simply refusing to stock Opal. It is not good enough that these pig-headed service station owners can undermine the effectiveness of what is such a good program—where Australia can rightly hold its head up high and say, 'We took action to address this issue.'


Amendments will be circulated in the chamber and will be discussed in the committee stage. I very strongly commend this bill to the chamber. It is that final link in addressing the issues around petrol sniffing, and it has the overwhelming support of the community. I am absolutely and totally convinced of that.

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2012-11-22,"



Senator CROSSIN
 (Northern Territory) (09:50):  I rise to add my contribution to this debate on the Low Aromatic Fuel Bill 2012. I recognise Senator Siewert's passion and endeavours in this area but might use my opportunity this morning to also correct some of her statements.


Petrol sniffing has been around in the Northern Territory for many, many decades. When I arrived at Yirrkala in 1981—and I have spoken about my experience in that community many times in this chamber—I saw firsthand the impact of petrol sniffing. That was over 30 years ago. In fact, in 1983 my husband specifically had a group of 15 post-primary boys in his class who were all petrol sniffers. It was a specific educational strategy that we designed at Yirrkala School to try and stop those boys from sniffing and to get them re-engaged in education. It was very difficult—extremely difficult—because there were no designated youth programs; there were no low-aromatic fuels back then. It was not until the 1990s that avgas was introduced across the Top End, specifically in Maningrida, I think. Chris Burns owes his doctorate to the research he did into avgas and its impact on petrol sniffing. Then, of course, it was not until 2005 that BP finally came up with the low-aromatic fuel that we now call Opal.


So a solution that would actually turn off the tap here has only been around since 2005, and that then led to the first Senate inquiry being initiated in 2006. Petrol sniffing is not just confined to Central Australia—not at all. I have lived with and am related to Indigenous families in north-east Arnhem who have watched their adolescent children diminish mentally, drastically, over the years to the point where they are chronically mentally ill. It saddens those families. It saddens me.


The other thing I want to say, Senator Siewert, is that this is not the last chapter in this book. This is not the last rung in the saga of petrol sniffing, because what we still need to do is have rehabilitation places right throughout Central Australia, the Top End and probably in Queensland and WA that cope with those adolescents and young adults who are mentally ill as a result of petrol sniffing. I know, for example, that the families at Yirrkala struggle because there is no rehabilitation facility in Gove and the ones in Darwin are completely inadequate. We know that in a place like Gove this bill will be very hard to implement because of the town and the situation there. At Jabiru we will have the same problems and similarly in Katherine. So there will be a need to embark on a lot of concentrated work and effort which goes to education, consultation and negotiation in order to get this bill implemented. There are still many years ahead of us to make sure that we do turn off the tap to regular unleaded petrol and just roll Opal out in remote communities.


The other rung that we will need to look at is extending the youth programs. If I had 20 minutes I could spend my whole time singing the praises of the Central Australian Youth Link Up Service and the fantastic work that people like Blair McFarland, Tristan Ray and their co-workers have done in highlighting the impact of youth services, combined with diminishing the reliance and dependence of youth on petrol for sniffing. That is a fantastic youth service and they work really well with people like the Mount Theo mob and Susie Low, but they are also confined to Central Australia. It would be my dream to give CAYLUS enough funding for them to become the Northern Territory youth link-up service, not just the Central Australian Youth Link Up Service, because I think they have the capacity to extend the work they do right up the Stuart Highway and right across the length and breadth of the Northern Territory.


I am surprised that there has not been a call to ensure that, as we mandate low-aromatic fuel in petrol stations, we also mandate the funding for an expansion of CAYLUS, so that as we turn off the tap and do not give young men, particularly, a reason to sniff this fuel we also provide them with the alternative. It is fine to have a bill in here for low-aromatic fuel to turn off that tap, but what I also want to see is the other side of the scales being balanced and the additional funding being provided so that an organisation can expand and provide these young people with an alternative.


There are a number of amendments that clearly need to be made to this bill in order for it to be passed. But let me be very clear that this Labor government has worked laboriously and closely with stakeholders to introduce voluntary compliance of suppliers with using low-aromatic fuels. Success in Indigenous health policy takes time, and the voluntary rollout of the low-aromatic fuel Opal over time has made a 70 per cent difference to the plight of petrol sniffers in Australian communities. So we know it works. This bill is about trying to take the next step.


We have worked hard to introduce Opal in areas around Australia. In 2005 the first Petrol Sniffing Strategy was announced; however, the plan was only partially implemented by the then coalition government. Since 2007, when we came into government, we have worked closely with the private sector, with governments at all levels and with NGOs to address those gaps and to achieve implementation of a successful Petrol Sniffing Strategy program. The manufacture and distribution of Opal in Central and Northern Australia has been a story of spectacular success. It has improved Indigenous health by curbing the detrimental curse of petrol sniffing across many of the communities, so in 2009 we expanded the supply and uptake of Opal fuel across the gulf region of Queensland, the East Kimberley and the Top End. Since then, the success has been echoed across many regions.


I do not have time to go through some of the evidence that was presented to the third and most recent inquiry conducted by the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee. I had been involved in the first two; I missed this one because I had other engagements in the Territory at the time. The inquiry on low-aromatic fuel took evidence from people like Donna Ah Chee at the Central Australian Aboriginal Congress, who said that the rollout of Opal fuel in Central Australia 'demonstrates what supply-side strategies can achieve'. There was also evidence from Susie Low at Mount Theo, from the NPY Women's Council, and from Andrew Stojanovski, whom Senator Siewert talked about. So there is clearly evidence about this strategy and how it works. 


As of July this year, there are 123 sites receiving low-aromatic fuel throughout regional and remote Australia. And since July this year the Department of Health and Ageing have conducted a procurement process to establish increased production and storage of low-aromatic fuel in various places in remote Australia. So a lot of work has been done and is being done. The committee heard that the low-aromatic fuel storage and distribution facility in Darwin is expected to be completed before the end of 2013. That will ensure that there is ready access to supply to roll it out across the Top End, not just in Central Australia. 


I am keen to try and wind up my remarks this morning, because I know we want to get through all of the speeches in the second reading debate, move the amendments and get this bill passed. But I clearly say in support of this legislation that I think it is time that we move on ensuring that distributors in the Northern Territory turn to Opal, and only to Opal. I think there is much discussion and there is much work still to be done. While the voluntary scheme is in place, we know that there is still a lot of work to be done to ensure that distributors switch to Opal and do it confidently and competently. We know that plenty of education work will need to be done to ensure that people have confidence in knowing what the difference between regular unleaded and Opal is. Of course, there is no difference except for the smell, but that education will need to occur. There will be a need to fund and extend those youth programs right around the Territory. My dream would be, as I said, that the Central Australian Youth Link Up Service becomes the Northern Territory youth link-up service.


So this is not the final chapter in the book; this is another chapter in addressing petrol sniffing. There is still a lot more work to be done. There are a lot more education programs to be rolled out, youth programs to be rolled out and work to be done with distributors. But it is another step along the way to ensuring that young Aboriginal lives are not destroyed because the only end of their day is to stick their nose in a can of petrol and sniff it. So we in this government need to play whatever part we can to prevent that occurring and to save one more person's life from spiralling dramatically downward to a tragic ending where they either become mentally ill or die, and this parliament needs to grasp any opportunity it has to prevent that from happening.

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2012-11-22,"



Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Deputy Leader of The Nationals) (10:01):  I rise to again contribute to the debate on the Low Aromatic Fuel Bill 2012, a private member's bill introduced by Senator Siewert. I will probably be somewhat critical of the government and of the Greens today, for a number of reasons that will become evident during my contribution, but I would like to start by saying that I would commend all sides of this place for their motivation. There is no question that the government is well motivated—I do not really understand the backflip of this morning—and I know that Senator Siewert is very well motivated in regard to the introduction of this legislation. I know that Senator Crossin, Senator Moore, Senator Siewert, I and others have been part of committees in the past that looked at this issue, before the committee that looked into this legislation, and we have all been very frustrated. We have had committee discussions. We made a recommendation after a committee inquiry in 2009 that someone act to introduce some legislation. I suspect that Senator Siewert's introduction of this legislation was a function of all of that frustration, but I think I should put on the record that I admire the motivation of all in this matter.


Of course, we are motivated by a very, very damaging substance. I can remember, as a very young bloke, hearing only a couple of times about people sniffing petrol, but it is really not a part of life for those who live conventionally in mainstream Australia. But it is just so damaging. I have been very fortunate, like Senator Crossin, to have spent some of my past living in remote parts of the Northern Territory and have viewed the damage that is caused by this otherwise innocuous substance that helps a car go. It is very damaging to communities and families, because the nature of the substance is that there are quite a spectrum of reactions when people are under the influence of petrol; it affects different people in different ways. Unlike with things like alcohol and other substances of abuse, where there is a general body weight indicator, for some reason—it is unknown, and not a lot of work has been done on it—some people hit this sort of psychotic state and you cannot speak to them or communicate with them. These are otherwise quite ordinary people. Yes, they have had some challenges and they are self-medicating; but, notwithstanding that, quite ordinary people behave in the most unexplainable ways, and it is just so destructive.


It covers a spectrum. At one end, they simply need petrol to sniff, so they will humbug, they will break things, they will hurt people or they will hurt themselves until you give them some more petrol or access to more petrol. That is extremely damaging to a community and to a family. The tragedy at the other end of the spectrum—I almost hesitate to remind the chamber—is shown by the circumstances where an 18-year-old petrol sniffer followed a group of young boys and girls, between the ages of six and nine, down to a billabong. He was in such a psychotic state that he waded into the billabong, grabbed an eight-year-old girl, and sodomised her and drowned her simultaneously. Imagine the psychotic state where that would happen. You can imagine the community's sense of grief and lack of understanding of how this could possibly happen in the community.


These are the sorts of events that we have, I think, managed to ameliorate substantially. It did not come because of some miracle in this place or legislation; it came through the miracle of technology—the miracle of Opal. I would have to commend the previous government and commend Tony Abbott for his leadership in saying to BP, 'We wish to develop a fuel that doesn't have the nasty bits that make you high—a non-aromatic or low-aromatic fuel.' That was done by BP, and I have to say that in my time in this area I have never seen such a change literally overnight. There were people whom I did not recognise. I knew they were sniffers; I would have vague conversations with them, but they were never going to make much sense. They changed into people whom I met for the first time—really wonderful people who had come out of the smog. I think it had a fantastic influence. It was expanded by the Howard government. I would also like to commend the current government, who have taken up that strategy and pursued that with the same vigour. I would also commend Warren Snowdon. He has certainly been very passionate about the continued rollout, and I know he shares the frustration of this place and the commitment to ensuring that we get it right.


The Central Australian Youth Link Up Service has been mentioned often in here, as it should be. If I could build on the other compliments that Tristan Ray and Blair McFarland have had, for me as a very practical person—and I know Tristan and Blair would understand—they provide minute feedback about what works and what does not. I know they run a great link-up service.


They are able to tell me forensically what is actually happening out there in the communities. They can say that to a person. They can say, 'There are eight people now, but four of them actually went last time in the football round that went over hundreds of kilometres. We now know as a consequence that there are another seven more. Four live here and three live here.' Such is the nature of their intelligence network on the ground that it gives us the capacity to be able to deal quite forensically with this issue which is so very important.


Despite the fantastic work of the previous government, this government, the innovation of BP and the rollout of Opal at a cost of between $23 million and $28 million over forward estimates over years, we are now, tragically, seeing substantial leaks in the system. We have reports now from CAYLUS on the spectrum of people engaging in petrol sniffing and the horror that comes with it. In an incident in the last couple of weeks, an 18-year-old petrol sniffer stabbed an eight-year-old boy in the head. It was not good. It was not just a poke. I do not want to go into the details, but this never would have happened otherwise. We have seen these communities rise up with people free of that stuff and it has now just started to come back. I share the frustration. We have to get this right.


One of the reasons that it has started to come back is the recalcitrance of a number of petrol stations. The government and the opposition have done all sorts of things. We have all worked together to support initiatives. One of the initiatives of the current government is to ensure that we provide a petrol station that only sells Opal across the road from one that does not. I wrote to the then Northern Territory Chief Minister and said, 'Don't let any Territory cars fuel up at this service station.' The Commonwealth agreed. We have gone to every possible length within the law to lever people who are not playing the game into doing so, but because there are leaks in the process that is always going to be the case. That is why it is absolutely essential that we get this right.


We have had a careful look at this legislation. I approached Senator Siewert and said we would support her in a bill that did pretty much what this bill is doing. Sadly, for whatever reason, Senator Siewert decided pretty shortly afterwards that the Greens would move it on their own. I had a private meeting with Minister Snowdon. He was frustrated. He believed that the way forward was, in fact, for the states and territories to legislate because it was more effective legislation and we need it to be part of a national framework. I was convinced that was probably the way to go. He had some frustrations. The flavour of government changes. We have the coalition in power in the Northern Territory, Western Australia and Queensland, while South Australia is Labor—but that might have been a bit of challenge. Certainly, in terms of this particular legislation, I think there has to be a better way.


This legislation came through a very comprehensive committee process, and once again I would like to commend the wonderful Senator Moore for traipsing around the countryside and taking evidence in all sorts of places from all sorts of people and for a wonderful report. A significant part of that report was recommendation 6, which, in light of the preceding five other recommendations, recommended that the current bill not proceed.


I know we will hear from the other side about it being all workable or whatever it is going to be. We will be listening carefully to that, but we certainly will not be supporting this legislation for a couple of pretty significant reasons. We do not think it is going to work. It will not work because it effectively relies on corporation powers. I can tell you right now, without naming any players—and I know Senator Siewert indicated this in her report—that, whilst there was no evidence given that they were not all covered by the Corporations Act, there is in fact a place that is a partnership and not a corporation power that would not be caught under this. I also got some legal advice about how convoluted but easy it would be for an organisation to change status to escape those sorts of processes. Whether you become a sole trader or a partnership, you are simply not going to be caught under this legislation. So there will still be leakage.


There has to be a better way, and I think the better way is through framework legislation. There is legislation in the Northern Territory. It was put in by the previous Labor government, and I commend the government. A lot of work went into it. It not only deals with petrol but with all volatile substances. That is the Volatile Substance Abuse Prevention Act 2005. When the new Northern Territory government came into power, I had better access so I said, 'We have had this piece of legislation, but in the context of petrol it has not been used.' I will not go into the intricacies of it—there is no mischief. There are further amendments required. I have spoken to the new minister. They have sought advice on a new amendment and I understand that new amendment is going to be introduced to enable these things. This is an act that does not rely on the corporations powers. This is an act that enables us to forensically take a lease on a petrol station. I am not sure you can draw a moving line around one person, but this is the closest piece of legislation to doing that. It is ultimately as flexible as you can get it. We can actually effectively prohibit the sale of a particular product in a particular area for a particular amount of time. Nobody wants legislation smashed for a long time. I very much commend this legislation to this place.


There is another matter, and it is not my word you have to take on this. Sadly, as I have indicated, there have been a number of deaths associated with volatile substances. The coroner at a West Australian coronial inquest said:


The Volatile Substance Abuse Prevention Act of 2005 (NT) has been an effective tool in the NT for ensuring that chronic solvent users who are at risk of severe harm undergo suitable treatment at appropriate facilities.


The coroner went on to recommend that.


In similar circumstances, a South Australian inquest recommendation was that the South Australian minister for health consider introducing legislation before the South Australian parliament similar to that encompassed with the Northern Territory Volatile Substance Abuse Prevention Act 2005.


For those who are concerned about moving forward on this, I can provide some hope to this place. I know we are in opposition but, because this is such a bipartisan issue, I spoke yesterday to the Labor minister in South Australia, and they are engaged in assisting me and others in having a look at this framework in the Northern Territory. If they have any amendments to it, we will seek to provide that information to the Northern Territory government, and they could include those in their amendments. I have spoken to the office in Queensland and they are also engaged in ensuring that they can provide some feedback on the framework. Sadly, I missed a call from WA's Peter Collier last night, but I spoke to his adviser on this matter and hopefully we will be speaking today. Substantially this is not just a matter for the Northern Territory. I think it is a good framework that will work. The reason I was talking to them today was not because I needed to tell you all that today. I actually thought I would be coming in today and saying: 'Sorry, Rachel, but, as I have already indicated to you, we are not supporting this. We think there are some flaws in it. But we are not giving up. We're off and working. We're off doing some practical things, talking to people and getting some things done.' But, sadly, we have come in here this morning and heard this. I heard about it at 20 past eight when Minister Snowdon rang me. I am not saying he was tardy about that, as I understand that must have been pretty much when either he heard or he changed his mind. It was hard to know from our conversation.


But, given the fact that the minister had told the Northern Territory government that they were not supporting the proposed act and asked me not to support the proposed act, I was very surprised to hear this morning from Minister Snowdon that the government was in fact supporting this proposed act and was not opposing it and moving in another direction. This backflip goes against the report recommendations, after the excellent work done by Senator Moore, Senator Crossin, Senator McKenzie and Senator Smith—who are in the chamber—and Senator Siewert. To me it really beggars belief that, on this very important issue on which we have had such a bipartisan approach, we have suddenly had a backflip. I am a bit cranky about it. I do not know the detail and I do not know what happened.


Senator Siewert may be able to throw some light on it when she makes her contribution in the committee stage. I know that our First Australians will be dying to hear what the issue was that they were traded off against. There is no other reason apart from such a deal that I would have got a phone call this morning—at 'two minutes to midnight'—telling me: 'Oh, by the way, we've just changed our mind completely on this. Come and get a briefing from someone,' someone who did not even know the Corporations Act seemed to appear in it. It was all pretty pathetic. So it is obvious to me that you have done a deal, and I think the Greens need to come clean. They have to put their hands up and say, 'This was part of the deal.' 


We know—and I say this without mischief—that this is a second-class solution. We have a first-class solution, in the volatile substances act, and we should not offer a second-class solution to our First Australians because we have done some grubby deal about something. I do not know about it. Perhaps the Greens would let us know. Perhaps it is not grubby—some deal on Malaysia or tax—but who would know? But these circumstances cannot be interpreted in any way other than: 'We're going to do a backflip.' I have to say to those on the other side that you do have a bit of form on this. Perhaps that is the way of things. I have forgotten how long ago it was that I was in government, and I am not really sure, but perhaps that is the way. Scrapping immigration policy because it would be popular—but not necessarily in our national interest—might have been one of the things. Just the other day, we had the supertrawler issue. There was a bit of a Twitter go, so it was 'We'll just change our mind on that.' Poor old Joe over here, who just the day before had been saying, 'Absolutely not; we've got to protect good science,' had to roll up here and then say—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Cameron
):  Senator Scullion, you know that you should address—




Senator SCULLION:
  Sorry, Senator Ludwig—it was a term of affection. Of course, we have been stuck since then. We saw it again with the carbon tax. I am sure that the Prime Minister said, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead,' because that was popular and that was what people wanted to hear. But, with what they delivered, again, it is the Greens corner that seems to have this commonality. Every time the government stroll into the Greens corner, they suit their own purposes of staying in power but they lose sight of looking after Australians. 


In this case, this place has been pretty good. I am very proud of how we have all dealt with this matter in a bipartisan way, given the challenges that face our First Australians. I am very proud of the way we have gone about doing that. But, as has been shown historically, inevitably behaviour will out. Today we are faced with something upon which we could have had a first-class solution that everybody agreed to. In fact, the committee made this recommendation:


The committee recommends that the Australian Government continue to consult with the relevant state and territory governments on the possibility of national legislation …


That recommendation is before us now. But this legislation is only enabling legislation. You may believe that this legislation will make some changes tomorrow. It will not. But the thing that saddens me most, and it is a great sadness—and we have all been dragged into this reluctantly, I suspect, including the minister—is that for the first time we are definitely using the interests of our First Australians as currency in some grubby trade-off. I think the Greens should come clean and tell us exactly what that trade-off is.




Senator Milne:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I object to the use of the term 'grubby trade-off with our First Australians'. I think that is really an offensive way to discuss what is going on in the Senate.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Scullion, I think you are reflecting on the Greens and the senators in the Greens party. I think you should withdraw.




Senator SCULLION:
  I want to speak to the point of order, if I may.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Sure.




Senator SCULLION:
  I was actually reflecting on the outcome. As I said, I think it is a grubby deal, the deal that was done. I was not saying that the Greens did a grubby deal.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Scullion, I do not accept that. You should withdraw.




Senator SCULLION:
  I withdraw. I believe the Greens should come forward and tell us what the deal was. Was it that uncharitable word I used? They need to come forward on this. We will not be supporting this legislation for two reasons: firstly, it will not work and, secondly, it is a part of a particularly unsavoury deal.

"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2012-11-22,"



Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (10:22):  The one thing that keeps this chamber together is the consideration of the welfare of our community, and I object to what Senator Scullion said. Senator Scullion and this side of the chamber have worked very closely together in a shared commitment to ensure that our First Australians receive strong services in our community. We share that. In terms of the process around the Low Aromatic Fuel Bill 2012, this is not the first time that the Senate's community affairs committees have considered the issues around petrol sniffing. In fact, we have had three inquiries on the issue. Everybody acknowledged that there needed to be action. Everybody acknowledged that the use of Opal fuel was one of the key strategies that was going to make a genuine difference.


In 2006, the first inquiry looked at hope in our communities, and the stunning title of the report was, Beyond petrol sniffing: renewing hope for Indigenous communities. One of the recommendations from that committee inquiry was a call for people to work together to ensure that Opal fuel was available across the areas of need. We called on state and territory governments to work with the Commonwealth to ensure that Opal fuel was available and used so that those communities were protected.


In the limited time I have I am not going to talk about all the other recommendations that we have had from our inquiries year in, year out. I acknowledge the reverence with which Senator Scullion refers to our committee and refers to the recommendations that we make. But, as we in this chamber all know, we make lots of recommendations and they are not all acted upon. In terms of the work that we do in our committee, I think that we would have had strong policy if governments of all flavours had taken up every single recommendation of every single community affairs committee inquiry of which I have been a member but, to my sorrow, that has not happened. What happens is that committees work together. They look at issues and bring forward recommendations for governments of all flavours, and decisions are made and work continues around them.


In terms of petrol sniffing, in 2006 we said that there needed to be coordinated work into the future to look at the way that Opal fuel could be developed, distributed and used effectively in the communities. Then we move forward to 2009, when the committee again looked at the issue of petrol sniffing across Australia. There were very encouraging issues that came forward in 2009. I know other senators talked at length about the wide range of issues that work together, including the importance of community empowerment and diversionary programs, but the petrol-sniffing strategy in which Opal fuel is key continued to be a major plank of work across the parliament to ensure that petrol sniffing was addressed.


In 2009, our committee was so frustrated by the continued lack of clarity around what was happening with Opal fuel. In fact it was that committee that, in 2009, recommended that there should be a process across governments to look at mandating the use of Opal fuel. It is there in our recommendations—I believe it was recommendation 5. In 2009, to my disappointment, we did not get that recommendation taken up immediately. But the issue continued to be discussed, and all of us who are interested in this area continued to work with communities and community organisations. One of the things that was on the agenda the whole time was frustration that there continued to be so much misinformation perpetrated by a range of individuals. We have never been able to actually find someone to talk to who raises these issues about the damage that Opal fuel can do to cars and the fact that it would be difficult to have financial advantage if you used Opal fuel in communities. These things continued to happen. We noted that in 2009 and we said that there needed to be changes into the future.


Senator Siewert, in putting forward her bill, referred to the recommendations of the 2009 committee inquiry. She said that there had been a lack of action. She said that we know things have continued to happen but we need something to cut through to address the frustration that we all share about the fact that we have a tool that we know works. There is no debate about the fact that the use of Opal fuel reduces petrol sniffing in communities. No-one even argues that point. It is clear and it is documented; the evidence is there. The issue with which we continued to struggle is the fact that, seemingly, we could convince some people in the business community that the use of Opal fuel was something that should be part of their business model and that working in Aboriginal communities where there could be danger had with it in many ways a community responsibility to provide the services that would best suit their communities. That was something with which we were struggling.


As people have pointed out in this debate, there continues to be ongoing work with the federal and state governments to move towards getting responses to this process. That was the discussion we had throughout the recent inquiry which finalised in September this year. When we put forward our recommendations, we said that the work needed to continue. We accepted that a process needed to happen. We said that the bill put forward did not meet some of the legislative processes and that it needed to be amended. As you can see, there have been a number of amendments drafted to address the issues that we raised in the committee recommendations. If you look at the minority report from Senator Siewert, you can see that she picked that up. She acknowledged that there needed to be changes to the draft legislation that was put before us.


Now that work has been done and, again through due process, we have come back to this place to say that this is one step that can be taken. It will not solve all the problems. No-one pretends that one step will solve all the problems. But we have a process that we are putting before the parliament that says that, if you follow this act, a framework could be implemented, a trigger could be implemented that the minister could use to say, 'In this circumstance, we're going to step in.'


It is not to stop the other issues. It is not to stop the valuable work that continues to happen amongst governments to work towards agreements to ensure that they can maintain the positive steps that they have taken up till now. I think one of the reasons for putting this legislation forward is to give that a bit of impetus and to say, as we have to in many cases when governments need to work together: 'Get a move on. This needs to be done.' There needs to be an urgency about the process because, while we are waiting and discussing and reviewing, people continue to have the horror of petrol sniffing in their communities. That was the evidence we had before our committee, and no-one denies that.


Communities sat before us, telling us about the horrors of petrol sniffing—the fact that, with all the efforts that have happened up to now, there are still outbreaks of sniffing—and that people continue to have that awful virus that seems to spread so quickly and everyone has been struggling to find out what stimulates it and how it continues. As long as there is petrol available in the community, petrol that allows the sniffing to happen, sniffing will happen.


The legislation that is before us is not perfect. In fact, I cannot remember a single piece of legislation placed before this place that has ever been perfect, so we continue to look at how things evolve and how we can make things better. What we are asking the government and the parliament to do is to take this step as one step along the road: to maintain the discussion, to maintain the debate, to maintain the commitment. When that happens, we can genuinely say that we have made a difference. We are not imposing this; we are engaging in it. We are responding to the need that has been put before our committee, before each of us individually. Everyone who is part of this debate has been working with communities and is dealing with people on a weekly and monthly basis.


I reject that this is something that is being rushed through. I think we have waited, I think we have encouraged continuing action and I think that this is one step that parliament can take to address the issues that we all know about. If we do not take this step, I am wondering how much longer we do have to wait.

"Smith, Sen Dean",LP,2012-11-22,"



Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia) (10:31):  I am also pleased to have this opportunity to speak on the Low Aromatic Fuel Bill 2012. As a member of the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee, at the outset of my contribution I would like to say how grateful I am for all those who have taken the time to make a contribution to the committee's inquiry on this important subject and add my commendation to those of other senators on the work of CAYLUS, the Central Australian Youth Link Up Service, which gave a very fulsome presentation to the committee over numerous days and was quite instrumental in making sure that the committee had an opportunity to hear from those most affected by the damaging consequences of petrol sniffing.


On a more personal note, the issue brought to the fore for me the central role that women will play in resolving many of the social issues we confront in Indigenous communities, but also the very important and urgent need to make sure that young Indigenous males across Central Australia and my home state of Western Australia have the necessary support and encouragement to avoid the temptation of petrol sniffing.


Petrol sniffing is a problem that has bedevilled areas of Northern Australia since the 1950s. Since the 1980s there have been a number of inquiries and solutions proposed to address petrol sniffing and its harmful, indeed tragic, social consequences. The most significant step at a Commonwealth level came, I am pleased to say, in 2005 when the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Tony Abbott, was the Minister for Health and Ageing. Mr Abbott's passionate, genuine and ongoing commitment to the welfare of Indigenous communities is well known to most Australians. In March 2005, as health minister, he worked with industry to commence the rollout of a form of low-aromatic fuel, more commonly known as Opal, across parts of Central Australia that had been identified as areas with particularly high instances of petrol sniffing.


Opal was developed by BP Australia and is a form of unleaded fuel that contains low levels of aromatic hydrocarbons. That means that a petrol sniffer will not be able to obtain the high from this form of fuel that they would from regular unleaded petrol. Opal fuel is produced by BP's facility in Kwinana, in my home state of Western Australia, but other petrol-retailing companies have agreed to distribute it through their own retail outlets.


The Howard government committed $42.7 million over five years to make Opal available to more and more communities throughout Central Australia. The Howard government invested a total of $55.2 million over four years on its whole-of-government Petrol Sniffing Strategy. And I join with Senator Scullion in commending also the efforts of the Rudd and Gillard Labor governments for the continued rollout during their tenures. As at 1 July this year, there were 123 sites across regional and remote Australia that were receiving low-aromatic fuel, and 67 of those sites were within zones identified as high risk for petrol sniffing activity. Focusing on my own state of Western Australia, the East Kimberley region has been identified as an area with a significant petrol-sniffing problem. In Western Australia there are 26 sites currently receiving low-aromatic fuel, with a further 18 sites targeted for rollout in the near future.


I am disappointed and saddened to say that only yesterday we heard of a firsthand account of the dangers and perils of petrol sniffing, when a 13-year-old boy unfortunately had almost 40 per cent of his body burnt after setting himself alight while sniffing petrol. The boy is believed to have inflicted the injuries on himself when his family found him sniffing in a shopping centre car park in South Hedland—and South Hedland is a place where I spent much of my youth, as my father was a police officer there in his early years. The boy was subsequently flown to the Princess Margaret Hospital. This incident points to the fact that this is a recurring issue.


But, while it is a recurring issue, I want to remind all of us that we must acknowledge the success of the low-aromatic fuel initiative. Universally it is accepted as having made a valuable and significant contribution to reducing the incidence of petrol sniffing. In the committee's report, I am pleased to say, we take some time to draw attention to the fact that the introduction of Opal has been significantly successful. In our report we mention:


The story of the manufacture and distribution of low aromatic fuel in central Australia, to substitute for sniffable fuel, is a story of spectacular policy success. It is a rare and precious achievement in the challenging field of Indigenous health policy. The initiative has involved a partnership between the private sector, including both large and small businesses, governments at all levels, non-government organisations, and Indigenous communities.


This statement in this latest report is consistent with previous findings. People will be familiar with the fact that the committee concluded in its 2009 report that 'the supply of Opal fuel has been a resounding success in helping to reduce petrol sniffing'.


I think it is fair to say, and I echo the comments of other senators, that the majority of submissions have noted the success that has been achieved to date with the voluntary rollout of low-aromatic fuel. I would like to draw specific attention to the contribution of Mr David and Mrs Margaret Hewitt, who have been activists in Indigenous communities and have committed themselves for a very long period of time to supporting the work of Indigenous communities.


Mr and Mrs Hewitt in their submission to the committee noted:


… the introduction of the Opal low aromatic fuel has had the biggest single positive impact on the health and welfare of Indigenous people in the 48 years of our work in remote regions.


What we are being asked to deliberate on today is not the suitability or the appropriateness of low-aromatic fuel as a means of containing petrol sniffing but instead what is the most appropriate legislative mechanism to deal with recalcitrant fuel suppliers across Central Australia—and, I might add, other parts of our country—that for reasons perhaps best known to themselves are not yet able to commit themselves to the introduction of Opal fuel. It is the legislative mechanism that requires our careful deliberation.


The committee's report as a result of its most recent inquiry found that the Commonwealth's efforts to communicate to outlets the benefits of selling low-aromatic fuel during the last 3½ years have not yet yielded great success. It was interesting to note that some of those who presented to the committee said they had never been asked about the possibility of supplying Opal fuel through their outlets. That suggests to me that the problem may not be outlets refusing to stock Opal, as some of the commentary around this issue has suggested, but at least in some instances it is a case of operators not having access to the information about the benefits or some of the assistance available to them in terms of moving from regular unleaded petrol across to Opal fuel.


My concern and the concern of other coalition senators in relation to the current bill is that, whilst it has honourable intentions, it has overlooked some important issues and may produce unintended consequences. Firstly, the Commonwealth government is already working with state and territory governments to address some of the issues outlined in the committee's report. There is goodwill from all parties and a determination to work through the issues cooperatively and comprehensively. To simply impose Commonwealth legislation now would merely bring that process to a halt.


I share Senator Scullion's suspicions about what might have motivated a change in the last 24 hours in regard to the government's consideration of and attitude to this private member's bill. I think it is worth reflecting that the minister, Mr Snowdon, has said previously how wrong this proposed approach would be. On ABC back in February of this year Mr Snowdon said the Commonwealth legislation as proposed in this bill:


… creates, I think, a potential legal minefield.


Again, he said:


If the Northern Territory government had in its mind that it ought to regulate it could, as could a Western Australian government, as could the Queensland government.


In July of this year he also said the same to his state ministerial colleagues, as reported by the Australian:


He told the ministers it was difficult to see how a commonwealth ban on unleaded fuel—which he has previously described as a ""legal minefield""—would have a greater impact on addressing petrol sniffing and state and territory legislation.


So what we are dealing with at the moment is a situation where, by the government's own admission, the proposition before us is not a worthy one—or at least is a second-class one.


The Greens say that the constitutionality of their bill is underpinned by the corporations power. The problem with that approach is that some of the bodies involved in the rollout of Opal fuel maybe unincorporated traders. As a result, the bill may be creating a loophole through which traders within petrol-sniffing zones can go on selling regular unleaded petrol—the opposite outcome to the one the bill seeks to remedy. Furthermore, what is contained in this bill will not do anything to actually address supply issues. BP's capacity to produce Opal fuel will not simply be increased as a result of passing legislation. Storage facilities for the distribution of the Opal fuel will not magically appear merely because this parliament passes a piece of legislation. Even the Greens who have authored this bill appear to have acknowledged this point. It is right there in the Greens minority report, which says:


This bill introduced by the Australian Greens does not in itself cause anything to take place.


I do not doubt for a moment the sincerity of the Greens' intentions in terms of what they have brought to the Senate, but I do question the merits of passing legislation in this place when even its proponents admit it will not cause anything to take place. Australia needs to make sure that its legislative approach is focused on getting outcomes. I am not convinced that this bill passes that simple test.


But there is a better way. There is already a process of discussion and negotiation under way between the Commonwealth and the relevant state and territory jurisdictions to deal with many of the issues that were raised during the committee's inquiry into this bill. For instance, I know that my coalition colleague Senator Scullion has met with the recently elected Chief Minister of the Northern Territory to discuss this very issue. During the committee's inquiry I actually raised the idea of replicating some of what the Northern Territory has done and fostering a coordinated approach across other state jurisdictions. That would seem to me to be a solution far preferable to additional Commonwealth legislation in this circumstance.


The indication in the Northern Territory is that the new Country Liberal Party government will be open to further amending the Northern Territory's volatile substances act to deal with this issue. There is no reason why that approach could not then be replicated in other relevant state jurisdictions. I am confident that the coalition government in Western Australia will be speedy in its response to this important issue. I acknowledge that sometimes the Commonwealth may be forced to legislate when states actively refuse to address a critical issue. That is not the case in this issue. No-one is denying that action must be taken. I think there is merit in allowing a solution based on state and territory legislation to proceed. It will allow for a more flexible and better targeted approach. All of us in this place want to see the supply of Opal fuel expanded and the problem of petrol sniffing eliminated. However, I do not feel that this bill will achieve that in the most effective way and in fact risks the creation of other difficulties. That is why I am opposed to it.


In this debate I think it is important to acknowledge that the commitment to improving the lives of Indigenous Australians is genuinely a matter that transcends party politics. We hear a lot of talk in this place about bipartisanship. Sometimes that is opportunistic but, fortunately, this is not one of those times. During my six months as a senator for Western Australia I have been struck by the genuine commitment of all my Senate colleagues to improving Indigenous lives, especially those in remote communities.


 


The hearings that the Community Affairs Legislation Committee held in regard to this specific bill were a powerful demonstration of that commitment, and I am grateful to senators from all parties on that committee for their efforts. Here was an example of the Senate and its committee process working at their best. Yes, there is now a discussion about the best way forward on this critical Indigenous social issue; however, I want to make it clear for the record that what is at issue merely amounts to a question over the best route, not the ultimate destination.


The coalition agrees with the need to stop petrol sniffing but believes this bill will be ineffective on the issue and that the issue is best handled at a state and territory level. In the Northern Territory many will be aware that the Territory's Volatile Substance Abuse Prevention Act—which could be enabled in other jurisdictions, with minor amendments—does enable supply of sniffable fuel to be banned in certain areas. This act could form framework legislation in other states, allowing effective anti-sniffing measures that better reflect local circumstances and differences amongst different Indigenous communities.


The Community Affairs Legislation Committee recommended the bill not proceed. It recommended that the act should not rely on the corporations power. It recommended that ongoing coordination with state and territory governments to prevent supply issues with Opal should be pursued. It also suggested that a review of Opal production and distribution subsidies should be more closely undertaken. The bill before us relies on the corporations powers under section 51 of the Constitution. It will have no effect on unincorporated traders. This means that any sole trader, partnership or other trading entity would not be covered. We know from the current situation that one point of leakage is enough to allow sniffing outbreaks in large surrounding areas. I think we are all agreed on that significant point. Therefore, a bill that does not cover every trader in the area would be all but ineffective.


Our alternative is a simple one but a highly effective one. The Northern Territory's Volatile Substance Abuse Prevention Act can, subject to minor amendment, be used to tackle the problem. Under this act a group of 10 or more residents of a locality or a community council could seek to prevent supply of a particular substance, including petrol, in that location. In the Northern Territory the department of health would then lead a process that would take account of interested parties' contributions to develop a management plan that would be able to specify restrictions on supply and use of regular unleaded petrol and other sniffable substances at that location.


This approach is worthy not least because it is one that has been advocated by coroners in other jurisdictions. This approach was endorsed in a Western Australian coronial inquest into a tragic circumstance. That inquest said:


… the Volatile Substance Abuse Prevention Act 2005 (NT) has been an effective tool in the Northern Territory for ensuring that chronic solvent users who are at risk of severe harm undergo suitable treatment at appropriate facilities.


In similar circumstances in South Australia an inquest recommendation stated:


That the Minister for Health consider introducing legislation before the South Australian Parliament similar to that encompassed within the Northern Territory Volatile Substance Abuse Prevention Act 2005 …


Senator Scullion has been actively working with the Northern Territory government to bring about this solution. I am sure that other senators, including me, from Western Australia, can use their energies and motivations to ensure that other jurisdictions follow suit in a speedy and effective manner.


It is very clear that what we have seen in the last 24 hours is a step back from what would have been a highly effective first-class solution to a less than perfect solution that unfortunately could compromise the future welfare of young Indigenous Australians. In conclusion I again would like to congratulate the committee on their deliberations. I also congratulate CAYLUS for its work in fostering the development of young people across our Indigenous communities.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Low Aromatic Fuel Bill 2012</title>,BILLS,0,1
"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2012-11-22,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (10:49):  I rise today to wholeheartedly support the Low Aromatic Fuel Bill 2012, which is currently before the Senate. This is an excellent bill that Senator Rachel Siewert needs to be congratulated for. She has shown tremendous leadership on this issue, and her commitment has been long running, from her first speech, which I had the pleasure of listening to, back in 2005. She spoke then about the scourge of petrol sniffing and the need to deal with it. I congratulate her on that and on her participation in the initial petrol-sniffing inquiry, in 2006. She has continued to lead on this issue, always consulting with Australia's Indigenous people and always listening to their responses. It was Senator Siewert who initiated the 2009 Senate inquiry to follow up on the 2006 report. It was those inquiries that prompted the government's first comprehensive petrol-sniffing strategy, which did include a voluntary rollout of the low-aromatic fuel. She has now consistently followed that rollout, visiting communities, talking to stakeholders through the estimates process, and she has continued to push for a better outcome for the communities that could benefit from the broader rollout of Opal fuel and a ban on sniffable fuel. I really congratulate my colleague. As I have just said, it has been seven years in the Senate to the point where we now have a bill before us that I think ought to be supported by the Senate. I think it demonstrates what can happen when you have no one party having all the power and there is a capacity to negotiate outcomes, in which case you get outcomes for the community.


I heard Senator Scullion speaking in a most derogatory manner earlier suggesting that there had been some trade-off of the interests of Australia's Indigenous people. Nothing could be further from the truth. The Greens have had at the forefront of all our work in the Senate, always, the interests of Australia's Indigenous people. I just want to go through that for a moment.


It was my former colleague Senator Bob Brown who worked very hard to have Indigenous recognition as part of the opening of the parliament every day. That is a real improvement and recognition. It was in our agreement with the Prime Minister that we try to secure recognition in Australia's Constitution for Australia's Indigenous people. Furthermore, all our work trying to protect James Price Point, trying to secure substantial new cultural heritage listings, has always been to protect not only the environment but also the cultural aspects. The Burrup Peninsula is another place where we have worked very hard to protect the cultural heritage of Australia's Indigenous people when it has been set upon and undermined by the gas industry in Western Australia—something that is supported by the coalition at every turn, I might say, which destroys that heritage that is so precious to us.


Another example is that during the negotiation of the Carbon Farming Initiative I was very keen to make sure that one of the earliest methodologies we recognised in carbon farming permits was savanna burning, because Australia's Indigenous people in the Northern Territory have very important knowledge and skills. Getting that change to savanna burning not only is good for the planet in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions but also is actually providing money and employment to people living in Indigenous communities.


So the Greens at all times try to work for better outcomes for Indigenous people. I remind the Senate that it was the Greens who stood strongly opposing the Northern Territory intervention. We believed it was bad for Indigenous people, and we still do. We also stood up and opposed the so-called Stronger Futures legislation, which the government introduced, because we think it provides weaker futures for Indigenous people. I very proudly stood in the courtyard here with a number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander leaders saying that this Stronger Future legislation would be a disaster for them. So I will not have on the record anywhere a suggestion that the Greens are not acting in the bests interests of Australia's Indigenous people when we are informed by those people of what they want.


And that is the key point on which Senator Scullion is wrong. It is the communities themselves who are asking for this legislation, and it is ridiculous to suggest that a better process would be to go and talk to each of the states and territories and try to negotiate with them to legislate, because that is a recipe for never getting an outcome. Anyone who has been into a community and seen the appalling outcomes of long-term petrol sniffing knows not only that it can kill but that it damages internal organs, the brain and the nervous system. People who sniff petrol can become disabled and ultimately die. It does not just damage the health of the individual; it leads to family breakdown, domestic violence, community breakdown, vandalism and all sorts of shocking outcomes in communities. I think everyone recognises that if we can get rid of petrol sniffing we can at least enable people in Aboriginal communities to take up other opportunities for a positive engagement with life—with education, culture and music and so many wonderful things that can be achieved.


So I am wholeheartedly supporting this legislation. The scourge of petrol sniffing is still with us, because of recalcitrant petrol stations that refuse to stock non-sniffable fuel. This bill gives the minister the power to declare areas where it will be an offence not to supply non-sniffable fuel. It enables the minister to target suppliers in relation to specific communities that are being devastated by sniffing, and I am wholeheartedly in favour of giving the minister that power. To Senator Smith, who just suggested that this will not provide an outcome, I say: what other outcome do you want than to give the minister the power to go in an make it an offence to not sell this low-aromatic fuel?


This is actually providing an outcome. A talkfest with the Territory is never going to get you an outcome, because we see what goes on at COAG year in, year out. COAG is a great big black hole where the states frustrate action on a whole range of issues. What we want here is action to actually deal with the issue—the final piece of the jigsaw to deal with the issue of petrol sniffing and to end it. I cannot understand the mentality of petrol station owners who are prepared to exploit people and deliver horrendous outcomes in Aboriginal communities for their own benefit. But, since the mentality exists and there are recalcitrant petrol station owners, then something has to be done. I think it would be a thing to celebrate in this parliament if all political parties could join together and say: 'Let's do it. Let's just close this last gap in relation to this particular issue and let's give young Aboriginal people and their communities the chance that we want them to have.'


Anyone who has not been in the communities may have seen the film Samson & Delilah. If ever you want to see what is going on in communities, have a look at that film and come away and tell me that it is now not time to actually deal with this issue. It is essential that we deal with the issue. Let's do it. I do not think there is any justification in saying, 'No, this isn't the right mechanism.' Giving the federal minister the power is the right mechanism. I congratulate my colleague and again say that one of the real benefits of a parliament where outcomes have to be negotiated—where one party cannot just deliver something and have it rubber-stamped—is that you get collaborative outcomes. Senator Siewert's work over seven years in this place has finally led to a collaborative outcome whereby we are going to see, I hope, this legislation passed and the Greens able to deliver—with the government, it would seem—an outcome that will close that gap of disadvantage in relation to petrol sniffing in Australia's Indigenous communities.


I think it is a very positive step. So much is said about the way parliament behaves or does not behave. This is an opportunity for the Senate to show that we can demonstrate the leadership that is so essential and that is being asked for. That is the critical thing that is being asked for by Indigenous communities saying, 'Help us to do what we need to do to end petrol sniffing.' The Greens are very pleased to respond to that by saying: 'Yes, we will help you. Yes, we will legislate.' I again congratulate my colleague Senator Siewert for doing just that.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Low Aromatic Fuel Bill 2012</title>,BILLS,0,1
"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2012-11-22,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (10:59):  I appreciate the opportunity to contribute to this debate and to congratulate those who are involved. Certainly, as I look around the chamber, the contribution over a long period of time by Senator Siewert must be recognised, as must that of Senator Scullion and also Senator Crossin.


Mr Acting Deputy President Bernardi, you would have thought that this would have been a fine opportunity to demonstrate the very best elements of the combined roles of federal, state, territory and local governments and the private sector in trying to resolve this horrific issue. But, as we know in the case of the Low Aromatic Fuel Bill 2012, should it actually be passed, it is only ever facilitation legislation anyhow and will not achieve its goals. I, too, recognise Senator Siewert's passion over time for this particular area. But initially, if I may, I acknowledge the work of the then Minister for Health in the Howard government back in 2005, Minister Tony Abbott, who first introduced the concept of this low-aromatic fuel. The package, along with negotiations with the BP company on this occasion, also included activities to support communities and to engage in youth diversion programs, rehabilitation, policing, communication and education strategies. It remains today, as we know, critically important that we do have that broad approach in trying to solve this issue.


From a straight epidemiological point of view, the fact that there has been a 70 per cent average reduction in the incidence of petrol sniffing and the fact that in areas where there is no provision of regular unleaded petrol that it is even more effective—up to 94 per cent—are wonderful stories and must be supported. But what this shows is the need for the engagement of different sectors at different levels.


Let me give you an instance: at a local Aboriginal community level back in 2004-05, what would the capacity of that community have been to go to the fuel majors and say, 'We need the introduction of a low-aromatic fuel'? Their capacity would have been zero, and the capacity of local government in those areas equally zero. Even a state or a territory would not have had that capacity. So here was an example, quite correctly at federal level, where the then Minister for Health was able to go to the senior management of the fuel industry—the fuel majors; on this occasion, the BP company—and convince them of the need for what would have been an incredible cost to change a regular unleaded product into a low-aromatic fuel.


That is a prime example of where we did need the intervention of the federal government at a level senior enough and persuasive enough to be able to get an international fuel major to change the composition of its fuel. And so there is a prime example of where federal government intervention is needed. But, equally, in this particular instance it is patently obvious that the most effective roles will be those of the states of Western Australia, possibly Queensland and South Australia, and especially the Northern Territory to enact legislation to give effect to a solution that will work.


It was only in July of this year that the minister for Indigenous health, Minister Snowdon, was urging the states and, presumably, the Territory to tackle petrol sniffing by matching the Territory's legislation that relies on community involvement and tougher policing powers to tackle volatile substance abuse. That is the appropriate role for the federal minister; it was in July, it was yesterday and why it is not today seems unusual to me, and I think it deserves explanation.


At that time in July, Mr Snowdon was favouring the approach driven by local communities. He told ministers that it was difficult to see how a Commonwealth ban on unleaded fuel, which he had previously described as a legal minefield, would have a greater impact on addressing petrol sniffing than state and territory legislation. I have heard nothing in the debate this morning to cause me to understand why Minister Snowdon would have a different view today, 22 November, to that which he had at the time these comments were made, and I will come back to some of his other comments.


The Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee report itself recommended that the bill not proceed—not proceed!—for several reasons. One is not relying on the corporations power, and my colleague Senator Smith eloquently made the point that so many fuel retailers would not fall under corporations law. Maybe sole traders and maybe partnerships would not fall under the jurisdiction of corporations law. We know, as the committee itself said, that there are different definitions of fuels to which legislation applies. The committee said that there is a need—and I agree—for ongoing coordination with state and territory governments to prevent supply issues. And I wish to come back to supply issues; having in fact been a fuel distributor and retailer in one of Australia's states, it is an area of which I do have some understanding. A further recommendation of the committee was that there should be a review of Opal, the low-aromatic fuel, production and distribution subsidies, to which I will also refer.


So we have the committee saying that the legislation at federal level is not appropriate. We have the minister saying that it is appropriately a state and territory issue. Until yesterday, the Labor government were of the view that it was properly a state and territory issue. I do not know why there has been this change of heart, and it needs to be explained to this chamber— again, because this legislation is only facilitating legislation and of itself will not have the desired effect. I emphasise again, as others have in this chamber—and it would be no different for any reasonable-minded, thinking Australian—that we should be able to grasp and complete the study of this exercise and remove regular unleaded petrol from sale.


The position of the coalition is simply this: first of all, the bill itself will not stop sniffing, for the reasons that I mentioned. You have only got to have a sole operator or a partnership and the legislation does not apply to them. In the light of the preceding matters, the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee recommended that the current bill not be proceeded with. As a consequence, we would say that this is the wrong instrument, that it is inappropriate to use a Commonwealth arm of the law. In fact, I repeat what Minister Snowdon said in February this year—that the Commonwealth legislation creates 'a potential legal minefield'. Let us avoid the potential legal minefield and let us come up with a solution that will actually work. There is a better, more effective way. 


I know that, only in the last few days, Senator Scullion, who has responsibility in this area from the coalition's point of view, has been in contact with the ministers or their senior executives in each of the states of South Australia and Western Australia, and of course with the Chief Minister in the Northern Territory and the Minister for Health and Alcohol Policy, to move all of this forward. So we are all working in concert. There is nobody working at variance with our end objective. We simply plead for a circumstance where we can bring this home, where we can give effect to this particular legislation and make sure that we eliminate petrol sniffing. 


The bill does not address the Opal fuel supply and subsidy issues cited in the committee report. The committee itself recommended—and this is recommendation 4:


… that there be further examination of the wording of the explanatory memorandum, consultation and exemption clauses, to ensure that fuel manufacturers are properly included, and the bill does not have unintended consequences—




Senator Siewert:
  Read the amendments!




Senator BACK:
  Thank you, I will pay particular attention to the amendments, Senator Siewert. Recommendation 4 continues:


in the event of supply bottlenecks or disruption—


of supply. Recommendation 5 says: 


The committee recommends that the Australian government conclude as soon as practical a subsidy review that covers production of up to 100 million litres per annum of low aromatic fuel.


Where does the funding come from for this particular exercise? As most people would be aware in Australia, about one-third of the cost of all retail fuel is fuel excise tax and GST. So, in a typical $1.50 per litre price that somebody might pay here in Canberra, about 38c of that will be fuel excise tax and 13.6c is GST—totalling 51.74 per cent. So more than a third of the actual retail price does go to government in some form or another. So there certainly is adequate funding to be able to give effect to this, and that should not be, and has not been, presented as a barrier.


I now come to a well-understood point in most areas for people associated with the emergency services—and I would see addressing the issue of petrol sniffing as being in that category of emergency—and that is that problems are best solved closest to where the affected people are. Unfortunately—much as we think the federal government and everything it does is important and that Canberra is the seat of power as it relates to this area—the simple fact of the matter is that we are a Federation of states and territories, and it has been my experience, especially in the emergency services area, that the more remote you are from where decisions are made the less effective the outcomes of those decisions will be.


This provides us with a tremendous opportunity in my view for locals to own the issue. That is why I plead for a continuation of the process, where the matter is dealt with at state and territory level, so that they have ownership of the problem and can then drive it through to local communities. We know of course that the areas that are the subject of the proposed legislation at the moment are those in which the highest concentration of petrol sniffing occurs. But then, as has been recorded this morning again by Senator Smith, we had the regrettable circumstance only recently in Port Hedland in Western Australia—which of course is well outside the area of this proposed jurisdiction—where a young person suffered burns to 40 per cent of his body because he was apparently trying to obtain fuel for this sniffing. So we have got to come up with a wider solution, one which will actually expand beyond the high-concentration areas to pick them all up. I plead again for a situation in which we drive this to the local level, where there is the greatest demand and the greatest impetus for this to happen.


We all know, and those of us who are associated with local and small communities do know, that when those communities own the issue they also own the solution and they commit to its implementation. Where they see that issues are related to remote decision-making, they will turn off and they will not have that sense of ownership, which I think all of us would agree is required in such circumstances.


We have had recently some wonderful contributions, in my view, from Aboriginal women especially who are providing leadership in this country. I wish to reflect on them for a moment because it comes back to the point I was just making about local ownership, local responsibility and local determination to solve problems. Initially I go to the text of a letter from a Kimberley Aboriginal elder, Rita Augustine, which was sent to then Senator Bob Brown. She makes some wonderful points which I would like to repeat. She said:


We are proud of our history of caring for this country over thousands of years. The country tells us who We are. It gives us strength and determination. But now we face great challenges; not only about our country and our culture, but about our survival as Indigenous people.


Whilst not all the comments made were in relation to the question of petrol sniffing, so many of her comments are relevant to this debate. She speaks of the need 'to face up to our own challenges, and to build a better future for our children, our people, our culture, and our country'. Whilst I was not going to refer specifically to Dr Bob Brown, to whom she had written this open letter, as a result of Senator Milne's comments a few moments earlier I think it is reasonable that I do so. She said:


Dr Brown, it is hard for us to understand why you think it is necessary for you to speak on our behalf, about our country, our culture, and our futures.


The only thing We need saving from, is people who disrespect our decisions and want to see our people locked up in a wilderness and treated as museum pieces.


We are a living people and a living culture. We have faced severe change over the last 200 years, and most of it has been far beyond our control.


All of us in this chamber would agree that the issue that is before us now, that of the impact of petrol sniffing on young people, certainly has been beyond the control of that community of people. She went on to say:


I am an old woman now and I have witnessed and lived the despair and hopelessness of many Kimberley Aboriginal people.


She reflects on watching 'children grow up in despair, die before they are 50, or even worse, take their own lives before they get to their 20s', a very, very passionate statement. She also speaks of the need for her own community in that particular case to be the ones to actually make their decisions.


In the same theme, I would like to go very briefly to the farewell speech last week, on 14 November, in the assembly in Western Australia by the member for the Kimberley, Mrs Carol Martin—I think, the first Aboriginal lady in the Western Australian parliament. Whilst her speech was very comprehensive and wide ranging, she made a plea, in the same context of what I am saying. She said:


The Department of Indigenous Affairs is my bugbear forever. It is a colonial structure that is still in place in this day, in this age and in this country where Aboriginal people are given second-class service.


Get rid of it, please. … Give Aboriginal people the rights of citizens like any other citizens. 


She made that plea. I do not think it is any coincidence that it is Aboriginal women who are the ones who speak so eloquently for the Aboriginal community.


My final comment in relation to this are the comments and the quotations of Northern Territory minister Alison Anderson, who is one of the nation's most senior Indigenous politicians. Rebuking her own people earlier this month—which was widely publicised—for relying on welfare, she said that they need to grow up and stop resorting to the 'dangerous conversation of endless complaint' and that she 'despaired at the reluctance' of some of her community to take available jobs. She was talking of people in Yirrkala not being prepared to drive the 20 kilometres to Nhulunbuy 'to earn excellent money in the mine and the processing plant there'. She went on to reflect the loss of adults. She said that there were 'less than half as many adults per child as for the non-Indigenous population,' and she asked: 'Where are the missing adults? There is no way to put this gently: they are dead.'


In conclusion, I say that there is unanimity in this chamber on the solution of this problem. I plead that we come up with a solution that works, that we drive ownership of the issue to where it can actually be addressed—and in this case, legislatively, that is correctly the states and the territories—so that they own that problem, they own that responsibility and they get financial support from the federal government. If there is a further need for communication between the federal government and, for example, fuel majors, that is appropriately the role of federal government instrumentalities. The issue is state. The issue is territory. The issue is local. Please can we have a solution that reflects the locality of the issue?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Low Aromatic Fuel Bill 2012</title>,BILLS,0,1
"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2012-11-22,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (11:19):  It is with a heavy heart that I rise to speak on the bill before us today, the Low Aromatic Fuel Bill 2012. The intent of this bill is to change the Corporations Act to mandate the use of the low-aromatic fuel known as Opal in some areas, to prevent petrol sniffing—a terrible problem in our Indigenous communities. Other senators have spoken eloquently today and at other times on the problem that petrol sniffing is for our First Australians. The bill aims to ensure that communities with serious petrol-sniffing problems can contain and hopefully turn their situation around—and I do not think anybody in this chamber disagrees with the intent of this legislation as stated.


There are 123 sites in remote Australia selling Opal fuel, and a substantial increase in this number is foreshadowed. That is a positive step. Opal fuel is produced by BP and it has very low levels of aromatic hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbons are the chemicals which give sniffers their high. They are also the same type of molecules as those used in spray cans, which is what some young people use in other areas.


There are often tragic consequences for the sniffers, for their communities and for those who love them, and it is a particular tragedy when young people are petrol sniffers. However, some petrol stations within this area refuse to sell the low-aromatic fuel, and that goes to the crux of this bill. The Greens are attempting to go it alone on solving the issue of dealing with the remaining retailers in remote Australia who are selling regular unleaded petrol rather than Opal fuel. Senator Scullion made very clear his desire to work collaboratively with the Greens on coming up with a legislative solution to this scourge of our society.


I come from Victoria, where we do not have a large Indigenous population, and I had only heard about petrol sniffing; I had not experienced it. I was not part of the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee when they went to remote Australia and heard directly from the communities, but I did go and see the movie Samson and Delilah and was very challenged by what I saw. It follows the lives of two Indigenous teenagers, one of whom becomes a petrol sniffer, with tragic consequences. In the last scenes, the young woman, in order to save the man she loved, drove the car out into the bush and drained the petrol onto the ground so that there was no way of getting back, in order to get him away from the substance that was changing him so significantly and as a way of recovery and rehabilitation. I think that film took the issue out into the wider community.


The community affairs committee conducted the inquiry into the bill. They travelled to Alice Springs to see and hear firsthand from some of the stakeholders with intimate knowledge of this issue, and it was not the first time the committee had done that. I would like to place on the record my thanks to all those who contributed to the inquiry, who submitted, appeared and participated in any way, and the secretariat staff who worked so hard to put it all together under the leadership of Senator Moore and Senator Siewert, who are great advocates in the community affairs committee space for our First Australians.


The committee made a number of recommendations which included that this bill not proceed, and the Greens submitted a minority report. There were specific details around why the bill should not proceed, and one of them was that the legislation should not rely on the corporations power. Another was that different definitions of fuels to which the legislation applies should be addressed, and I note that through an amendment that has been addressed. Ongoing coordination with state and territory governments was also recommended to prevent supply issues with Opal. That goes to the crux of some comments I will go to later and the modus operandi, I guess, of the Greens in continuing to ignore and be frustrated by the fact that state governments exist in our Federation. The committee also recommended a review of the Opal production and distribution subsidies. I understand where the Greens are coming from when you look at the excellent results from the rollout of the Opal fuel. I appreciate the interest of Senator Moore, Senator Siewert and many others in this issue and I acknowledge that there is bipartisan support for ensuring a positive solution for affected communities. A solution that works around this issue is always going to be cross-jurisdictional.


The original rollout of Opal fuel and the development of the Petrol Sniffing Strategy was the initiative of the Howard government under the leadership of Tony Abbott as the then minister for health. The initiative was implemented through collaboration with industry and with some incentives to ensure that industry took up the opportunity to sell a product that would have such a positive benefit out there in Indigenous communities. The package also included activities to support communities—youth diversion, rehabilitation, policing, communication and education strategies. I am pleased to say that, as a result of that and of ongoing initiatives by the current government, Opal fuel is now available in 106 sites across Australia. This is a great step forward and one that not just the coalition but all Australians can be pleased with.


The results speak for themselves. Research indicates that where Opal fuel has been introduced it has been effective in reducing sniffing by, on average, 70 per cent. The result has been even better in areas where there are no retailers selling regular unleaded petrol, with a 94 per cent average reduction. So we know it works, leading to some fantastic results out there in communities. Although Opal fuel is subsidised, the savings to communities and individuals, in health care and otherwise, from Opal fuel are significant.


The community affairs committee heard from Mr Andrew Stojanovski, who spent 11 years in remote Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory working on petrol-sniffing issues and was awarded the Order of Australia Medal for his work. He told the committee in his submission:


Up until Opal was introduced in Central Australia I expected that I would spend my career working on petrol sniffing, community by community … Over my career the best I could hope for using this approach would be to eradicate sniffing in four communities over a period of forty years.


It would have been a long and slow process. He also said that, following all of his hard work, the introduction of Opal had not only changed the reality for Indigenous communities and petrol sniffers and those who love and care for them but also changed his life and how he saw his contribution to this problem.


The South Australian Centre for Economic Studies has found that there would be a $780 million benefit in shifting from regular unleaded petrol to Opal fuel in the area of their analysis. You will have heard from my colleagues here today about the Central Australian Youth Link Up Service. The service told the community affairs committee:


We consider the low aromatic fuel rollout to have been a great success to date. It has completely changed the focus of our work.


Fantastic! So we know the strategy works. It is a very impressive story from a Canberra policy sense and from a community sense out there on the ground.


No-one is arguing that we do not need to solve the problem and no-one is arguing with the fact that decreasing access to regular unleaded fuel assists with the problem. However, the bill before us today relies on the corporations powers under section 51 of the Australian Constitution. As such, it will have no effect on unincorporated traders. This means that any sole trader, partnership or other trading entity will not actually be covered, and there are a few petrol stations around our nation that are so constructed in the way they have set up their businesses.


We know from the current situation that one point of leakage or availability of regular unleaded petrol is enough to allow sniffing outbreaks in a large surrounding area; there is a black market in unleaded petrol in these areas. So it is a serious flaw that only certain traders and petrol stations are actually going to be covered. There are some traders who will stock and sell regular unleaded petrol—and we have seen that growing. That indicates that, if they see a commercial advantage in restructuring their businesses to continue to do so, they are going to do it. So the bill will end up being ineffectual as a result. The committee heard that there are even a number of traders who falsely believe that Opal fuel results in performance impacts and has a negative effect on engines. So there is a real issue around education. The belief in performance impacts has been proven to be untrue, but it is still up to traders to make their own decision on whether they choose to sell Opal. So the bill, which does not cover every trader in the area, will be all but ineffective. As this bill will apply only to incorporated traders, as I have said, there will still be regular unleaded petrol available from any petrol station trading as a sole trader or partnership or under another business model. In addition, a service station that has so far refused to stock Opal for whatever reason would only need to change its corporate structure to continue to sell regular unleaded fuel. The committee came to that same conclusion, recommending:


… that a legislative scheme for low aromatic fuel not be confined to reliance upon the corporations power.


Yet here we are today.


Perhaps the Greens could consider looking to the state governments, who have jurisdiction over these sorts of issues, to help find some constructive solutions. But I note Senator Milne's comments during this debate around the black hole of COAG and the disrespect that is continually shown to state governments and any collaboration that COAG or the state governments seem to do in developing national cooperative approaches that take into account the fact that they are separate entities. I look to Senator Waters's issues around the EPBC Act and state governments coming together with a framework on how we are going to go forward on dealing with environmental issues. I think the disrespect for the COAG process and the states as a consequence is the modus operandi for the Greens and does not always deliver the best policy solutions, as Senator Back outlined in his contribution with respect to localism. Similarly, Senator Scullion commented on the Northern Territory legislation that could be used as a framework for going forward. A further recommendation of the committee was, in fact, just this:


… that the Australian Government continue to consult with the relevant state and territory governments on the possibility of national legislation to mandate the supply of low aromatic fuel to ensure that there is agreed and coordinated action to address petrol supply. 


I am really looking forward to the committee stage of this bill to ensure that we have actually consulted with state and territory jurisdictions and to establish what form that consultation has taken. It is inappropriate to use Commonwealth law in an area which should be governed by state and territory law. Commonwealth legislation will be open to challenge and will apply only to incorporated traders, as I have already gone over.


The coalition has been seeking to address this issue. The Deputy Leader of the Nationals and coalition shadow minister for Indigenous affairs, Senator Scullion, has made very clear his intent to work collaboratively with the Greens and with the government on issues of improving the plight of our First Australians and to seek a bipartisan solution, because that is the only solution that is going to work going forward. Senator Scullion himself met with the Northern Territory Chief Minister, Terry Mills, as recently as 23 October to discuss petrol sniffing and associated issues. It was agreed that the Northern Territory's Volatile Substance Abuse Prevention Act could be used to stop the sale of regular unleaded petrol in certain areas, and the Chief Minister agreed that Senator Scullion could go on to discuss appropriate amendments.


So in the Northern Territory, where this problem plays out in communities most keenly, the wheels are already in motion to deploy the legislation against petrol sniffing—legislation, Senator Siewert, that will actually work. Under this approach, a group of 10 or more residents of a locality or a community council could seek to prevent supply of a particular substance, including petrol, in that location, which goes back to Senator Back's comments on communities taking control of their area. The Greens are right: in a previous contribution, Senator Milne, I think, said again that communities are screaming out for this issue to be addressed, but they are not screaming out for this bill and this approach.




Senator Siewert:
  Oh, yes, they are. That's where you're wrong.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order, please! Senator Siewert, could you not shout across the chamber.




Senator McKENZIE:
  I will continue to outline the Northern Territory approach. The Northern Territory Department of Health would then lead a process that would take account of interested parties' contributions to develop a management plan that could specify restrictions on the supply and use of regular unleaded petrol or other sniffable substances in that community. Senator Scullion has also written to the other states involved to propose that they consider adopting similar legislation. State and territory legislation based on the Northern Territory's can be more targeted and more flexible, will be more legally robust and will actually be a solution that provides confidence to those communities on the ground to take action when they experience a problem, instead of Commonwealth legislation being thrust upon them from Canberra.


The coalition has been proactive about developing a long-term, effective solution to this problem and has been attempting to work with both the government and the Greens—unfortunately, as of this morning, to no avail. Even the Greens themselves acknowledge that the bill would be ineffective. As they said in their minority report in the community affairs inquiry report:


The bill introduced by the Australian Greens does not in itself cause anything to take place. It is enabling legislation.


My concern, and the concern of the coalition, is that the Greens' decision to go it alone on the legislative approach to the scourge of petrol sniffing has meant the imperfect bill before us today. Petrol sniffing will not be stopped by this bill, not because of a lack of good intent in the bill but because it uses the wrong legislative mechanism to achieve the outcome. The Greens and Labor know this. I go back to my commentary on traders and how they will structure their businesses if there is a commercial advantage in doing so. We all know that they are capable of doing that.


Labor, as part of its opportunistic deals with the Greens, changed its mind. We do not know what the deals are; we just know that we are now debating this bill before us. Minister Snowdon changed his mind and now this bill is before us. It would be fantastic if the community and the Senate understood the price of getting this legislation onto the agenda this morning for debate with the government support. I guess we should not be surprised, because evidence based, effective policy for this government is shelved for political expediency, something we have seen time and again. We are here in the second-last week of our sitting year with another backflip as we have seen a political fix occur. I hope the details are going to be outlined somewhere. We have a couple more speakers. I hope that a little gold nugget will come forward. We saw it with the supertrawler, we saw it on live cattle exports, we saw it with the excising of the migration zone and we saw it with the carbon tax. With science and evidence based policy, a legislative approach that uses mechanisms that will work is shelved for short-term political gain. 


My strong desire, in terms of addressing this problem, was that the Greens would choose to use being highly effective with this Labor government, rather than this strategy, to get the bill on the agenda and get the government's support. The Greens chose to mobilise their highly effective e-campaigners—the 76,000 that changed the minds of Minister Ludwig and Minister Burke. They could mobilise them to get consumers and industry to get behind them by running their businesses and purchasing the products that will lead to long-term and effective change in Indigenous communities as Opal becomes the only fuel sold. I am not sure what really happened in the past day or so to change the government's mind. Obviously, the bill is being done. I wish that the— (Time expired)

"Boyce, Sen Sue",LP,2012-11-22,"



Senator BOYCE
 (Queensland) (11:39):  Petrol sniffing has apparently been around or known of since about 1951, but it was not until the 2000s that action was taken. Certainly, Senator Rachel Siewert, who was instrumental in getting the first inquiry held, deserves congratulations on doing that, as do many organisations, such as CAYLUS, and many elders, particularly the women, in rural Aboriginal and remote communities that pushed for something to be done about the scourge of petrol sniffing. As a member of the community affairs committee I have been involved in two of the three petrol-sniffing or low-aromatic fuel inquiries that the committee has held. It has been very instructive to visit communities and to see what is being done and what cannot be done because of the problems not just with petrol sniffing but with chroming and glue sniffing, with the substitution of marijuana, or ganja, for petrol when it is not available.


We are looking at a more serious problem and an underlying and complex problem around why petrol sniffing happens. Just recently the ABC reported that there had been an outbreak of petrol sniffing in Tennant Creek, with 10 young people sniffing petrol. It is really a very serious issue. Some of the things that have happened have certainly improved the situation, and the development of Opal fuel by BP is one that needs to be lauded and celebrated. In itself Opal fuel, the low-aromatic fuel, has made a major difference to the number of petrol sniffers.


Part of the original inquiry that sought to push the introduction of low-aromatic fuel said that youth programs needed to be established in many of the communities where petrol sniffing happened because it was a result of loss of self-esteem, it was a result of boredom and it was a result of lack of cultural connection. On the second inquiry that the committee held, we went to a number of remote communities, met people undertaking youth work programs and saw that there were some benefits beginning to develop. 


I must admit the one thing that has concerned me in many cases in regard to the sorts of programs that we as governments—federal, state and territory and even local—impose on Aboriginal communities is that we do not have a component to try and build local social and community capacity. We tend to still have the situation, which was obvious in one community we visited, where the youth worker leaves after a few months, as they are expected to do when their contract expires, and the program stops. I am very happy to accept that someone with a degree in youth work is probably far superior at setting up a youth development program than someone without a degree. But I certainly know of many communities throughout Australia where locals have seen a need and simply filled it, perhaps not as expertly as someone with a degree. But what we are not doing is giving communities the sense that they are in control of their own destinies and that they are the ones who should be working out how to fill the gaps.


The other consequence of petrol sniffing and other substance abuse is that in many cases in some of these communities we have a semi-literate generation of young people who are not able to assist their own children with their education. They do not see the benefits of education and do not support education for their children, which, of course, creates an ongoing problem that may yet affect another generation. It has really become a serious problem that needs very complex solutions and I congratulate all those who are working in the area to try to develop some of those solutions.


I note, in the outline accompanying the amendments to the Low Aromatic Fuel Bill that have been provided to us today, that the government says:


The Government recognises the devastating impact of petrol sniffing on young lives and the importance of action to reduce the incidence of petrol sniffing and its impact on families and communities. In this context these Government amendments are in keeping with the Bill’s object to reduce the potential harm to the health of people, including Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders, living in certain areas from petrol sniffing. The amendments also provide clarity on a number of technical issues to facilitate the clearer administration of the Bill.


If this is true, I cannot imagine that anyone would have any concerns with this bill. But when you get a virtually rewritten bill, with 25 substantial amendments attached to it, 10 minutes before the debate begins, with no notice to the coalition, naturally one suspects a rat. I noted that Senator Siewert interjected a number of times during speeches, saying, 'Read the amendments.' This was in terms of some of the coalition's objections to this bill. The amendments do in fact include a change so that instead of the bill saying 'a corporation must not supply regular unleaded petrol in a low-aromatic fuel area' it now says 'prohibiting the supply of regular unleaded petrol in a low-aromatic fuel area'. If this had been discussed and gone through with the coalition and if it had been suggested that this was a good way to get around objections to the Corporations Act not covering sufficiently the concerns and the organisations that are involved in ignoring the low-aromatic fuel position, that would be fine. But, of course, we have nothing except those words written on a piece of paper and Senator Siewert interjecting, 'Read the amendments.'


As I think everyone in this place knows very well, Senator Nigel Scullion has been at the forefront of trying to ensure that low-aromatic fuel is available throughout the Northern Territory, and many others in this place have been keen to ensure that low-aromatic fuel is available in my own home state, particularly in areas of Western Queensland where it currently is not available and in the APY Lands. This is not just a problem for Indigenous communities, but the main areas of concern have been in Indigenous communities, and that is where the change to low-aromatic fuels has made a very large difference. If in fact those amendments overcome the objections that were made by all parties when this bill was before the committee, then certainly let's look at them; let's consider them. However, given that there are currently negotiations going on with the states and territories and given that this bill appears to say that the minister will only legislate if states and territories do not, surely the best way to go ahead with this is through negotiation and discussion.


As I said, if the bill would do what the government now says it would do, let's have a proper look at it. Let's certainly look at going ahead with the legislation if it will reduce the incidence of petrol sniffing and therefore the devastating impact of petrol sniffing. We have no problems with that, but why would these amendments simply be rushed into the chamber with no discussion with the coalition, who I think both the Greens and the government know have strong concerns in this area about reducing and then eliminating petrol sniffing? Certainly it would be our strong intention to go ahead in that way, and the government and the Greens certainly owe it to us to sit down with us and look at this. Also, they should be talking to the communities and the state and territory governments involved. Without their involvement, it is a ridiculous proposition to suggest that this bill should simply be passed because the government and the Greens say: 'You don't need to read the amendments. You just have to accept our word that they do exactly what we say they do.' This is certainly not acceptable to the coalition but we are certainly open to discussion on the topic.



The PRESIDENT:  Order! The time for the debate has expired.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Low Aromatic Fuel Bill 2012</title>,BILLS,0,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2012-11-22,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (09:31):  I am very pleased that this chamber is finally able to debate the Low Aromatic Fuel Bill 2012, because unfortunately, despite the very serious and sustained efforts to end it, petrol sniffing is still persistent in some areas of Australia.


Over the past 20 years it has been the subject of reports, coronial and other inquiries and research projects. The impact of petrol sniffing on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander individuals and communities is very well documented and well known. The petrol-sniffing inquiry, in fact, was one of the first committee inquiries that I participated in in this place back in 2005-2006. The committee recognised that the situation with petrol sniffing in Australia was dire, and since that inquiry I am very pleased that there has been considerable movement on this issue.


We do now have a petrol-sniffing strategy and we have seen great progress all over Central Australia in dealing with this problem. There are very good programs that are supporting communities in their goal to eradicate petrol sniffing. Most fuel stations in the targeted areas have switched to low-aromatic, non-sniffable fuel or, as it is known, Opal fuel, resulting in a 94 per cent drop in petrol sniffing. That is according to the government's assessment of the success of the program.


But, unfortunately, there is still petrol sniffing occurring, and there are recurring outbreaks. One example that CAYLUS, which is the Central Australian Youth Link Up Service, spoke to Lateline about when they were presenting submissions and evidence to the latest inquiry, the inquiry into this bill, is:


There was one outbreak that sort of spread like wildfire through the Western Desert, which was 12-year-olds, the average age was 11 or 12. A kid came in and showed other kids how to do it and off it took.


When it was managed to be stopped in one community, one of the kids went to the next community and started it up there, and there were another 12 kids sniffing there. It took a couple of months of serious work by a lot of people to bring that one back under control.


As I said, that was some of the evidence that CAYLUS gave to the inquiry.


This occurred because, unfortunately, sniffable fuel is still readily available in some places. These outbreaks are very closely linked to gaps in the rollout of a non-sniffable fuel. These gaps exist because up until now we have relied on suppliers signing up to this process voluntarily. Currently, the government designates target areas under the strategy for non-sniffable fuel use, and then works and lobbies petrol station owners to have Opal or non-sniffable fuel replace regular unleaded fuel. Of course communities and service stations can also receive Opal on request, and this is part of the strategy for rolling it out. However, where petrol suppliers fail or refuse to collaborate, the problem of petrol sniffing and its associated horrors is more likely to occur; in communities close to those petrol stations that refuse to engage with supplying Opal fuel, you can track outbreaks.


CAYLUS provided an example from my home state of Western Australia where, up until the rollout of Opal in Laverton, the owner of one particular service station there had been refusing to stock Opal for a number of years. Fortunately, there was a change of ownership and the new owners agreed to stock Opal. That has had a dramatic impact in reducing the number of sniffers. The association between dealing with petrol sniffing and the rolling out of Opal is very clear.


We have been gathering evidence on this for quite some time. The Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry into this bill has clearly documented the success of the rollout of the Opal fuel program. But it has also shown firsthand that the categorical rejection of Opal fuel by a small minority, with what some witnesses called a 'pig-headed response', is where we have been struggling. As I have articulated, that is where we have the gaps. This is why we believe that it is very important that the government have the power to mandate the use of low-aromatic fuel. We believe it is essential, because we absolutely need that power to be able to plug these gaps in the sniffing strategy.


As of February this year, there were at least eight, and possibly more, retailers who have consistently refused to stock low-aromatic fuel. Evidence collected by CAYLUS suggests that these refusals have resulted in further sniffing incidents. We heard about those during the Senate inquiry.


According to CAYLUS, there have been areas of concern in Papunya, Lake Nash, Titjikala, Alice Springs, Kintore, Ti Tree, Canting Creek and a number of other places. These are the current places where we understand—the evidence has come in over the last six months—that there have been sniffing outbreaks. For example, Lake Nash is very close to a pub over the border in Queensland, Urandangi, which stocks sniffable fuel. That is, sniffable fuel is run into Lake Nash, which is trying really hard to deal with issues around petrol sniffing. Because cars can carry it across the border, it is really easy to bring it into Lake Nash. Because petrol sniffing does not contain itself within state borders, there needs to be a national approach to mandating fuel supply in designated zones rather than leaving it up to individual states and territories, as the federal government has previously proposed. We believe that it is essential to have a nationally coordinated response.


The Senate inquiry heard evidence to this effect from the Warlpiri Youth Development Aboriginal Corporation, who said:


Warlpiri families come and go across state borders so, for maximum impact, we would like to see this legislation applied to Western Australia, Queensland and South Australia as well as the Northern Territory. We know that Opal fuel has proven effective but, unless the sale of Opal is mandated, and across the broader region, there is a real danger of sniffing outbreaks and devastating consequences.


The evidence I have heard for over seven years now clearly shows that controlling access to sniffable fuel can have, and does have, a significant impact on the ability of communities to prevent harm coming to their young people. Organisations in Central Australia, health and drug services, and individuals from affected communities have all voiced their support for this particular legislative approach, and that was very clear through the inquiry process but also from sustained lobbying over a number of years. This has been on the cards for a long time because we know there have been significant gaps in the strategy. 


I am not for one minute at all trying to run down what has been achieved so far. It has been an outstanding program of success. It is one of those programs where we can all stand really proudly and say that there has been multiparty support for this and it has been a success. So why not capitalise on that success? We are almost there in dealing with this problem of petrol sniffing.


Although we have had this comprehensive program provided, there are gaps. We know that Opal fuel on its own cannot achieve the stamping-out of petrol sniffing. We know that it has to be part of a comprehensive approach. It is absolutely crucial, because it buys time in order to get in with youth diversionary programs and the other support programs such as drug and alcohol support programs. We know that it is successful but we also know that, unless we deal with these areas of outbreak associated with sniffable fuel, we will continue to undermine that success. 


As has been articulated to the Senate inquiry and to me personally, the gains achieved to date through the rollout of Opal fuel are critical and crucial, but they are also fragile. We currently have a generation of children in much of the region who have grown up free of a sniffing culture. However, due to what we believe are the irresponsible decisions of some retailers, the sniffing culture appears to be once again rearing its head in some sites. We know from hard experience that sniffing, once established in an affected community, can rapidly spread. It is an epidemic we do not wish to relive. Again, that was evidence from CAYLUS during the Senate inquiry.


Though the provision of low-aromatic fuel is not on its own a solution, it is absolutely critical to a holistic approach. CAYLUS has had long experience in the field—and I think senators who have had any dealings with CAYLUS will know that they are one of the most respected youth services in Central Australia and that they have played a critical role in dealing with the issue of petrol sniffing. As CAYLUS said:


We were doing this before Opal, and we would try all the other measures. You could start a youth program in a community and you would get a lot of the sniffers to stop but not all of them. But once you have Opal in a community the sniffing stops and then the youth programs can really go because they are not competing against people who are off their faces all the time. 


The importance of Opal has been clearly demonstrated. All it has lacked is the final part to ensure that the petrol-sniffing strategy has the capacity to proceed in the face of consistent denial from the petrol station owners. As Andrew Stojanovski, who was awarded the Order of Australia Medal for his work at Yuendumu in setting up the Mount Theo Petrol Sniffing Prevention Program, told the committee: 


Opal is a solution that governments and communities can readily  implement. Its use in Central Australia has really taken the pressure off communities and provides a breathing space where community workers can actually focus on programs that address the personal and social issues underlying petrol sniffing. When sniffing is rife in a community it is near impossible to do this, the power, violence and dysfunction caused by sniffing is too overwhelming.


This is why I have introduced this bill as a private member's bill—because we have spent so long working in a collective effort to address the issues of petrol sniffing. This is the element that the communities have said is missing from the strategy. They have been lobbying for a long time for this. We have had three Senate inquiries. The Senate inquiry in 2009 found that the Opal program was overwhelmingly successful but it identified this gap and said that if retailers were refusing to stock Opal fuel or low-aromatic fuel the government should proceed to mandate the stocking of Opal fuel. 


This is why I am bringing this bill to the chamber. The government has not brought it on. There is overwhelming support. I was lobbied very heavily by the communities in Central Australia, who need this vital element to make sure that they can control petrol sniffing in their communities. This is also a very powerful tool. The communities have also been lobbying heavily for this so that they can then implement their other youth programs, the diversionary programs, and work to really address the underlying causes of petrol sniffing. 


This bill will give the minister the power to mandate low-aromatic fuel and make it an offence to supply regular fuel in these places. It will also give the minister the power to create fuel control areas by legislative instrument, which will give the minister the capacity to tailor the measures to the particular community—after consulting them.


Consultation and flexibility are at the heart of these measures because this bill is about helping communities affected by petrol sniffing by complementing the existing strategies and programs. Consultation has been a very big part of the development of this bill. I believe this has been an effective process. We developed the bill in consultation with and with feedback from communities. We made sure it got referred to a Senate inquiry. The overwhelming number of submissions to the Senate inquiry supported this bill and very strongly endorsed this approach. We have taken on board the feedback from the Senate inquiry and subsequently will amend the bill. We have consulted again on those measures. We have talked to as many of the stakeholders as we possibly can and, as I said, we have received overwhelming support for these measures.


I will discuss the purpose of the amendments in the committee stage, but I want to acknowledge the many people who participated in the Senate inquiry. We were pleased to see the proper process of consultation and committee inquiry work here—the idea being that, when you bring a bill to the Senate, it goes off to inquiry, you get feedback and you make amendments in response to that feedback. So, where a bill is not perfect, in response to very sensible review and comment you can make amendments that reflect the feedback from the community. I stress again: this bill has the strong support of Aboriginal organisations, health organisations, community organisations, individuals and communities. They want the minister to have the power to mandate the supply of low-aromatic fuel because it is absolutely critical to dealing with the scourge of petrol sniffing.


I have been in communities and seen for myself the impact that taking away sniffable fuel has. As CAYLUS said, it provides the window of opportunity for people to get in and deal with the other, underlying causes of petrol sniffing. During the committee inquiry, some of the concern was that, if you take away sniffable fuel, people will switch to other forms of substance abuse. The evidence in fact does not support that. The evidence supports the idea that this does provide a window of opportunity to give youth in particular another chance to address those underlying causes and have sufficient diversionary programs so that these youths can move completely away from substance abuse.


When petrol stations just pig-headedly refuse to stock Opal fuel, this bill gives the government or the minister, after they have carefully consulted, the capacity to say, 'You know what? You really need to stock non-sniffable fuel.' As the evidence to the committee inquiry overwhelmingly demonstrated, when people can get access to sniffable fuel and run that into communities, that is where you get petrol-sniffing outbreaks. Again, the evidence overwhelmingly shows that that is the case. Once somebody starts petrol sniffing in a community, it is very easy to get other kids sniffing, and then it moves on to other communities.


As I said, this bill has the overwhelming support of the community organisations that we have consulted. We have consulted them extensively and, under the bill, the minister will be required to consult as well. So it is not as if this is something that the minister can apply willy-nilly to the states and territories in Australia. The minister will need to consult under this bill. It is the missing piece to finally dealing with petrol sniffing, which can so devastate our communities. Petrol sniffing has largely occurred in Central Australia, but it does occur elsewhere and it is increasingly occurring in the north of the Northern Territory and in Western Australia around Warburton, Laverton, which I have already discussed, and in some places in the Kimberley. We need the minister to have the power of mandate where we see this sort of thing happening and where service stations are simply refusing to stock Opal. It is not good enough that these pig-headed service station owners can undermine the effectiveness of what is such a good program—where Australia can rightly hold its head up high and say, 'We took action to address this issue.'


Amendments will be circulated in the chamber and will be discussed in the committee stage. I very strongly commend this bill to the chamber. It is that final link in addressing the issues around petrol sniffing, and it has the overwhelming support of the community. I am absolutely and totally convinced of that.

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2012-11-22,"



Senator CROSSIN
 (Northern Territory) (09:50):  I rise to add my contribution to this debate on the Low Aromatic Fuel Bill 2012. I recognise Senator Siewert's passion and endeavours in this area but might use my opportunity this morning to also correct some of her statements.


Petrol sniffing has been around in the Northern Territory for many, many decades. When I arrived at Yirrkala in 1981—and I have spoken about my experience in that community many times in this chamber—I saw firsthand the impact of petrol sniffing. That was over 30 years ago. In fact, in 1983 my husband specifically had a group of 15 post-primary boys in his class who were all petrol sniffers. It was a specific educational strategy that we designed at Yirrkala School to try and stop those boys from sniffing and to get them re-engaged in education. It was very difficult—extremely difficult—because there were no designated youth programs; there were no low-aromatic fuels back then. It was not until the 1990s that avgas was introduced across the Top End, specifically in Maningrida, I think. Chris Burns owes his doctorate to the research he did into avgas and its impact on petrol sniffing. Then, of course, it was not until 2005 that BP finally came up with the low-aromatic fuel that we now call Opal.


So a solution that would actually turn off the tap here has only been around since 2005, and that then led to the first Senate inquiry being initiated in 2006. Petrol sniffing is not just confined to Central Australia—not at all. I have lived with and am related to Indigenous families in north-east Arnhem who have watched their adolescent children diminish mentally, drastically, over the years to the point where they are chronically mentally ill. It saddens those families. It saddens me.


The other thing I want to say, Senator Siewert, is that this is not the last chapter in this book. This is not the last rung in the saga of petrol sniffing, because what we still need to do is have rehabilitation places right throughout Central Australia, the Top End and probably in Queensland and WA that cope with those adolescents and young adults who are mentally ill as a result of petrol sniffing. I know, for example, that the families at Yirrkala struggle because there is no rehabilitation facility in Gove and the ones in Darwin are completely inadequate. We know that in a place like Gove this bill will be very hard to implement because of the town and the situation there. At Jabiru we will have the same problems and similarly in Katherine. So there will be a need to embark on a lot of concentrated work and effort which goes to education, consultation and negotiation in order to get this bill implemented. There are still many years ahead of us to make sure that we do turn off the tap to regular unleaded petrol and just roll Opal out in remote communities.


The other rung that we will need to look at is extending the youth programs. If I had 20 minutes I could spend my whole time singing the praises of the Central Australian Youth Link Up Service and the fantastic work that people like Blair McFarland, Tristan Ray and their co-workers have done in highlighting the impact of youth services, combined with diminishing the reliance and dependence of youth on petrol for sniffing. That is a fantastic youth service and they work really well with people like the Mount Theo mob and Susie Low, but they are also confined to Central Australia. It would be my dream to give CAYLUS enough funding for them to become the Northern Territory youth link-up service, not just the Central Australian Youth Link Up Service, because I think they have the capacity to extend the work they do right up the Stuart Highway and right across the length and breadth of the Northern Territory.


I am surprised that there has not been a call to ensure that, as we mandate low-aromatic fuel in petrol stations, we also mandate the funding for an expansion of CAYLUS, so that as we turn off the tap and do not give young men, particularly, a reason to sniff this fuel we also provide them with the alternative. It is fine to have a bill in here for low-aromatic fuel to turn off that tap, but what I also want to see is the other side of the scales being balanced and the additional funding being provided so that an organisation can expand and provide these young people with an alternative.


There are a number of amendments that clearly need to be made to this bill in order for it to be passed. But let me be very clear that this Labor government has worked laboriously and closely with stakeholders to introduce voluntary compliance of suppliers with using low-aromatic fuels. Success in Indigenous health policy takes time, and the voluntary rollout of the low-aromatic fuel Opal over time has made a 70 per cent difference to the plight of petrol sniffers in Australian communities. So we know it works. This bill is about trying to take the next step.


We have worked hard to introduce Opal in areas around Australia. In 2005 the first Petrol Sniffing Strategy was announced; however, the plan was only partially implemented by the then coalition government. Since 2007, when we came into government, we have worked closely with the private sector, with governments at all levels and with NGOs to address those gaps and to achieve implementation of a successful Petrol Sniffing Strategy program. The manufacture and distribution of Opal in Central and Northern Australia has been a story of spectacular success. It has improved Indigenous health by curbing the detrimental curse of petrol sniffing across many of the communities, so in 2009 we expanded the supply and uptake of Opal fuel across the gulf region of Queensland, the East Kimberley and the Top End. Since then, the success has been echoed across many regions.


I do not have time to go through some of the evidence that was presented to the third and most recent inquiry conducted by the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee. I had been involved in the first two; I missed this one because I had other engagements in the Territory at the time. The inquiry on low-aromatic fuel took evidence from people like Donna Ah Chee at the Central Australian Aboriginal Congress, who said that the rollout of Opal fuel in Central Australia 'demonstrates what supply-side strategies can achieve'. There was also evidence from Susie Low at Mount Theo, from the NPY Women's Council, and from Andrew Stojanovski, whom Senator Siewert talked about. So there is clearly evidence about this strategy and how it works. 


As of July this year, there are 123 sites receiving low-aromatic fuel throughout regional and remote Australia. And since July this year the Department of Health and Ageing have conducted a procurement process to establish increased production and storage of low-aromatic fuel in various places in remote Australia. So a lot of work has been done and is being done. The committee heard that the low-aromatic fuel storage and distribution facility in Darwin is expected to be completed before the end of 2013. That will ensure that there is ready access to supply to roll it out across the Top End, not just in Central Australia. 


I am keen to try and wind up my remarks this morning, because I know we want to get through all of the speeches in the second reading debate, move the amendments and get this bill passed. But I clearly say in support of this legislation that I think it is time that we move on ensuring that distributors in the Northern Territory turn to Opal, and only to Opal. I think there is much discussion and there is much work still to be done. While the voluntary scheme is in place, we know that there is still a lot of work to be done to ensure that distributors switch to Opal and do it confidently and competently. We know that plenty of education work will need to be done to ensure that people have confidence in knowing what the difference between regular unleaded and Opal is. Of course, there is no difference except for the smell, but that education will need to occur. There will be a need to fund and extend those youth programs right around the Territory. My dream would be, as I said, that the Central Australian Youth Link Up Service becomes the Northern Territory youth link-up service.


So this is not the final chapter in the book; this is another chapter in addressing petrol sniffing. There is still a lot more work to be done. There are a lot more education programs to be rolled out, youth programs to be rolled out and work to be done with distributors. But it is another step along the way to ensuring that young Aboriginal lives are not destroyed because the only end of their day is to stick their nose in a can of petrol and sniff it. So we in this government need to play whatever part we can to prevent that occurring and to save one more person's life from spiralling dramatically downward to a tragic ending where they either become mentally ill or die, and this parliament needs to grasp any opportunity it has to prevent that from happening.

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2012-11-22,"



Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Deputy Leader of The Nationals) (10:01):  I rise to again contribute to the debate on the Low Aromatic Fuel Bill 2012, a private member's bill introduced by Senator Siewert. I will probably be somewhat critical of the government and of the Greens today, for a number of reasons that will become evident during my contribution, but I would like to start by saying that I would commend all sides of this place for their motivation. There is no question that the government is well motivated—I do not really understand the backflip of this morning—and I know that Senator Siewert is very well motivated in regard to the introduction of this legislation. I know that Senator Crossin, Senator Moore, Senator Siewert, I and others have been part of committees in the past that looked at this issue, before the committee that looked into this legislation, and we have all been very frustrated. We have had committee discussions. We made a recommendation after a committee inquiry in 2009 that someone act to introduce some legislation. I suspect that Senator Siewert's introduction of this legislation was a function of all of that frustration, but I think I should put on the record that I admire the motivation of all in this matter.


Of course, we are motivated by a very, very damaging substance. I can remember, as a very young bloke, hearing only a couple of times about people sniffing petrol, but it is really not a part of life for those who live conventionally in mainstream Australia. But it is just so damaging. I have been very fortunate, like Senator Crossin, to have spent some of my past living in remote parts of the Northern Territory and have viewed the damage that is caused by this otherwise innocuous substance that helps a car go. It is very damaging to communities and families, because the nature of the substance is that there are quite a spectrum of reactions when people are under the influence of petrol; it affects different people in different ways. Unlike with things like alcohol and other substances of abuse, where there is a general body weight indicator, for some reason—it is unknown, and not a lot of work has been done on it—some people hit this sort of psychotic state and you cannot speak to them or communicate with them. These are otherwise quite ordinary people. Yes, they have had some challenges and they are self-medicating; but, notwithstanding that, quite ordinary people behave in the most unexplainable ways, and it is just so destructive.


It covers a spectrum. At one end, they simply need petrol to sniff, so they will humbug, they will break things, they will hurt people or they will hurt themselves until you give them some more petrol or access to more petrol. That is extremely damaging to a community and to a family. The tragedy at the other end of the spectrum—I almost hesitate to remind the chamber—is shown by the circumstances where an 18-year-old petrol sniffer followed a group of young boys and girls, between the ages of six and nine, down to a billabong. He was in such a psychotic state that he waded into the billabong, grabbed an eight-year-old girl, and sodomised her and drowned her simultaneously. Imagine the psychotic state where that would happen. You can imagine the community's sense of grief and lack of understanding of how this could possibly happen in the community.


These are the sorts of events that we have, I think, managed to ameliorate substantially. It did not come because of some miracle in this place or legislation; it came through the miracle of technology—the miracle of Opal. I would have to commend the previous government and commend Tony Abbott for his leadership in saying to BP, 'We wish to develop a fuel that doesn't have the nasty bits that make you high—a non-aromatic or low-aromatic fuel.' That was done by BP, and I have to say that in my time in this area I have never seen such a change literally overnight. There were people whom I did not recognise. I knew they were sniffers; I would have vague conversations with them, but they were never going to make much sense. They changed into people whom I met for the first time—really wonderful people who had come out of the smog. I think it had a fantastic influence. It was expanded by the Howard government. I would also like to commend the current government, who have taken up that strategy and pursued that with the same vigour. I would also commend Warren Snowdon. He has certainly been very passionate about the continued rollout, and I know he shares the frustration of this place and the commitment to ensuring that we get it right.


The Central Australian Youth Link Up Service has been mentioned often in here, as it should be. If I could build on the other compliments that Tristan Ray and Blair McFarland have had, for me as a very practical person—and I know Tristan and Blair would understand—they provide minute feedback about what works and what does not. I know they run a great link-up service.


They are able to tell me forensically what is actually happening out there in the communities. They can say that to a person. They can say, 'There are eight people now, but four of them actually went last time in the football round that went over hundreds of kilometres. We now know as a consequence that there are another seven more. Four live here and three live here.' Such is the nature of their intelligence network on the ground that it gives us the capacity to be able to deal quite forensically with this issue which is so very important.


Despite the fantastic work of the previous government, this government, the innovation of BP and the rollout of Opal at a cost of between $23 million and $28 million over forward estimates over years, we are now, tragically, seeing substantial leaks in the system. We have reports now from CAYLUS on the spectrum of people engaging in petrol sniffing and the horror that comes with it. In an incident in the last couple of weeks, an 18-year-old petrol sniffer stabbed an eight-year-old boy in the head. It was not good. It was not just a poke. I do not want to go into the details, but this never would have happened otherwise. We have seen these communities rise up with people free of that stuff and it has now just started to come back. I share the frustration. We have to get this right.


One of the reasons that it has started to come back is the recalcitrance of a number of petrol stations. The government and the opposition have done all sorts of things. We have all worked together to support initiatives. One of the initiatives of the current government is to ensure that we provide a petrol station that only sells Opal across the road from one that does not. I wrote to the then Northern Territory Chief Minister and said, 'Don't let any Territory cars fuel up at this service station.' The Commonwealth agreed. We have gone to every possible length within the law to lever people who are not playing the game into doing so, but because there are leaks in the process that is always going to be the case. That is why it is absolutely essential that we get this right.


We have had a careful look at this legislation. I approached Senator Siewert and said we would support her in a bill that did pretty much what this bill is doing. Sadly, for whatever reason, Senator Siewert decided pretty shortly afterwards that the Greens would move it on their own. I had a private meeting with Minister Snowdon. He was frustrated. He believed that the way forward was, in fact, for the states and territories to legislate because it was more effective legislation and we need it to be part of a national framework. I was convinced that was probably the way to go. He had some frustrations. The flavour of government changes. We have the coalition in power in the Northern Territory, Western Australia and Queensland, while South Australia is Labor—but that might have been a bit of challenge. Certainly, in terms of this particular legislation, I think there has to be a better way.


This legislation came through a very comprehensive committee process, and once again I would like to commend the wonderful Senator Moore for traipsing around the countryside and taking evidence in all sorts of places from all sorts of people and for a wonderful report. A significant part of that report was recommendation 6, which, in light of the preceding five other recommendations, recommended that the current bill not proceed.


I know we will hear from the other side about it being all workable or whatever it is going to be. We will be listening carefully to that, but we certainly will not be supporting this legislation for a couple of pretty significant reasons. We do not think it is going to work. It will not work because it effectively relies on corporation powers. I can tell you right now, without naming any players—and I know Senator Siewert indicated this in her report—that, whilst there was no evidence given that they were not all covered by the Corporations Act, there is in fact a place that is a partnership and not a corporation power that would not be caught under this. I also got some legal advice about how convoluted but easy it would be for an organisation to change status to escape those sorts of processes. Whether you become a sole trader or a partnership, you are simply not going to be caught under this legislation. So there will still be leakage.


There has to be a better way, and I think the better way is through framework legislation. There is legislation in the Northern Territory. It was put in by the previous Labor government, and I commend the government. A lot of work went into it. It not only deals with petrol but with all volatile substances. That is the Volatile Substance Abuse Prevention Act 2005. When the new Northern Territory government came into power, I had better access so I said, 'We have had this piece of legislation, but in the context of petrol it has not been used.' I will not go into the intricacies of it—there is no mischief. There are further amendments required. I have spoken to the new minister. They have sought advice on a new amendment and I understand that new amendment is going to be introduced to enable these things. This is an act that does not rely on the corporations powers. This is an act that enables us to forensically take a lease on a petrol station. I am not sure you can draw a moving line around one person, but this is the closest piece of legislation to doing that. It is ultimately as flexible as you can get it. We can actually effectively prohibit the sale of a particular product in a particular area for a particular amount of time. Nobody wants legislation smashed for a long time. I very much commend this legislation to this place.


There is another matter, and it is not my word you have to take on this. Sadly, as I have indicated, there have been a number of deaths associated with volatile substances. The coroner at a West Australian coronial inquest said:


The Volatile Substance Abuse Prevention Act of 2005 (NT) has been an effective tool in the NT for ensuring that chronic solvent users who are at risk of severe harm undergo suitable treatment at appropriate facilities.


The coroner went on to recommend that.


In similar circumstances, a South Australian inquest recommendation was that the South Australian minister for health consider introducing legislation before the South Australian parliament similar to that encompassed with the Northern Territory Volatile Substance Abuse Prevention Act 2005.


For those who are concerned about moving forward on this, I can provide some hope to this place. I know we are in opposition but, because this is such a bipartisan issue, I spoke yesterday to the Labor minister in South Australia, and they are engaged in assisting me and others in having a look at this framework in the Northern Territory. If they have any amendments to it, we will seek to provide that information to the Northern Territory government, and they could include those in their amendments. I have spoken to the office in Queensland and they are also engaged in ensuring that they can provide some feedback on the framework. Sadly, I missed a call from WA's Peter Collier last night, but I spoke to his adviser on this matter and hopefully we will be speaking today. Substantially this is not just a matter for the Northern Territory. I think it is a good framework that will work. The reason I was talking to them today was not because I needed to tell you all that today. I actually thought I would be coming in today and saying: 'Sorry, Rachel, but, as I have already indicated to you, we are not supporting this. We think there are some flaws in it. But we are not giving up. We're off and working. We're off doing some practical things, talking to people and getting some things done.' But, sadly, we have come in here this morning and heard this. I heard about it at 20 past eight when Minister Snowdon rang me. I am not saying he was tardy about that, as I understand that must have been pretty much when either he heard or he changed his mind. It was hard to know from our conversation.


But, given the fact that the minister had told the Northern Territory government that they were not supporting the proposed act and asked me not to support the proposed act, I was very surprised to hear this morning from Minister Snowdon that the government was in fact supporting this proposed act and was not opposing it and moving in another direction. This backflip goes against the report recommendations, after the excellent work done by Senator Moore, Senator Crossin, Senator McKenzie and Senator Smith—who are in the chamber—and Senator Siewert. To me it really beggars belief that, on this very important issue on which we have had such a bipartisan approach, we have suddenly had a backflip. I am a bit cranky about it. I do not know the detail and I do not know what happened.


Senator Siewert may be able to throw some light on it when she makes her contribution in the committee stage. I know that our First Australians will be dying to hear what the issue was that they were traded off against. There is no other reason apart from such a deal that I would have got a phone call this morning—at 'two minutes to midnight'—telling me: 'Oh, by the way, we've just changed our mind completely on this. Come and get a briefing from someone,' someone who did not even know the Corporations Act seemed to appear in it. It was all pretty pathetic. So it is obvious to me that you have done a deal, and I think the Greens need to come clean. They have to put their hands up and say, 'This was part of the deal.' 


We know—and I say this without mischief—that this is a second-class solution. We have a first-class solution, in the volatile substances act, and we should not offer a second-class solution to our First Australians because we have done some grubby deal about something. I do not know about it. Perhaps the Greens would let us know. Perhaps it is not grubby—some deal on Malaysia or tax—but who would know? But these circumstances cannot be interpreted in any way other than: 'We're going to do a backflip.' I have to say to those on the other side that you do have a bit of form on this. Perhaps that is the way of things. I have forgotten how long ago it was that I was in government, and I am not really sure, but perhaps that is the way. Scrapping immigration policy because it would be popular—but not necessarily in our national interest—might have been one of the things. Just the other day, we had the supertrawler issue. There was a bit of a Twitter go, so it was 'We'll just change our mind on that.' Poor old Joe over here, who just the day before had been saying, 'Absolutely not; we've got to protect good science,' had to roll up here and then say—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Cameron
):  Senator Scullion, you know that you should address—




Senator SCULLION:
  Sorry, Senator Ludwig—it was a term of affection. Of course, we have been stuck since then. We saw it again with the carbon tax. I am sure that the Prime Minister said, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead,' because that was popular and that was what people wanted to hear. But, with what they delivered, again, it is the Greens corner that seems to have this commonality. Every time the government stroll into the Greens corner, they suit their own purposes of staying in power but they lose sight of looking after Australians. 


In this case, this place has been pretty good. I am very proud of how we have all dealt with this matter in a bipartisan way, given the challenges that face our First Australians. I am very proud of the way we have gone about doing that. But, as has been shown historically, inevitably behaviour will out. Today we are faced with something upon which we could have had a first-class solution that everybody agreed to. In fact, the committee made this recommendation:


The committee recommends that the Australian Government continue to consult with the relevant state and territory governments on the possibility of national legislation …


That recommendation is before us now. But this legislation is only enabling legislation. You may believe that this legislation will make some changes tomorrow. It will not. But the thing that saddens me most, and it is a great sadness—and we have all been dragged into this reluctantly, I suspect, including the minister—is that for the first time we are definitely using the interests of our First Australians as currency in some grubby trade-off. I think the Greens should come clean and tell us exactly what that trade-off is.




Senator Milne:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I object to the use of the term 'grubby trade-off with our First Australians'. I think that is really an offensive way to discuss what is going on in the Senate.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Scullion, I think you are reflecting on the Greens and the senators in the Greens party. I think you should withdraw.




Senator SCULLION:
  I want to speak to the point of order, if I may.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Sure.




Senator SCULLION:
  I was actually reflecting on the outcome. As I said, I think it is a grubby deal, the deal that was done. I was not saying that the Greens did a grubby deal.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Scullion, I do not accept that. You should withdraw.




Senator SCULLION:
  I withdraw. I believe the Greens should come forward and tell us what the deal was. Was it that uncharitable word I used? They need to come forward on this. We will not be supporting this legislation for two reasons: firstly, it will not work and, secondly, it is a part of a particularly unsavoury deal.

"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2012-11-22,"



Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (10:22):  The one thing that keeps this chamber together is the consideration of the welfare of our community, and I object to what Senator Scullion said. Senator Scullion and this side of the chamber have worked very closely together in a shared commitment to ensure that our First Australians receive strong services in our community. We share that. In terms of the process around the Low Aromatic Fuel Bill 2012, this is not the first time that the Senate's community affairs committees have considered the issues around petrol sniffing. In fact, we have had three inquiries on the issue. Everybody acknowledged that there needed to be action. Everybody acknowledged that the use of Opal fuel was one of the key strategies that was going to make a genuine difference.


In 2006, the first inquiry looked at hope in our communities, and the stunning title of the report was, Beyond petrol sniffing: renewing hope for Indigenous communities. One of the recommendations from that committee inquiry was a call for people to work together to ensure that Opal fuel was available across the areas of need. We called on state and territory governments to work with the Commonwealth to ensure that Opal fuel was available and used so that those communities were protected.


In the limited time I have I am not going to talk about all the other recommendations that we have had from our inquiries year in, year out. I acknowledge the reverence with which Senator Scullion refers to our committee and refers to the recommendations that we make. But, as we in this chamber all know, we make lots of recommendations and they are not all acted upon. In terms of the work that we do in our committee, I think that we would have had strong policy if governments of all flavours had taken up every single recommendation of every single community affairs committee inquiry of which I have been a member but, to my sorrow, that has not happened. What happens is that committees work together. They look at issues and bring forward recommendations for governments of all flavours, and decisions are made and work continues around them.


In terms of petrol sniffing, in 2006 we said that there needed to be coordinated work into the future to look at the way that Opal fuel could be developed, distributed and used effectively in the communities. Then we move forward to 2009, when the committee again looked at the issue of petrol sniffing across Australia. There were very encouraging issues that came forward in 2009. I know other senators talked at length about the wide range of issues that work together, including the importance of community empowerment and diversionary programs, but the petrol-sniffing strategy in which Opal fuel is key continued to be a major plank of work across the parliament to ensure that petrol sniffing was addressed.


In 2009, our committee was so frustrated by the continued lack of clarity around what was happening with Opal fuel. In fact it was that committee that, in 2009, recommended that there should be a process across governments to look at mandating the use of Opal fuel. It is there in our recommendations—I believe it was recommendation 5. In 2009, to my disappointment, we did not get that recommendation taken up immediately. But the issue continued to be discussed, and all of us who are interested in this area continued to work with communities and community organisations. One of the things that was on the agenda the whole time was frustration that there continued to be so much misinformation perpetrated by a range of individuals. We have never been able to actually find someone to talk to who raises these issues about the damage that Opal fuel can do to cars and the fact that it would be difficult to have financial advantage if you used Opal fuel in communities. These things continued to happen. We noted that in 2009 and we said that there needed to be changes into the future.


Senator Siewert, in putting forward her bill, referred to the recommendations of the 2009 committee inquiry. She said that there had been a lack of action. She said that we know things have continued to happen but we need something to cut through to address the frustration that we all share about the fact that we have a tool that we know works. There is no debate about the fact that the use of Opal fuel reduces petrol sniffing in communities. No-one even argues that point. It is clear and it is documented; the evidence is there. The issue with which we continued to struggle is the fact that, seemingly, we could convince some people in the business community that the use of Opal fuel was something that should be part of their business model and that working in Aboriginal communities where there could be danger had with it in many ways a community responsibility to provide the services that would best suit their communities. That was something with which we were struggling.


As people have pointed out in this debate, there continues to be ongoing work with the federal and state governments to move towards getting responses to this process. That was the discussion we had throughout the recent inquiry which finalised in September this year. When we put forward our recommendations, we said that the work needed to continue. We accepted that a process needed to happen. We said that the bill put forward did not meet some of the legislative processes and that it needed to be amended. As you can see, there have been a number of amendments drafted to address the issues that we raised in the committee recommendations. If you look at the minority report from Senator Siewert, you can see that she picked that up. She acknowledged that there needed to be changes to the draft legislation that was put before us.


Now that work has been done and, again through due process, we have come back to this place to say that this is one step that can be taken. It will not solve all the problems. No-one pretends that one step will solve all the problems. But we have a process that we are putting before the parliament that says that, if you follow this act, a framework could be implemented, a trigger could be implemented that the minister could use to say, 'In this circumstance, we're going to step in.'


It is not to stop the other issues. It is not to stop the valuable work that continues to happen amongst governments to work towards agreements to ensure that they can maintain the positive steps that they have taken up till now. I think one of the reasons for putting this legislation forward is to give that a bit of impetus and to say, as we have to in many cases when governments need to work together: 'Get a move on. This needs to be done.' There needs to be an urgency about the process because, while we are waiting and discussing and reviewing, people continue to have the horror of petrol sniffing in their communities. That was the evidence we had before our committee, and no-one denies that.


Communities sat before us, telling us about the horrors of petrol sniffing—the fact that, with all the efforts that have happened up to now, there are still outbreaks of sniffing—and that people continue to have that awful virus that seems to spread so quickly and everyone has been struggling to find out what stimulates it and how it continues. As long as there is petrol available in the community, petrol that allows the sniffing to happen, sniffing will happen.


The legislation that is before us is not perfect. In fact, I cannot remember a single piece of legislation placed before this place that has ever been perfect, so we continue to look at how things evolve and how we can make things better. What we are asking the government and the parliament to do is to take this step as one step along the road: to maintain the discussion, to maintain the debate, to maintain the commitment. When that happens, we can genuinely say that we have made a difference. We are not imposing this; we are engaging in it. We are responding to the need that has been put before our committee, before each of us individually. Everyone who is part of this debate has been working with communities and is dealing with people on a weekly and monthly basis.


I reject that this is something that is being rushed through. I think we have waited, I think we have encouraged continuing action and I think that this is one step that parliament can take to address the issues that we all know about. If we do not take this step, I am wondering how much longer we do have to wait.

"Smith, Sen Dean",LP,2012-11-22,"



Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia) (10:31):  I am also pleased to have this opportunity to speak on the Low Aromatic Fuel Bill 2012. As a member of the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee, at the outset of my contribution I would like to say how grateful I am for all those who have taken the time to make a contribution to the committee's inquiry on this important subject and add my commendation to those of other senators on the work of CAYLUS, the Central Australian Youth Link Up Service, which gave a very fulsome presentation to the committee over numerous days and was quite instrumental in making sure that the committee had an opportunity to hear from those most affected by the damaging consequences of petrol sniffing.


On a more personal note, the issue brought to the fore for me the central role that women will play in resolving many of the social issues we confront in Indigenous communities, but also the very important and urgent need to make sure that young Indigenous males across Central Australia and my home state of Western Australia have the necessary support and encouragement to avoid the temptation of petrol sniffing.


Petrol sniffing is a problem that has bedevilled areas of Northern Australia since the 1950s. Since the 1980s there have been a number of inquiries and solutions proposed to address petrol sniffing and its harmful, indeed tragic, social consequences. The most significant step at a Commonwealth level came, I am pleased to say, in 2005 when the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Tony Abbott, was the Minister for Health and Ageing. Mr Abbott's passionate, genuine and ongoing commitment to the welfare of Indigenous communities is well known to most Australians. In March 2005, as health minister, he worked with industry to commence the rollout of a form of low-aromatic fuel, more commonly known as Opal, across parts of Central Australia that had been identified as areas with particularly high instances of petrol sniffing.


Opal was developed by BP Australia and is a form of unleaded fuel that contains low levels of aromatic hydrocarbons. That means that a petrol sniffer will not be able to obtain the high from this form of fuel that they would from regular unleaded petrol. Opal fuel is produced by BP's facility in Kwinana, in my home state of Western Australia, but other petrol-retailing companies have agreed to distribute it through their own retail outlets.


The Howard government committed $42.7 million over five years to make Opal available to more and more communities throughout Central Australia. The Howard government invested a total of $55.2 million over four years on its whole-of-government Petrol Sniffing Strategy. And I join with Senator Scullion in commending also the efforts of the Rudd and Gillard Labor governments for the continued rollout during their tenures. As at 1 July this year, there were 123 sites across regional and remote Australia that were receiving low-aromatic fuel, and 67 of those sites were within zones identified as high risk for petrol sniffing activity. Focusing on my own state of Western Australia, the East Kimberley region has been identified as an area with a significant petrol-sniffing problem. In Western Australia there are 26 sites currently receiving low-aromatic fuel, with a further 18 sites targeted for rollout in the near future.


I am disappointed and saddened to say that only yesterday we heard of a firsthand account of the dangers and perils of petrol sniffing, when a 13-year-old boy unfortunately had almost 40 per cent of his body burnt after setting himself alight while sniffing petrol. The boy is believed to have inflicted the injuries on himself when his family found him sniffing in a shopping centre car park in South Hedland—and South Hedland is a place where I spent much of my youth, as my father was a police officer there in his early years. The boy was subsequently flown to the Princess Margaret Hospital. This incident points to the fact that this is a recurring issue.


But, while it is a recurring issue, I want to remind all of us that we must acknowledge the success of the low-aromatic fuel initiative. Universally it is accepted as having made a valuable and significant contribution to reducing the incidence of petrol sniffing. In the committee's report, I am pleased to say, we take some time to draw attention to the fact that the introduction of Opal has been significantly successful. In our report we mention:


The story of the manufacture and distribution of low aromatic fuel in central Australia, to substitute for sniffable fuel, is a story of spectacular policy success. It is a rare and precious achievement in the challenging field of Indigenous health policy. The initiative has involved a partnership between the private sector, including both large and small businesses, governments at all levels, non-government organisations, and Indigenous communities.


This statement in this latest report is consistent with previous findings. People will be familiar with the fact that the committee concluded in its 2009 report that 'the supply of Opal fuel has been a resounding success in helping to reduce petrol sniffing'.


I think it is fair to say, and I echo the comments of other senators, that the majority of submissions have noted the success that has been achieved to date with the voluntary rollout of low-aromatic fuel. I would like to draw specific attention to the contribution of Mr David and Mrs Margaret Hewitt, who have been activists in Indigenous communities and have committed themselves for a very long period of time to supporting the work of Indigenous communities.


Mr and Mrs Hewitt in their submission to the committee noted:


… the introduction of the Opal low aromatic fuel has had the biggest single positive impact on the health and welfare of Indigenous people in the 48 years of our work in remote regions.


What we are being asked to deliberate on today is not the suitability or the appropriateness of low-aromatic fuel as a means of containing petrol sniffing but instead what is the most appropriate legislative mechanism to deal with recalcitrant fuel suppliers across Central Australia—and, I might add, other parts of our country—that for reasons perhaps best known to themselves are not yet able to commit themselves to the introduction of Opal fuel. It is the legislative mechanism that requires our careful deliberation.


The committee's report as a result of its most recent inquiry found that the Commonwealth's efforts to communicate to outlets the benefits of selling low-aromatic fuel during the last 3½ years have not yet yielded great success. It was interesting to note that some of those who presented to the committee said they had never been asked about the possibility of supplying Opal fuel through their outlets. That suggests to me that the problem may not be outlets refusing to stock Opal, as some of the commentary around this issue has suggested, but at least in some instances it is a case of operators not having access to the information about the benefits or some of the assistance available to them in terms of moving from regular unleaded petrol across to Opal fuel.


My concern and the concern of other coalition senators in relation to the current bill is that, whilst it has honourable intentions, it has overlooked some important issues and may produce unintended consequences. Firstly, the Commonwealth government is already working with state and territory governments to address some of the issues outlined in the committee's report. There is goodwill from all parties and a determination to work through the issues cooperatively and comprehensively. To simply impose Commonwealth legislation now would merely bring that process to a halt.


I share Senator Scullion's suspicions about what might have motivated a change in the last 24 hours in regard to the government's consideration of and attitude to this private member's bill. I think it is worth reflecting that the minister, Mr Snowdon, has said previously how wrong this proposed approach would be. On ABC back in February of this year Mr Snowdon said the Commonwealth legislation as proposed in this bill:


… creates, I think, a potential legal minefield.


Again, he said:


If the Northern Territory government had in its mind that it ought to regulate it could, as could a Western Australian government, as could the Queensland government.


In July of this year he also said the same to his state ministerial colleagues, as reported by the Australian:


He told the ministers it was difficult to see how a commonwealth ban on unleaded fuel—which he has previously described as a ""legal minefield""—would have a greater impact on addressing petrol sniffing and state and territory legislation.


So what we are dealing with at the moment is a situation where, by the government's own admission, the proposition before us is not a worthy one—or at least is a second-class one.


The Greens say that the constitutionality of their bill is underpinned by the corporations power. The problem with that approach is that some of the bodies involved in the rollout of Opal fuel maybe unincorporated traders. As a result, the bill may be creating a loophole through which traders within petrol-sniffing zones can go on selling regular unleaded petrol—the opposite outcome to the one the bill seeks to remedy. Furthermore, what is contained in this bill will not do anything to actually address supply issues. BP's capacity to produce Opal fuel will not simply be increased as a result of passing legislation. Storage facilities for the distribution of the Opal fuel will not magically appear merely because this parliament passes a piece of legislation. Even the Greens who have authored this bill appear to have acknowledged this point. It is right there in the Greens minority report, which says:


This bill introduced by the Australian Greens does not in itself cause anything to take place.


I do not doubt for a moment the sincerity of the Greens' intentions in terms of what they have brought to the Senate, but I do question the merits of passing legislation in this place when even its proponents admit it will not cause anything to take place. Australia needs to make sure that its legislative approach is focused on getting outcomes. I am not convinced that this bill passes that simple test.


But there is a better way. There is already a process of discussion and negotiation under way between the Commonwealth and the relevant state and territory jurisdictions to deal with many of the issues that were raised during the committee's inquiry into this bill. For instance, I know that my coalition colleague Senator Scullion has met with the recently elected Chief Minister of the Northern Territory to discuss this very issue. During the committee's inquiry I actually raised the idea of replicating some of what the Northern Territory has done and fostering a coordinated approach across other state jurisdictions. That would seem to me to be a solution far preferable to additional Commonwealth legislation in this circumstance.


The indication in the Northern Territory is that the new Country Liberal Party government will be open to further amending the Northern Territory's volatile substances act to deal with this issue. There is no reason why that approach could not then be replicated in other relevant state jurisdictions. I am confident that the coalition government in Western Australia will be speedy in its response to this important issue. I acknowledge that sometimes the Commonwealth may be forced to legislate when states actively refuse to address a critical issue. That is not the case in this issue. No-one is denying that action must be taken. I think there is merit in allowing a solution based on state and territory legislation to proceed. It will allow for a more flexible and better targeted approach. All of us in this place want to see the supply of Opal fuel expanded and the problem of petrol sniffing eliminated. However, I do not feel that this bill will achieve that in the most effective way and in fact risks the creation of other difficulties. That is why I am opposed to it.


In this debate I think it is important to acknowledge that the commitment to improving the lives of Indigenous Australians is genuinely a matter that transcends party politics. We hear a lot of talk in this place about bipartisanship. Sometimes that is opportunistic but, fortunately, this is not one of those times. During my six months as a senator for Western Australia I have been struck by the genuine commitment of all my Senate colleagues to improving Indigenous lives, especially those in remote communities.


 


The hearings that the Community Affairs Legislation Committee held in regard to this specific bill were a powerful demonstration of that commitment, and I am grateful to senators from all parties on that committee for their efforts. Here was an example of the Senate and its committee process working at their best. Yes, there is now a discussion about the best way forward on this critical Indigenous social issue; however, I want to make it clear for the record that what is at issue merely amounts to a question over the best route, not the ultimate destination.


The coalition agrees with the need to stop petrol sniffing but believes this bill will be ineffective on the issue and that the issue is best handled at a state and territory level. In the Northern Territory many will be aware that the Territory's Volatile Substance Abuse Prevention Act—which could be enabled in other jurisdictions, with minor amendments—does enable supply of sniffable fuel to be banned in certain areas. This act could form framework legislation in other states, allowing effective anti-sniffing measures that better reflect local circumstances and differences amongst different Indigenous communities.


The Community Affairs Legislation Committee recommended the bill not proceed. It recommended that the act should not rely on the corporations power. It recommended that ongoing coordination with state and territory governments to prevent supply issues with Opal should be pursued. It also suggested that a review of Opal production and distribution subsidies should be more closely undertaken. The bill before us relies on the corporations powers under section 51 of the Constitution. It will have no effect on unincorporated traders. This means that any sole trader, partnership or other trading entity would not be covered. We know from the current situation that one point of leakage is enough to allow sniffing outbreaks in large surrounding areas. I think we are all agreed on that significant point. Therefore, a bill that does not cover every trader in the area would be all but ineffective.


Our alternative is a simple one but a highly effective one. The Northern Territory's Volatile Substance Abuse Prevention Act can, subject to minor amendment, be used to tackle the problem. Under this act a group of 10 or more residents of a locality or a community council could seek to prevent supply of a particular substance, including petrol, in that location. In the Northern Territory the department of health would then lead a process that would take account of interested parties' contributions to develop a management plan that would be able to specify restrictions on supply and use of regular unleaded petrol and other sniffable substances at that location.


This approach is worthy not least because it is one that has been advocated by coroners in other jurisdictions. This approach was endorsed in a Western Australian coronial inquest into a tragic circumstance. That inquest said:


… the Volatile Substance Abuse Prevention Act 2005 (NT) has been an effective tool in the Northern Territory for ensuring that chronic solvent users who are at risk of severe harm undergo suitable treatment at appropriate facilities.


In similar circumstances in South Australia an inquest recommendation stated:


That the Minister for Health consider introducing legislation before the South Australian Parliament similar to that encompassed within the Northern Territory Volatile Substance Abuse Prevention Act 2005 …


Senator Scullion has been actively working with the Northern Territory government to bring about this solution. I am sure that other senators, including me, from Western Australia, can use their energies and motivations to ensure that other jurisdictions follow suit in a speedy and effective manner.


It is very clear that what we have seen in the last 24 hours is a step back from what would have been a highly effective first-class solution to a less than perfect solution that unfortunately could compromise the future welfare of young Indigenous Australians. In conclusion I again would like to congratulate the committee on their deliberations. I also congratulate CAYLUS for its work in fostering the development of young people across our Indigenous communities.

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (10:49):  I rise today to wholeheartedly support the Low Aromatic Fuel Bill 2012, which is currently before the Senate. This is an excellent bill that Senator Rachel Siewert needs to be congratulated for. She has shown tremendous leadership on this issue, and her commitment has been long running, from her first speech, which I had the pleasure of listening to, back in 2005. She spoke then about the scourge of petrol sniffing and the need to deal with it. I congratulate her on that and on her participation in the initial petrol-sniffing inquiry, in 2006. She has continued to lead on this issue, always consulting with Australia's Indigenous people and always listening to their responses. It was Senator Siewert who initiated the 2009 Senate inquiry to follow up on the 2006 report. It was those inquiries that prompted the government's first comprehensive petrol-sniffing strategy, which did include a voluntary rollout of the low-aromatic fuel. She has now consistently followed that rollout, visiting communities, talking to stakeholders through the estimates process, and she has continued to push for a better outcome for the communities that could benefit from the broader rollout of Opal fuel and a ban on sniffable fuel. I really congratulate my colleague. As I have just said, it has been seven years in the Senate to the point where we now have a bill before us that I think ought to be supported by the Senate. I think it demonstrates what can happen when you have no one party having all the power and there is a capacity to negotiate outcomes, in which case you get outcomes for the community.


I heard Senator Scullion speaking in a most derogatory manner earlier suggesting that there had been some trade-off of the interests of Australia's Indigenous people. Nothing could be further from the truth. The Greens have had at the forefront of all our work in the Senate, always, the interests of Australia's Indigenous people. I just want to go through that for a moment.


It was my former colleague Senator Bob Brown who worked very hard to have Indigenous recognition as part of the opening of the parliament every day. That is a real improvement and recognition. It was in our agreement with the Prime Minister that we try to secure recognition in Australia's Constitution for Australia's Indigenous people. Furthermore, all our work trying to protect James Price Point, trying to secure substantial new cultural heritage listings, has always been to protect not only the environment but also the cultural aspects. The Burrup Peninsula is another place where we have worked very hard to protect the cultural heritage of Australia's Indigenous people when it has been set upon and undermined by the gas industry in Western Australia—something that is supported by the coalition at every turn, I might say, which destroys that heritage that is so precious to us.


Another example is that during the negotiation of the Carbon Farming Initiative I was very keen to make sure that one of the earliest methodologies we recognised in carbon farming permits was savanna burning, because Australia's Indigenous people in the Northern Territory have very important knowledge and skills. Getting that change to savanna burning not only is good for the planet in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions but also is actually providing money and employment to people living in Indigenous communities.


So the Greens at all times try to work for better outcomes for Indigenous people. I remind the Senate that it was the Greens who stood strongly opposing the Northern Territory intervention. We believed it was bad for Indigenous people, and we still do. We also stood up and opposed the so-called Stronger Futures legislation, which the government introduced, because we think it provides weaker futures for Indigenous people. I very proudly stood in the courtyard here with a number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander leaders saying that this Stronger Future legislation would be a disaster for them. So I will not have on the record anywhere a suggestion that the Greens are not acting in the bests interests of Australia's Indigenous people when we are informed by those people of what they want.


And that is the key point on which Senator Scullion is wrong. It is the communities themselves who are asking for this legislation, and it is ridiculous to suggest that a better process would be to go and talk to each of the states and territories and try to negotiate with them to legislate, because that is a recipe for never getting an outcome. Anyone who has been into a community and seen the appalling outcomes of long-term petrol sniffing knows not only that it can kill but that it damages internal organs, the brain and the nervous system. People who sniff petrol can become disabled and ultimately die. It does not just damage the health of the individual; it leads to family breakdown, domestic violence, community breakdown, vandalism and all sorts of shocking outcomes in communities. I think everyone recognises that if we can get rid of petrol sniffing we can at least enable people in Aboriginal communities to take up other opportunities for a positive engagement with life—with education, culture and music and so many wonderful things that can be achieved.


So I am wholeheartedly supporting this legislation. The scourge of petrol sniffing is still with us, because of recalcitrant petrol stations that refuse to stock non-sniffable fuel. This bill gives the minister the power to declare areas where it will be an offence not to supply non-sniffable fuel. It enables the minister to target suppliers in relation to specific communities that are being devastated by sniffing, and I am wholeheartedly in favour of giving the minister that power. To Senator Smith, who just suggested that this will not provide an outcome, I say: what other outcome do you want than to give the minister the power to go in an make it an offence to not sell this low-aromatic fuel?


This is actually providing an outcome. A talkfest with the Territory is never going to get you an outcome, because we see what goes on at COAG year in, year out. COAG is a great big black hole where the states frustrate action on a whole range of issues. What we want here is action to actually deal with the issue—the final piece of the jigsaw to deal with the issue of petrol sniffing and to end it. I cannot understand the mentality of petrol station owners who are prepared to exploit people and deliver horrendous outcomes in Aboriginal communities for their own benefit. But, since the mentality exists and there are recalcitrant petrol station owners, then something has to be done. I think it would be a thing to celebrate in this parliament if all political parties could join together and say: 'Let's do it. Let's just close this last gap in relation to this particular issue and let's give young Aboriginal people and their communities the chance that we want them to have.'


Anyone who has not been in the communities may have seen the film Samson & Delilah. If ever you want to see what is going on in communities, have a look at that film and come away and tell me that it is now not time to actually deal with this issue. It is essential that we deal with the issue. Let's do it. I do not think there is any justification in saying, 'No, this isn't the right mechanism.' Giving the federal minister the power is the right mechanism. I congratulate my colleague and again say that one of the real benefits of a parliament where outcomes have to be negotiated—where one party cannot just deliver something and have it rubber-stamped—is that you get collaborative outcomes. Senator Siewert's work over seven years in this place has finally led to a collaborative outcome whereby we are going to see, I hope, this legislation passed and the Greens able to deliver—with the government, it would seem—an outcome that will close that gap of disadvantage in relation to petrol sniffing in Australia's Indigenous communities.


I think it is a very positive step. So much is said about the way parliament behaves or does not behave. This is an opportunity for the Senate to show that we can demonstrate the leadership that is so essential and that is being asked for. That is the critical thing that is being asked for by Indigenous communities saying, 'Help us to do what we need to do to end petrol sniffing.' The Greens are very pleased to respond to that by saying: 'Yes, we will help you. Yes, we will legislate.' I again congratulate my colleague Senator Siewert for doing just that.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2012-11-22,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (10:59):  I appreciate the opportunity to contribute to this debate and to congratulate those who are involved. Certainly, as I look around the chamber, the contribution over a long period of time by Senator Siewert must be recognised, as must that of Senator Scullion and also Senator Crossin.


Mr Acting Deputy President Bernardi, you would have thought that this would have been a fine opportunity to demonstrate the very best elements of the combined roles of federal, state, territory and local governments and the private sector in trying to resolve this horrific issue. But, as we know in the case of the Low Aromatic Fuel Bill 2012, should it actually be passed, it is only ever facilitation legislation anyhow and will not achieve its goals. I, too, recognise Senator Siewert's passion over time for this particular area. But initially, if I may, I acknowledge the work of the then Minister for Health in the Howard government back in 2005, Minister Tony Abbott, who first introduced the concept of this low-aromatic fuel. The package, along with negotiations with the BP company on this occasion, also included activities to support communities and to engage in youth diversion programs, rehabilitation, policing, communication and education strategies. It remains today, as we know, critically important that we do have that broad approach in trying to solve this issue.


From a straight epidemiological point of view, the fact that there has been a 70 per cent average reduction in the incidence of petrol sniffing and the fact that in areas where there is no provision of regular unleaded petrol that it is even more effective—up to 94 per cent—are wonderful stories and must be supported. But what this shows is the need for the engagement of different sectors at different levels.


Let me give you an instance: at a local Aboriginal community level back in 2004-05, what would the capacity of that community have been to go to the fuel majors and say, 'We need the introduction of a low-aromatic fuel'? Their capacity would have been zero, and the capacity of local government in those areas equally zero. Even a state or a territory would not have had that capacity. So here was an example, quite correctly at federal level, where the then Minister for Health was able to go to the senior management of the fuel industry—the fuel majors; on this occasion, the BP company—and convince them of the need for what would have been an incredible cost to change a regular unleaded product into a low-aromatic fuel.


That is a prime example of where we did need the intervention of the federal government at a level senior enough and persuasive enough to be able to get an international fuel major to change the composition of its fuel. And so there is a prime example of where federal government intervention is needed. But, equally, in this particular instance it is patently obvious that the most effective roles will be those of the states of Western Australia, possibly Queensland and South Australia, and especially the Northern Territory to enact legislation to give effect to a solution that will work.


It was only in July of this year that the minister for Indigenous health, Minister Snowdon, was urging the states and, presumably, the Territory to tackle petrol sniffing by matching the Territory's legislation that relies on community involvement and tougher policing powers to tackle volatile substance abuse. That is the appropriate role for the federal minister; it was in July, it was yesterday and why it is not today seems unusual to me, and I think it deserves explanation.


At that time in July, Mr Snowdon was favouring the approach driven by local communities. He told ministers that it was difficult to see how a Commonwealth ban on unleaded fuel, which he had previously described as a legal minefield, would have a greater impact on addressing petrol sniffing than state and territory legislation. I have heard nothing in the debate this morning to cause me to understand why Minister Snowdon would have a different view today, 22 November, to that which he had at the time these comments were made, and I will come back to some of his other comments.


The Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee report itself recommended that the bill not proceed—not proceed!—for several reasons. One is not relying on the corporations power, and my colleague Senator Smith eloquently made the point that so many fuel retailers would not fall under corporations law. Maybe sole traders and maybe partnerships would not fall under the jurisdiction of corporations law. We know, as the committee itself said, that there are different definitions of fuels to which legislation applies. The committee said that there is a need—and I agree—for ongoing coordination with state and territory governments to prevent supply issues. And I wish to come back to supply issues; having in fact been a fuel distributor and retailer in one of Australia's states, it is an area of which I do have some understanding. A further recommendation of the committee was that there should be a review of Opal, the low-aromatic fuel, production and distribution subsidies, to which I will also refer.


So we have the committee saying that the legislation at federal level is not appropriate. We have the minister saying that it is appropriately a state and territory issue. Until yesterday, the Labor government were of the view that it was properly a state and territory issue. I do not know why there has been this change of heart, and it needs to be explained to this chamber— again, because this legislation is only facilitating legislation and of itself will not have the desired effect. I emphasise again, as others have in this chamber—and it would be no different for any reasonable-minded, thinking Australian—that we should be able to grasp and complete the study of this exercise and remove regular unleaded petrol from sale.


The position of the coalition is simply this: first of all, the bill itself will not stop sniffing, for the reasons that I mentioned. You have only got to have a sole operator or a partnership and the legislation does not apply to them. In the light of the preceding matters, the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee recommended that the current bill not be proceeded with. As a consequence, we would say that this is the wrong instrument, that it is inappropriate to use a Commonwealth arm of the law. In fact, I repeat what Minister Snowdon said in February this year—that the Commonwealth legislation creates 'a potential legal minefield'. Let us avoid the potential legal minefield and let us come up with a solution that will actually work. There is a better, more effective way. 


I know that, only in the last few days, Senator Scullion, who has responsibility in this area from the coalition's point of view, has been in contact with the ministers or their senior executives in each of the states of South Australia and Western Australia, and of course with the Chief Minister in the Northern Territory and the Minister for Health and Alcohol Policy, to move all of this forward. So we are all working in concert. There is nobody working at variance with our end objective. We simply plead for a circumstance where we can bring this home, where we can give effect to this particular legislation and make sure that we eliminate petrol sniffing. 


The bill does not address the Opal fuel supply and subsidy issues cited in the committee report. The committee itself recommended—and this is recommendation 4:


… that there be further examination of the wording of the explanatory memorandum, consultation and exemption clauses, to ensure that fuel manufacturers are properly included, and the bill does not have unintended consequences—




Senator Siewert:
  Read the amendments!




Senator BACK:
  Thank you, I will pay particular attention to the amendments, Senator Siewert. Recommendation 4 continues:


in the event of supply bottlenecks or disruption—


of supply. Recommendation 5 says: 


The committee recommends that the Australian government conclude as soon as practical a subsidy review that covers production of up to 100 million litres per annum of low aromatic fuel.


Where does the funding come from for this particular exercise? As most people would be aware in Australia, about one-third of the cost of all retail fuel is fuel excise tax and GST. So, in a typical $1.50 per litre price that somebody might pay here in Canberra, about 38c of that will be fuel excise tax and 13.6c is GST—totalling 51.74 per cent. So more than a third of the actual retail price does go to government in some form or another. So there certainly is adequate funding to be able to give effect to this, and that should not be, and has not been, presented as a barrier.


I now come to a well-understood point in most areas for people associated with the emergency services—and I would see addressing the issue of petrol sniffing as being in that category of emergency—and that is that problems are best solved closest to where the affected people are. Unfortunately—much as we think the federal government and everything it does is important and that Canberra is the seat of power as it relates to this area—the simple fact of the matter is that we are a Federation of states and territories, and it has been my experience, especially in the emergency services area, that the more remote you are from where decisions are made the less effective the outcomes of those decisions will be.


This provides us with a tremendous opportunity in my view for locals to own the issue. That is why I plead for a continuation of the process, where the matter is dealt with at state and territory level, so that they have ownership of the problem and can then drive it through to local communities. We know of course that the areas that are the subject of the proposed legislation at the moment are those in which the highest concentration of petrol sniffing occurs. But then, as has been recorded this morning again by Senator Smith, we had the regrettable circumstance only recently in Port Hedland in Western Australia—which of course is well outside the area of this proposed jurisdiction—where a young person suffered burns to 40 per cent of his body because he was apparently trying to obtain fuel for this sniffing. So we have got to come up with a wider solution, one which will actually expand beyond the high-concentration areas to pick them all up. I plead again for a situation in which we drive this to the local level, where there is the greatest demand and the greatest impetus for this to happen.


We all know, and those of us who are associated with local and small communities do know, that when those communities own the issue they also own the solution and they commit to its implementation. Where they see that issues are related to remote decision-making, they will turn off and they will not have that sense of ownership, which I think all of us would agree is required in such circumstances.


We have had recently some wonderful contributions, in my view, from Aboriginal women especially who are providing leadership in this country. I wish to reflect on them for a moment because it comes back to the point I was just making about local ownership, local responsibility and local determination to solve problems. Initially I go to the text of a letter from a Kimberley Aboriginal elder, Rita Augustine, which was sent to then Senator Bob Brown. She makes some wonderful points which I would like to repeat. She said:


We are proud of our history of caring for this country over thousands of years. The country tells us who We are. It gives us strength and determination. But now we face great challenges; not only about our country and our culture, but about our survival as Indigenous people.


Whilst not all the comments made were in relation to the question of petrol sniffing, so many of her comments are relevant to this debate. She speaks of the need 'to face up to our own challenges, and to build a better future for our children, our people, our culture, and our country'. Whilst I was not going to refer specifically to Dr Bob Brown, to whom she had written this open letter, as a result of Senator Milne's comments a few moments earlier I think it is reasonable that I do so. She said:


Dr Brown, it is hard for us to understand why you think it is necessary for you to speak on our behalf, about our country, our culture, and our futures.


The only thing We need saving from, is people who disrespect our decisions and want to see our people locked up in a wilderness and treated as museum pieces.


We are a living people and a living culture. We have faced severe change over the last 200 years, and most of it has been far beyond our control.


All of us in this chamber would agree that the issue that is before us now, that of the impact of petrol sniffing on young people, certainly has been beyond the control of that community of people. She went on to say:


I am an old woman now and I have witnessed and lived the despair and hopelessness of many Kimberley Aboriginal people.


She reflects on watching 'children grow up in despair, die before they are 50, or even worse, take their own lives before they get to their 20s', a very, very passionate statement. She also speaks of the need for her own community in that particular case to be the ones to actually make their decisions.


In the same theme, I would like to go very briefly to the farewell speech last week, on 14 November, in the assembly in Western Australia by the member for the Kimberley, Mrs Carol Martin—I think, the first Aboriginal lady in the Western Australian parliament. Whilst her speech was very comprehensive and wide ranging, she made a plea, in the same context of what I am saying. She said:


The Department of Indigenous Affairs is my bugbear forever. It is a colonial structure that is still in place in this day, in this age and in this country where Aboriginal people are given second-class service.


Get rid of it, please. … Give Aboriginal people the rights of citizens like any other citizens. 


She made that plea. I do not think it is any coincidence that it is Aboriginal women who are the ones who speak so eloquently for the Aboriginal community.


My final comment in relation to this are the comments and the quotations of Northern Territory minister Alison Anderson, who is one of the nation's most senior Indigenous politicians. Rebuking her own people earlier this month—which was widely publicised—for relying on welfare, she said that they need to grow up and stop resorting to the 'dangerous conversation of endless complaint' and that she 'despaired at the reluctance' of some of her community to take available jobs. She was talking of people in Yirrkala not being prepared to drive the 20 kilometres to Nhulunbuy 'to earn excellent money in the mine and the processing plant there'. She went on to reflect the loss of adults. She said that there were 'less than half as many adults per child as for the non-Indigenous population,' and she asked: 'Where are the missing adults? There is no way to put this gently: they are dead.'


In conclusion, I say that there is unanimity in this chamber on the solution of this problem. I plead that we come up with a solution that works, that we drive ownership of the issue to where it can actually be addressed—and in this case, legislatively, that is correctly the states and the territories—so that they own that problem, they own that responsibility and they get financial support from the federal government. If there is a further need for communication between the federal government and, for example, fuel majors, that is appropriately the role of federal government instrumentalities. The issue is state. The issue is territory. The issue is local. Please can we have a solution that reflects the locality of the issue?

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2012-11-22,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (11:19):  It is with a heavy heart that I rise to speak on the bill before us today, the Low Aromatic Fuel Bill 2012. The intent of this bill is to change the Corporations Act to mandate the use of the low-aromatic fuel known as Opal in some areas, to prevent petrol sniffing—a terrible problem in our Indigenous communities. Other senators have spoken eloquently today and at other times on the problem that petrol sniffing is for our First Australians. The bill aims to ensure that communities with serious petrol-sniffing problems can contain and hopefully turn their situation around—and I do not think anybody in this chamber disagrees with the intent of this legislation as stated.


There are 123 sites in remote Australia selling Opal fuel, and a substantial increase in this number is foreshadowed. That is a positive step. Opal fuel is produced by BP and it has very low levels of aromatic hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbons are the chemicals which give sniffers their high. They are also the same type of molecules as those used in spray cans, which is what some young people use in other areas.


There are often tragic consequences for the sniffers, for their communities and for those who love them, and it is a particular tragedy when young people are petrol sniffers. However, some petrol stations within this area refuse to sell the low-aromatic fuel, and that goes to the crux of this bill. The Greens are attempting to go it alone on solving the issue of dealing with the remaining retailers in remote Australia who are selling regular unleaded petrol rather than Opal fuel. Senator Scullion made very clear his desire to work collaboratively with the Greens on coming up with a legislative solution to this scourge of our society.


I come from Victoria, where we do not have a large Indigenous population, and I had only heard about petrol sniffing; I had not experienced it. I was not part of the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee when they went to remote Australia and heard directly from the communities, but I did go and see the movie Samson and Delilah and was very challenged by what I saw. It follows the lives of two Indigenous teenagers, one of whom becomes a petrol sniffer, with tragic consequences. In the last scenes, the young woman, in order to save the man she loved, drove the car out into the bush and drained the petrol onto the ground so that there was no way of getting back, in order to get him away from the substance that was changing him so significantly and as a way of recovery and rehabilitation. I think that film took the issue out into the wider community.


The community affairs committee conducted the inquiry into the bill. They travelled to Alice Springs to see and hear firsthand from some of the stakeholders with intimate knowledge of this issue, and it was not the first time the committee had done that. I would like to place on the record my thanks to all those who contributed to the inquiry, who submitted, appeared and participated in any way, and the secretariat staff who worked so hard to put it all together under the leadership of Senator Moore and Senator Siewert, who are great advocates in the community affairs committee space for our First Australians.


The committee made a number of recommendations which included that this bill not proceed, and the Greens submitted a minority report. There were specific details around why the bill should not proceed, and one of them was that the legislation should not rely on the corporations power. Another was that different definitions of fuels to which the legislation applies should be addressed, and I note that through an amendment that has been addressed. Ongoing coordination with state and territory governments was also recommended to prevent supply issues with Opal. That goes to the crux of some comments I will go to later and the modus operandi, I guess, of the Greens in continuing to ignore and be frustrated by the fact that state governments exist in our Federation. The committee also recommended a review of the Opal production and distribution subsidies. I understand where the Greens are coming from when you look at the excellent results from the rollout of the Opal fuel. I appreciate the interest of Senator Moore, Senator Siewert and many others in this issue and I acknowledge that there is bipartisan support for ensuring a positive solution for affected communities. A solution that works around this issue is always going to be cross-jurisdictional.


The original rollout of Opal fuel and the development of the Petrol Sniffing Strategy was the initiative of the Howard government under the leadership of Tony Abbott as the then minister for health. The initiative was implemented through collaboration with industry and with some incentives to ensure that industry took up the opportunity to sell a product that would have such a positive benefit out there in Indigenous communities. The package also included activities to support communities—youth diversion, rehabilitation, policing, communication and education strategies. I am pleased to say that, as a result of that and of ongoing initiatives by the current government, Opal fuel is now available in 106 sites across Australia. This is a great step forward and one that not just the coalition but all Australians can be pleased with.


The results speak for themselves. Research indicates that where Opal fuel has been introduced it has been effective in reducing sniffing by, on average, 70 per cent. The result has been even better in areas where there are no retailers selling regular unleaded petrol, with a 94 per cent average reduction. So we know it works, leading to some fantastic results out there in communities. Although Opal fuel is subsidised, the savings to communities and individuals, in health care and otherwise, from Opal fuel are significant.


The community affairs committee heard from Mr Andrew Stojanovski, who spent 11 years in remote Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory working on petrol-sniffing issues and was awarded the Order of Australia Medal for his work. He told the committee in his submission:


Up until Opal was introduced in Central Australia I expected that I would spend my career working on petrol sniffing, community by community … Over my career the best I could hope for using this approach would be to eradicate sniffing in four communities over a period of forty years.


It would have been a long and slow process. He also said that, following all of his hard work, the introduction of Opal had not only changed the reality for Indigenous communities and petrol sniffers and those who love and care for them but also changed his life and how he saw his contribution to this problem.


The South Australian Centre for Economic Studies has found that there would be a $780 million benefit in shifting from regular unleaded petrol to Opal fuel in the area of their analysis. You will have heard from my colleagues here today about the Central Australian Youth Link Up Service. The service told the community affairs committee:


We consider the low aromatic fuel rollout to have been a great success to date. It has completely changed the focus of our work.


Fantastic! So we know the strategy works. It is a very impressive story from a Canberra policy sense and from a community sense out there on the ground.


No-one is arguing that we do not need to solve the problem and no-one is arguing with the fact that decreasing access to regular unleaded fuel assists with the problem. However, the bill before us today relies on the corporations powers under section 51 of the Australian Constitution. As such, it will have no effect on unincorporated traders. This means that any sole trader, partnership or other trading entity will not actually be covered, and there are a few petrol stations around our nation that are so constructed in the way they have set up their businesses.


We know from the current situation that one point of leakage or availability of regular unleaded petrol is enough to allow sniffing outbreaks in a large surrounding area; there is a black market in unleaded petrol in these areas. So it is a serious flaw that only certain traders and petrol stations are actually going to be covered. There are some traders who will stock and sell regular unleaded petrol—and we have seen that growing. That indicates that, if they see a commercial advantage in restructuring their businesses to continue to do so, they are going to do it. So the bill will end up being ineffectual as a result. The committee heard that there are even a number of traders who falsely believe that Opal fuel results in performance impacts and has a negative effect on engines. So there is a real issue around education. The belief in performance impacts has been proven to be untrue, but it is still up to traders to make their own decision on whether they choose to sell Opal. So the bill, which does not cover every trader in the area, will be all but ineffective. As this bill will apply only to incorporated traders, as I have said, there will still be regular unleaded petrol available from any petrol station trading as a sole trader or partnership or under another business model. In addition, a service station that has so far refused to stock Opal for whatever reason would only need to change its corporate structure to continue to sell regular unleaded fuel. The committee came to that same conclusion, recommending:


… that a legislative scheme for low aromatic fuel not be confined to reliance upon the corporations power.


Yet here we are today.


Perhaps the Greens could consider looking to the state governments, who have jurisdiction over these sorts of issues, to help find some constructive solutions. But I note Senator Milne's comments during this debate around the black hole of COAG and the disrespect that is continually shown to state governments and any collaboration that COAG or the state governments seem to do in developing national cooperative approaches that take into account the fact that they are separate entities. I look to Senator Waters's issues around the EPBC Act and state governments coming together with a framework on how we are going to go forward on dealing with environmental issues. I think the disrespect for the COAG process and the states as a consequence is the modus operandi for the Greens and does not always deliver the best policy solutions, as Senator Back outlined in his contribution with respect to localism. Similarly, Senator Scullion commented on the Northern Territory legislation that could be used as a framework for going forward. A further recommendation of the committee was, in fact, just this:


… that the Australian Government continue to consult with the relevant state and territory governments on the possibility of national legislation to mandate the supply of low aromatic fuel to ensure that there is agreed and coordinated action to address petrol supply. 


I am really looking forward to the committee stage of this bill to ensure that we have actually consulted with state and territory jurisdictions and to establish what form that consultation has taken. It is inappropriate to use Commonwealth law in an area which should be governed by state and territory law. Commonwealth legislation will be open to challenge and will apply only to incorporated traders, as I have already gone over.


The coalition has been seeking to address this issue. The Deputy Leader of the Nationals and coalition shadow minister for Indigenous affairs, Senator Scullion, has made very clear his intent to work collaboratively with the Greens and with the government on issues of improving the plight of our First Australians and to seek a bipartisan solution, because that is the only solution that is going to work going forward. Senator Scullion himself met with the Northern Territory Chief Minister, Terry Mills, as recently as 23 October to discuss petrol sniffing and associated issues. It was agreed that the Northern Territory's Volatile Substance Abuse Prevention Act could be used to stop the sale of regular unleaded petrol in certain areas, and the Chief Minister agreed that Senator Scullion could go on to discuss appropriate amendments.


So in the Northern Territory, where this problem plays out in communities most keenly, the wheels are already in motion to deploy the legislation against petrol sniffing—legislation, Senator Siewert, that will actually work. Under this approach, a group of 10 or more residents of a locality or a community council could seek to prevent supply of a particular substance, including petrol, in that location, which goes back to Senator Back's comments on communities taking control of their area. The Greens are right: in a previous contribution, Senator Milne, I think, said again that communities are screaming out for this issue to be addressed, but they are not screaming out for this bill and this approach.




Senator Siewert:
  Oh, yes, they are. That's where you're wrong.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order, please! Senator Siewert, could you not shout across the chamber.




Senator McKENZIE:
  I will continue to outline the Northern Territory approach. The Northern Territory Department of Health would then lead a process that would take account of interested parties' contributions to develop a management plan that could specify restrictions on the supply and use of regular unleaded petrol or other sniffable substances in that community. Senator Scullion has also written to the other states involved to propose that they consider adopting similar legislation. State and territory legislation based on the Northern Territory's can be more targeted and more flexible, will be more legally robust and will actually be a solution that provides confidence to those communities on the ground to take action when they experience a problem, instead of Commonwealth legislation being thrust upon them from Canberra.


The coalition has been proactive about developing a long-term, effective solution to this problem and has been attempting to work with both the government and the Greens—unfortunately, as of this morning, to no avail. Even the Greens themselves acknowledge that the bill would be ineffective. As they said in their minority report in the community affairs inquiry report:


The bill introduced by the Australian Greens does not in itself cause anything to take place. It is enabling legislation.


My concern, and the concern of the coalition, is that the Greens' decision to go it alone on the legislative approach to the scourge of petrol sniffing has meant the imperfect bill before us today. Petrol sniffing will not be stopped by this bill, not because of a lack of good intent in the bill but because it uses the wrong legislative mechanism to achieve the outcome. The Greens and Labor know this. I go back to my commentary on traders and how they will structure their businesses if there is a commercial advantage in doing so. We all know that they are capable of doing that.


Labor, as part of its opportunistic deals with the Greens, changed its mind. We do not know what the deals are; we just know that we are now debating this bill before us. Minister Snowdon changed his mind and now this bill is before us. It would be fantastic if the community and the Senate understood the price of getting this legislation onto the agenda this morning for debate with the government support. I guess we should not be surprised, because evidence based, effective policy for this government is shelved for political expediency, something we have seen time and again. We are here in the second-last week of our sitting year with another backflip as we have seen a political fix occur. I hope the details are going to be outlined somewhere. We have a couple more speakers. I hope that a little gold nugget will come forward. We saw it with the supertrawler, we saw it on live cattle exports, we saw it with the excising of the migration zone and we saw it with the carbon tax. With science and evidence based policy, a legislative approach that uses mechanisms that will work is shelved for short-term political gain. 


My strong desire, in terms of addressing this problem, was that the Greens would choose to use being highly effective with this Labor government, rather than this strategy, to get the bill on the agenda and get the government's support. The Greens chose to mobilise their highly effective e-campaigners—the 76,000 that changed the minds of Minister Ludwig and Minister Burke. They could mobilise them to get consumers and industry to get behind them by running their businesses and purchasing the products that will lead to long-term and effective change in Indigenous communities as Opal becomes the only fuel sold. I am not sure what really happened in the past day or so to change the government's mind. Obviously, the bill is being done. I wish that the— (Time expired)

Senator BOYCE
 (Queensland) (11:39):  Petrol sniffing has apparently been around or known of since about 1951, but it was not until the 2000s that action was taken. Certainly, Senator Rachel Siewert, who was instrumental in getting the first inquiry held, deserves congratulations on doing that, as do many organisations, such as CAYLUS, and many elders, particularly the women, in rural Aboriginal and remote communities that pushed for something to be done about the scourge of petrol sniffing. As a member of the community affairs committee I have been involved in two of the three petrol-sniffing or low-aromatic fuel inquiries that the committee has held. It has been very instructive to visit communities and to see what is being done and what cannot be done because of the problems not just with petrol sniffing but with chroming and glue sniffing, with the substitution of marijuana, or ganja, for petrol when it is not available.


We are looking at a more serious problem and an underlying and complex problem around why petrol sniffing happens. Just recently the ABC reported that there had been an outbreak of petrol sniffing in Tennant Creek, with 10 young people sniffing petrol. It is really a very serious issue. Some of the things that have happened have certainly improved the situation, and the development of Opal fuel by BP is one that needs to be lauded and celebrated. In itself Opal fuel, the low-aromatic fuel, has made a major difference to the number of petrol sniffers.


Part of the original inquiry that sought to push the introduction of low-aromatic fuel said that youth programs needed to be established in many of the communities where petrol sniffing happened because it was a result of loss of self-esteem, it was a result of boredom and it was a result of lack of cultural connection. On the second inquiry that the committee held, we went to a number of remote communities, met people undertaking youth work programs and saw that there were some benefits beginning to develop. 


I must admit the one thing that has concerned me in many cases in regard to the sorts of programs that we as governments—federal, state and territory and even local—impose on Aboriginal communities is that we do not have a component to try and build local social and community capacity. We tend to still have the situation, which was obvious in one community we visited, where the youth worker leaves after a few months, as they are expected to do when their contract expires, and the program stops. I am very happy to accept that someone with a degree in youth work is probably far superior at setting up a youth development program than someone without a degree. But I certainly know of many communities throughout Australia where locals have seen a need and simply filled it, perhaps not as expertly as someone with a degree. But what we are not doing is giving communities the sense that they are in control of their own destinies and that they are the ones who should be working out how to fill the gaps.


The other consequence of petrol sniffing and other substance abuse is that in many cases in some of these communities we have a semi-literate generation of young people who are not able to assist their own children with their education. They do not see the benefits of education and do not support education for their children, which, of course, creates an ongoing problem that may yet affect another generation. It has really become a serious problem that needs very complex solutions and I congratulate all those who are working in the area to try to develop some of those solutions.


I note, in the outline accompanying the amendments to the Low Aromatic Fuel Bill that have been provided to us today, that the government says:


The Government recognises the devastating impact of petrol sniffing on young lives and the importance of action to reduce the incidence of petrol sniffing and its impact on families and communities. In this context these Government amendments are in keeping with the Bill’s object to reduce the potential harm to the health of people, including Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders, living in certain areas from petrol sniffing. The amendments also provide clarity on a number of technical issues to facilitate the clearer administration of the Bill.


If this is true, I cannot imagine that anyone would have any concerns with this bill. But when you get a virtually rewritten bill, with 25 substantial amendments attached to it, 10 minutes before the debate begins, with no notice to the coalition, naturally one suspects a rat. I noted that Senator Siewert interjected a number of times during speeches, saying, 'Read the amendments.' This was in terms of some of the coalition's objections to this bill. The amendments do in fact include a change so that instead of the bill saying 'a corporation must not supply regular unleaded petrol in a low-aromatic fuel area' it now says 'prohibiting the supply of regular unleaded petrol in a low-aromatic fuel area'. If this had been discussed and gone through with the coalition and if it had been suggested that this was a good way to get around objections to the Corporations Act not covering sufficiently the concerns and the organisations that are involved in ignoring the low-aromatic fuel position, that would be fine. But, of course, we have nothing except those words written on a piece of paper and Senator Siewert interjecting, 'Read the amendments.'


As I think everyone in this place knows very well, Senator Nigel Scullion has been at the forefront of trying to ensure that low-aromatic fuel is available throughout the Northern Territory, and many others in this place have been keen to ensure that low-aromatic fuel is available in my own home state, particularly in areas of Western Queensland where it currently is not available and in the APY Lands. This is not just a problem for Indigenous communities, but the main areas of concern have been in Indigenous communities, and that is where the change to low-aromatic fuels has made a very large difference. If in fact those amendments overcome the objections that were made by all parties when this bill was before the committee, then certainly let's look at them; let's consider them. However, given that there are currently negotiations going on with the states and territories and given that this bill appears to say that the minister will only legislate if states and territories do not, surely the best way to go ahead with this is through negotiation and discussion.


As I said, if the bill would do what the government now says it would do, let's have a proper look at it. Let's certainly look at going ahead with the legislation if it will reduce the incidence of petrol sniffing and therefore the devastating impact of petrol sniffing. We have no problems with that, but why would these amendments simply be rushed into the chamber with no discussion with the coalition, who I think both the Greens and the government know have strong concerns in this area about reducing and then eliminating petrol sniffing? Certainly it would be our strong intention to go ahead in that way, and the government and the Greens certainly owe it to us to sit down with us and look at this. Also, they should be talking to the communities and the state and territory governments involved. Without their involvement, it is a ridiculous proposition to suggest that this bill should simply be passed because the government and the Greens say: 'You don't need to read the amendments. You just have to accept our word that they do exactly what we say they do.' This is certainly not acceptable to the coalition but we are certainly open to discussion on the topic.

Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (11:55):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to table an explanatory memorandum relating to the bill.


Leave granted.




Senator RHIANNON:
  I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



This bill, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Prohibition of Live Imports of Primates for Research) Bill 2012 amends the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 to disallow the import into Australia of live primates for the purposes of research.


The bill does not ban the use of primates for research per se – which is a separate issue that requires rigorous examination. There are three government funded facilities in Australia that breed primates for research. Permits for the importation of live primates have been neither sought by these facilities, nor issued since 2009. 


Nor does the bill provide a blanket ban on the importation of primates for other purposes such as zoos. 


This bill thus formalises current practice whereby primates have not been imported for research purposes to Australia for many years


It also ensures Australia does not participate in the unethical trade of wild-caught primates used in experimentation for the research industry.


Australia is signatory to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which commits to ensuring international trade in flora and fauna does not threaten their survival. All non-human primates are listed as CITES specimens, and as such wild-caught animals may not normally be traded. 


Australia's National Health and Medical Research Council's (NHMRC) policy on non-human primates for scientific purposes also states that ""whenever possible investigators obtain non-human primates from National Breeding Centres"". 


The global wildlife trade is recognised as one of the biggest threats to biodiversity conservation, and the major trade in nonhuman primates – as live, as body parts or as meat – presents a significant risk to their conservation in the wild.


The illegal and unsustainable trade in primates is ""increasingly recognised as an urgent threat to conservation"" and is described as a ""conservation crisis"". One of the main sources of nonhuman primates to meet global demand is Southeast Asia. Since the 1970s Indonesia has been a major exporter of monkeys. 


When India and then Bangladesh banned primate exports in the late 1970s, Southeast Asia became ""a major hub of wildlife trade"". With its concurrent highest rate of tropical deforestation on the planet, the loss of its biodiversity is described as ""an impending disaster"". 


The list of threats causing decimation of the world's wild primates is a long and bleak litany which includes the trade in monkeys to supply the booming biomedical and pharmaceutical research industry.


Around the world an estimated 100,000 to 200,000, nonhuman primates, or monkeys, are used in experiments every year, and tens upon tens of thousands of monkeys are traded around the world to meet the research industry demand. According to US Department of Agriculture figures, in the US alone the use of nonhuman primates in experiments rose from 57,518 in 2000 to 71,317 in 2010.


There is considerable clinical evidence that much animal-based research correlates poorly with the human response. This is confirmed by scientific reviews that show correlations between the results of animal experimentation and human outcomes is negligible, expensive and unnecessary. Most animal experiments do not translate to clinical trials, are not validated, minimally cited, and use methodologies that render findings as unreliable.


For example, Bailey's 2005 scientific critical review on research using animals came to the conclusion such findings ""have little or no predictive value or application to human medicine.""


Matthews' 2008 paper in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine points out that much of the claimed value of animal research is anecdotal rather than quantitative and that there are ""relatively few quantitative studies of the predictive abilities of animal models"". Where such studies do exist in toxicity testing, ""the data provided by these studies is typically incomplete, ambiguous, and subjected to inadequate or incorrect analysis."" However ""the evidential weight of animals models that emerge are at best inconclusive, and sometimes wholly misleading.""


The Medical Research Modernization Committee, a health advocacy organisation comprised of medical professionals and scientists, found in their 2006 critical review that ""human data has historically been interpreted in light of laboratory data derived from nonhuman animals. This has resulted in unfortunate medical consequences."" 


The 2006 autoimmune, multiple scleroses and leukaemia drug trial at Britain's Northwick Park hospital where 6 young men suffered multiple organ failure after taking a new drug shown to be safe at a 500 times greater dosage in monkeys, is one such example.


In 2002, the House of Lords Select Committee on Animals in Scientific Procedures stated ""the formulaic use of two species in safety testing is not a scientifically justifiable practice, but rather an acknowledgement of the problem of species differences in extrapolating the results of animal tests to predict effects in humans."" The Committee also concluded ""that the effectiveness and reliability of animal tests is unproven"" and that ""the reliability and relevance of all existing animal tests should be reviewed as a matter of urgency."" 


A 2004 UK survey by Europeans for Medical Progress found 82% of general practitioners ""were concerned that animal data can be misleading when applied to humans.""


Safer Medicines, a British patient safety organisation of doctors and scientists articulates the growing questions from a safety perspective: ""whether animal testing, today, is more harmful than helpful to public health and safety"" with ""alarming evidence that animal tests fail to protect us"" in areas from strokes, to AIDS, cancer, autoimmune diseases and more.


Knight's 2007 review on animal experiments found published experiments on chimpanzees, as the species most closely related to human primates, have been shown to generate data of ""questionable value"" and to make insignificant contributions to cited research – with in vitro studies, human clinical and epidemiological studies, molecular assays and methods, and genomic studies contributing most to the development of combating human diseases. 


Not surprisingly, this is because chimpanzees' phenotype, that is their morphology and biochemistry, is markedly different to humans. 


Yet with the progressive banning of testing on chimpanzees around the world, the research industry has turned to smaller nonhuman primates that are even more removed from the human phenome. This is despite cheaper and more scientifically reliable and valid methodologies and technologies already existing and being used by more and more laboratories around the world. 


The Greens urge government, regulators and research institutions to practice these sophisticated and humane research methods. These include genomics, proteomics, nanotechnology, phage display, microdosing, microfluidic chips, epidemiology, autopsies, computer modelling deducing toxicity based on chemical structure of compounds, more thorough world research databases, and tissue and cell in vitro research such as the Ames Test. 


Australia has not permitted the import of live nonhuman primates for research since 2009. 


From 2000 until 2009 the CITES database records Australia permitted the live import of 331 Pig-tailed macaques from Indonesia for research. These are listed as Vulnerable to extinction on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. 


In the same period Australia also permitted the live import of 71 Owl monkeys for research ""breeding purposes"". This species is also listed on the IUCN red list as ""although not necessarily now threatened with extinction may become so unless trade in specimens of such species is subject to strict regulation in order to avoid utilization incompatible with their survival."" The IUCN also notes concern that large numbers of these South American species are used in research, and that the issue of wild-caught Owl monkeys ""should be monitored to understand the effect on populations.""


During 2000-2009 250 long-tailed macaques were also imported into Australia for research purposes. These monkeys are noted on the IUCN red list as suffering declining populations, and a CITES meeting in 2011 expressed as ""imperative"" a reassessment of the species was needed, given the trapping, laundering and largely illegal trade of massive numbers of wild caught long-tail macaques to support the pharmaceutical industry and its researchers 


The European Commission states that the majority of Asian (Old World) monkeys traded for the global research are not bred in western facilities but are born to wild-caught captive monkeys in Asian facilities. The IUCN Primate Specialist Group's Ardith Eudey described these as ""lucrative operations ... [that] may serve to 'launder' wild-caught monkeys"" to sell as captive-bred to the research industry, and which ""appear[s] to have resulted in their disappearance even from legally protected areas"".


More than half of the 70 species of primates in Southeast Asia are found in Indonesia, which ""features prominently on the list of source countries for both domestic and international trade,"" and it is from here Australia sourced most of its primates for research until the last importation in 2009.


In 2009, a BUAV (British Union Against Vivisection) undercover investigation confirmed the IUCN's and other scientists' concerns, revealing Indonesia's ""official"" ban on the export of wild-caught primates for research (in line with its CITES obligations) is a farce. 


Monkeys were shown suffering high levels of cruelty during their capture, confinement and transportation, with an endpoint destination of experimentation in the world's laboratories. 


BUAV also found Indonesian wild-caught monkeys are coded as ""captive-bred"". Monkeys wild-living on islands, such as Australia's source island - Tinjil Island - are also coded as ""captive-bred"" because the whole island is described as a ""breeding facility"". 


The investigation also revealed monkeys trapped in inhumane conditions by villagers who view them as pests and ready income. Baby monkeys are taken from their trapped parents who were often killed rather than being released back into the wild. Mother monkeys are sometimes shot with air rifles forcing them to flee and drop their infants. Monkeys are chased by dogs to be entangled in nets or ropes which often strangled the trapped terrified animals. 


The monkeys, including the infants, are then kept in filthy, crowded and barren concrete pens with metal grid floors lacking fresh air or sunlight, many with no access to water or food. In one primate breeding and supply facility infants were kept in small empty pens with smooth walls, no perches and only a wire ceiling, from which the scores of babies would hang frightened in the absence of safe shelter.


Monkeys are then transported around the world, sometimes kept in transit for days, packed into crates too small to stand up in, suffering the noise, inadequate ventilation and extreme temperature fluctuations. If there are transport delays, there is often insufficient food and water.


One UK primate import company alone had a mortality rate of nearly 19% of its delivered monkeys, all from Indonesia, during 1988-1991.


In the 2001 May Budget estimates, it was stated that the three Australian primate breeding facilities were established, among other reasons: ""to remove the necessity to import these animals into Australia; and to protect these species in the wild by breeding them in captive colonies""


This bill if passed, would confirm in law that Australia does not support the cruel and inhumane primate trade for experimentation and that Australia will not participate in practices leading to the extinction of primates in the wild.


This is a small but important step.


The Greens support the global scientific 3R principle for the use of animals in research – replacement, refinement and reduction. We support the call by leading scientific researchers and medics, and by important organisations such as Humane Research Australia, for legislators and regulators to support a more methodologically sound and effective science that transitions away from the 19th century practice of animal experimentation to the more sophisticated and credible modern methods of biomedical research already being used with more accuracy and success today.


I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2012-11-22,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia) (12:22):  I rise to speak on the Environment and Communications References Committee report on container deposit schemes. The intention of this inquiry was to investigate the pricing and revenue allocation practices of the beverage industry in South Australia and the Northern Territory, which are the only two states in Australia where the CDS exists. The South Australian scheme is 35 years old and well established, and the Northern Territory scheme is brand new. As such, the South Australian community is largely accepting of this system of legislation. But I would just like to put on record that other states should be very, very careful before they consider going down this path, because there may well be better options available to achieve disposal outcomes.


I draw the attention of the Senate to a success story on this sort of management that does not have the overly burdensome requirements of the two container deposit schemes investigated in the inquiry. The success story to which I refer is the drumMUSTER, with 20 million containers safely disposed of since 1999. This scheme has been dedicated to helping farmers and chemical users keep their land free of waste. The plastic and steel from which these products are made is recycled and diverted away from landfill into new products. There have been pretty amazing results of this Industry Waste Reduction Scheme agreement. More than 25,000 tonnes have been diverted from landfill—465,000 cubic metres of uncompacted waste, enough to fill more than 120 Olympic-size swimming pools. That is 276 road trains packed to the top—almost 10 kilometres of road trains. If the waste were put into cotton bales it would be 110,000 bales. Laid end to end, that is enough containers to go from Brisbane down to Sydney, past Melbourne, across to Adelaide, past Perth and up to Broome, stopping at Kununurra—more than 8,200 kilometres.


The drumMUSTER is run by AgStewardship Australia Limited, an organisation established and developed to implement stewardship programs that reduce and manage waste for the Australian agricultural sector. AgStewardship Australia is rightly proud of what the drumMUSTER has achieved. The organisation is supported by the National Farmers Federation, CropLife Australia, Animal Health Alliance Ltd, the Veterinary Manufacturers and Distributors Association and the Australian Local Government Association. It has come a long way since the 4c per litre or kilogram was introduced. Today, 97 chemical manufacturers and 452 collection agencies or councils are taking part at 762 collection sites across the country. Since 1999, their programs have diverted more than 75 per cent of packaging that would have otherwise gone into landfill and has safely disposed of approximately 340 tonnes of unwanted chemicals. Most are managed by local councils at waste management sites and transfer stations and others by community groups, charities or even organisations like rural firefighters.


Because it is not overly bureaucratic, the drumMUSTER fits the different needs of a range of groups taking part. That is also a major reason the drumMUSTER has grown over time and continues to develop in individual ways. As the chairman of AgStewardship, Lauchlan McIntosh, has said, everyone from farmers, resellers, manufacturers and local councils have made the scheme efficient. Local governments are a key partner, recognising that the collection of the drums for recycling reduces landfill, besides providing a useful service for the taxpayers. The drumMUSTER has achieved a highly desirable outcome without the need for regulation. I know this is a foreign concept for many of those opposite, who see regulation as the answer to most problems. But the drumMUSTER has adapted in the flexible ways that government regulation just cannot do. I know the Greens in particular have an ideological hatred of agricultural chemical companies, yet it is by partnering with these firms that there has been proper disposal of unwanted chemicals. Research indicates that almost every farmer in Australia is aware of the drumMUSTER program, with more than 60 per cent having indicated that they have used the program.


Twenty thousand containers is a lot of drums. If more processors become involved, then hopefully we will end up seeing more and getting greater flexibility in our recovery rates. The challenge obviously is to get more sites. Overall, though, schemes such as the drumMUSTER mean a better stewardship of land, which is crucial to the health of the environment and to long-term prosperity. The CEO of AgStewardship Australia, Karen Gomez, who grew up in my home state of South Australia, attributes the success of the drumMUSTER to their pragmatic approach of owning and solving their own problems.


I commend AgStewardship Australia for what they have done so far and hope their example can pave the way for a concept of stewardship to replace some of the more outdated methods of regulation that currently exist. AgStewardship Australia sets a great example of taking responsibility for your own problems. By being proactive, this sector has saved itself a huge amount of time, money and angst. I would suggest that there is a lesson in this for all industry sectors: take responsibility for yourselves and you might avoid the burden of government intervention.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2012-11-22,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (12:27):  I am very disappointed in Senator Ruston's analysis of the container deposit scheme. She completely misunderstands the whole reason we had a Senate inquiry in the first place. To my knowledge, 20 million agricultural containers are not consumed outside the home by individuals and left lying around as rubbish, which was exactly the reason container deposit schemes were set up around the world in the first place.


I totally agree that anyone who uses a beverage container should be responsible for the disposal of that container. Unfortunately, human nature tends to intervene. No matter what fines and infringements we place on people—and I am sure Senator Ruston, coming from one of the cleanest states in Australia, would agree—they do not seem to work. We still get litter and we still get rubbish—and unfortunately that rubbish and that litter ends up not only in our environment but in our waterways and our oceans, and it breaks down into millions of pieces and finds its way into our sea life. Studies all around the world are now showing the ingestion of plastic from things such as plastic containers as far as the plankton food chain.


We know from packaging that 50 per cent of beverages in containers are consumed outside the home. It was fascinating to me, going to South Australia recently, to see how well kerbside recycling is working with container deposit schemes. South Australia—Senator Ruston's home state—achieves some of the highest recycling rates in the world: 84 per cent of containers consumed outside the home are recycled. This is a key point. We have kerbside recycling, and that is fantastic; nobody disagrees with that. But that is for containers consumed inside the home. I must say, my vineyard does not use chemical drums, because we are organic. I am a Green, but there are also non-Green people who are organic. I will make this point very clear: 20-litre drums of chemicals are not considered rubbish that people take to barbecues with them.


I have never seen someone turn up at a barbecue with a 20-litre drum of chemicals. I have never seen someone go to the football or a rock concert and dispose of a 20-litre drum of chemicals. It is an entirely inappropriate comparison to make and it shows a complete lack of understanding of our rubbish problem in this country.


It is not just Australia, Senator Ruston, that has implemented container deposit schemes. They have been successfully implemented all around the world. In fact, they started in the US to solve exactly this problem. How do we go from A to B and stop people from littering? We cannot. What we can do is work on the incentive that human nature responds to by putting a value on the rubbish that people leave lying around. Human nature lets us down on the left hand because people unfortunately litter when they are not supposed to and, on the right hand, people are prepared to go out and collect the rubbish. Why are they prepared to collect that rubbish? It is because there is an economic value on it. It is called a market based instrument. It is putting a price on pollution. It is using a market system. It is the most efficient system we have for solving our rubbish problem and it is a market based system. If you want to start sledging and throwing around comparisons about people who are on the left or the right and talking about regulation, that is using a market and a price signal to solve the problem. It is a very different point to what the senator was trying to make about the Greens being heavy on regulation. This is, in fact, not a regulation in the strictest sense of the word; it is an incentive. It is not a tax, as the Food and Grocery Council tried to make out. It is a levy that provides an incentive for people to do the right thing.


Let us talk about South Australia. I was very pleased to go there and see how proud they are of the container deposit scheme in their own state. Eighty-four per cent of all beverage containers are recycled. The Food and Grocery Council and other lobby groups for the beverage industry tried to make out that the packaging covenant, a co-regulatory approach that relies on volunteer agreements, is the best way to go. They could not provide any evidence as to how much packaging was consumed outside the home and how much of that was recycled, because their statistics relied on kerbside recycling, not rubbish outside the home. That is what container deposit schemes were set up for and that is what we were looking at in the inquiry.


It was also interesting for me to note that a state that was so proud of its scheme was surprised when the inefficiencies in that scheme were highlighted by a number of the key players. It is a lot worse in the Northern Territory, where a new scheme has been implemented and a large number of inefficiencies exist. I went to the Northern Territory and I sat and watched people stand in the sun and the dust for an hour with their children waiting to get their cans and bottles counted because people inside the depot were having to split 24 different ways every single container that came into their depot. It took people over an hour and a half to get their money before they left. That is a very inefficient system. All the participants we spoke to in the chain, including the beverage companies who own these supercollectors, agreed that the systems were inefficient and could be done much better.


In terms of rolling out a national scheme, yes, I agree with Senator Ruston: every state should take note of the existing schemes in the Northern Territory and South Australia. They should most definitely take note of what can be done better and what can be done more efficiently. There is absolutely no doubt from the Senate inquiry into container deposit schemes that we can do them a lot more efficiently. The use of new technology, only recently evident in both South Australia and Northern Territory recycling depots, will significantly reduce costs of the schemes.


It is also my view, and the view of the Greens, that beverage companies should not be part of this scheme. They should not be supercollectors. There is an inherent conflict of interest for companies that are fundamentally and ideologically opposed to using container deposit schemes being part of the system. It is like putting the fox in charge of the henhouse. There is no incentive whatsoever for them to improve the schemes. We believe that the inquiry has proven there has been profiteering in the South Australian scheme by Coca-Cola. That has been outlined in our dissenting report.


So, yes, future state schemes or a national scheme should be aware of the container deposits schemes in South Australia and the Northern Territory. There are things they need to know and there are significant ways we can improve the schemes. But the one thing that the EPA in South Australia and most South Australians I talked to, who are very proud of this scheme, pointed out is that in its environmental aim and objective—that is, increasing recycling and removing rubbish from outside the home—it is highly effective. Eighty-four per cent of all beverage containers sold in that state are recycled because of the scheme, because of this market based instrument that puts a price on plastic pollution and gives people an incentive to get off their backsides, pick up bottles and cans, and take them back to the depot. If they will not do it, kids will. Nearly everyone I saw at the depots in South Australia and in the Northern Territory were children with their parents. It is children making money. It is the Boy Scouts, church groups and community groups profiting from a scheme that distributes that income around the state.


It also provides a fantastic opportunity to aggregate other forms of waste. The South Australian container deposit scheme has revolutionised recycling in that state, and I believe it will do so for every state that adopts such a scheme. The packaging covenant at the moment does not provide an integrated scheme for integrating waste, particularly things such as e-waste and other types of waste that we saw being brought in by the same people who were there to cash in their containers. It could also be rolled out around this country by using private investment at no cost to the beverage companies and at no cost to the taxpayer. We believe there is a market solution to this right around the country. We also believe that new technologies that are being trialled will allow the schemes to run very efficiently and very cost-effectively. There is no doubt in my mind at all from my visits to South Australia and the Northern Territory that this could revolutionise the way we recycle in Australia.


I certainly like the reports that Boomerang Alliance have put out on a Tasmanian based scheme creating 300 new jobs with seven depots around the state. Hopefully, given all the awful garbage that I have seen lying around the Tamar River in the last two weeks, which we have done media on, we could also improve our recycling rates and take plastic out of our rivers and oceans where we know it is damaging marine life. It is the biggest source of pollution in our oceans. (Time expired)

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (12:37):  I am delighted to have learned from listening to Senator Whish-Wilson that you and I, Senator Ruston and Senator Farrell live in some type of litter and recycling nirvana. Where we are is obviously heaven on earth compared to everywhere else—and it is. It is a wonderful place to live, as we know. But I am not convinced that everything we have heard from Senator Whish-Wilson by any means stacks up to the most basic of fact checks or proofing. Firstly, seeing as Senator Whish-Wilson decided to dedicate the first part of his speech to responding to Senator Ruston, I might dedicate a little bit of time to responding to Senator Whish-Wilson before I reflect on the report of the inquiry that I was pleased to chair.


Senator Whish-Wilson claimed in one part of his speech that this type of scheme is the most efficient system we have but then in a different part of his speech that it was a very inefficient system. There was a complete contradiction even within the same speech. Throughout this inquiry, in much of what we heard from Senator Whish-Wilson's questioning, his approach was to question the inefficiencies in the systems of container deposit legislation in place.


He claimed that it was a market based system, not a regulation but an incentive. That is really quite remarkable, I think, for anybody. It is not regulatory, not a regulation? This is a system where the state government legislates to require that a 10c deposit be paid to anybody who returns a certain type of container to a certain type of place. That sounds very much like regulation to me. There is no variance in the price. The state government legislates that it be 10c. It is a fixed price. There is no market in terms of recognising that some of the products returned—say, aluminium cans—are worth an awful lot more than some of the other products returned. Some of them have greater value to recycling than other products.


Senator Whish-Wilson also claimed that evidence provided 'has proven profiteering by Coca-Cola'. Of course, I have not seen the minority report put down by Senator Whish-Wilson. I look forward to reading that and seeing how he has demonstrated and proven his claim of profiteering through the scheme by Coca-Cola. I think anybody with a relatively simple analysis of what occurs in the food and beverages grocery sector would acknowledge that it is a pretty competitive sector. They would acknowledge that at the retail level retailers fight for market share and at the wholesale and manufacturing level there is equally a fight for market share that occurs to maximise profits but to maximise profits in the most effective way—by maximising your sales and margin combinations.


I do not think through this inquiry we saw any credible evidence to support the claim of profiteering through these schemes. If anything, analysis undertaken at all manner of levels indicates that these schemes cost. They come at a cost. There is a merit based argument that can be made about the treatment of litter and the benefits of recycling, and I acknowledge those merit based arguments. We should acknowledge, though, that much has changed since the South Australian scheme was first enacted in the 1970s. Kerbside recycling did not exist then. In fact, very little of the recycling activities that we see today existed then. The scheme was tackling a very different problem to those that we look at today.


In talking about Tasmania, Senator Whish-Wilson suggested that if such a scheme were implemented there it could create hundreds of new jobs. Yet he claims that it all comes at no cost. You do not create new jobs in a sector like this without there being some cost application to fund those jobs.



Senator Whish-Wilson interjecting—




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  'It does not cost the taxpayers.' It costs the consumers—that is right, Senator Whish-Wilson. It costs the consumers, because the costs will be passed through to the consumers, who will pay more—



Senator Fifield interjecting—




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  and who in large part are the same people as taxpayers. Thank you, Senator Fifield. Consumers, taxpayers, Australians, Tasmanians—whoever they are—will end up footing the bill through higher costs.


This inquiry did not, however, seek to take on board the merits of having a container deposit scheme or not. It really was a narrow inquiry that looked very much at the operation of the South Australian and Northern Territory schemes and some of these claims of profiteering that I think were firmly rebuked. The inquiry made some clear recommendations, though. In terms of claims of price impacts, anybody who decides to go down this path in future at a national or a state level should make sure that, just as was the case when the GST or the carbon tax was introduced, there are tests so that anybody who makes false claims as to the price impacts can be held to account for making such false claims. In terms of return rates of products, there should be transparency to give confidence and in terms of disputes that may occur within the scheme, there should be some clear dispute resolution mechanisms.


I particularly want to highlight the last recommendation of the report, which relates to the treatment of small containers—containers of less than 100 millilitres in size—that require refrigeration. I urge the South Australian and Northern Territory governments to exempt them. Perhaps the best known of these types of containers are the small Yakult products. They are consumed in the home, they have to be kept refrigerated and they will be captured through kerbside recycling without a container deposit scheme being in place. The committee has recommended that they be treated just as a litre of milk is treated because they are consumed, by and large, just as a litre of milk is consumed—that is, they should be exempt from the schemes. I would urge the South Australian and Northern Territory governments to look at that because it is placing an unfair cost burden on a number of small companies who produce these products. With that, I commend the report to the Senate.

"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2012-11-22,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia) (12:22):  I rise to speak on the Environment and Communications References Committee report on container deposit schemes. The intention of this inquiry was to investigate the pricing and revenue allocation practices of the beverage industry in South Australia and the Northern Territory, which are the only two states in Australia where the CDS exists. The South Australian scheme is 35 years old and well established, and the Northern Territory scheme is brand new. As such, the South Australian community is largely accepting of this system of legislation. But I would just like to put on record that other states should be very, very careful before they consider going down this path, because there may well be better options available to achieve disposal outcomes.


I draw the attention of the Senate to a success story on this sort of management that does not have the overly burdensome requirements of the two container deposit schemes investigated in the inquiry. The success story to which I refer is the drumMUSTER, with 20 million containers safely disposed of since 1999. This scheme has been dedicated to helping farmers and chemical users keep their land free of waste. The plastic and steel from which these products are made is recycled and diverted away from landfill into new products. There have been pretty amazing results of this Industry Waste Reduction Scheme agreement. More than 25,000 tonnes have been diverted from landfill—465,000 cubic metres of uncompacted waste, enough to fill more than 120 Olympic-size swimming pools. That is 276 road trains packed to the top—almost 10 kilometres of road trains. If the waste were put into cotton bales it would be 110,000 bales. Laid end to end, that is enough containers to go from Brisbane down to Sydney, past Melbourne, across to Adelaide, past Perth and up to Broome, stopping at Kununurra—more than 8,200 kilometres.


The drumMUSTER is run by AgStewardship Australia Limited, an organisation established and developed to implement stewardship programs that reduce and manage waste for the Australian agricultural sector. AgStewardship Australia is rightly proud of what the drumMUSTER has achieved. The organisation is supported by the National Farmers Federation, CropLife Australia, Animal Health Alliance Ltd, the Veterinary Manufacturers and Distributors Association and the Australian Local Government Association. It has come a long way since the 4c per litre or kilogram was introduced. Today, 97 chemical manufacturers and 452 collection agencies or councils are taking part at 762 collection sites across the country. Since 1999, their programs have diverted more than 75 per cent of packaging that would have otherwise gone into landfill and has safely disposed of approximately 340 tonnes of unwanted chemicals. Most are managed by local councils at waste management sites and transfer stations and others by community groups, charities or even organisations like rural firefighters.


Because it is not overly bureaucratic, the drumMUSTER fits the different needs of a range of groups taking part. That is also a major reason the drumMUSTER has grown over time and continues to develop in individual ways. As the chairman of AgStewardship, Lauchlan McIntosh, has said, everyone from farmers, resellers, manufacturers and local councils have made the scheme efficient. Local governments are a key partner, recognising that the collection of the drums for recycling reduces landfill, besides providing a useful service for the taxpayers. The drumMUSTER has achieved a highly desirable outcome without the need for regulation. I know this is a foreign concept for many of those opposite, who see regulation as the answer to most problems. But the drumMUSTER has adapted in the flexible ways that government regulation just cannot do. I know the Greens in particular have an ideological hatred of agricultural chemical companies, yet it is by partnering with these firms that there has been proper disposal of unwanted chemicals. Research indicates that almost every farmer in Australia is aware of the drumMUSTER program, with more than 60 per cent having indicated that they have used the program.


Twenty thousand containers is a lot of drums. If more processors become involved, then hopefully we will end up seeing more and getting greater flexibility in our recovery rates. The challenge obviously is to get more sites. Overall, though, schemes such as the drumMUSTER mean a better stewardship of land, which is crucial to the health of the environment and to long-term prosperity. The CEO of AgStewardship Australia, Karen Gomez, who grew up in my home state of South Australia, attributes the success of the drumMUSTER to their pragmatic approach of owning and solving their own problems.


I commend AgStewardship Australia for what they have done so far and hope their example can pave the way for a concept of stewardship to replace some of the more outdated methods of regulation that currently exist. AgStewardship Australia sets a great example of taking responsibility for your own problems. By being proactive, this sector has saved itself a huge amount of time, money and angst. I would suggest that there is a lesson in this for all industry sectors: take responsibility for yourselves and you might avoid the burden of government intervention.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2012-11-22,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (12:27):  I am very disappointed in Senator Ruston's analysis of the container deposit scheme. She completely misunderstands the whole reason we had a Senate inquiry in the first place. To my knowledge, 20 million agricultural containers are not consumed outside the home by individuals and left lying around as rubbish, which was exactly the reason container deposit schemes were set up around the world in the first place.


I totally agree that anyone who uses a beverage container should be responsible for the disposal of that container. Unfortunately, human nature tends to intervene. No matter what fines and infringements we place on people—and I am sure Senator Ruston, coming from one of the cleanest states in Australia, would agree—they do not seem to work. We still get litter and we still get rubbish—and unfortunately that rubbish and that litter ends up not only in our environment but in our waterways and our oceans, and it breaks down into millions of pieces and finds its way into our sea life. Studies all around the world are now showing the ingestion of plastic from things such as plastic containers as far as the plankton food chain.


We know from packaging that 50 per cent of beverages in containers are consumed outside the home. It was fascinating to me, going to South Australia recently, to see how well kerbside recycling is working with container deposit schemes. South Australia—Senator Ruston's home state—achieves some of the highest recycling rates in the world: 84 per cent of containers consumed outside the home are recycled. This is a key point. We have kerbside recycling, and that is fantastic; nobody disagrees with that. But that is for containers consumed inside the home. I must say, my vineyard does not use chemical drums, because we are organic. I am a Green, but there are also non-Green people who are organic. I will make this point very clear: 20-litre drums of chemicals are not considered rubbish that people take to barbecues with them.


I have never seen someone turn up at a barbecue with a 20-litre drum of chemicals. I have never seen someone go to the football or a rock concert and dispose of a 20-litre drum of chemicals. It is an entirely inappropriate comparison to make and it shows a complete lack of understanding of our rubbish problem in this country.


It is not just Australia, Senator Ruston, that has implemented container deposit schemes. They have been successfully implemented all around the world. In fact, they started in the US to solve exactly this problem. How do we go from A to B and stop people from littering? We cannot. What we can do is work on the incentive that human nature responds to by putting a value on the rubbish that people leave lying around. Human nature lets us down on the left hand because people unfortunately litter when they are not supposed to and, on the right hand, people are prepared to go out and collect the rubbish. Why are they prepared to collect that rubbish? It is because there is an economic value on it. It is called a market based instrument. It is putting a price on pollution. It is using a market system. It is the most efficient system we have for solving our rubbish problem and it is a market based system. If you want to start sledging and throwing around comparisons about people who are on the left or the right and talking about regulation, that is using a market and a price signal to solve the problem. It is a very different point to what the senator was trying to make about the Greens being heavy on regulation. This is, in fact, not a regulation in the strictest sense of the word; it is an incentive. It is not a tax, as the Food and Grocery Council tried to make out. It is a levy that provides an incentive for people to do the right thing.


Let us talk about South Australia. I was very pleased to go there and see how proud they are of the container deposit scheme in their own state. Eighty-four per cent of all beverage containers are recycled. The Food and Grocery Council and other lobby groups for the beverage industry tried to make out that the packaging covenant, a co-regulatory approach that relies on volunteer agreements, is the best way to go. They could not provide any evidence as to how much packaging was consumed outside the home and how much of that was recycled, because their statistics relied on kerbside recycling, not rubbish outside the home. That is what container deposit schemes were set up for and that is what we were looking at in the inquiry.


It was also interesting for me to note that a state that was so proud of its scheme was surprised when the inefficiencies in that scheme were highlighted by a number of the key players. It is a lot worse in the Northern Territory, where a new scheme has been implemented and a large number of inefficiencies exist. I went to the Northern Territory and I sat and watched people stand in the sun and the dust for an hour with their children waiting to get their cans and bottles counted because people inside the depot were having to split 24 different ways every single container that came into their depot. It took people over an hour and a half to get their money before they left. That is a very inefficient system. All the participants we spoke to in the chain, including the beverage companies who own these supercollectors, agreed that the systems were inefficient and could be done much better.


In terms of rolling out a national scheme, yes, I agree with Senator Ruston: every state should take note of the existing schemes in the Northern Territory and South Australia. They should most definitely take note of what can be done better and what can be done more efficiently. There is absolutely no doubt from the Senate inquiry into container deposit schemes that we can do them a lot more efficiently. The use of new technology, only recently evident in both South Australia and Northern Territory recycling depots, will significantly reduce costs of the schemes.


It is also my view, and the view of the Greens, that beverage companies should not be part of this scheme. They should not be supercollectors. There is an inherent conflict of interest for companies that are fundamentally and ideologically opposed to using container deposit schemes being part of the system. It is like putting the fox in charge of the henhouse. There is no incentive whatsoever for them to improve the schemes. We believe that the inquiry has proven there has been profiteering in the South Australian scheme by Coca-Cola. That has been outlined in our dissenting report.


So, yes, future state schemes or a national scheme should be aware of the container deposits schemes in South Australia and the Northern Territory. There are things they need to know and there are significant ways we can improve the schemes. But the one thing that the EPA in South Australia and most South Australians I talked to, who are very proud of this scheme, pointed out is that in its environmental aim and objective—that is, increasing recycling and removing rubbish from outside the home—it is highly effective. Eighty-four per cent of all beverage containers sold in that state are recycled because of the scheme, because of this market based instrument that puts a price on plastic pollution and gives people an incentive to get off their backsides, pick up bottles and cans, and take them back to the depot. If they will not do it, kids will. Nearly everyone I saw at the depots in South Australia and in the Northern Territory were children with their parents. It is children making money. It is the Boy Scouts, church groups and community groups profiting from a scheme that distributes that income around the state.


It also provides a fantastic opportunity to aggregate other forms of waste. The South Australian container deposit scheme has revolutionised recycling in that state, and I believe it will do so for every state that adopts such a scheme. The packaging covenant at the moment does not provide an integrated scheme for integrating waste, particularly things such as e-waste and other types of waste that we saw being brought in by the same people who were there to cash in their containers. It could also be rolled out around this country by using private investment at no cost to the beverage companies and at no cost to the taxpayer. We believe there is a market solution to this right around the country. We also believe that new technologies that are being trialled will allow the schemes to run very efficiently and very cost-effectively. There is no doubt in my mind at all from my visits to South Australia and the Northern Territory that this could revolutionise the way we recycle in Australia.


I certainly like the reports that Boomerang Alliance have put out on a Tasmanian based scheme creating 300 new jobs with seven depots around the state. Hopefully, given all the awful garbage that I have seen lying around the Tamar River in the last two weeks, which we have done media on, we could also improve our recycling rates and take plastic out of our rivers and oceans where we know it is damaging marine life. It is the biggest source of pollution in our oceans. (Time expired)

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (12:37):  I am delighted to have learned from listening to Senator Whish-Wilson that you and I, Senator Ruston and Senator Farrell live in some type of litter and recycling nirvana. Where we are is obviously heaven on earth compared to everywhere else—and it is. It is a wonderful place to live, as we know. But I am not convinced that everything we have heard from Senator Whish-Wilson by any means stacks up to the most basic of fact checks or proofing. Firstly, seeing as Senator Whish-Wilson decided to dedicate the first part of his speech to responding to Senator Ruston, I might dedicate a little bit of time to responding to Senator Whish-Wilson before I reflect on the report of the inquiry that I was pleased to chair.


Senator Whish-Wilson claimed in one part of his speech that this type of scheme is the most efficient system we have but then in a different part of his speech that it was a very inefficient system. There was a complete contradiction even within the same speech. Throughout this inquiry, in much of what we heard from Senator Whish-Wilson's questioning, his approach was to question the inefficiencies in the systems of container deposit legislation in place.


He claimed that it was a market based system, not a regulation but an incentive. That is really quite remarkable, I think, for anybody. It is not regulatory, not a regulation? This is a system where the state government legislates to require that a 10c deposit be paid to anybody who returns a certain type of container to a certain type of place. That sounds very much like regulation to me. There is no variance in the price. The state government legislates that it be 10c. It is a fixed price. There is no market in terms of recognising that some of the products returned—say, aluminium cans—are worth an awful lot more than some of the other products returned. Some of them have greater value to recycling than other products.


Senator Whish-Wilson also claimed that evidence provided 'has proven profiteering by Coca-Cola'. Of course, I have not seen the minority report put down by Senator Whish-Wilson. I look forward to reading that and seeing how he has demonstrated and proven his claim of profiteering through the scheme by Coca-Cola. I think anybody with a relatively simple analysis of what occurs in the food and beverages grocery sector would acknowledge that it is a pretty competitive sector. They would acknowledge that at the retail level retailers fight for market share and at the wholesale and manufacturing level there is equally a fight for market share that occurs to maximise profits but to maximise profits in the most effective way—by maximising your sales and margin combinations.


I do not think through this inquiry we saw any credible evidence to support the claim of profiteering through these schemes. If anything, analysis undertaken at all manner of levels indicates that these schemes cost. They come at a cost. There is a merit based argument that can be made about the treatment of litter and the benefits of recycling, and I acknowledge those merit based arguments. We should acknowledge, though, that much has changed since the South Australian scheme was first enacted in the 1970s. Kerbside recycling did not exist then. In fact, very little of the recycling activities that we see today existed then. The scheme was tackling a very different problem to those that we look at today.


In talking about Tasmania, Senator Whish-Wilson suggested that if such a scheme were implemented there it could create hundreds of new jobs. Yet he claims that it all comes at no cost. You do not create new jobs in a sector like this without there being some cost application to fund those jobs.



Senator Whish-Wilson interjecting—




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  'It does not cost the taxpayers.' It costs the consumers—that is right, Senator Whish-Wilson. It costs the consumers, because the costs will be passed through to the consumers, who will pay more—



Senator Fifield interjecting—




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  and who in large part are the same people as taxpayers. Thank you, Senator Fifield. Consumers, taxpayers, Australians, Tasmanians—whoever they are—will end up footing the bill through higher costs.


This inquiry did not, however, seek to take on board the merits of having a container deposit scheme or not. It really was a narrow inquiry that looked very much at the operation of the South Australian and Northern Territory schemes and some of these claims of profiteering that I think were firmly rebuked. The inquiry made some clear recommendations, though. In terms of claims of price impacts, anybody who decides to go down this path in future at a national or a state level should make sure that, just as was the case when the GST or the carbon tax was introduced, there are tests so that anybody who makes false claims as to the price impacts can be held to account for making such false claims. In terms of return rates of products, there should be transparency to give confidence and in terms of disputes that may occur within the scheme, there should be some clear dispute resolution mechanisms.


I particularly want to highlight the last recommendation of the report, which relates to the treatment of small containers—containers of less than 100 millilitres in size—that require refrigeration. I urge the South Australian and Northern Territory governments to exempt them. Perhaps the best known of these types of containers are the small Yakult products. They are consumed in the home, they have to be kept refrigerated and they will be captured through kerbside recycling without a container deposit scheme being in place. The committee has recommended that they be treated just as a litre of milk is treated because they are consumed, by and large, just as a litre of milk is consumed—that is, they should be exempt from the schemes. I would urge the South Australian and Northern Territory governments to look at that because it is placing an unfair cost burden on a number of small companies who produce these products. With that, I commend the report to the Senate.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2012-11-22,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (12:45):  The coalition will not oppose these bills. In fact, the coalition strongly supports the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Capital Gains Tax Relief and Other Efficiency Measures) Bill 2012 and thinks that we should have been dealing with this a long time ago. People across the superannuation industry who are focused on the best interests of their members and people across the superannuation industry who have been exploring opportunities for mergers to achieve efficiencies and benefits of scale which can then flow through in terms of lower fees and higher net returns have been waiting for some time for this bill to be passed by the parliament. 


The coalition have been indicating for months that the government had our support. Of course Minister Shorten, the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation, has known for months that he had our support to get this bill through the parliament, yet he has not progressed it in an appropriately timely fashion. This measure has broad support, is very sensible and does the sorts of things that we all agree with—which is ensure that super fund trustees can make decisions on mergers based on whether they make sense and whether they are appropriate in the best interests of members rather than be prevented, because of tax considerations, from making decisions that otherwise make sense. Instead of pressing ahead with that, Minister Shorten thought he was going to be a bit clever, which is what this government always does. He thought he would slip something in that is somewhat controversial. He put together two bills that have nothing to do with each other. 


We have the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Capital Gains Tax Relief and Other Efficiency Measures) Bill 2012, which provides capital gains tax relief for merging superannuation funds, and we have the Superannuation Auditor Registration Imposition Bill 2012, which, consistent with the terrible track record of this government over the past five years, seeks to impose further red tape on a sector of the superannuation industry—self-managed super funds—which this government fundamentally dislikes. This government has an ideological dislike of self-managed superannuation. This government does not like those Australians who are working hard and saving hard to help achieve a self-funded retirement. It is always looking for ways to come up with more hurdles, more red tape and more costs and to make it less attractive for people across Australia to work hard and save to achieve a self-funded retirement. The second bill, which we are opposed to, is attached to the first bill for no reason other than that the minister and the government know that, because of our strong support for the first bill, attaching the second bill to it and making a package will force our hand so that we eventually roll over and let something go through that otherwise would not attract our support. That is a very bad and very dishonourable process. People across Australia need to understand what this government is up to.


Over the last five years, this government has given us more than 21,000 new regulations. This government is choking our economy in red tape. The Superannuation Auditor Registration Imposition Bill 2012 is a very insidious part of that agenda by this government because it is targeting those Australians who are doing the right thing, who are doing everything they can to achieve a self-funded retirement, which ultimately helps take pressure off the public purse.


It is quite extraordinary that, despite our publicly indicated support for the best part of this year, the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Capital Gains Tax Relief and Other Efficiency Measures) Bill has not come before us until the second last week of the sittings. To go through a bit of detail, capital gains tax considerations can be a barrier to the merging of superannuation funds, even where that merging otherwise make sense and would deliver benefits to fund members. Whenever superannuation funds merge, this will typically trigger a capital gains tax event, which leads to capital gains and/or losses being applied to those assets being transferred. When a merger takes place and the assets have been transferred, the merged fund is typically wound up; however, when the merged fund comes to an end, any previous capital or revenue losses that existed at that time will be foregone. Capital losses can be used to offset present and future capital gains tax liabilities. Revenue losses can be offset against current-year income. 


This bill permits the rollover of both revenue gains and losses in addition to capital gains or losses to the receiving fund. Due to the prevailing economic and financial market conditions in late 2008, a temporary taxation relief measure was passed in the form of loss relief and asset rollover to assist the superannuation industry and, through the industry, relevant fund members. However, the relief provided in that legislation was time limited to 1 October 2011. We not only supported at the time the relief that was provided but have indicated in the past that the time limited nature of that relief was going to be a problem. So we supported the tax relief for merging super funds at the time as a sensible measure to ensure that otherwise sensible mergers of superannuation funds were not prevented based on taxation considerations. The truth of the matter is that, if there are significant capital gains tax implications from a merger, then that in itself can prevent a merger from going ahead that otherwise would make sense. Any loss of revenue in that context is largely academic and theoretical because it would not otherwise be realised. If the capital gains tax implications were significant, a merger would not occur and the revenue would not be realised in any event.


This current bill is temporary, this time for mergers that occur on or after 1 October 2011 and before 2 July 2017. We are very conscious of the fact that across large parts of the sector, including, I might add, the not-for-profit industry super funds sector, a lot of people have been waiting for the parliament to deal with this legislation. I place on the record that the only person that is to blame for the delay is Minister Bill Shorten himself. No other person can be blamed for the fact that this legislation has been delayed until today. As well as having delayed it, he has put the passage of this legislation—this legislation which makes a lot of sense—at risk, by attaching to it the Superannuation Auditor Registration Imposition Bill, a bill that is clearly somewhat controversial. 


Schedule 2 of the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Capital Gains Tax Relief and Other Efficiency Measures) Bill introduces a new registration regime for auditors of self-managed superannuation funds. Currently SMSF trustees are required to appoint an approved auditor to audit the financial reports and operations of the fund annually. This bill introduces a new definition of an approved SMSF auditor. It sets out who may apply for registration and the requirements that they must meet. It sets out the necessary ongoing obligations of SMSF auditors, including needing to meet a range of continuing professional development requirements and complying with a range of competency and independence standards. It allows ASIC to create a register of approved SMSF auditors in addition to a register of disqualified SMSF auditors. It allows ASIC to charge relevant fees—here we go again—including in relation to the application to be an approved SMSF auditor and for the compulsory competency examination. It provides ASIC with the power to determine and set competency standards for all SMSF auditors. It provides powers to the ATO to monitor SMSF auditors' compliance with relevant standards and refer any non-compliant SMSF auditor to ASIC. Registration processes are to commence from 31 January 2013. 


You are getting the gist—there is a whole lot of additional bureaucratic involvement on top of the already quite burdensome arrangements that are in place so far, all of it at a cost that ultimately will have to be passed on to those people who have chosen, or will choose in the future, to manage their superannuation affairs through a self-managed super fund because in their judgement this gives them more control and more options to manage their own financial affairs as they work towards retirement.


Minister Shorten's approach to the SMSF sector more generally, which is egged on by commercial interests in other parts of the industry, has been consistent all the way through. He is trying to make it harder for people to manage their superannuation affairs through self-managed super funds because he does not like people managing their affairs through self-managed super funds. He would much rather have people invest their superannuation funds perhaps with an industry super fund. As well as his bad track record when it comes to imposing additional red tape, consistent with what the Labor Party in government has done more generally, he also has a bad track record in relation to the taxation of superannuation. In the first four budgets, and in the most recent Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, the current government has imposed more than $8 billion in new taxes on superannuation, through a range of measures, including by reducing concessional contribution caps from $50,000 and $100,000 down to $25,000 across the board, by changing the definition of income and doing a whole range of things that always looked like a bit of fiddling at the margins, but always with a significant revenue sting in the tail.


In the House of Representatives, the coalition moved amendments to excise schedule 2 from the superannuation bill. We were also opposed to the associated auditor registration bill. The coalition did this because we see the registration regime as being yet more red tape and cost to the financial sector, which is ultimately passed on to consumers and to those Australians saving to achieve self-funded retirement. Under the new regime, new registration fees are set to not exceed $1,000. However, there is no detail in the legislation, with the actual fee to be determined by regulation. We put up those amendments in the House. Sadly, they did not succeed. Given the approach and attitude that the Greens have taken in relation to this whole issue, we understand that these amendments would not succeed in the Senate either, because the Labor-Greens alliance government is a high-taxing and high-red-tape kind of a government. Consistent with that general attitude of the Labor-Greens administration, that is the approach that they have taken to this particular bill. 


This is exactly the position that Minister Shorten wanted the Senate and the coalition to be in. The government wanted us to be in a position where we would feel so strongly about the importance of the capital gains tax relief provisions that we would have no choice but to ultimately roll over on the other aspects of this package of bills. And that is exactly what is going to happen. In recognition of the importance of the capital gains tax relief measures to the superannuation industry and to the people in relevant superannuation funds, we will not be insisting on those amendments again in the Senate, but we do however restate in the strongest possible terms the coalition's opposition to unnecessary red tape being imposed by this government.


At the next election, people will have the opportunity to make a choice. They can continue with this high-spending, high-taxing, big red-tape government which is taking Australia in the wrong direction by making us less competitive internationally and reducing productivity growth—or they can opt for a change of direction. They can choose a coalition government which would be serious about living within its means, which would be serious about spending less, which would be serious about taxing less and which would be serious about cutting red tape instead of adding red tape. A coalition government would deliver $1 billion worth of savings for business per annum through cutting red tape. These savings would flow through the Australian economy to consumers through lower costs and charges. As a government we would spend less, tax less, cut red tape and reduce the level of sovereign risk—which has been rising because of the constant chopping and changing by this government—by being more predictable. If we were successful in doing all that, we would grow our productivity more strongly and grow our international competitiveness instead of reducing it. In doing so, we would end up growing our economy more strongly than it otherwise would have grown. A more strongly growing economy would not only improve our prosperity as a nation, it would also lead to better superannuation returns. Guess what? That would also lead to more revenue for the government—without the need for all these new and ad hoc Labor Party and Greens taxes.


That is the choice the Australian people will have in front of them sometime next year. They can choose to continue in the current direction. That direction has included more than 26 new or increased taxes and more than 21,000 new regulations, regulations which are choking business and making the delivery of goods and services more expensive than it needs to be. That direction has seen significant new sovereign risk generated through this government's constant chopping and changing. 


This government hates success and hates people who aspire to be successful. It is a government which does not like people who are doing everything they can to achieve self-funded retirement—which is the right thing to do. Surely we want to see as many Australians as possible achieve a self-funded retirement. But this is the bad direction this government has been taking Australia in—our productivity growth is slowing and our international competitiveness has been going down. Ultimately that imposes a cost on our economy and on the people of Australia. There is a better way—the coalition way. Under a coalition government, pieces of legislation such as this one, which massively increases red tape, would not be on the agenda. A coalition government would focus on cutting red tape rather than indiscriminately continuing to add to it week after week and month after month. 


The coalition will not oppose this package of bills on the basis that we strongly support the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Capital Gains Tax Relief and Other Efficiency Measures) Bill—certainly we support the schedule 1 provisions which provide tax relief for merging superannuation funds. We are concerned about schedule 2, the self-managed superannuation funds auditor registration provisions, and the second bill. However, in the interests of providing certainty to superannuation funds that may be considering fund mergers which make sense other than for the capital gains tax implications of those mergers, we will not be opposing the package of bills. We do reserve the right in government to revisit the additional red tape the government has imposed through the self-managed superannuation provisions I have talked about.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (12:45):  The coalition will not oppose these bills. In fact, the coalition strongly supports the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Capital Gains Tax Relief and Other Efficiency Measures) Bill 2012 and thinks that we should have been dealing with this a long time ago. People across the superannuation industry who are focused on the best interests of their members and people across the superannuation industry who have been exploring opportunities for mergers to achieve efficiencies and benefits of scale which can then flow through in terms of lower fees and higher net returns have been waiting for some time for this bill to be passed by the parliament. 


The coalition have been indicating for months that the government had our support. Of course Minister Shorten, the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation, has known for months that he had our support to get this bill through the parliament, yet he has not progressed it in an appropriately timely fashion. This measure has broad support, is very sensible and does the sorts of things that we all agree with—which is ensure that super fund trustees can make decisions on mergers based on whether they make sense and whether they are appropriate in the best interests of members rather than be prevented, because of tax considerations, from making decisions that otherwise make sense. Instead of pressing ahead with that, Minister Shorten thought he was going to be a bit clever, which is what this government always does. He thought he would slip something in that is somewhat controversial. He put together two bills that have nothing to do with each other. 


We have the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Capital Gains Tax Relief and Other Efficiency Measures) Bill 2012, which provides capital gains tax relief for merging superannuation funds, and we have the Superannuation Auditor Registration Imposition Bill 2012, which, consistent with the terrible track record of this government over the past five years, seeks to impose further red tape on a sector of the superannuation industry—self-managed super funds—which this government fundamentally dislikes. This government has an ideological dislike of self-managed superannuation. This government does not like those Australians who are working hard and saving hard to help achieve a self-funded retirement. It is always looking for ways to come up with more hurdles, more red tape and more costs and to make it less attractive for people across Australia to work hard and save to achieve a self-funded retirement. The second bill, which we are opposed to, is attached to the first bill for no reason other than that the minister and the government know that, because of our strong support for the first bill, attaching the second bill to it and making a package will force our hand so that we eventually roll over and let something go through that otherwise would not attract our support.

The answer read as follows—



On 22 November 2012 Senator Brandis asked:


I refer the minister to comments by Mr Richard Britten, the Police Commissioner of Nauru, reported in the Fairfax press today indicating that the Nauruan authorities wished to pursue wilful damage and riot charges against two Iranian asylum seekers to answer for their alleged role in the riot at the processing centre which caused $25,000 worth of damage. Can the minister confirm that the Australian government agreed to the men's request to be voluntarily returned to Iran without having to answer for their alleged crimes?


Response: 


The Department has not facilitated the removal of anyone who was charged with any offence on Nauru.


Law enforcement matters are an issue for the Nauruan Government.

"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2012-11-22,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia) (15:03):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Sport (Senator Lundy) to a question without notice asked by Senator Cash today relating to detention centres and asylum seekers.


I rise to take note of answers given by Senator Lundy to questions asked by me in question time today. A number of my colleagues noted the irony in the statement that I have just made to the Senate: 'I rise to take note of answers'—because what we have witnessed today is, quite frankly, one of the worst displays of a minister not answering questions in this Senate.


It is a very serious situation when the government makes an announcement, like the government did yesterday, that it is having to expand the detention facility because the detention network in Australia has officially broken under the Gillard Labor government; and, when asked very specific questions about just how much these additional onshore facilities are going to cost the Australian taxpayer, the minister was actually dumbfounded. Not only was she dumbfounded; she actually read from the wrong brief.


Australian taxpayers have a right to know just how much more of their money this government is going to rob them blind of to pay for what is now being heralded—even by the press, I have to say; and that is saying something—as possibly the greatest policy failure we have seen since Federation. Australians have witnessed over 30,000 people arriving in Australia in only a four-year period because of a gross dereliction of duty by this Labor government. We have now spent in excess of $6 billion of taxpayers' money because of the gross incompetence of those opposite.


Under the former Howard government, who stopped the boats—you cannot deny that; our policy stopped the boats and we reduced the number of people coming here to zero—Australians were paying $85 million a year for detention networks in Australia. The Australian taxpayer is now paying in excess of $6 billion. And only recently, on Monday, the Senate was asked to appropriate an additional $1.67 billion of taxpayers' money because this government just cannot get it right.


Today, after the government has made the announcement that it is again changing its policy in relation to detention, we ask what is it going to cost? You have made an announcement that you are going to open an additional 700 beds. You are going to reopen Pontville in Tasmania. You officially announced yesterday that you are now sending thousands of asylum seekers, not refugees, into the community. It needs to be very clear to Australians that refugees are not being sent into the community; asylum seekers are being sent into the community. There is a fundamental difference: these people have not had their claim actually verified. The government has admitted it will be sending thousands of asylum seekers into the Australian community and it cannot tell the Australian taxpayers how much it is going to cost them. It is $6 billion to date. Part of that is the additional $1.67 billion that this Senate appropriated on Monday. I can tell you, when we are back here in February, I do not know how much this government will be asking for anymore. We are already up to $6 billion, but I will put money on it that it will be at least another billion dollars of taxpayers' money. 


Why do we say that? Because the minister was unable to tell the Senate whether or not the government had actually revised the number of estimated monthly arrivals. Currently, the government has budgeted for 450 arrivals per month. That is what the Australian government has said is its budget for this financial year. We are currently experiencing over 2,000 people arriving per month. That is the equivalent of the QE2 arriving at Christmas Island fully laden every single month. Two thousand people per month are arriving in Australia. Over 10,000 people have already arrived in this financial year alone. The government only budgeted for 5,400 people arriving. This is without a doubt the grossest dereliction of duty Australians have ever seen in relation to this portfolio area. (Time expired)

Senator CROSSIN
 (Northern Territory) (15:09):  I rise to make a contribution to this debate in which we have heard a number of severe inaccuracies in the contribution just made by Senator Cash.




Senator Cash:
  Please tell me what they are.




Senator CROSSIN:
  Senator Cash, month after month, as I chair the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee and as we sit in that committee three times a year at estimates, you sit alongside us at the table. On the day when the Department of Immigration and Citizenship is before us, you hear its representatives when they usually—almost nine times out of 10—begin their contribution by explaining to us what is happening in the world when it comes to the movement of people seeking asylum and the movement of people who are refugees. There are push and pull factors, the former secretary Andrew Metcalfe said, time and time again. So, standing in this chamber and making the comment that under the Howard government you single-handedly stopped the boats is an absolutely incorrect statement. We know, for the record, that the evidence will show that movement of people around the world seeking asylum stops and starts for many reasons.


We also know that, if you go back and have a look at the record, it will show that when TPVs were introduced the number of people who were seeking asylum in this country spiked because of the nature of the TPVs, which totally prevented family reunions. So, once the man or even the woman arrived in this country, their partner or their family had no choice but to get on a boat to join them, because they were not going to get here any other way. So please go back and look at the figures and accurately reflect what happens.


We stand in this chamber every single day having a debate about what is going on with the refugee policy in this country simply because you have failed to endorse wholeheartedly the Houston committee report and the 22 recommendations it made. So, yes, people will still keep arriving. Yes, the costs were included in the budget appropriation bills debate that you were part of last Monday—the cost is there in the MYEFO. But the essential element we need to understand and people listening need to understand is that, as a way of moving forward, this Prime Minister and this government got together three eminent people in this country and set up an expert committee headed by Angus Houston, the former Chief of the Defence Force, a person that your government appointed as the Chief of the Defence Force.


Those three people came up with a report that had 22 recommendations. They clearly said that the situation needed all of their report to be endorsed, that all of the fundamental propositions they put together needed to be endorsed as a package. But what do you across the chamber do? You want to cherry-pick and pick the eyes out of it. You do not want to endorse the Malaysia agreement, which was their pre-eminent recommendation. You want Nauru, but you do not want Malaysia. You want to do offshore processing, but you do not want to do it in a way that is going to comprehensively deal with this problem. One minute you want TPVs, but you do not want bridging visas. So I sit opposite you and listen to your contribution, Senator Cash, but—try as hard as you may, day after day—I still cannot get a handle on exactly what the policy of the coalition is. What is it that you fundamentally want? 




Senator Brandis:
  The Howard government policy.




Senator CROSSIN:
  You want offshore processing, so you want Nauru? You have got Nauru. You want TPVs. We offered you the chance to have an independent inquiry into whether or not TPVs were effective. We did not rule them out. On the table we put a negotiating chip: here's TPVs—let's have a joint look at whether they are effective or not. You ruled that out. You do not want to give the Malaysia agreement a try. You want to tow back the boats to a country that is not going to accept your boats. You want to tow the boats back to somewhere, but you cannot tell the people of this country where you would tow the boats back to—because Indonesia sure as hell is not going to have them. So where are you going to take these people back to once they get halfway to Australia and they are on a rickety boat? You do not have a policy. Your policy is that you just want to keep playing politics with people's lives. (Time expired)

Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Deputy Leader of The Nationals) (15:14):  I have to say it is fairly nauseating to get lectured by those on the other side, particularly Senator Crossin, on picking policy. Can you imagine that—getting lectured by them about picking policy? It is now some 14 weeks—over three months—since Nauru opened. This is one successful policy of the Howard government. We say, 'Congratulations on accepting one policy out of a trilogy of success.' But remember that, to get a car, or anything, to move forward, you need three things to happen: the handbrake needs to be off, there needs to be air in the tyres and there needs to be petrol in the tank. If you fail on one of those three things, there is no movement. If you fail on two of them, I suspect there will be no movement either. It is a little bit like having a trifecta bet, going up to the bookie and saying, 'One of them came home; can I have my money.' It is just not going to cut it.


This is not some academic report that is suggesting, 'If you do all of these things, it'll be a miracle; that's never been tried.' We had a policy that ended up with us having absolutely no boats: temporary protection visas, offshore processing and turning the boats back where it is safe to do so. This has been tested. Three months ago, the government accepted one of our policies. What has happened? What are we going to measure it on? What about how many people have arrived? Since that date the policy has not worked, because we have had record numbers of people. We have had over 2,000 people a month. More people than the QE2 carries are arriving on Christmas Island every month. You have to say, 'I don't think this is really working for me.' If the intention was to stop people, clearly that policy has not worked. Since 14 August, 7,716 people have arrived.


So the government have tinkered around a bit and said, 'I know: instead of temporary protection visas'—which we need, as they are a clear disincentive—'we will call them bridging visas.' But they are not actually even a bridging visa; they are a new type of bridging visa. They are a recurring bridging visa, which basically means we are not waiting for some particular thing to happen. It is a bit like going to the chemist for a script. You are going to get one every time. You do not even have to turn up. So they are a special sort of bridging visa, a Clayton's bridging visa—the bridging visa you have when you do not have a bridging visa. This basically means you can stay forever. But not only do you have a reasonable expectation under those circumstances of permanent residency—which one might understand is quite reasonable if you are a refugee—but these are not even refugees. They are asylum seekers that now have the little green pad of a recurring 'I'll stay forever' bridging visa.


The whole idea of this package of policies was as a disincentive package. We sympathise with the 14½-odd million people who seek a migration outcome or a movement outcome on this globe; of course we do. But we have also decided that we would like to have them move in an orderly way. We have a list of people who are priorities set by the UNHCR, primarily from the Horn of Africa. These people are in the most horrendous circumstances. We do not want people to get on boats, so we must create and stick by a significant disincentive package. So how can it possibly be a disincentive when we muck about with this by saying, 'We don't want to offend people—we have to keep the Greens happy, and there are a couple of people in this electorate we want to keep happy—so what we'll do is talk about a new bridging visa which does absolutely nothing as a disincentive'? What is the acid test? What do they think about that? They have come in droves—7,000 people in three months, which is just unthinkable. When we were in government, we would have just given the game away, and it seems that that is exactly what this government has done. All it does is spend money on more accommodation, borrowing more money to set more people up—because we have no chance of stopping them. 


So all we have done is give up. We are not even investing our hard-earned dollars; the government has broken the economy's back to the extent that we borrow everything we spend. So all its investment simply goes into dealing with its lack of grunt and its lack of capacity to make a disincentive package; to stick with that disincentive package; to ensure that people do not get on the vessels; to assist those people who are the most vulnerable and, according to the UNHCR, need to be provided with assistance as soon as possible; and to ensure that the family reunion processes associated with that are given absolute priority. That is what this government should be doing, and it has failed.

Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (15:19):  I rise also to contribute to the taking note debate about asylum seekers. As we all know, this is an issue that generates a highly charged political debate, and obviously it is something that those opposite continue to seek to make political mileage out of. It is time that those opposite realised that this is an ongoing challenge that many governments have faced, and they need to do away with the political point-scoring. It does not help. It does not help the issue, it does not help the Australian community and, in the end, it does not help the coalition. The people listening out there to what you have to say on this issue do not agree with you and are not listening to you. The Australian community want their political leaders to work together on this issue. We know that is what they want. They want us to work together and stop the political point-scoring.


To address the asylum seeker challenge, the federal Labor government are getting on with the job of trying to break the people-smuggling business model, because that is what needs to be done. The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Mr Chris Bowen, announced yesterday, on 21 November, that another group of 100 Sri Lankan men have been sent home. This is the ninth involuntary removal this month and the largest return to Colombo so far. This takes the number of Sri Lankans who have been returned involuntarily since 13 August this year to 426. When voluntary returns are included, a total of 525 have been returned home. The minister has also announced, as those opposite would be aware, that people who arrived by boat post 13 August and future arrivals will have the no-advantage principle applied to their cases onshore, even if they are not transferred offshore for regional processing.


I want to look back to earlier in the year when the political impasse over asylum seekers could not be broken and the parliament voted down measures to stop the tragedies at sea, so the government created the independent expert panel. This panel was set up to provide the government with a report on the best way forward for our nation to prevent asylum seekers risking their lives on dangerous boat journeys to Australia. This panel was made up of retired Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, Professor Michael L'Estrange and Mr Paris Aristotle. The Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers then released its report containing 22 recommendations on the policy options available to government. In presenting this report, Mr Houston said that the panel had proposed a way forward that it believed would address the challenges that Australia faced over the short, medium and longer term.


The panel's report highlighted that, from late 2001 to June of this year, 964 asylum seekers and crew had been lost at sea, with 604 of these people having lost their lives since October 2009. The report made a number of important points regarding regional cooperation and the regional cooperation framework. The Houston report highlighted that it is fundamentally important that we achieve a regional cooperation framework as a central focus. The report also outlined a number of elements that were required to achieve genuine regional cooperation, including domestic policies that enjoy broad based support and are sustainable over time.

"Smith, Sen Dean",LP,2012-11-22,"



Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia) (15:24):  I also rise to take note of answers to questions asked by Senator Cash. Senator Crossin's contribution to this debate was in part correct: the world has most definitely changed. We have moved from a border protection policy that was well managed and controlled under the Howard government to one that is poorly managed, ill-conceived and causing no end of disaster for our borders. Senator Moore likes to suggest that people do not agree with the coalition's attitudes. Nothing could be further from the truth. What the community wants is clear and decisive action in regards to border protection policies. They want border protection policies that work. They know what they want because they were able to see them under the previous, Howard government. These are not bridging visas; these are bandaid visas—a belated and botched attempt, creating yet another policy failure by this Labor government. 


You would not want to be a supporter of the Australian Labor Party this morning and wake up to read the attitudes of Australia's leading newspapers. Just to reflect on a few of them, under the headline of 'Flawed law won't stop boat people', the Daily Telegraph says:


The Labor government's policies toward asylum seekers were mistaken from the very first minute they were put in place, and they continue to be dogged by mistakes to this very day. 


The Age has 'Labor's descent into agony excruciating to see' and states:


It might have been less painful for Labor if the government had just embraced John Howard's hard asylum-seeker policy in one fell swoop. Instead it has been an excruciating crawl back to the Coalition days. Each change cuts into the souls of some in the ALP …


The Australian newspaper, under the headline of 'Demise of Pacific non-solution', said:


Five years of backflips, bad judgment, half-baked proposals and piecemeal border protection steps culminated yesterday in Immigration Minister Chris Bowen running up the white flag on Labor's half-hearted Pacific solution.


Dennis Shanahan's comments in the Australianon the subject were headlined, 'Admit it, the model has been broken'.


Trying to choose the most outrageous of this Labor government's failures is an almost impossible task, there are so many examples of bungles, backflips, waste mismanagement and maladministration. Each one would have proven a major embarrassment for any other government, including previous Labor governments. However, for the Rudd-Gillard government it is par for the course. Perhaps nothing better demonstrates the incompetence of this government than its utter failure to manage Australia's borders. I would just like to put it in some perspective, similar to my colleagues Senator Scullion and Senator Cash but taking a more local and more Western Australian flavour. 


As senators would know, I take a very keen interest in the Great Southern region of Western Australia. The largest town in the Great Southern is the City of Albany, which is where I have a regional electorate office. According to the latest statistics from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the population of Albany is 26,644 people, almost 30,000. Under the Rudd-Gillard Labor government, over 30,000 people have arrived in Australia by boat. It is worth reflecting on the fact that it took 186 years for the City of Albany to get to almost 30,000 people. It has taken but five years for this government to get to 30,000 illegal immigrants. A couple of weeks ago it was my pleasure to host the shadow minister for immigration, Scott Morrison, in Albany, where he held a very successful public forum to discuss some of these matters.


What a powerful demonstration of this government's ineptitude these numbers represent—more people having arrived on this government's watch than there are people currently living in Albany, the Great Southern region's largest population centre. In the five years this government has been in office, 30,000 people have arrived. Half that number, or 15,000, have arrived this year alone. We now have an average of 2,000 people per month arriving in Australia by boat. The Prime Minister said 10 years ago, when she was immigration spokesman for Labor under Simon Crean, 'Another boat, another policy failure.' I am not given to agreeing too regularly with what the Prime Minister has to say, but on that score she is absolutely correct. 


Quite apart from the cost in human misery, there is the financial cost. The cost blow-outs from Labor's border protection failures now top $6.6 billion. This year alone, since the budget was announced in May—the same month I came to this place—the blow-out has been $1.7 billion, but there is nothing temporary about it. If 30,000 people have turned up under this government, 15,000 of them this year— (Time expired)

Commonwealth Government response to Environment and Communications References Committee report


The capacity of communication networks and emergency warning systems to deal with emergencies and natural disasters


November 2012




INTRODUCTION



The Senate Environment and Communications References Committee tabled its report, The capacity of communication networks and emergency warning systems to deal with emergencies and natural disasters on 23 November 2011. The report contains six recommendations. The Commonwealth Government response to each of the recommendations made by the Senate References Committee, are provided below.


While the Commonwealth has a national coordination role, primary responsibility for the protection of life, property and the environment rests with the states and territories, who are the first responders to emergencies in their jurisdictions. Therefore, state and territory emergency management agencies have full autonomy in relation to: (i) whether and when to issue an emergency warning, (ii) which delivery mechanisms to use to disseminate the emergency warning, and (iii) the content of the warning. Individual states and territories choose which warning technologies to adopt and when to activate them in accordance with the specific circumstances of an incident.


All states and territories have disaster or emergency plans that include a communications component for the dissemination of rapid onset emergency warnings to the community. At the Commonwealth level, the Bureau of Meteorology (the Bureau) issues warnings and watch notices via the broadcast media, HF Radio and Fax, recorded telephone and the internet, directly to the public for weather warnings (such as severe thunderstorm, high sea, flood and tropical cyclone warnings) and, in conjunction with Geoscience Australia, also issues tsunami warnings. Warnings issued by these agencies also inform the warning messages that state and territory control agencies disseminate to the public.


The states and territories are also responsible for the communications systems within their jurisdiction. The Commonwealth’s role is to support public safety operations by, inter alia, making adequate provision of spectrum for use by agencies involved in the defence or national security of Australia, law enforcement, or the provision of emergency services, including for use by other public or community services.




RESPONSE TO RECOMMENDATIONS





Recommendation 1





2.11


The committee recommends that interoperability of narrowband voice radiocommunications between federal, state and territory emergency service organisations is achieved as soon as practicable and that all services attending major incidents be compelled to maintain a common emergency communications platform to ensure seamless real time communication from and to the Incident Controller.




Commonwealth Position: Supported


The Government supports this recommendation, noting all jurisdictions are moving towards mobile radio networks that support real time and seamless communications.


The Attorney-General’s Department (AGD) through its membership on the National Coordinating Committee for Government Radiocommunications (NCCGR) is working with the states and territories to achieve improved narrowband voice communications interoperability within the indicative time frame set out in the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) endorsed framework. This work includes achieving consensus amongst all jurisdictions on technologies and Standard Operating Protocols that will assist with moving towards fully interoperable radio networks and operating procedures. The Government understands that the COAG endorsed framework does not prescribe a single technology for jurisdictions (and agencies within them); rather that each jurisdiction as part of their current and future procurement cycles considers technologies that will enable voice communications interoperability with other Emergency Service Organisations (ESOs) throughout Australia. Accordingly, relevant Commonwealth agencies are in the process of planning to transition their voice communications to systems that will be interoperable with state and territory ESOs operating within spectrum harmonised for government use in the 400 MHz band.




Recommendation 2





2.50


The committee recommends the Commonwealth Government allocate sufficient spectrum for dedicated broadband public protection and disaster relief (PPDR) radiocommunications in Australia. 





2.51


The committee further recommends that any allocation of broadband spectrum to emergency service organisations (ESOs) for PPDR must be provided on the basis of interoperability amongst Australian ESOs and with ESO counterparts overseas.




Commonwealth Position: Noted


The Radiocommunications Act 1992 states that the object of the Act is to provide for management of the radiofrequency spectrum in order to:


(a) maximise, by ensuring the efficient allocation and use of the spectrum, the overall public benefit derived from using the radiofrequency spectrum;


(b) make adequate provision of the spectrum:


   (i) for use by agencies involved in the defence or national security of Australia, law enforcement or the provision of emergency services; and


   (ii) for use by other public or community services;


(c) provide a responsive and flexible approach to meeting the needs of users of the spectrum;


(d) encourage the use of efficient radiocommunication technologies so that a wide range of services of an adequate quality can be provided;


(e) provide an efficient, equitable and transparent system of charging for the use of spectrum, taking account of the value of both commercial and non-commercial use of spectrum;


(f) support the communications policy objectives of the Commonwealth Government;


(g) provide a regulatory environment that maximises opportunities for the Australian communications industry in domestic and international markets;


(h) promote Australia’s interests concerning international agreements, treaties and conventions relating to radiocommunications or the radiofrequency spectrum.


The then Commonwealth Attorney-General, the Hon Robert McClelland MP, and the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Senator the Hon Stephen Conroy, 


co-chaired a roundtable meeting on 10 May 2011 on the matter of public safety mobile broadband. The key outcome of that meeting was the establishment of a multijurisdictional high-level officials’ Public Safety Mobile Broadband Steering Committee to progress this work, led nationally by the Commonwealth Attorney-General’s Department and the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy.


Membership of the Committee includes representatives of the following key national stakeholder groups, committees and agencies:


the COAG Senior Officials Group


the National Policing Senior Officers Group


the National Counter-Terrorism Committee


the Australia New Zealand Police Advisory Agency


the Australasian Fire and Emergency Service Authorities Council


the Council of Ambulance Authorities


the National Coordinating Committee for Government Radiocommunications


the Law Enforcement and Security Radio Spectrum Committee, and


the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA).


The Committee has analysed public safety mobile communications needs, developed models to meet those needs and collected information to assist the ACMA in its determination of spectrum requirements.


The Commonwealth has worked with the states and territories to develop a national implementation plan for a nationally interoperable public safety mobile broadband capability. In parallel with this activity, the Commonwealth has considered whether radio spectrum should be allocated and, if so, what the quantum of a possible allocation would be.


The Commonwealth announced on 29 October 2012 that it would make provision for 10 MHz from the 800 MHz band for the specific purpose of realising a dedicated, nationally interoperable public safety mobile broadband cellular 4G data capability. 


The offer of the spectrum to the states and territories will be at a Public Interest Price and is conditional on factors including:


the capability being nationally interoperable


the states and territories funding all costs associated with designing, building, equipping, maintaining and operating the capability, and 


an agreement to provide reasonable access to state and territory networks by relevant Commonwealth agencies.


In terms of interoperability with counterparts overseas, this will be guided by the domestic approaches that those countries take as well as future outcomes of key fora such as regional radio harmonisation in region 3 (the Asia-Pacific region in which Australia sits). 




Recommendation 3





3.63


The committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government together with national, state and territory emergency service organisations and radio and television broadcasters, develop a secure database of up-to-date contact details for key personnel to be used during an emergency.




Commonwealth Position: Noted


The Commonwealth, state and territory agencies and the ESOs all have media services and dedicated databases in place that perform this role.


The Australian Government will work with the states and territories, through the Australia-New Zealand Emergency Management Committee (ANZEMC) (formerly the National Emergency Management Committee), to effectively coordinate the maintenance of appropriate contact details in both emergency service and media organisations for use during an emergency.




Recommendation 4





3.69


The committee recommends the Commonwealth Government require guaranteed access to emergency call services for people with a disability at all times.




Commonwealth Position: Noted 


The Government is a member of the National Forum on Emergency Warnings to the Community which has recently completed drafting the document, ‘Inclusive Communications Guidelines for Emergency Managers’. These guidelines, when finalised, will be used as a tool to help emergency managers understand the requirements to assist people with disabilities during emergencies. They are intended to be used in conjunction with each state and territory’s own policies and procedures.


The Government is aware that people who are deaf, hearing and/or speech impaired often have limited access to emergency services outside of the home as a result of not being able to access a teletypewriter to call the National Relay Service (NRS) dedicated emergency number 106. In response to this need, the Government included mobile access to text-based emergency services for people who are deaf, hearing impaired and/or speech impaired in the new NRS tender. On 15 August, the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency (TUSMA) issued a request for tender to identify and select a company(s) to provide the NRS for the next five years. The tender has now closed and a public announcement is expected in early 2013. 


On 12-13 January 2011, the NRS experienced interruption for nearly 24 hours as a result of severe flooding in Brisbane where the NRS call centre is based. However, it should be noted that this interruption did not affect access to the 106 emergency number. Since that time, the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) has been working with the NRS service provider, Australian Communication Exchange (ACE), on lessons learnt and opportunities to better mitigate disruptions in the event of similar emergency situations. This has resulted in a number of new initiatives, including new redundancy strategies and software improvements, to better prioritise certain types of calls. 




Recommendation 5 





3.81


The committee recommends emergency service organisations in collaboration with television and radio broadcasters, the print media and other relevant organisations, use regular and ongoing public education well in advance of an emergency situation as an opportunity to teach the public about their responsibilities during an emergency and how they can appropriately prepare themselves for such an event.




Commonwealth Position: Noted


The Commonwealth notes this recommendation is directed at emergency service organisations, radio broadcasters, the print media and other relevant organisations. However, in a broader context, the Commonwealth and all state and territory governments are implementing the COAG National Strategy for Disaster Resilience 2011 (the Strategy). 


The Strategy focuses on building disaster resilient communities across Australia, including educating people about risks and that disaster resilience is a shared responsibility. Aligned to this Strategy, the Commonwealth delivers education programs including:


School education resources and teaching aids including: the online ‘Dingo Creek’ interactive disaster preparedness and recovery game and related teaching material, the online ‘Digital Stories’ series where students who have been involved in disasters record their stories, recently released ‘DisasterMapper’, an online and Google Map based product to allow students to investigate disasters relevant to them or to their studies, and soon to be released ‘Before the Storm’ phone application (app), a teaching resource aimed at improving preparedness


Ensuring disaster resilience is considered in the current national curriculum review for Australia 


Producing source materials for vulnerable communities including those of a non-English speaking background, such as the recent Pictorial Storyboards, and


Providing all these materials, together with a range of publication and brochure prototypes, available online at the national emergency website www.em.gov.au.


The recently released DisasterWatch phone app provides access to emergency and disaster information in a mobile device format derived from authoritative sources in the states and territories and agencies. The app also provides public educational information, such as how to prepare for various hazard events. More than 11,000 downloads of the app have occurred since its launch in December 2011.




Recommendation 6 





4.33


The committee recommends the government consider granting public broadcasters priority access to fuel during times of emergency for the purpose of broadcasting emergency warnings and information, and in a way that does not impede the ability of emergency service organisations to access fuel.




Commonwealth Position: Noted


Australia’s state and territory governments have constitutional responsibility for planning and coordinating the response to fuel shortages within their territorial boundaries and have appropriate legislation and associated response plans in place to manage such emergencies. 


Whilst every jurisdiction has legislation in place to address a liquid fuel supply emergency, not every emergency will trigger the use of that legislation. Many emergencies that include localised fuel distribution issues, but which do not include an overall fuel supply problem for the jurisdiction, are managed under general emergency response legislation rather than liquid fuel specific legislation. 


As such, during an emergency within a particular jurisdiction, determinations about access to fuels, including for public broadcasters, will be a decision for the relevant state or territory government. 


At a national level, the Liquid Fuel Emergency Act 1984 (LFE Act) grants the Commonwealth Minister for Resources and Energy the power, by legislative instrument, to identify a person or organisation as an essential user of fuel for the purpose of a national liquid fuel emergency. Declaration of a national liquid fuel emergency under the LFE Act remains a low probability event, as it would require a severe (i.e. prolonged and widespread) national shortage of fuel.

COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS





Recommendation 1



The committee recommends that the application of the exception in proposed APP 2.2(b) be clarified to make it clear that APP 2.1 does not apply where it is impracticable for the APP entity to deal with ‘individuals who have not identified themselves or used a pseudonym’.




Response:
 Accept



The Government notes the committee’s view that a clarification to the provision would be helpful to ensure that it is clear that Australian Privacy Principle (APP) 2.1 does not apply where it is impracticable for the APP entity to deal with individuals who are seeking to use a pseudonym.  The Government will develop appropriate amendments to the Privacy Amendment (Enhancing Privacy Protection) Bill 2012 (the Bill).




Recommendation 2



The committee recommends that to avoid confusion, the subheading to proposed APP 7.1 in item 104 of Schedule 1 of the Bill be amended to read 'Use or disclosure' or 'Direct marketing', rather than 'Prohibition on direct marketing'.




Response:  Accept



The Government acknowledges that amending the subheading of this section may be helpful in more accurately reflecting the substance of the provisions.  The Government will develop appropriate amendments to the Bill.  




Recommendation 3



The committee recommends that proposed APP 7.2 and APP 7.6 in item 104 of Schedule 1 of the Bill be amended to ensure consistency with the notification requirement in APP 7.3, and enable individuals the opportunity to opt out of direct marketing communications at any time.




Response:  Accept in principle



The Government agrees that consumers should be able to opt out of direct marketing involving the use or disclosure of their personal information at any time.  That is the practical effect of APPs 7.2, 7.3 and 7.6 although the point at which they are made aware of the opt-out requirements may differ depending on the relationship between the direct marketer and the consumer. 


The Government notes that companies engaged in direct marketing under APP 7.3 will be required to give notice about an opt out mechanism in each direct marketing communication and should consider adopting this approach as good privacy practice.  However, given the different forms and contextual nature of online direct marketing, and the likely future developments in this area, the Government’s preferred approach would be for additional practical level details to be covered by guidance issued by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC).  In that respect, the Government notes that it has already accepted an Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) recommendation that the OAIC develop and publish detailed guidance about the new direct marketing principle (see rec 26-7), including some key aspects of proposed APP 7.2 and 7.6.




Recommendation 4



The committee recommends that proposed APP 8.2(b) in item 104 of Schedule 1 of the Bill be amended to require an entity to inform an individual of the practical effect and potential consequences of any informed consent by the individual to APP 8.1 not applying to the disclosure of the individual's personal information to an 'overseas recipient'.




Response:  Accept in principle



The Government notes that the provision already requires that information be provided to the individual about the effect of providing consent in these circumstances.  The Government considers any further guidance on meeting this requirement would be best placed in guidance material issued by the OAIC.  OAIC Guidelines could provide advice on the information to be given to the consumer so that they are clear that the consequences of providing consent in such circumstances are that the entity will no longer be responsible for the protection of their personal information by the overseas recipient, and what, if any, additional information should be provided where it is possible and practicable for the entity to know of other practical effects or potential consequences.




Recommendation 5



The committee recommends that the Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill be revised to clearly explain that an entity will be required to inform an individual of the practical effect and potential consequences of any informed consent by the individual to APP 8.1 not applying to the disclosure of the individual's personal information to an 'overseas recipient'.




Response:  Accept in principle



Consistent with the Government’s response to recommendation 4, the Government will develop appropriate amendments to the Explanatory Memorandum.




Recommendation 6



The committee recommends that the Attorney-General's Department revise and reissue the Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill to clearly explain the enforcement-related functions and activities of the Department of Immigration and Citizenship, as justification for the classification of the 'Immigration Department' as an 'enforcement body' in item 17 of Schedule 1 of the Bill.




Response:  Accept



The Government will develop appropriate amendments to the Explanatory Memorandum.




Recommendation 7



The committee recommends that the Attorney-General's Department revise and reissue the Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill to clearly explain the scope and intended application of the terms 'surveillance activities', 'intelligence gathering activities', and 'monitoring activities' in item 20 of Schedule 1 of the Bill.




Response:  Accept



The Government will develop appropriate amendments to the Explanatory Memorandum.




Recommendation 8



The committee recommends that the provisions contained in item 82 of Schedule 1 of the Bill and for each Australian Privacy Principle which contains a 'permitted general situation' or 'permitted health situation' exception, a note should be added at the end of the relevant principle to cross-reference proposed new section 16A of the Privacy Act 1988 and/or proposed new section 16B of the Privacy Act 1988, as appropriate.




Response:  Accept



The Government notes the committee’s views that the legislation could be more ‘user-friendly’ and that a cross-reference located in some of the APPs to the exceptions in clauses 16A and 16B may be appropriate.  The Government will develop appropriate amendments to the Bill.




Recommendation 9



The committee recommends that the Attorney-General's Department revise and reissue the Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill to explain the intended scope and application of the 'diplomatic or consular functions or activities' exception set out in item 6 in the table to proposed new subsection 16A(1) of the Privacy Act in item 82 of Schedule 1 of the Bill.




Response:  Accept



The Government will develop appropriate amendments to the Explanatory Memorandum.




Recommendation 10



The committee recommends that proposed new subsection 6Q(1) in item 69 of Schedule 2 of the Bill be amended to require an appropriate amount of time, such as 14 days, to have elapsed from the date of a written notice before a default listing can occur.




Response:  Accept



The Government accepts the recommendation and will insert a requirement that at least 14 days must elapse from the date of the written notice before default information can be disclosed to a credit reporting body.




Recommendation 11



The committee recommends that the written notification in proposed new subsection 6Q(1) in item 69 of Schedule 2 of the Bill be amended to include a warning about the potential for a default listing by a 'credit provider' in the event that an overdue amount is not paid within a set period of time.




Response:  Accept in principle



The Government agrees that further information should be provided to consumers about the consequences of failure to pay.  However, the Government considers that the Credit Reporting Code of Conduct (CR code) is the most appropriate place to set out requirements on the information to be provided to consumers in the written notice required under 6Q(1).  This will ensure that the written notice provides comprehensive advice on what matters must be included, for example additional information about credit reporting and how to obtain a credit report.




Recommendation 12



The committee recommends that proposed new subparagraph 6Q(1)(d)(i) in item 69 of Schedule 2 of the Bill be amended to reflect $300, or such higher amount as the Australian Government considers appropriate, as the minimum amount for which a consumer credit default listing can be made.




Response:  Accept in principle



The Government agrees that the minimum amount for a default should be reasonable.  The Government recognises that there are strong arguments proposed both for and against changing the current amount of $100.  A regulation-making power is included in paragraph (d) of the definition to provide flexibility to vary the minimum amount to a higher level.  The Government considers that economic modelling of the impact of changing the minimum amount for the listing of a default to $300 is necessary.  The Government will consult with stakeholders on this issue in the development of the Privacy Regulations.




Recommendation 13



The committee recommends that the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner, in formulating guidelines under proposed new section 26V in item 29 of Schedule 3 of the Bill, include as a criterion the timeframe within which an individual's 'default information' can be listed by a 'credit provider'.




Response:  Accept



The Government agrees that there would be benefit in providing further guidance around the timing of listing default information in the CR Code, and encourages the OAIC, in formulating guidelines under proposed new section 26V as to what should be included in the CR Code, to include as a criterion the timeframe within which an individual’s ‘default information’ can be listed by a ‘credit provider’.  This will ensure guidance around the issue of reasonable timeframes within which a listing should be made is considered as part of the CR Code drafting process.




Recommendation 14



The committee recommends that the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner, in formulating guidelines under proposed new section 26V in item 29 of Schedule 3 of the Bill, include a requirement for credit providers to fully consider an application for financial difficulty assistance under the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009 before an individual's 'default information' can be listed.




Response:  Accept



The Government agrees that there would be benefit in providing guidance in the CR Code around the consideration of applications for financial difficulty assistance before listing default information.  The Government notes that this will only be relevant where a person has applied for hardship assistance prior to default.




Recommendation 15



The committee recommends that the Australian Government consider prohibiting the re-identification of 'credit reporting information' which has been de-identified for research purposes in accordance with proposed new subsection 20M(2) in item 72 of Schedule 2 of the Bill, and whether a proportionate civil penalty should apply to any breach of that prohibition.




Response:  Accept in principle



The Government agrees that the risk of re-identification of previously de-identified personal information is an important issue.  However, the Government considers that further evidence on the nature and scope of the risk of re-identification is necessary.  The Government notes that the Commissioner will issue rules relating to the use of de-identified information for research purposes.  The Government will review the situation 12 months after the Commissioner issues rules to determine whether additional measures dealing with the risk of re-identification are necessary.


The Government is aware of concerns expressed to the Committee that the provision may prohibit research currently conducted on credit issues in the community.  In order to ensure that such research is permitted to continue, the Government will amend clause 20M to provide that research must be in relation to ‘credit’, rather than the narrower concept of the ‘credit worthiness of individuals’.




Recommendation 16



The committee recommends that proposed new sections 20T and 21V in item 72 of Schedule 2 of the Bill be amended to:


create an obligation for the recipient of a request to take reasonable steps to have the information corrected by the entity which holds the disputed information


create an obligation for the entity which holds the disputed information to correct the information within 30 days, if satisfied that the information is inaccurate, out-of-date, incomplete, irrelevant or misleading, and


create an obligation for the recipient of a request to notify the individual about the outcome of their request if that request has been determined by another entity which holds the disputed information.




Response:  Accept in principle



The Government accepts that all entities that hold information should correct it if found to be incorrect.  This was the Government’s clear intention in drafting the correction obligations, including the notification requirements.  The general quality obligation in 20S and 21U would operate to require the entity holding the disputed information to make the correction.  However, the Government considers that the clarification recommended by the Committee would be useful, and that this kind of detail would be best placed in the CR Code. 




Recommendation 17



The committee recommends that the regulations made pursuant to section 100 of the Privacy Act 1988 provide a mechanism for 'credit reporting bodies' and 'credit providers' who have received a request for the correction of an individual's personal information to note on the individual's credit file that a correction is under investigation, with the notation to be removed upon completion of that investigation.




Response:  Accept in principle



The Government considers this to be an operational matter best dealt with in the CR Code.  The matter could also be dealt with as part of education processes to inform individuals about exercising rights already available to obtain credit reports and request corrections.  The Government considers that it is important that the suggested notation requirements do not add lengthy procedural steps which extend the length of time required, and add costs to, a process that is intended to be simple and user friendly.   




Recommendation 18



The committee recommends that the Bill be amended to enable a 'credit reporting body' or 'credit provider' to correct an individual's personal information in exceptional circumstances, such as in the case of natural disasters, bank error, fraud, medical incapacity, and mail theft.




Response:  Accept in principle



The Government agrees that certain exceptional circumstances should be considered by credit providers and credit reporting bodies when listing defaults or considering whether to correct information on an individual’s file.  The Government considers that guidance relating to the consideration of exceptional circumstances could be dealt with in the CR Code.  The Government considers it a matter for stakeholders to determine the kinds of exceptional circumstances that should be addressed and the way in which these matters should be addressed.  As well as this, consumer education initiatives surrounding the Bill should make individuals aware of existing rights in relation to hardship variations, and any other National Consumer Credit Protection (NCCP) Act issues.




Recommendation 19



The committee recommends that the commencement date for the Bill remain at nine months after the Bill receives Royal Assent in order to provide certainty for all relevant stakeholders.




Response:  Accept in principle



The Government agrees that a defined commencement date is necessary to provide certainty to stakeholders.  However, recognising work to be completed prior to commencement, the Government considers that a period of 15 months is necessary to provide sufficient time for all necessary elements to be in place for an effective transition to the new privacy and credit reporting systems.




Recommendation 20



The committee recommends that before the Bill's commencement date, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner – in consultation with the Attorney-General's Department, as appropriate – develop and publish material informing consumers of the key changes to privacy legislation as proposed by the Bill, and providing guidance to Commonwealth agencies and private sector organisations to ensure compliance with the new legislative requirements.




Response:  Accept



The Government agrees that consumer education surrounding the changes to be made by the Bill is important and supports the OAIC’s plans to produce relevant guidance material.




Recommendation 21



The committee recommends that subject to the preceding recommendations, the Senate pass the Bill.

Commonwealth Government response to Environment and Communications References Committee report


The capacity of communication networks and emergency warning systems to deal with emergencies and natural disasters


November 2012




INTRODUCTION



The Senate Environment and Communications References Committee tabled its report, The capacity of communication networks and emergency warning systems to deal with emergencies and natural disasters on 23 November 2011. The report contains six recommendations. The Commonwealth Government response to each of the recommendations made by the Senate References Committee, are provided below.


While the Commonwealth has a national coordination role, primary responsibility for the protection of life, property and the environment rests with the states and territories, who are the first responders to emergencies in their jurisdictions. Therefore, state and territory emergency management agencies have full autonomy in relation to: (i) whether and when to issue an emergency warning, (ii) which delivery mechanisms to use to disseminate the emergency warning, and (iii) the content of the warning. Individual states and territories choose which warning technologies to adopt and when to activate them in accordance with the specific circumstances of an incident.


All states and territories have disaster or emergency plans that include a communications component for the dissemination of rapid onset emergency warnings to the community. At the Commonwealth level, the Bureau of Meteorology (the Bureau) issues warnings and watch notices via the broadcast media, HF Radio and Fax, recorded telephone and the internet, directly to the public for weather warnings (such as severe thunderstorm, high sea, flood and tropical cyclone warnings) and, in conjunction with Geoscience Australia, also issues tsunami warnings. Warnings issued by these agencies also inform the warning messages that state and territory control agencies disseminate to the public.


The states and territories are also responsible for the communications systems within their jurisdiction. The Commonwealth’s role is to support public safety operations by, inter alia, making adequate provision of spectrum for use by agencies involved in the defence or national security of Australia, law enforcement, or the provision of emergency services, including for use by other public or community services.




RESPONSE TO RECOMMENDATIONS





Recommendation 1





2.11


The committee recommends that interoperability of narrowband voice radiocommunications between federal, state and territory emergency service organisations is achieved as soon as practicable and that all services attending major incidents be compelled to maintain a common emergency communications platform to ensure seamless real time communication from and to the Incident Controller.




Commonwealth Position: Supported


The Government supports this recommendation, noting all jurisdictions are moving towards mobile radio networks that support real time and seamless communications.


The Attorney-General’s Department (AGD) through its membership on the National Coordinating Committee for Government Radiocommunications (NCCGR) is working with the states and territories to achieve improved narrowband voice communications interoperability within the indicative time frame set out in the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) endorsed framework. This work includes achieving consensus amongst all jurisdictions on technologies and Standard Operating Protocols that will assist with moving towards fully interoperable radio networks and operating procedures. The Government understands that the COAG endorsed framework does not prescribe a single technology for jurisdictions (and agencies within them); rather that each jurisdiction as part of their current and future procurement cycles considers technologies that will enable voice communications interoperability with other Emergency Service Organisations (ESOs) throughout Australia. Accordingly, relevant Commonwealth agencies are in the process of planning to transition their voice communications to systems that will be interoperable with state and territory ESOs operating within spectrum harmonised for government use in the 400 MHz band.




Recommendation 2





2.50


The committee recommends the Commonwealth Government allocate sufficient spectrum for dedicated broadband public protection and disaster relief (PPDR) radiocommunications in Australia. 





2.51


The committee further recommends that any allocation of broadband spectrum to emergency service organisations (ESOs) for PPDR must be provided on the basis of interoperability amongst Australian ESOs and with ESO counterparts overseas.




Commonwealth Position: Noted


The Radiocommunications Act 1992 states that the object of the Act is to provide for management of the radiofrequency spectrum in order to:


(a) maximise, by ensuring the efficient allocation and use of the spectrum, the overall public benefit derived from using the radiofrequency spectrum;


(b) make adequate provision of the spectrum:


   (i) for use by agencies involved in the defence or national security of Australia, law enforcement or the provision of emergency services; and


   (ii) for use by other public or community services;


(c) provide a responsive and flexible approach to meeting the needs of users of the spectrum;


(d) encourage the use of efficient radiocommunication technologies so that a wide range of services of an adequate quality can be provided;


(e) provide an efficient, equitable and transparent system of charging for the use of spectrum, taking account of the value of both commercial and non-commercial use of spectrum;


(f) support the communications policy objectives of the Commonwealth Government;


(g) provide a regulatory environment that maximises opportunities for the Australian communications industry in domestic and international markets;


(h) promote Australia’s interests concerning international agreements, treaties and conventions relating to radiocommunications or the radiofrequency spectrum.


The then Commonwealth Attorney-General, the Hon Robert McClelland MP, and the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Senator the Hon Stephen Conroy, 


co-chaired a roundtable meeting on 10 May 2011 on the matter of public safety mobile broadband. The key outcome of that meeting was the establishment of a multijurisdictional high-level officials’ Public Safety Mobile Broadband Steering Committee to progress this work, led nationally by the Commonwealth Attorney-General’s Department and the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy.


Membership of the Committee includes representatives of the following key national stakeholder groups, committees and agencies:


the COAG Senior Officials Group


the National Policing Senior Officers Group


the National Counter-Terrorism Committee


the Australia New Zealand Police Advisory Agency


the Australasian Fire and Emergency Service Authorities Council


the Council of Ambulance Authorities


the National Coordinating Committee for Government Radiocommunications


the Law Enforcement and Security Radio Spectrum Committee, and


the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA).


The Committee has analysed public safety mobile communications needs, developed models to meet those needs and collected information to assist the ACMA in its determination of spectrum requirements.


The Commonwealth has worked with the states and territories to develop a national implementation plan for a nationally interoperable public safety mobile broadband capability. In parallel with this activity, the Commonwealth has considered whether radio spectrum should be allocated and, if so, what the quantum of a possible allocation would be.


The Commonwealth announced on 29 October 2012 that it would make provision for 10 MHz from the 800 MHz band for the specific purpose of realising a dedicated, nationally interoperable public safety mobile broadband cellular 4G data capability. 


The offer of the spectrum to the states and territories will be at a Public Interest Price and is conditional on factors including:


the capability being nationally interoperable


the states and territories funding all costs associated with designing, building, equipping, maintaining and operating the capability, and 


an agreement to provide reasonable access to state and territory networks by relevant Commonwealth agencies.


In terms of interoperability with counterparts overseas, this will be guided by the domestic approaches that those countries take as well as future outcomes of key fora such as regional radio harmonisation in region 3 (the Asia-Pacific region in which Australia sits). 




Recommendation 3





3.63


The committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government together with national, state and territory emergency service organisations and radio and television broadcasters, develop a secure database of up-to-date contact details for key personnel to be used during an emergency.




Commonwealth Position: Noted


The Commonwealth, state and territory agencies and the ESOs all have media services and dedicated databases in place that perform this role.


The Australian Government will work with the states and territories, through the Australia-New Zealand Emergency Management Committee (ANZEMC) (formerly the National Emergency Management Committee), to effectively coordinate the maintenance of appropriate contact details in both emergency service and media organisations for use during an emergency.




Recommendation 4





3.69


The committee recommends the Commonwealth Government require guaranteed access to emergency call services for people with a disability at all times.




Commonwealth Position: Noted 


The Government is a member of the National Forum on Emergency Warnings to the Community which has recently completed drafting the document, ‘Inclusive Communications Guidelines for Emergency Managers’. These guidelines, when finalised, will be used as a tool to help emergency managers understand the requirements to assist people with disabilities during emergencies. They are intended to be used in conjunction with each state and territory’s own policies and procedures.


The Government is aware that people who are deaf, hearing and/or speech impaired often have limited access to emergency services outside of the home as a result of not being able to access a teletypewriter to call the National Relay Service (NRS) dedicated emergency number 106. In response to this need, the Government included mobile access to text-based emergency services for people who are deaf, hearing impaired and/or speech impaired in the new NRS tender. On 15 August, the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency (TUSMA) issued a request for tender to identify and select a company(s) to provide the NRS for the next five years. The tender has now closed and a public announcement is expected in early 2013. 


On 12-13 January 2011, the NRS experienced interruption for nearly 24 hours as a result of severe flooding in Brisbane where the NRS call centre is based. However, it should be noted that this interruption did not affect access to the 106 emergency number. Since that time, the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) has been working with the NRS service provider, Australian Communication Exchange (ACE), on lessons learnt and opportunities to better mitigate disruptions in the event of similar emergency situations. This has resulted in a number of new initiatives, including new redundancy strategies and software improvements, to better prioritise certain types of calls. 




Recommendation 5 





3.81


The committee recommends emergency service organisations in collaboration with television and radio broadcasters, the print media and other relevant organisations, use regular and ongoing public education well in advance of an emergency situation as an opportunity to teach the public about their responsibilities during an emergency and how they can appropriately prepare themselves for such an event.




Commonwealth Position: Noted


The Commonwealth notes this recommendation is directed at emergency service organisations, radio broadcasters, the print media and other relevant organisations. However, in a broader context, the Commonwealth and all state and territory governments are implementing the COAG National Strategy for Disaster Resilience 2011 (the Strategy). 


The Strategy focuses on building disaster resilient communities across Australia, including educating people about risks and that disaster resilience is a shared responsibility. Aligned to this Strategy, the Commonwealth delivers education programs including:


School education resources and teaching aids including: the online ‘Dingo Creek’ interactive disaster preparedness and recovery game and related teaching material, the online ‘Digital Stories’ series where students who have been involved in disasters record their stories, recently released ‘DisasterMapper’, an online and Google Map based product to allow students to investigate disasters relevant to them or to their studies, and soon to be released ‘Before the Storm’ phone application (app), a teaching resource aimed at improving preparedness


Ensuring disaster resilience is considered in the current national curriculum review for Australia 


Producing source materials for vulnerable communities including those of a non-English speaking background, such as the recent Pictorial Storyboards, and


Providing all these materials, together with a range of publication and brochure prototypes, available online at the national emergency website www.em.gov.au.


The recently released DisasterWatch phone app provides access to emergency and disaster information in a mobile device format derived from authoritative sources in the states and territories and agencies. The app also provides public educational information, such as how to prepare for various hazard events. More than 11,000 downloads of the app have occurred since its launch in December 2011.




Recommendation 6 





4.33


The committee recommends the government consider granting public broadcasters priority access to fuel during times of emergency for the purpose of broadcasting emergency warnings and information, and in a way that does not impede the ability of emergency service organisations to access fuel.




Commonwealth Position: Noted


Australia’s state and territory governments have constitutional responsibility for planning and coordinating the response to fuel shortages within their territorial boundaries and have appropriate legislation and associated response plans in place to manage such emergencies. 


Whilst every jurisdiction has legislation in place to address a liquid fuel supply emergency, not every emergency will trigger the use of that legislation. Many emergencies that include localised fuel distribution issues, but which do not include an overall fuel supply problem for the jurisdiction, are managed under general emergency response legislation rather than liquid fuel specific legislation. 


As such, during an emergency within a particular jurisdiction, determinations about access to fuels, including for public broadcasters, will be a decision for the relevant state or territory government. 


At a national level, the Liquid Fuel Emergency Act 1984 (LFE Act) grants the Commonwealth Minister for Resources and Energy the power, by legislative instrument, to identify a person or organisation as an essential user of fuel for the purpose of a national liquid fuel emergency. Declaration of a national liquid fuel emergency under the LFE Act remains a low probability event, as it would require a severe (i.e. prolonged and widespread) national shortage of fuel.

COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS





Recommendation 1



The committee recommends that the application of the exception in proposed APP 2.2(b) be clarified to make it clear that APP 2.1 does not apply where it is impracticable for the APP entity to deal with ‘individuals who have not identified themselves or used a pseudonym’.




Response:
 Accept



The Government notes the committee’s view that a clarification to the provision would be helpful to ensure that it is clear that Australian Privacy Principle (APP) 2.1 does not apply where it is impracticable for the APP entity to deal with individuals who are seeking to use a pseudonym.  The Government will develop appropriate amendments to the Privacy Amendment (Enhancing Privacy Protection) Bill 2012 (the Bill).




Recommendation 2



The committee recommends that to avoid confusion, the subheading to proposed APP 7.1 in item 104 of Schedule 1 of the Bill be amended to read 'Use or disclosure' or 'Direct marketing', rather than 'Prohibition on direct marketing'.




Response:  Accept



The Government acknowledges that amending the subheading of this section may be helpful in more accurately reflecting the substance of the provisions.  The Government will develop appropriate amendments to the Bill.  




Recommendation 3



The committee recommends that proposed APP 7.2 and APP 7.6 in item 104 of Schedule 1 of the Bill be amended to ensure consistency with the notification requirement in APP 7.3, and enable individuals the opportunity to opt out of direct marketing communications at any time.




Response:  Accept in principle



The Government agrees that consumers should be able to opt out of direct marketing involving the use or disclosure of their personal information at any time.  That is the practical effect of APPs 7.2, 7.3 and 7.6 although the point at which they are made aware of the opt-out requirements may differ depending on the relationship between the direct marketer and the consumer. 


The Government notes that companies engaged in direct marketing under APP 7.3 will be required to give notice about an opt out mechanism in each direct marketing communication and should consider adopting this approach as good privacy practice.  However, given the different forms and contextual nature of online direct marketing, and the likely future developments in this area, the Government’s preferred approach would be for additional practical level details to be covered by guidance issued by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC).  In that respect, the Government notes that it has already accepted an Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) recommendation that the OAIC develop and publish detailed guidance about the new direct marketing principle (see rec 26-7), including some key aspects of proposed APP 7.2 and 7.6.




Recommendation 4



The committee recommends that proposed APP 8.2(b) in item 104 of Schedule 1 of the Bill be amended to require an entity to inform an individual of the practical effect and potential consequences of any informed consent by the individual to APP 8.1 not applying to the disclosure of the individual's personal information to an 'overseas recipient'.




Response:  Accept in principle



The Government notes that the provision already requires that information be provided to the individual about the effect of providing consent in these circumstances.  The Government considers any further guidance on meeting this requirement would be best placed in guidance material issued by the OAIC.  OAIC Guidelines could provide advice on the information to be given to the consumer so that they are clear that the consequences of providing consent in such circumstances are that the entity will no longer be responsible for the protection of their personal information by the overseas recipient, and what, if any, additional information should be provided where it is possible and practicable for the entity to know of other practical effects or potential consequences.




Recommendation 5



The committee recommends that the Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill be revised to clearly explain that an entity will be required to inform an individual of the practical effect and potential consequences of any informed consent by the individual to APP 8.1 not applying to the disclosure of the individual's personal information to an 'overseas recipient'.




Response:  Accept in principle



Consistent with the Government’s response to recommendation 4, the Government will develop appropriate amendments to the Explanatory Memorandum.




Recommendation 6



The committee recommends that the Attorney-General's Department revise and reissue the Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill to clearly explain the enforcement-related functions and activities of the Department of Immigration and Citizenship, as justification for the classification of the 'Immigration Department' as an 'enforcement body' in item 17 of Schedule 1 of the Bill.




Response:  Accept



The Government will develop appropriate amendments to the Explanatory Memorandum.




Recommendation 7



The committee recommends that the Attorney-General's Department revise and reissue the Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill to clearly explain the scope and intended application of the terms 'surveillance activities', 'intelligence gathering activities', and 'monitoring activities' in item 20 of Schedule 1 of the Bill.




Response:  Accept



The Government will develop appropriate amendments to the Explanatory Memorandum.




Recommendation 8



The committee recommends that the provisions contained in item 82 of Schedule 1 of the Bill and for each Australian Privacy Principle which contains a 'permitted general situation' or 'permitted health situation' exception, a note should be added at the end of the relevant principle to cross-reference proposed new section 16A of the Privacy Act 1988 and/or proposed new section 16B of the Privacy Act 1988, as appropriate.




Response:  Accept



The Government notes the committee’s views that the legislation could be more ‘user-friendly’ and that a cross-reference located in some of the APPs to the exceptions in clauses 16A and 16B may be appropriate.  The Government will develop appropriate amendments to the Bill.




Recommendation 9



The committee recommends that the Attorney-General's Department revise and reissue the Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill to explain the intended scope and application of the 'diplomatic or consular functions or activities' exception set out in item 6 in the table to proposed new subsection 16A(1) of the Privacy Act in item 82 of Schedule 1 of the Bill.




Response:  Accept



The Government will develop appropriate amendments to the Explanatory Memorandum.




Recommendation 10



The committee recommends that proposed new subsection 6Q(1) in item 69 of Schedule 2 of the Bill be amended to require an appropriate amount of time, such as 14 days, to have elapsed from the date of a written notice before a default listing can occur.




Response:  Accept



The Government accepts the recommendation and will insert a requirement that at least 14 days must elapse from the date of the written notice before default information can be disclosed to a credit reporting body.




Recommendation 11



The committee recommends that the written notification in proposed new subsection 6Q(1) in item 69 of Schedule 2 of the Bill be amended to include a warning about the potential for a default listing by a 'credit provider' in the event that an overdue amount is not paid within a set period of time.




Response:  Accept in principle



The Government agrees that further information should be provided to consumers about the consequences of failure to pay.  However, the Government considers that the Credit Reporting Code of Conduct (CR code) is the most appropriate place to set out requirements on the information to be provided to consumers in the written notice required under 6Q(1).  This will ensure that the written notice provides comprehensive advice on what matters must be included, for example additional information about credit reporting and how to obtain a credit report.




Recommendation 12



The committee recommends that proposed new subparagraph 6Q(1)(d)(i) in item 69 of Schedule 2 of the Bill be amended to reflect $300, or such higher amount as the Australian Government considers appropriate, as the minimum amount for which a consumer credit default listing can be made.




Response:  Accept in principle



The Government agrees that the minimum amount for a default should be reasonable.  The Government recognises that there are strong arguments proposed both for and against changing the current amount of $100.  A regulation-making power is included in paragraph (d) of the definition to provide flexibility to vary the minimum amount to a higher level.  The Government considers that economic modelling of the impact of changing the minimum amount for the listing of a default to $300 is necessary.  The Government will consult with stakeholders on this issue in the development of the Privacy Regulations.




Recommendation 13



The committee recommends that the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner, in formulating guidelines under proposed new section 26V in item 29 of Schedule 3 of the Bill, include as a criterion the timeframe within which an individual's 'default information' can be listed by a 'credit provider'.




Response:  Accept



The Government agrees that there would be benefit in providing further guidance around the timing of listing default information in the CR Code, and encourages the OAIC, in formulating guidelines under proposed new section 26V as to what should be included in the CR Code, to include as a criterion the timeframe within which an individual’s ‘default information’ can be listed by a ‘credit provider’.  This will ensure guidance around the issue of reasonable timeframes within which a listing should be made is considered as part of the CR Code drafting process.




Recommendation 14



The committee recommends that the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner, in formulating guidelines under proposed new section 26V in item 29 of Schedule 3 of the Bill, include a requirement for credit providers to fully consider an application for financial difficulty assistance under the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009 before an individual's 'default information' can be listed.




Response:  Accept



The Government agrees that there would be benefit in providing guidance in the CR Code around the consideration of applications for financial difficulty assistance before listing default information.  The Government notes that this will only be relevant where a person has applied for hardship assistance prior to default.




Recommendation 15



The committee recommends that the Australian Government consider prohibiting the re-identification of 'credit reporting information' which has been de-identified for research purposes in accordance with proposed new subsection 20M(2) in item 72 of Schedule 2 of the Bill, and whether a proportionate civil penalty should apply to any breach of that prohibition.




Response:  Accept in principle



The Government agrees that the risk of re-identification of previously de-identified personal information is an important issue.  However, the Government considers that further evidence on the nature and scope of the risk of re-identification is necessary.  The Government notes that the Commissioner will issue rules relating to the use of de-identified information for research purposes.  The Government will review the situation 12 months after the Commissioner issues rules to determine whether additional measures dealing with the risk of re-identification are necessary.


The Government is aware of concerns expressed to the Committee that the provision may prohibit research currently conducted on credit issues in the community.  In order to ensure that such research is permitted to continue, the Government will amend clause 20M to provide that research must be in relation to ‘credit’, rather than the narrower concept of the ‘credit worthiness of individuals’.




Recommendation 16



The committee recommends that proposed new sections 20T and 21V in item 72 of Schedule 2 of the Bill be amended to:


create an obligation for the recipient of a request to take reasonable steps to have the information corrected by the entity which holds the disputed information


create an obligation for the entity which holds the disputed information to correct the information within 30 days, if satisfied that the information is inaccurate, out-of-date, incomplete, irrelevant or misleading, and


create an obligation for the recipient of a request to notify the individual about the outcome of their request if that request has been determined by another entity which holds the disputed information.




Response:  Accept in principle



The Government accepts that all entities that hold information should correct it if found to be incorrect.  This was the Government’s clear intention in drafting the correction obligations, including the notification requirements.  The general quality obligation in 20S and 21U would operate to require the entity holding the disputed information to make the correction.  However, the Government considers that the clarification recommended by the Committee would be useful, and that this kind of detail would be best placed in the CR Code. 




Recommendation 17



The committee recommends that the regulations made pursuant to section 100 of the Privacy Act 1988 provide a mechanism for 'credit reporting bodies' and 'credit providers' who have received a request for the correction of an individual's personal information to note on the individual's credit file that a correction is under investigation, with the notation to be removed upon completion of that investigation.




Response:  Accept in principle



The Government considers this to be an operational matter best dealt with in the CR Code.  The matter could also be dealt with as part of education processes to inform individuals about exercising rights already available to obtain credit reports and request corrections.  The Government considers that it is important that the suggested notation requirements do not add lengthy procedural steps which extend the length of time required, and add costs to, a process that is intended to be simple and user friendly.   




Recommendation 18



The committee recommends that the Bill be amended to enable a 'credit reporting body' or 'credit provider' to correct an individual's personal information in exceptional circumstances, such as in the case of natural disasters, bank error, fraud, medical incapacity, and mail theft.




Response:  Accept in principle



The Government agrees that certain exceptional circumstances should be considered by credit providers and credit reporting bodies when listing defaults or considering whether to correct information on an individual’s file.  The Government considers that guidance relating to the consideration of exceptional circumstances could be dealt with in the CR Code.  The Government considers it a matter for stakeholders to determine the kinds of exceptional circumstances that should be addressed and the way in which these matters should be addressed.  As well as this, consumer education initiatives surrounding the Bill should make individuals aware of existing rights in relation to hardship variations, and any other National Consumer Credit Protection (NCCP) Act issues.




Recommendation 19



The committee recommends that the commencement date for the Bill remain at nine months after the Bill receives Royal Assent in order to provide certainty for all relevant stakeholders.




Response:  Accept in principle



The Government agrees that a defined commencement date is necessary to provide certainty to stakeholders.  However, recognising work to be completed prior to commencement, the Government considers that a period of 15 months is necessary to provide sufficient time for all necessary elements to be in place for an effective transition to the new privacy and credit reporting systems.




Recommendation 20



The committee recommends that before the Bill's commencement date, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner – in consultation with the Attorney-General's Department, as appropriate – develop and publish material informing consumers of the key changes to privacy legislation as proposed by the Bill, and providing guidance to Commonwealth agencies and private sector organisations to ensure compliance with the new legislative requirements.




Response:  Accept



The Government agrees that consumer education surrounding the changes to be made by the Bill is important and supports the OAIC’s plans to produce relevant guidance material.




Recommendation 21



The committee recommends that subject to the preceding recommendations, the Senate pass the Bill.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:37):  At the request of Senator Fifield, I move:


That the Senate notes the challenges for good government posed by the culture of the Australian Labor Party and its special relationship with affiliated trade unions.


The subject matter of this motion raises issues of very grave concern to the Australian community. They are not matters that can be dismissed as being the ravings of hysterical people or, to use the phrase that the Prime Minister once used, of 'nut jobs on the internet'. The terms of the motion address the Senate to the challenges for good government posed by the culture of the Australian Labor Party and its special relationship with affiliated trade unions.


This parliament has since its inception in September 2010 been consumed with scandal after scandal arising from within the trade union movement and touching upon Australian Labor Party members of parliament arising from that culture. In the early part of the parliament, we heard a great deal about the member for Dobell, Mr Craig Thomson, and his conduct as an official of the Health Services Union. Time and again, time beyond number, the Prime Minister defended Mr Craig Thomson. Time and again the Prime Minister was asked whether she had full confidence in Mr Craig Thomson and she said repeatedly, 'I do have full confidence in the member for Dobell and I trust that he remains the member for Dobell for many, many, many years to come.' It was only earlier this year, after findings concerning the behaviour of Mr Craig Thomson, including findings—not allegations but findings—by an exhaustive inquiry by Fair Work Australia, were published that the Prime Minister was shamed into excluding Mr Craig Thomson from the Labor Party caucus. The point I seek to make is this: both the presence within the Labor Party caucus and the continued protection of such a person by the Labor Party leadership, including by the Prime Minister herself, was only possible because of the relationship that exists between the trade union movement and the Australian Labor Party.


When at last the Prime Minister was shamed into excluding Mr Craig Thomson from the Labor Party caucus and abandoning her protection of him, it was not as if anything new had been learned, because what the Fair Work Australia findings disclosed were the very allegations that the opposition had been making in the House of Representatives since the beginning of this parliament, and indeed which my colleague Senator Michael Ronaldson, initially, and my leader, Senator Eric Abetz, subsequently, had made in the previous parliament, in Senate estimates and in this chamber. So nothing new was learned. But at last, having sought to defend the indefensible for a period of years, the Prime Minister abandoned the member for Dobell.


We now know that Mr Thomson is a person of interest in a police investigation. In fact he is a person of interest in two police investigations—one initiated by the New South Wales Police Force and one initiated by the Victoria Police. Both of those police investigations were initiated after complaints made by me. When I made those complaints in August and September of last year, I was denounced for being on a witch-hunt. So fanciful was this 'witch-hunt' that already a man who was the Federal President of the Australian Labor Party, Mr Michael Williamson, has been arrested. Let me say that again: a man who was the Federal President of the Labor Party has been charged with serious crimes. So much for the assertions coming from those in the Australian Labor Party who are the protectors and guardians and custodians of its culture that the allegations I made, and others in the opposition made, were fanciful and without merit. We also know that Mr Craig Thomson continues to be, according to Detective Superintendent Dyson, who is in charge of the New South Wales Police investigation, a person of interest in that investigation. Where the investigation goes we will wait and see. We will abide the process. We will allow the process to take its course. But that process would not even have begun had the opposition, in the teeth of the most virulent criticism from the government, of both our motives and the substance of our concerns, not initiated it.


Unfortunately, the matter concerning Mr Craig Thomson is not the only matter of scandal with which this parliament has been concerned arising from the relationship between the Labor Party and the trade union movement and the culture which it promotes. I have many friends who are members of the Australian Labor Party, and all of us in this chamber, on a daily basis, deal professionally with Labor Party senators. I look across the chamber at the Labor Party senators I know—I see Senator Wong, Senator Bilyk, Senator Doug Cameron and Senator Brown—and I am sure they are all honest people. I am sure they are. I am sure those of my friends who are members of the Australian Labor Party are honest people, and I cannot bear to imagine how difficult it must be for them, as honest people, to be representing in parliament a political party of which they are undoubtedly proud but which is nevertheless home to a culture in which large sections of their party are controlled by people who are not honest, controlled by people like Mr Michael Williamson, who are accused of serious white-collar crime. It is not individual wrongdoing; it is a culture. It is a culture that allows such behaviour to occur, that nurtures it, in some cases encourages it and protects it, as Mr Craig Thomson was protected for years, including by the Prime Minister of Australia.


Turning to the Prime Minister of Australia, this parliament has increasingly this year been concerned with the scandal of the AWU and, in particular, the AWU Workplace Reform Association. When this story initially broke in the latter part of last year, as a result of the work of two intrepid journalist, Glenn Milne and Michael Smith, both of those journalists suffered serious professional consequences. Both of them were effectively dismissed from their news organisations by a pusillanimous management as a result of threats from the highest levels of government made to their news organisations. But I am pleased to say that that pusillanimity, that cowardice by the management of some of the largest news organisations in Australia, has not continued. And increasingly the Australian public are coming to realise that the Prime Minister does indeed have serious questions to answer in relation to her role in and knowledge of the activities of the AWU Workplace Reform Association.


In her press conference on 23 August this year the Prime Minister said that these allegations were only being made by 'misogynists and nut jobs on the internet'—to quote her elegant language. Well, there is no misogyny in saying of a politician, 'You have done the wrong thing'. There is no misogyny in saying of a politician, 'We are concerned about the probity of your conduct'. There is no misogyny in saying of a politician, 'We doubt your integrity'. There is no misogyny in saying, 'There are certain matters that remain to be explained and we ask you to explain them to the parliament'.


The people who are examining the matters alleged against Ms Gillard include arguably the most distinguished and highly awarded investigative reporter in Australia, Mr Hedley Thomas—twice the winner of the Walkley award. Mr Hedley Thomas has pursued this issue in a diligent and tenacious and professional way, not to be deterred by the claims 'There's nothing to see here'. When I was a young man living Queensland, I was involved in politics peripherally at the time of the Fitzgerald inquiry. I remember hearing the same excuse in the mid-1980s from National Party ministers who ended their careers in prison. 'There's nothing to see here.' It is the same argument that we hear from Labor ministers, including the Prime Minister, today that we heard from the other side of politics in Queensland in the 1980s: 'There's nothing to see here'.


These are serious allegations. They are allegations now being pursued, appropriately, by the two national newspapers: the Australian and the Australian Financial Review. These newspapers represent both of the great newspaper groups in Australia: the News Limited group and the Fairfax group. So much for nut jobs on the internet. Until the government comes to terms with the fact that these are serious allegations, reaching the highest levels of government, impeaching the personal probity and integrity of the Prime Minister herself, then the government is not doing itself justice and it is certainly not doing the Australian people justice.


Earlier today, in question time, I directed a question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Evans. I directed him to some remarks by Mr Bill Shorten—a former senior trade union official, well familiar with the affairs of the AWU, of course—on Lateline last night, when he said that it would be absolutely inappropriate to use members' money to fund or finance an internal trade union election and that to set up a slush fund to do so—because that is what he was asked about by Mr Tony Jones—would be quite wrong. Yet that is the very thing to which the Prime Minister herself admitted, in an interview conducted by the partners of Slater & Gordon with her on 11 September 1995, a redacted transcript of which was tabled by me in the Senate today.


Of course, in 1995 Ms Julia Gillard was not the Prime Minister. She was not even a member of parliament; she was a private citizen. She had a spot on the Victorian Labor Party Senate ticket, but she was a partner in the law firm Slater & Gordon. On 11 September 1995 an interview with Ms Gillard was conducted by Mr Peter Gordon, a senior partner of that firm, and Mr Geoff Shaw, the general manager of that firm. That interview was taped and it is the redacted transcript of that interview that I tabled today. 


Let me pause for a moment to say that it is a very unusual thing for a lawyer of a law firm, let alone a partner of a law firm, to be required to undergo a formal tape-recorded interview by the senior management of that firm. That would only ever happen if the senior management of that firm had serious concerns about wrongdoing by the lawyer concerned—in this case, Ms Julia Gillard. She was asked about her involvement in the establishment of the Australian Workers Union Workplace Reform Association. She admitted that she was responsible for the incorporation of that association in Western Australia. Then she said this:


… every union has what it refers to as a re-election fund, slush fund, whatever …


Lest it be thought that Ms Gillard was acting entirely on somebody else's behalf, she was asked by Peter Gordon:


PG: And to the extent that work was done on that file in relation to that, it was done by you?


JG: That's right.


PG: And did you get advice from anyone else in the firm in relation to any of those matters?


JG: No, I didn't.


Then we learnt that two pages immediately following that answer have been redacted. Astonishingly, we now learn that the file created at the time, containing all the contemporaneous documents relating to the incorporation of the Australian Workers Union Workplace Reform Association, has disappeared and cannot be located in the archives of the Western Australia Corporate Affairs Commission. We learn that the conveyancing file which contained the contemporaneous documents relating to the conveyance—which Ms Gillard admits that she was responsible for the conduct of—of a property in Melbourne alleged to have been bought with funds laundered through the AWU Workplace Relations Association has also gone missing and cannot be located. 


We also learnt, most recently, that the Federal Court files in two matters in the Sydney Registry of the Federal Court, both bearing the name Ludwig and Harrison, in which Mr Bill Ludwig, the President of the Australian Workers Union, sued various people to recover and track down the moneys that had been laundered through the Australian Workers Union Workplace Reform Association, had also gone missing. And I received as recently as yesterday a letter from the Registrar of the Federal Court telling me that, despite exhaustive searches in both the Sydney and Melbourne registries of the Federal Court, those files could not be found.


If the Prime Minister thinks that, by continuing with her stonewalling denials, she can maintain the fiction that there are no more questions to be answered by her about this matter, this scandal, then she is kidding herself. What she ought to do is what Mr Craig Thomson did and make a statement to the House of Representatives next week, fully and truthfully explaining her role in these events.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2012-11-22,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (15:58):  I come to this debate with some experience of the relationship between the trade union movement and the Australian Labor Party. I am finding it very difficult, after listening to Senator Brandis's contribution, to see exactly how his contribution went to the issue that is before the chair. Be that as it may, there have been some great lawyers and some outstanding parliamentarians in the Senate, and I have to say, after that performance, Senator Brandis, that you have a long way to go to be deemed a great lawyer. One of the great lawyers in this Senate was former Senator the Hon. Lionel Murphy, who went on to become a High Court judge, and he knew a bit about the law. Senator Murphy, back in 1972, had something to say about the role of the Attorney-General—and we have the shadow Attorney-General here, smearing and trying to set up a kangaroo court in the Senate against the current Prime Minister. This is what Senator Murphy said at that time, when he was talking about the conduct of Senator Greenwood. Senator Greenwood was trying to put legislation through this parliament that people should be tried on the basis of their known character. Luckily enough, the Senate had the knowledge and the wisdom not to put through that from the coalition. The then shadow Attorney-General, Senator Lionel Murphy, said:


The Attorney-General must rigidly exclude party politics. The Attorney-General—


And we have Senator Brandis, who wants to be the Attorney-General—


must act in the interests of all citizens…. One of his functions—


it was a bit sexist in those days—


is to determine whether proceedings should be instituted to protect a person facing a charge from prejudicial statements. It is part of the rule of law that persons should not be made the subject of prejudicial statements before their case is tried …


And we have seen plenty of prejudicial statements here from the would-be Attorney-General, Senator Brandis.


To suggest guilt is prejudicial …


You know that.


The publication of any matter indicating bad character on his part or otherwise disparaging an accused may be prejudicial …


It is not necessary to impute guilt. To disparage is enough.


And we have had nothing but disparagement from the coalition against the Prime Minister, who is not charged with any issue. It is about impugning her character and it is about going back to where they were in the late 1960s and early 1970s, where your known character, or what they believe is your character, should affect how the law is implemented.


We should never have Senator Brandis as an Attorney-General in this country if he is so devoid of understanding of the basic principles of the law. I am not a lawyer, but I can understand what Senator the Hon. Lionel Murphy was saying when he outlined these issues. It is not necessary to impute guilt. To disparage is enough. I ask the shadow Attorney-General to think about that. Think about what you are doing, as the would-be Attorney-General of this country, standing there disparaging the Prime Minister, without any evidence, without any basis of fact—




Senator Brandis:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Senator Cameron is reflecting on me. In taking the point of order, may I point out that it follows necessarily from what he is saying that no criticism of the probity of the conduct of any member of parliament by another member of parliament in the parliament would ever be allowed.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Ludlam
):

Senator Brandis, you know full well that that is a point of debate and not a point of order. Senator Cameron.




Senator CAMERON:
  I think that goes to the same position that Senator Brandis takes with his legal arguments—you know, misuse the processes of the Senate. It just shows again why Senator Brandis should actually go back and read what Lionel Murphy said in this place back in 1972.


I will leave that just for a minute, because I am not a lawyer. But it is actually nice being able to draw to the attention of the would-be Attorney-General of this country some of the basic principles of the law—some of the basic principles that are being trashed here. We have been through this time and again, and I would have thought someone who was standing up and foreshadowing that they wanted to be the Attorney-General of this country would have some basic understanding of the law and the principles that underpin the law.


I want to come to the proposition we have before us. It is about special relationships. No-one denies that there is a special relationship between the trade union movement and the Australian Labor Party. Why? Because the Australian Labor Party is a labour party—a party representing workers and labour in this country. It is the party that actually stood up for workers when Work Choices was foisted upon the community during the Howard government. We are a labour party. There is a special relationship. The relationship between the trade union movement and the Labor Party is a root-and-branch relationship. If we stood here every time one of the big business mates of the coalition ended up in court on an embezzlement charge, we would spend a lot of time of the Senate talking about special relationships between corrupt businessmen and the coalition. We would be doing a lot of that.


You talk about special relationships. Let's look at special relationships in the coalition. Look at the special relationships of the lobbyists, who are now becoming a huge force, working away under the surface of the Liberal Party—the lobbyists who have both offices within the Liberal Party and operate as lobbyists. Senator Brandis should know this well, because it has been a huge controversy in Queensland, where Campbell Newman has had to face accusations that lobbyists are getting special privileges in Queensland.


Just look at some of these lobbyists. If you want to talk about the Australian Financial Review and how good the Financial Review is, I would draw your attention, Senator Brandis, to Pamela Williams's two articles back on Friday, 2 November and Saturday, 3 November. She talks about a growing number of top business executives getting phone calls from Santo Santoro—




Senator Brandis:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I direct your attention to the terms of the question before the chair, which is: 'That the Senate notes the challenges for good government posed by the culture of the Australian Labor Party and its special relationship with affiliated trade unions'. I accept entirely that a degree of latitude is involved in applying the relevance test to this debate. I accept entirely that it is perfectly in order for a senator to make comparisons between his side of politics and his political opponents—but only in the context of the question before the chair. I respectfully submit that because this is a debate about the Labor Party and the trade unions, not about the Liberal Party, Senator Cameron has trespassed beyond what could be regarded as relevant.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Brandis, as you yourself observed, these debates do customarily range fairly widely. There is no point of order.




Senator CAMERON:
  Let us go back to the Australian Financial Review, which was quoted by Senator Brandis, and this issue of special relationships, because this debate is about special relationships. I am happy to have a discussion about the special relationships the coalition lobbyists, who have relationships with big business, have with the Liberal Party, and that is a legitimate issue here. Pamela Williams, who is a highly respected journalist, says:


It's the phone call a growing number of top business executives receive: Santo Santoro is on the line.


Santo Santoro, a former Liberal senator, is on the line. It goes on:


Santo is your man, they say, if you want something pushed in Queensland by a lobbyist …


But Santo Santoro is not just a lobbyist with rolled-gold cronies across Queensland's Liberal National Party. He is a political fund-raiser on a wider stage, too, personally backed by Opposition Leader Tony Abbott as a federal vice-president of the Liberal Party with the role of helping round up big-dollar donations for the party, ahead of the next federal election. … Which Santoro is it who lifts the phone? The political bagman for the federal Liberals, or the highly paid private lobbyist looking for a contract, who happens to be a party elder with the ear of Abbott and a speed dial in Queensland?


It says that Santoro's political lobbying business has almost tripled in size in one year, from 10 clients in July last year to 28 clients now. How has this happened? It has happened because there is a special relationship. There is a special relationship between Santo Santoro and the Liberal Party. Is there any doubt that this would be a special relationship of some note, taking up two articles in the Financial Review? Let us go to some of Santo Santoro's clients. If you see the list of clients, and then you listen to the coalition defending a number of businesses around this country, you will see that there is quite a connection between the clientele of Santo Santoro and the arguments put up here defending businesses' rights in this country.


And then we have other special relationships. We have the special relationship that Nationals Senator Barnaby Joyce and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Ms Julie Bishop, have with Gina Rinehart. An article in Crikey,whichrefers to an article in the Age, says:


… Nationals Senator Barnaby Joyce tapped the taxpayer for $2,000 last week to attend the lavish wedding of a granddaughter of an Indian billionaire engaged in delicate negotiations with iron ore matriarch Gina Rinehart to buy two of her Queensland assets.


So here we have a special relationship. We have Gina Rinehart actually flying out the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and Senator Barnaby Joyce to a wedding in India. I just do not understand this, but that is what happened. Gina Rinehart was in negotiations with one of these Indian billionaires to buy two of her properties. So what is being done, according to Crikey, is that she is getting added status. She says to Senator Joyce and to Ms Bishop: 'Jump in my jet. I'll fly you out to India, and you can stand by my side and I'll look pretty good. I've got these senior politicians on my side. It'll show how important I am.'


If ever there was ever a special relationship, that is it. And what did Senator Joyce say about this massive function he went to? He said he’d 'enjoyed a brief encounter with a Bollywood actor'. He didn't get any lessons! When you see Senator Joyce in action, you know the Bollywood actor didn't give him any tips. According to the article, he described the actor as 'India’s Brad Pitt' and said, 'I must admit it was absolutely mind-blowing.' So here we have Senator Joyce out at the big shindig in India, flown out by the billionaire—a special relationship, a fantastic relationship. I do not know what he was supposed to be doing. Why would you have two coalition politicians in your jet going to an Indian billionaire's wedding? But there they were. Senator Joyce said it was mind blowing. I do not think he has ever recovered from that mind-blowing experience; it is getting worse every week! But there you go. Why would he be at this billionaire's wedding? That is a special relationship, and we will just have to wait and see where that special relationship leads us.


Another person who had a 'special relationship' was former Senator Helen Coonan. Helen went off and left here and her seat was still warm when she became a director of Kerry Packer's Crown Ltd, on the payroll of Kerry Packer. That is fine; people can do that. But you cannot simply talk about special relationships without understanding—



Senator Brandis interjecting—




Senator CAMERON:
  You have to understand the special relationship of the coalition with all of these billionaires. You have to understand it. That is why they are in here defending the tobacco industry, the gambling industry and the healthcare industry. That is because there is a 'special relationship' between the coalition and big business. Make no mistake about it.


There are some weirder special relationships. Take Senator Mathias Cormann. What about his special relationships? Senator Cormann took a trip back in 2011 to the United States. It is on the public record. He said the purpose of the trip was to explore the United States's economic, fiscal and monetary policy and their approach to financial services and to deepen relationships in the US—it went on and on. What else did he say? He said: 'My visit to the US was an invaluable opportunity to develop contacts to draw on in the future.'


Let us see who he is drawing on. He is drawing on a mob called FreedomWorks. What are they about? They are major supporters of the Tea Party in America. That is why we see all this nonsense all the time from over the other side of the chamber. They went over at public expense to talk to all the loopy people from the Tea Party. Then they came back here and tried to behave every bit as loopily as the Tea Party in the United States. What else do FreedomWorks do? They sell high deductible insurance policies and tax-free medical savings plans to individuals at group discounts. So they are in the private health industry. They are really up to their necks in a whole range of things. One of their main funders is Philip Morris, the tobacco company. These are the types of people that Senator Cormann met over there.



Senator Brandis interjecting—



Senator Cormann interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Ludlam
):  Order, senators on my left! Senator Brandis was heard in silence through his contribution; Senator Cameron should be extended the same courtesy.




Senator CAMERON:
  FreedomWorks were also out there funding a campaign against legislation in the American House of Representatives to give rights to people who had contracted asbestos related disease— mesothelioma and that type of thing. These are the types of people that the coalition have a special relationship with. They went over there and talked to people who are trying to stop ordinary Americans getting any access to help, support and money to keep their families going after they have contracted asbestos. That is their approach.


They went to the Cato Foundation. They have a special relationship with the Cato Foundation. They have a special relationship with the Heartland Institute. They say they are a think tank. These are the climate sceptics in chief. They think that there is no global warming and no problem with the climate and it should all just be left alone. I think the Heartland Institute are crazy. I could go on. There is much more.


I have just come across this. I will keep this and I will come back some day and take you on another walk through the special relationships that the coalition have with big business, with the climate sceptics and with all the nutters in the Republican Party in the United States, and you will say, 'Why do we listen to these people?' Senator Brandis, go and read the biography of the former— (Time expired)

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales) (16:20):  Before I get into the substance of my contribution, I just want to share with the Senate that some senior shadows on the coalition side will be visiting China during the first week of December as guests of the Chinese Communist Party—they are Senator Brandis, Senator Johnston, Senator Scullion and Senator Bishop, along with Mr Morrison and Mr Truss. Just because they are visiting China does not make them communists, Senator Cameron. That is the fallacy in your argument. Indeed, I confess that I myself have visited Vietnam. I visited a number of people in Vietnam, but does that make me a communist? Absolutely not. Senator Cameron, would you describe me as a communist? I do not think so.


I will now move to a number of matters that address the motion before us. Before I do, I would like to pick up on some comments that Senator Bob Carr made today in answer to Senator Fifield. He stated that:


… there was not even an allegation in all those question times over 10 years—all those question times in the bearpit of the New South Wales parliament, regarded as the toughest in Australia.


Which rock are you under, Senator Carr? Did you not listen? Obviously you were not interested in listening to what I had to say yesterday as I reiterated allegation after allegation. Indeed, I only shared with the Senate a smattering of allegations in relation to what has happened in New South Wales. The issue here is for you to answer, Mr Carr. It goes to your very judgement. That is, it was under your watch that Eddie Obeid was made a minister in New South Wales. It was under your watch that people like Mr Macdonald continued to be ministers. What is coming out of New South Wales at the moment, speaking as a person from that state, is absolutely appalling. I am ashamed when I open the newspaper and read those things—the shocking revelations that are coming out of New South Wales and the ICAC hearings.


It is not just the coalition saying so. Kevin Rudd was on Q&A the other evening. He said earlier in the week that the whole future of the Labor Party could depend on cleaning up these matters. Let us not forget that it is the Sussex Street machine that gave us Eddie Obeid, that gave us Ian Macdonald, that gave us the stinking system of patronage, the culture that did really bad things in New South Wales under a series of governments, all of the Labor persuasion. It is the same Sussex Street machine that organised the political assassination of a Prime Minister in this country, an assassination in which the Prime Minister of today was complicit. It is the same Sussex Street machine that has given us political family upon political family, that gave us Karl Bitar and Mark Arbib. We all know their history in this place. This is the same Sussex Street machine which is today sustaining the Labor government in Canberra. That is the reality. New South Wales and Sussex Street and all their dirty machinations have put this woman into power and they are the ones sustaining her in power.


I am sorry that Senator Cameron is no longer in the chamber because he is absolutely right when he says that the people of western Sydney are sick and tired of this Labor government. They saw it for 16 years. They saw it under successive premiers in New South Wales—including you, Mr Carr. The gestation of the corruption that is now finding its way into the public with these ICAC inquiries had at its heart a time during your government, Mr Carr, because you are the one—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Ludlam
):  Senator Fierravanti-Wells, I just ask that you refer to ministers by their correct titles.




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  Thank you—Senator Carr. Senator Carr, I would remind you—



Senator Williams interjecting—




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  Senator Bob Carr. I apologise to Senator Kim Carr, sitting across the chamber.




Senator Kim Carr:
  That's right! Another tearful apology is required here.




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  You will not get too many tears from me, Senator Kim Carr—don't you worry about that! I am no shrinking violet that gets into tears. Minister Carr had the hide to come into this place yesterday and tell us, in answer to my question:


There was never a finding against the government I led on the grounds of corruption—never.


Maybe he did not stick around long enough. He continued:


Not once between 1995 and 2005; not about the government I led. Australia's record and that of New South Wales in the years I can speak for is exemplary.


Exemplary! Does he know what the definition of exemplary is? Of course he does not, because if he really knew the definition of exemplary he could never describe his government and what we are seeing in New South Wales today as exemplary.


I would remind Minister Carr that yesterday in this place I trawled through a whole series of allegations—the dates, the person who asked the question from the opposition. Let's airbrush that out of history. Let's forget the time that you were Premier and all the things that happened, forget the time that you gave birth politically to the ministry of Eddie Obeid and others in this government.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Moore
):  Senator, I do not want to interrupt, but everything should be directed to the chair rather than directed at someone else in the Senate.




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  Thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President. Because Minister Carr obviously was not listening yesterday, let me repeat some of the issues that I raised yesterday again today. On 9 September 1999 there were questions asked of him by the then Leader of the Opposition, Mrs Chikarovski, in relation to the pecuniary interests disclosures of Labor powerbroker Eddie Obeid. She asked him:


… to explain why he—


Mr Obeid—


asserted yesterday that he held no shares in Hapgeti when the company's own annual returns—prepared by Mr Obeid's son—shows the Minister to be the sole registered shareholder?


It is pretty obvious. The documents are on the public record. What was then Premier Carr's response? He ignored the question. Mrs Chikarovski asked:


Is Mr Obeid lying or is he just incompetent?


Then Premier Carr's response was simply to ignore totally any mention at all of Minister Obeid, to basically bat off the question, to stonewall. Stonewalling was invented by Sussex Street. Therefore, the same tricks that have been used for many years—the stonewalling of these allegations in New South Wales—have now found their way into Canberra. That was one example, Minister Carr. 


Let us go to 3 September 2002, when there were a whole series of allegations surrounding then Minister Obeid in relation to the Oasis Liverpool development. Perhaps, Minister Carr, you have forgotten about the evidence that was given up to ICAC.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Moore
):  Senator, address your remarks through the chair.




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  Perhaps, Madam Acting Deputy President, Minister Carr has forgotten completely—it was somewhere in the dim, dark days—about the absolutely disgusting evidence that was provided at that time. But Minister Carr yesterday said that there had been no allegations made.


We get to 3 September 2002. Let us have a look at these allegations of attempted bribery by the Minister for Mineral Resources and Minister for Fisheries. Mr Brogden asked the then Premier Carr what steps he took to satisfy himself of the minister's innocence and the Premier said that he had full confidence in the minister, describing the allegations as false and reckless. Premier Carr's response was: 'The Leader of the Opposition would be the only one trying to breathe life into ludicrous allegations.' He completely bats it off as being ludicrous allegations; there was no response whatsoever. On that same day, we had other members of the opposition asking questions. We had Mr Brogden asking supplementaries. We had Mr O'Farrell asking questions on the same point. Indeed, Mr O'Farrell was reminding Premier Carr that Eddie Obeid: 


… is the only Minister to have bought his place on the front bench by bankrolling backbench members of the Labor Party. He paid his way into the Ministry, and the Premier ought to reveal to this House the questions he asked the Minister for Mineral Resources, and Minister for Fisheries, Eddie Obeid, about his disclosures, what the ministerial Code of Conduct obliges the Minister to tell the Premier, and why the Premier continues to help a man who tells lies to this Parliament time and time again. 


In the end, Premier Carr completely ignores the question. He does not ever respond to questions asked by the opposition. Mr Souris was asking questions in relation to some of the evidence that had been given and some articles that had appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald that morning and about asking Mr Obeid to stand down pending investigation. That was in September 2002. 


On 23 October 2002, again Mr Souris from the opposition was asking questions. He said that Mr Obeid had given sworn evidence the week before to a parliamentary investigation looking into his pecuniary interests that he had had no business dealings since becoming a minister, which had been directly contradicted by further sworn evidence. Yesterday I put on the record a whole series of correspondence and indications that Mr Obeid had made to the clerk of the New South Wales parliament going to this very point. Mr Carr's response was, 'I believe the minister answered those questions fully in the Legislative Council today.' He completely batted it off.


On 19 November 2002, in relation to the Valhalla Stables lease, Mr Brogden asked questions of the Premier about a briefing note from the Director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service back in 1988, when Mr Carr was minister for the environment. That briefing note referred to the minister requesting that the service review the request of Eddie Obeid with a view to providing alternatively worded provisions that could meet the requirements of the lease. This related to Mr Obeid's Valhalla Stables snow lease development and so forth. Forget it—Mr Carr refused to answer, despite the specific questions that the opposition were asking and the specific allegations they were putting to him on that occasion.


We then come to 30 October 2003. Again, questions were being asked of the Premier in relation to the personal business interests of former ministers, including minsters Face, Allan, Whelan, Knight and Obeid. The Premier was asked whether he could give guarantees that none of his former ministers or parliamentary secretaries had used their positions to set up businesses or jobs to fund their retirements. Again, Premier Carr simply dismisses it—no issues, no research on the other side. There ain't anything happening that the opposition can get its teeth into. Then there was this classic comment from Premier Carr: 'I have often said that this is the period of best governance in the history of New South Wales.'



An opposition senator:  That's what they thought!




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  That's what they thought—wonderful governance. What a great example of governance! And here is Minister Carr refusing to answer questions asked by the opposition in this place in relation to corruption conventions and the like. Goodness me—with a history like this in New South Wales, it is a wonder that he is not an expert in the field.  I am sure that his meetings with all sorts of people in this area will be very interesting. 


The issues before the ICAC inquiry at the moment go to the very heart of Mr Obeid's suitability to have remained in parliament, let alone be promoted to the ministry. They go to the question of the judgement of then Premier Carr, who promoted him to the ministry. They go to the very heart of the corruption over those years that saw a two-way protection racket. The question remains: who was protecting whom and why were they protecting them? How much damage is being done to Australia's good standing as a country and to New South Wales's good standing as a state in which to do business as a consequence of the evidence of serious corruption that is now emerging from the ICAC inquiry? 


Mr Obeid and Mr Macdonald were both men that Mr Carr saw fit to include and retain in his ministry during the time that he was Premier of New South Wales, most especially in the case of Mr Obeid, whom he frequently and vociferously defended and protected when serious questions about his integrity were raised. This is what this is about. This is what the opposition's legitimate questioning of Minister Carr is about now. It goes to his judgement, just like the questions that are being asked of the Prime Minister about her time at Slater and Gordon go to her judgement, to her integrity. That is what it is about. 


Minister Carr, it is wrong when you come into this place and assert that no allegations were ever put to you by any member of the opposition in New South Wales. That is blatantly wrong. What I have referred to today is only a small example of the many allegations over a long, long time in New South Wales put to you and other Labor premiers about issues going to corruption in New South Wales. It is my strong belief that, in the ICAC inquiry which is currently on foot, we will see ongoing revelations about those years in New South Wales. It really is very sad for the people of New South Wales that they daily see the decadence and the corruption that occurred for many years. If that is exemplary government—to use Minister Carr's words—I do not know what bad government is.

"McEwen, Sen Anne",ALP,2012-11-22,"



Senator McEWEN
 (South Australia—Government Whip in the Senate) (16:40):  I too would like to contribute to the debate on this motion. What we have seen here from the opposition today is more muckraking, more negativity, more trawling over ancient history, more sleaze and more personal vilification—all of those things that they specialise in, things that they have learnt from the opposition leader, Mr Tony Abbott. We notice that he has withdrawn from that sort of attack line at the moment, because he knows that it does not wash with the Australian public and he knows that the Australian public does not like it. So, instead, he sent out his attack dogs—the masters in sleaze, the gutter dwellers: Senator Brandis and Senator Fierravanti-Wells, and I know we are going to hear Senator Ronaldson making loud pronouncements, for sure, following me. We saw the same thing happen in question time. You would have thought that the opposition might use this general business time to debate something that is really important. 


I know, for example, that if I were in my home state of South Australia today, my constituents would probably be asking me questions about the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. That is the news story of the day. That is what is really important to people in my state—how the government has acted, after a long period of time and a long period of consultation, to introduce a plan that is genuinely going to support South Australia, that is going to restore our river to health and support our river communities. That is what is really important in South Australia. But, instead, we have got the opposition gutter dwellers here reading out excerpts from their favourite newspaper, the Australian,and reading out transcripts from the ICAC inquiry that is currently happening in New South Wales. I would not want the public to think that the opposition are actually doing any of their own research. They just recite what is already in the public sphere. Do not think they are smart or clever or anything like that; they just pick up on what is already being talked about out there. 


It continues the opposition's long campaign of denigration of our Prime Minister. They have been doing that for a long period of time. I think they will wake up fairly soon to the fact that the Australian public do not like that either. Perhaps that is why they are turning their attention now to Australia's Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Bob Carr, one of Australia's most important public figures, who is engaged in some of the most important debates not just in this country but in the world. But what do they do? They come in here and trawl through the history of the New South Wales Labor Party and the New South Wales government in the 1990s. My goodness me! 


This motion is about the relationship between the Labor Party and the trade union movement, and I am more than happy to talk about that relationship and about the culture of the Labor Party. The relationship between the Labor Party and the trade union movement has delivered great benefits for working people in Australia—for all Australians and their families—and that relationship continues to deliver benefits. I am going to trawl over a bit of ancient history myself in my contribution today by talking about what that relationship has delivered for Australians, because it is always worth reminding ourselves how important it is.


The Labor Party was formed as the legislative arm of the labour movement. It was formed so that issues of importance to working Australians could be prosecuted in the parliament.




Senator Williams:
  There are no shearers over there now.




Senator McEWEN:
  Yes, Senator Williams, the Labor Party certainly arose out of the great shearers' strike. We know that and we are proud of that history. We celebrate that history. 


Unions are collectives, collectives formed to pursue the interests of their members—working Australians and their families. Together, the Labor Party and the unions have worked together for good in this country. I will outline some of the good things they have done, but first I wanted to say that I am very proud to be a member of a trade union. I have been a union member for many years. I am a member of the Australian Services Union and I was formerly a member of the Federated Clerks' Union. I have been a union delegate in my workplace, I have been a union official and I have been a union secretary. 


I have worked with many union officials and, in my experience, most of them, like ordinary Australians everywhere, work very hard. They are honest, hard-working and committed people who use whatever talents, skills and opportunities they have to support other people in our community. If there are exceptions in the trade union movement, just as if there are exceptions in the employer community, amongst politicians or anywhere else, and if people are misusing members' funds, they should be subject to whatever processes are available. The issues should be investigated to determine whether there has been any wrongdoing and those responsible for any such wrongdoing should be punished.


But the opposition continues its smear campaign about union officials. It is all part of their plan to destroy unions. They do not like what unions stand for, they do not like collectivism, they do not like a fair go and they do not like to see working people and their families effectively represented. Unions stand in the way of the opposition's determination to implement a workplace relations system in which protections for workers are minimal and in which opportunities for bad employers to exploit people are maximised. 


I was tempted to use my contribution to revisit the saga of Work Choices, to revisit the underlying extremism which fed Work Choices and to revisit the pathetic attempts by the coalition during that period in 2005 to try and hoodwink the Australian people by pretending that they actually cared about working Australians and that Work Choices was going to be good for working Australians. The people of Australia were not hoodwinked; they saw right through you. We saw the result of that in the 2007 election. I should also mention that Mr Abbott was front and centre during that industrial relations debate. We know that in his little heart—if he has one—he secretly harbours the hope that one day Work Choices will come back in some other guise. And he has a chorus of supporters over there who would also like to reintroduce it.


This motion gives us the opportunity to reflect on what unions and the Labor Party have achieved and I will outline a few of those achievements. As an example, did you know that we would not have paid annual leave had it not been for the trade union movement? It was one of the great early achievements of the union movement when the arbitration commission granted workers paid leave back in the 1930s. It started off at one week, went to two weeks and now the standard is four weeks. It was a long campaign by the union movement working with the Labor Party to introduce that basic right.


We would not have industrial awards and all the protections they include for working people had it not been for the trade union movement. Since 1904, we have had industrial awards to underpin pay and conditions for working people. We know that the opposition wanted to destroy those awards and still does. They have been dreaming about a free-range, no-protection kind of workplace relations system—probably ever since the Labor Party was first created. 


We can thank trade unions for penalty rates, penalty rates which compensate people who have to work unusual hours, longer hours or when other people are not working. We know that penalty rates were one of the things targeted by the opposition in Work Choices. They wanted to get rid of penalty rates altogether. 


The union movement can also claim responsibility for maternity leave. For paid maternity leave we can thank the Australian Labor Party, who introduced the first paid parental leave scheme in Australia. Many of us in this chamber were early participants in the campaign to get parental leave included as standard in awards. 


We can thank the union movement, together with the Labor Party, for universal superannuation in Australia—a fantastic achievement of a great government, the Keating Labor government. It took a long time to bring that in, too. The union movement worked with employers and government to bring it in as part of the Accord. I read somewhere today that Minister Bill Shorten has announced that investment in Australian superannuation has reached $1.5 trillion. That is a phenomenal investment in Australia's future. It is this Labor government which is working to increase superannuation savings for the Australian people and it is those people over there who do not like superannuation and who would like to get rid of it. 


Another thing we can thank the union movement and the Labor government for is the pursuit of equal pay for women, something that I know you, Madam Acting Deputy President Moore, me and many other people on this side of the chamber have campaigned long and hard for. We were proud of the union movement—my union, the Australian Services Union, in particular—and the Labor government working together to bring about the pay equity case. That outcome of that case will be to deliver, for the first time ever, decent wages for those people in our community who work to support people with disabilities, who work with families in distress, who care for elderly people and who do all those sorts of jobs. Those jobs have always been undervalued because they have always been done mainly by women. The people in those jobs deserve the recognition that has now been delivered—delivered as a result of the equal pay provisions that this Labor government put into the Fair Work Act. I note that some 150,000 Australian workers, most of them women, are going to get pay increases of between 23 per cent and 45 per cent as a result of that.


Another great achievement of state and national Labor governments, working with the trade union movement, was the introduction of workers compensation schemes. These schemes provide income, support and rehabilitation services for people who have been injured at work. Those schemes would never have been introduced if it had not been for the long campaigns by the union movement to ensure that people who were injured at work through no fault of their own were compensated. We would not have sick leave if it were not for the union movement, which campaigned very hard to ensure that when people were sick they could still get some pay. Now we take these things for granted, but we should never be complacent about ensuring that these benefits are retained. 


The union movement can be thanked for long service leave. It was the coal workers who went on strike in 1949 over the long service leave issue, and now of course long service leave is a universal entitlement and one that Australia is very proud of. It is a rare thing in the developed world—indeed, anywhere in the world. 


We can thank the union movement for redundancy pay for workers who lose their jobs through no fault of their own. If it had not been for the union movement we would still be in a situation where people could be made redundant or lose their jobs and have to walk away without any compensation. We know also that the Labor government introduced the GEER Scheme, which ensured that, where an employer had to make people redundant because the employer itself was broke, workers would not miss out on all of their entitlements and some would still be paid through a government funded scheme. 


We can thank the union movement for other things, like shift allowances and uniform allowances and meal breaks and rest breaks. We can thank them for unfair dismissal protection—again something that the opposition hate. They hate the fact that working people have some redress in a court that is accessible and free in the event that they are unfairly dismissed by their employer. They are just some of the things that the labour movement has introduced, the unions and the Labor Party working together.


It is worth going through the history of Labor governments in Australia and highlighting a few of the other things that Labor governments have introduced. This is a debate about good government. Labor governments are good governments, and they are good governments because they have introduced measures like the ones I am about to mention. The Fisher Labor government in the early 1900s was the first to introduce a payment to mothers on the birth of a child—what we later called child endowment—and it was the first government to legislate for a national workers compensation act. The Scullin Labor government increased social services payments for people during the Great Depression so that people had a bit of an income to protect themselves through that terrible time. The Curtin Labor government in the 1940s introduced the widow's pension and increased child endowment, and it began funding public hospitals for the first time. The Chifley Labor government was the first to recognise the value of immigration and assisted people to come here to help build our great nation. It was the Chifley Labor government that began building the Snowy hydro-electric scheme, a typically visionary Labor initiative. It employed a lot of people and provided a lot of energy for the developing states of New South Wales and Victoria. The same government played a major role on the international stage by helping to write the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that has become the basis for protecting human rights throughout the world. A little bit of history from South Australia is that it was also the same government that helped create the Holden motor company, Australia's first car company—again, the kind of visionary Labor initiative that we are very proud of.


The Whitlam Labor government took our troops out of Vietnam and got rid of the White Australia policy—fantastic initiatives. It opened Australian relations with China, increased the age pension and brought in the Racial Discrimination Act. The Hawke Labor government brought in Medicare. Who over there wants to get rid of Medicare? All of them. The Hawke Labor government intervened in Tasmania to protect the Franklin River from damming—action I was very proud of. It also led efforts to protect the Antarctica from mining and exploration, yet another thing I was very proud of. They were great environmental initiatives from a great Labor government. Of course it also introduced the Sex Discrimination Act and the Equal Employment Opportunity Act, which provided security for women in the workforce and paved the way for other antidiscrimination legislation that Labor governments have continued to pursue since that time. I have mentioned the Keating Labor government and superannuation. We should also remember that the Keating Labor government recognised native title through Mabo legislation and it helped to create the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum. That great government freed up the Australian economy and brought us into the modern world and, again, it paid attention to issues such as sex discrimination as well.


While the opposition are using this debate to continue their sleaze and smear campaign against the Prime Minister and other members of the government and their campaign against union officials and are continuing to trawl over ancient history and read out bits of the Australian, Labor senators are taking the opportunity to highlight the value, the importance and the goodness of the labour movement in Australia, with that special relationship between Labor governments and the trade union movement. We have nothing to be ashamed of over here. Those opposite can sling as much mud as they like; we can proudly say that we have a lot to be proud of in the Labor movement in Australia and, while people are listening to this ridiculous debate and the contributions from those on the other side, perhaps they would like to take some time to remember that all of those things that I talked about today, all of those good things that have been implemented by the Labor movement, would have been opposed by those opposite. Have we heard any policy from them today? Have they come up with any alternative policies, any big picture stories, any good news? No, it is just another afternoon of negativity, mud throwing, sleaze and trawling around in the gutter, and now we will have a contribution from the ace gutter dweller, Senator Ronaldson. 

",Senate,<title>MOTIONS</title>,<title>Australian Labor Party</title>,MOTIONS,19,1
"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2012-11-22,"



Senator RONALDSON
 (Victoria) (17:00):  I am sure my good friend Senator McEwen was not calling me some of those appalling names! But I will say this: I find it highly amusing that Senator McEwen has invoked the roots of the Labor Party to talk about Australian shearers. There would not be one senator or one House of Representatives member who would know a shearer if they fell over one! There would not be one member of the Labor Party in either house, quite frankly, who knew what grease remover for hands was. You would probably know what hand moisturiser was, but you would not know what grease remover for hands was. There is no-one in this place with any understanding of Australian workers anymore; you are completely unrepresentative of Australian workers. 


Nothing was better evidence of that, quite frankly, than a recent notice of motion put forward by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Abetz, in relation to Mr Craig Thomson. I will just read it, out of interest, so that everyone is acutely aware of it:


The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Abetz), pursuant to notice of motion not objected to as a formal motion, moved general business notice of motion no. 804—That the Senate—


(a) notes findings by Fair Work Australia that Mr Craig Thomson misused Health Services Union members' funds for sexual services, personal travel and entertainment and to secure a seat in the Federal Parliament; and


(b) condemns the misuse of union members' funds as found by Fair Work Australia.


You would have thought that a party that was protecting workers would have supported that, particularly in relation to the misuse of union members' funds. Oh, no. Where was Senator McEwen when it came to this? Where were the rest of the Labor senators when it came to this? Where were their partners in crime, the Greens, when it came to this? They voted against it. They voted against a motion which condemned the misuse of union funds—the funds of the very same people they pretend to represent in this place.


Everyone knows that three-quarters of Labor senators are ex union bosses. That is a fact. It is an undeniable fact. Put that on the back of the motion today for the Senate to note:


… the challenges for good government posed by the culture of the Australian Labor Party and its special relationship with affiliated trade unions.


Then put that in some context: look at what they have actually done in the last 12 months—look at what they have done in relation to the misuse of union funds. So how are you protecting the workers? As I say, you would not know a shearer if you fell over one. You no longer represent Australian workers. The roots of the Australian Labor Party were torn up and thrown out years ago. You could not even find your way to Creswick, most of you people. You have absolutely no idea. You do not represent workers. You have not represented workers for a long, long time.


I found the discussion today about the Leader of the Opposition and the Prime Minister very, very interesting. Isn't it remarkable? What we saw today was that you are happy to throw the mud, but when legitimate questions are posed—and we noticed the arrival of Ralph Blewitt in the country the day before yesterday—about the behaviour of the Prime Minister of this country, all of a sudden it is mud-slinging.


But I want to take you back, as I mentioned the other day, to the genesis of the quite remarkable, dirty and vile attack on the Leader of the Opposition. I just want to, again, refer to Mr John McTernan, who, of course, was an adviser to the British Labour Prime Minister, Tony Blair. I just want those on the other side to listen to these comments. As I said the other day in this place, they were in an article by Mr Chris Kenny in the Weekend Australian and I just want those opposite to listen as I quote from that article:


In a column for Britain's Daily Telegraph in 2010, McTernan declared: ""The Coalition has a problem with women."" 


Now where have we heard that before? Where did we hear that in the last month? Well, of course, we heard it coming from the Prime Minister and a large number of government ministers, and this was on the back of the McTernan tactics—the great mud-slinger of the Western world. And this article goes on:


He argued spending cuts proposed by the Conservative and Liberal Democrat Coalition in Britain were unpopular with female voters. ""This gender gap is a real and pressing problem for (British PM David) Cameron,"" he wrote.


Last year another column on law and order issues was headed: ""How many women today feel the Coalition—


this is the British coalition—


is protecting them?"" And just in case you missed the angle, a few months later McTernan focused on women promoted in British Labour's reshuffle, turning it against Cameron: ""The PM has a problem with women and he knows it.""


Straight out of the McTernan manual was the attack on the Leader of the Opposition a month and a half ago—straight out of the McTernan manual for dirt and grubbiness and personal attacks. This man was brought into this position by the Prime Minister of this country to achieve what he has achieved in relation to an abuse of that office and indeed an abuse of her as a Prime Minister and an abuse of proper process. You on the other side should be hanging your heads in shame, because you know exactly why he is in this country. You know he is in this country to denigrate the Leader of the Opposition and senior coalition members, and you sit there mute when you know exactly what has been done. There are some decent people on the other side who surely cannot countenance this sort of behaviour, and you should be standing up and saying you are not prepared to do it.


I will get back to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister can run but she cannot hide in relation to the slush fund affair. There have been some quite legitimate questions posed by some in the Australian media. As I said the other day, the conga line of apologists will never pursue it, but there are those in the gallery—this gallery and other galleries—who have the intestinal fortitude to pursue these matters, and they have put on notice quite legitimate questions that this Prime Minister must answer. And she refuses to do so. If she has a realistic and real answer to those questions, then good; that will be the end of the matter. But you do not have a press conference for an hour on the back of one misplaced word—'trust' instead of 'slush'—without any warning at all about what the matter would involve and then walk away, refuse to say anything more and then hang your shingle on the back of that hour-long press conference based on the back of one misused word: 'trust' instead of 'slush'. 


This Prime Minister has simply got to go into the House of Representatives next week and answer the questions that have been put to her. They are legitimate questions. There have been denials to date but there is new information and many, many people have now come out to confirm the alleged involvement of the Prime Minister. If they are wrong, then let us hear the Prime Minister say so personally, in the other place, and give a full, open and proper account of her involvement in the slush fund affair. The Australian people deserve no less and the other place deserves no less if, indeed, Ms Gillard's denials are found to be untrue. The onus is now on her to answer these questions. 


This is a matter of trust, and the Australian people have lost trust in this Prime Minister. Indeed, one of the Prime Minister's own, Darren Cheeseman, made that quite clear earlier this year. Mr Cheeseman is the ineffective member for Corangamite. He is ineffective, ineffectual, but he is the member for Corangamite at this stage. What did Mr Cheeseman say about the Prime Minister? He told the Sunday Age earlier this year that, 'many rank-and-file MPs had concluded Ms Gillard's leadership was now ''terminal'''. He then said, 'There's no doubt about it, Julia Gillard can't take the party forward.' And here is the telling comment in relation to trust, the telling comment in relation to where this Prime Minister is, and the telling words in relation to the requirement for the Prime Minister to come into the other place next week and put on record any denial of the allegations that have been made against her. This is what Mr Cheeseman said: 'The community has made its mind up on her.' What do you think he might have been referring to? I think he might have been referring to the trust issue. His view is that his community has lost trust in this Prime Minister. Trust is one of those fundamental hallmarks of leadership. Trust must be attached to a nation's leaders. Mr Cheeseman has made it quite clear that neither he nor his constituents trust this Prime Minister any longer. 


I want to turn now to two separate matters which are, I think, causing enormous angst. The Little Creatures brewery, which is part of the Lion Group—




Senator Chris Evans:
  It's a very good drop.




Senator RONALDSON:
  I am glad you said that, because remarkably, that drop is not going to be brewed in Geelong. Nor, potentially, will $60 million be spent by the company; nor, potentially, will there be 100 jobs created, because the CFMEU and the AMWU are picketing the construction of the Little Creatures brewery. So you might enjoy a drop, Senator Evans, but you will not be enjoying a drop coming out of Geelong unless these two unions—against whom an injunction had been granted—allow the construction to continue. There will not be any of your favourite drop coming out of Geelong, Senator Evans. 




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Moore
):  I remind you, Senator, that those comments should be directed through the chair, not across the chamber.




Senator RONALDSON:
  Indeed, the last person I would call 'Senator Evans' would be you, Madam Acting Deputy President, I can assure you of that.


What was said by some of those who are actually trying to drive investment in Geelong? I will go to the Geelong Advertiser—a very fine paper indeed—of 30 October. The Geelong Chamber of Commerce was quoted in the Geelong Advertiser:


""It sends the wrong message to people who want to invest in Geelong,"" executive officer Bernadette Uzelac said. ""We should be making things easier to do business and invest in Geelong and not harder.""


What did the Geelong Advertiser editorial say in relation to this, following an intervention by the Premier of Victoria, Mr Ted Baillieu, who expressed his outrage at the behaviour of the unions? The editorial on 20 July said:


Premier Baillieu is right to air the same concerns we did in this space last week when we said we feared for the impact this dispute might have on would-be investors in Geelong.


The editorial went on:


This dispute has to end now. The longer it continues, the more negative impact on future investment it will have and, the more indifference will be shown to the spirit if not the letter of the law.


Developments like this brewery are very important for our community. 


Industrial action like we are seeing in South Geelong—despite court orders—does not send a great message to any company looking to establish a business here.


You would think that the local members would have some comment to make about this, because those picketers were there this morning. So I will go through the comments made by the local members. The first was a hard-hitting comment from the member for Geelong, Ian Trezise. He is a charming fellow but, like Mr Cheeseman, highly ineffectual. He is quoted in the Geelong Advertiser on 31 October:


Member for Geelong Ian Trezise urged the company and the unions to sort out the issue as soon as possible.


That is an inspired intervention! But it is probably more inspired than two other interventions that have not been made. We have heard what the Geelong Advertiser has said about the risk to investment into the great centre of Geelong in regional Victoria. We heard what the Chamber of Commerce said about the potential impact of this union picket line, which was found to be illegal, on Geelong. We know that it is going to cost, potentially, a $60 million investment and 100-plus jobs, so one would think that two people in particular might have a comment about this. The first person would be Mr Darren Cheeseman, the current member for Corangamite. The second person, you might think, would be the member for Corio, Mr Richard Marles. I will ask my colleagues to guess at how many comments were made by these two gentlemen in relation to the risk that Geelong faced. Who would like to have a guess?




Senator Fifield:
  This many!




Senator RONALDSON:
  'Two,' Senator Fifield says.




Senator Fifield:
  No; this many!




Senator RONALDSON:
  None. You were right the second time, Senator Fifield. Not one single word was said, or has been said, by the member for Corangamite or the member for Corio in relation to a dispute which has been found to be illegal. It is a dispute that will potentially put at risk $60 million of investment and 100 jobs but there was not a word. Why do you think that might be? I will tell you why it is. It is because of that unholy alliance. The alliance between the Australian Labor Party and the Greens is an unholy alliance but there is an unholy alliance between the Australian Labor Party and union members who have turned out, in Geelong, to be nothing but thugs. As we saw with the Grocon dispute, they are nothing but thugs.


Where were Darren Cheeseman and Richard Marles when this was going on? Where were they standing up for investment in their own region? They go and talk the talk but they never, ever walk the walk in relation to looking after and supporting the region of Geelong. They have not said a word. And they have not said a word because of the unholy alliance between them and the union movement. They have effectively been silenced by a union movement that is so powerful it can change a Prime Minister. These two political wimps did not have the intestinal fortitude to make a single comment about this dispute. 


You have heard what the Geelong Chamber of Commerce said and what the editorial in the Geelong Advertiser said. This required these two men to stand up for their region and it required these two men to tell the unions to back off and let the investment take place. And they were completely missing in action. They are still missing in action, because their obligation is to the Australian union movement. Their obligation, clearly, is not to those who elected them or those who are part of their wider constituency. And that is what Senator Fifield's motion is about today. It is about the fact that we are seeing, again, further proof about who owes whom, and it is not about the people of Geelong. (Time expired)

"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2012-11-22,"



Senator MARSHALL
 (Victoria) (17:20):  It is always fun to follow Senator Ronaldson!




Senator Ronaldson:
  I think you do it on purpose.




Senator MARSHALL:
  It is because I come in for the show. But it is all show and no substance. Actually, it is like watching a Punch and Judy show with only Punch. There is no Judy; there is no Judy at all. There is no substance in what Senator Ronaldson has to say. 


Let us go back to the very start of Senator Ronaldson's speech, where he decided that everyone on this side of the chamber was a union official and had no other work-life experience, and that we would not even know a shearer if we fell over one. Let me say this: there are three people on this side who have spoken in this debate. First of all, Senator Cameron is a fitter and turner. He worked as a fitter and turner for most of his working life. That is what he was. The second speaker from this side was Senator Anne McEwen, whose first job was as a tea lady in a solicitor's firm and who then worked for most of her working life as a clerical worker. 


I am the third Labor person to speak and I am an electrician. I did an electrical apprenticeship and worked a large part of my working life as an electrician. So, Senator Ronaldson, you say that we have not had our hands dirty and that we have no real experience in life but it is simply untrue. It is a demonstration of all show but no substance, which we are very used to from you, Senator Ronaldson. But you are not alone; there are plenty on your side who do that.


Then we heard this little tirade about the Prime Minister and all the things she has to answer. But, strangely enough, I listened to Senator Brandis, Senator Fierravanti-Wells and then Senator Ronaldson in this debate and not a single accusation was made nor a single question put that required an answer—not one. It was just this 'round the world' general muckraking and accusations that other people apparently have made but not saying it here, not even making the point once. Quite frankly, it is a nonsense.


But let me go to what the real substance of this debate is. It is about the special relationship between the Labor Party and the trade union movement. And it is a special relationship. I would not for one moment seek to distance the Australian Labor Party from the fine tradition of the union movement in Australia. It is a close relationship with working people and their representatives. It may be viewed as a source of embarrassment over in the opposition's headquarters, but it only goes to show how out of touch they are with the everyday lives of working people.


As I said, I am a senator who worked for many years as an A grade electrician. I am also a former shop steward and a former official of the Electrical Trades Union. I am very proud to follow in the footsteps of my many predecessors in the Labor Party who began their working life on the shop floor before going on to devote their careers to improving the lives of their fellow workers right across Australia. And our party is full of those people and I am proud to be one of them.


There are, from time to time, in all walks of life and in all professions people who do not do as we would like them to do, whether it be in the judiciary, politics, business and, unfortunately, sometimes the union movement. There are people who do not act as we would like them to act. Recent examples will be before the courts. Those matters will be tested before the courts where they are properly to be tested and, if the accusations made about some in the trade union movement are true, none will be more disappointed than the people of the trade union movement and the labour movement and I will be one of them. I will be incredibly disappointed. But just because one of our colleagues may be found guilty in the future does not tar people on this side of the chamber nor former union officials.


Given that Senator Fifield is himself the grandchild of a widely respected former federal secretary of the former Printing & Kindred Industries Union, Mr Bert Fifield, I am surprised that he would seek to tarnish his own legacy by denigrating the proud history of the trade unions and what they have achieved through their relationship with the Labor Party. Just because there may be people in the trade union movement on this side who have done wrong does not take away his legacy in respect of his grandfather and nor does it take away anyone else's. As I said, unfortunately, you have only to go to the court system and see people who are accused of doing wrong from all walks of life. I know through my personal experience that the vast majority of union officials, union activists and indeed union members are hardworking, committed and dedicated people. I am proud to be part of that group.


I just want to go through a little bit of history, because the author of this motion is obviously incredibly ignorant of the background of the Labor Party and the trade union movement in this country. The first working class member of parliament was Charles Jardine Don. He was elected to the colonial government of Victoria in 1859, with the support of the Trades Halls Operatives Reform Association. As members of parliament were not paid for their service until 1870, Mr Don would work as a stonemason during the day and attend parliament at night. The need for political representation of the trade union movement became even more apparent over the following years and this was highlighted when the efforts of trade unions to improve the lives of working Australians through collective action, from 1890 to 1894, were thwarted by the vested interests of the colonial governments of the time. The Labour Defence Committee expressed the need for political representation of everyday Australians in the following words. If we are to:


radically improve the lot of the worker we must secure a substantial representation in Parliament. Then, and only then, can we begin to restore to the people the land of which they have been plundered, to absorb the monopolies which society at large has tended to create, and to ensure to every man, by the opportunity of fairly remunerated labor, a share in those things that make life worth living.


It was in the spirit of this fine sentiment that the first conference of the Australian Labor Party was held in 1891. Later that year Labor won 37 seats in the New South Wales parliament and, in 1893, 16 Labor candidates successfully stood for office in Queensland, 10 in Victoria and eight in South Australia. Finally, the aspirations of Australian workers were represented in parliament by Australia's first clearly differentiated political party and that was the Australian Labor Party.


We have always had a link to the trade union movement and I for one am absolutely proud of it. I can only ask: what aspect of this relationship between the trade unions and the Australian Labor Party could possibly be considered to be a barrier to good government, as the motion suggests?


It is easy to take our quality of life in Australia for granted but decent jobs with decent pay and conditions are not natural facts. Australian workers do not get paid well by international standards because we have a uniquely generous employer class; they are paid more because of the efforts of generations of working Australians who banded together in the spirit of a fair go for all. The Australian labour movement and their parliamentary representatives have made tremendous gains on the most important issues for workers and their families—wages, hours, representation, leave, security and safety.


In 1828 a convict shepherd was sentenced to 500 lashes, one month in solitary confinement on bread and water and the remainder of his sentence in a penal settlement for inciting his master's servants to combine for the purpose of obliging him to raise their wages and increase their rations. He got that penalty because he tried to take collective action to improve their wages, improve their rations and improve their conditions. 


Perhaps understandably, the first record of an Australian trade union does not appear until what is thought to be the first general meeting of the Australian Society of Compositors in the Crown and Anchor in George Street Sydney on 21 February 1839. By the mid 1850s, approximately 20 trade unions had been established and in 1856 they made their first gain, reducing the hours of the then six-day working week from 58 hours to 48 hours with no reduction in pay. To this day you can see a monument to the eight-hour day across from the Victorian Trades Hall council in Melbourne.


In 1946, the ACTU lodged a claim for a 40-hour week. It argued that shorter hours would make workers more efficient and the booming economy could afford it. Two years later, the case was won and the 40-hour week began on 1 January 1948. Today, working hours are on the increase again and the Australian Labor Party, along with trade unions, remains alert to the erosion of the hard-won workplace conditions that are taken for granted all too often.


The Australian labour movement has fought and continues to fight for improved work-life balance for all Australians through access to leave. In 1941, the labour movement—the ALP and the union movement—won conditions like sick leave and one week of annual leave. In 1946, we increased annual leave to two weeks. In 1953, we achieved long service leave. In 1963, we increased annual leave to three weeks and then increased it again to four weeks in 1970. In 1971, we won the right to maternity leave. In 2001, we extended the benefits of maternity and carers leave to casual employees. In 2010, we guaranteed the rights of Australian workers under the National Employment Standards of the Fair Work Act, ensuring, amongst other things, that working parents would have the right to request flexible working hours to care for their children.


In 2011, the labour movement was responsible for extending 18 weeks of paid parental leave to hundreds of thousands of working parents and from 1 January next year Australians will be eligible to apply for two weeks of dad-and-partner pay, again thanks to the labour movement as a whole. That is just a very small snapshot of all the benefits that have been gained by the labour movement over the last century, and then some. The struggle to achieve those benefits is widely forgotten but nonetheless Australian workers enjoy them and they benefit from them, thanks to the labour movement. They are not thanks from benevolent employers; they are thanks to the labour movement. Does the opposition honestly believe that Australian workers will resent the relationship between the ALP and the trade unions when they take a week of leave to enjoy Christmas with their families this year? I do not think so. 


For decades, women doing the same work as men were paid just a fraction of men's salary. In line with societal norms of 1907, Justice Higgins in establishing the basic wage ruled that a man's wage must be enough to feed and clothe his wife and family. A woman's wage was to pay only for herself. A landmark ruling in 1969 smashed through the discrimination and by 1974 all women were finally entitled to equal pay for work of equal value. The labour movement achieved that.


Just this year, the Australian Labor government, along with the Australian Services Union and the CPSU were successful in their application for equal pay for workers in the social and community service sector, achieving a historic pay increase of between 19 per cent and 41 per cent for 150,000 of Australia's lowest-paid workers, the vast majority of whom were women. Does the opposition honestly think that these workers resent the relationship between the Labor Party and the Australian Services Union and the CPSU? I do not think so.


From as early as the 1960s a number of unions achieved superannuation for their members in established industry funds. This led to a wider push amongst unions to ensure that working people would be able to enjoy a decent level of retirement income. In the 1986 National Wage Case, the ACTU argued and won three per cent universal super for all award workers. Compulsory super has since risen to nine per cent through a legislated super guarantee charge negotiated under the accord in 1991.


Reform of taxation and superannuation by the Australian Labor Party this year will result in a 30-year-old person on an average full-time income receiving an estimated $100,000 extra in retirement savings. Does the opposition think that these workers will resent these savings on retirement? Will they decry the relationship between the Australian trade unions and the Australian Labor Party that led to these retirement savings? I do not think so.


The Australian Labor Party governs for all Australians. Is the opposition honestly proposing the government should ignore the ideas and aspirations of millions of trade unionists, millions of trade union members who contribute to Australia's society and economy? Is that what good government is supposed to look like to those across the chamber? When 180,000 unemployed Australians asked conservative Prime Minister Stanley Bruce for work in 1927, and Bruce replied that it was not his business, is that what good government looks like to the opposition in this chamber? When Patrick Corporation unleashed the attack dogs in the waterfront dispute in 1998 with the backing of the coalition government, was that what good government looks like to the coalition?


What about the former ACTU President and Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke's government—a government that cooperated with unions to launch the accord, a mechanism to bring inflation under control, promote jobs growth and investment, and implement social wage improvement? Perhaps I think that is what good government looks like. What about a government that consults with both working people and their employers? What about a government that works with the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia to protect exploited outworkers in the textile, clothing and footwear sector? 


What about a government that works with the United Firefighters Union to ensure that firefighters dying of cancer from occupational-related causes get adequate compensation? Those are just two examples of government action taken this year in response to consultation between the Australian trade unions and government. The culture of the Australian Labor Party and its relationship with trade unions is no cause for alarm for firefighters or textile workers—far from it. I think they appreciate the special relationship between the trade union movement and the Australian Labor Party. The special relationship that alarms Australian workers is the relationship that exists between the big end of town and their coalition mouthpieces, a relationship that compels the coalition to demonise the union movement at every available opportunity, not in spite of the achievements they have made on behalf of everyday Australians, but because of them.


We are the government that got rid of Work Choices. We are the government that gave people a fair go. I do not think that having a special relationship with the trade union movement where we give and return basic entitlements to people is a cause of concern to Australian workers. I do not think Australian workers are concerned at all when the Labor Party and the trade union movement stand up for their rights, stand up for the rights of their families, stand up for a fair go for all, stand up for equality of access and stand up for education being made available to those who need help: those from low socioeconomic backgrounds, those who are struggling on low wages. We are the government that makes education available to them, and we want to make education available fairly to them. We want the best education for those people. I do not think Australians worry about that. I do not think they worry about the relationship between the trade union movement and the ALP when they see a Labor government acting on behalf of working class kids, trying to get the best outcomes, the best social equity, for them.


Let me say, I think this motion is simply a joke. When anyone of any substance looks hard at the great achievements that have been made by Labor governments in conjunction with the trade union movement and the achievements that the trade union movement has made, they should be over there saying that the trade union movement is one of the great civilisers of our society. Every rich Western country has a strong, vibrant trade union movement. They are protectors of democracy. They are protectors of working people. I am proud to be part of it. I am proud to have worked as an electrician. I am proud to have been a blue collar worker. I am proud to have been a union official—aspiring to keep those values alive, defending working people wherever I could—and I am very proud to be a senator of the Labor Party, which has a fine history, a fine tradition and a great special relationship with the trade union movement.

"Sinodinos, Sen Arthur",LP,2012-11-22,"



Senator SINODINOS
 (New South Wales) (17:40):  This is an important debate. It is good that speakers from all sides can reflect on the role of trade unions in our society. May I begin by saying that there is no-one in the coalition who says that trade unions should not exist. This is not a debate about whether unions should or should not exist. This is not a debate about freedom of association. This is not a debate about governments taking action to rub out an important component of civil society. We all recognise the role that unions can play in society. But it is one thing to recognise the contribution of unions, one thing to say that they have an important role to play in our civil society, and it is another to ask: 'Do they have too much power, and is part of that power exercised by their ownership of one of the great political parties of Australia, the Australian Labor Party?' That is what we are talking about here. We are talking about who calls the shots, ultimately, in the Australian Labor Party.


We saw no better evidence of that on that night in June 2010, when a sitting Prime Minister was bundled out of office, overnight. He was basically persuaded that he did not have the numbers in caucus the next morning; he had to go. He did not put up a fight in the end. He saw that the numbers were against him and he went. That was the night when the faceless men—they were all men that time—were identified as the people who coordinated and put together the plot. Those faceless men: David Feeney, Don Farrell and Bill Shorten—before he was a superstar. These are people who have several things in common. They are members of the Labor Party and formerly members of the trade union movement in some form or another.


We had the spectacle that night of a member of a very senior union in Australia, the Australian Workers Union, Paul Howes—that shy and retiring Paul Howes, who shuns the media spotlight, who is afraid of the camera; he runs from the camera and the spotlight!—getting on national television to give a running commentary on what they had done to a sitting Prime Minister. The announcement was not even being made by a member of parliament. It was being made by a sitting trade union official: 'Oh, gee, oh, shucks, I've got an announcement to make: we've just removed or are in the process of removing a Prime Minister.' The gall! The Liberal Party did not have to do anything except sit back and watch as the trade union movement ordained, for whatever reason, that Kevin Rudd had to go. The order went out, and Rudd went.


One of the things that was not in Rudd's favour is that from time to time he had had the temerity to speak out against the unions. He had had the temerity to talk about how the Labor Party was meant to be a broader based, more representative organisation. He had the temerity to do that. In 2007, he showed that temerity by watering down the even more extreme proposal that Julia Gillard, the then shadow minister, I think, for employment and workplace relations, was bringing forward to unwind the coalition's Work Choices legislation. The first draft of the Fair Work amendments, as drafted by Julia Gillard, were even more extreme than the version which finally saw the light of day as Labor Party policy in the run-up to the 2007 general election. It was watered down by Kevin Rudd.


It was watered down by Kevin Rudd because Mr Rudd could see the damage that would be done to the image of the Australian Labor Party if the public were to see how much the parliamentary party appeared to be in the pocket of the trade unions. We know that they have to be in the pocket of the trade unions. They are owned: lock, stock and barrel. There are so many members of the Labor Party in this place—almost all of them—who owe being here to the union movement. They therefore have an obligation—a filial obligation, if you like—to defend the union movement to the last, and this creates a lens that they put on any piece of legislation which comes before us; a lens which has a very heavy trade union bias. That is why it is always a furphy when people say only 13 per cent of the private sector is unionised—yes, but through the union movement that is in control of the Labor Party they exert a disproportionate influence over the legislation and policy of the country. That is the point. The only thing ultimately that stops the Labor Party from doing more extreme things in favour of the unions is the potential for a public opinion backlash. 


In 2007, Kevin Rudd watered down the Fair Work Act. We can imagine how more extreme it would have been if Julia Gillard had had her way in. Julia Gillard came to the prime ministership owing her position to those faceless men and to the trade unions behind them. So often during her prime ministership we have seen that she has had to genuflect to those unions because of how she owes her position to them. 


When she came back from overseas and found that the redoubtable, long-suffering, beleaguered Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen, had put together the first enterprise mining agreement involving Roy Hill Mine, owned by Gina Rinehart, she feigned surprise that this had happened. When the unions got in touch with her, they said, 'We've got a problem with this.' All of a sudden she turned around, dropped Bowen like hot coals and said: 'We've got to have a proper review of this. We've got to have a jobs board. We've got to do this and we've got to do that.'


This was the case of a policy which had been carefully put together over 12 months, coming to fruition in this first enterprise mining agreement, suddenly being brought to a halt and requiring a further review because of a union backlash. That is not good for the culture of good government in Australia that there can be that sort of backlash and that sort of quick backtracking by a Prime Minister. We hope to be administering the biggest resources boom in Australia's history and we need to be putting in place a consistent, credible policy regime that will stand the test of time and which will be coherent. We cannot have a situation where unions can stop a whole process that has been going for 12 months if they find something wrong with a particular agreement. That is where good government comes up against the institutional ownership of the Labor Party by the labour movement. 


There are many here who will recall the Cole royal commission into the building industry—something fiercely opposed by many on the other side. Senator Marshall, who spoke before me, formerly an official of the ETU, in his maiden speech to the parliament attacked the Cole royal commission and said it was a 'politically motivated witch-hunt' that was 'desperately trying to uncover non-existent union corruption in the building industry.' Further, he praised the Electrical Trade Union and 'its many fine members who I had pleasure to work with during my tenure there.' Yet this commission catalogued over 100 types of unlawful and inappropriate conduct, including by the ETU. As a result of that the Australian building and construction commission was established as a tough cop on the beat to take a strong stand against union thuggery in the building and construction industry. The Office of the ABCC had helped the building and construction industry to increase productivity by 10 per cent and provided an annual economic welfare gain of something like $6.2 billion, reduced inflation by 1.2 per cent and increased GDP by 1.5 per cent. The number of working days lost annually per thousand employees in the construction industry fell from 224 in 2004 to 24 in 2006. At the same time, building costs fell by 20 to 25 per cent and long project delays were dramatically reduced.


What did the Labor government do? In 2007, they promised, under employer pressure, to keep the Building and Construction Commission. But three or four years later, safe from that 2007 election, they watered down the building and construction commission—they defanged it. What has been the result? You only have to go to the Grocon site in the middle of Melbourne to see the result—the upsurge in days lost in the construction industry and the sort of lawlessness that is returning to the construction sector. Governments, apart from anything else, must uphold the law. They must not be seen to be turning a blind eye to the law. Construction is a sector where that is happening and that is not in the interests of good government. 


Senator Marshall talked about the importance of consultation. He talked about how good government is about consultation. Yes, he is right. As part of that consultation, trade unions and stakeholders on many important matters should be consulted. But this government has a track record of not understanding what genuine consultation is about. We saw that with the mining tax, where they mugged an industry overnight with a punitive tax which was actually designed to extract more revenue than the government had estimated at the time. This was only realised when the mining industry finally got a look at it. They were mugged and essentially told, 'Take it or leave it. The numbers are baked into the budget.' Was that appropriate consultation with an industry? Is that the model of consultation that they want? 


Contrast that with the consultation that has occurred recently with the trade union movement where we have seen a new shipping reform program put through which offers all sorts of concessions to the shipping industry to help preserve shipping industry jobs, because we are fundamentally uncompetitive in that sector. In return, allegedly, the Maritime Union of Australia have pledged a new productivity compact with the shipowners. We are still to see that productivity compact or any of its content. The reason the 1997-98 maritime dispute occurred is that a lot of people in Australia had had enough—shippers, customers of the shipping lines and customers of the ports. Our wharves were a laughing stock. Our crane rates were amongst the lowest in the world, if you measured wharf productivity that way. People say that what happened on the waterfront was pretty rough. But what had been happening on the waterfront for years with all the rorts was pretty rough.


We can go back to the early seventies, we can go back to the painters and dockers, we can go through the whole history of the wharves, but the fact of the matter is that from a history in the thirties of protecting workers from very bad conditions on the wharves the MUA by the eighties and nineties had mutated into this body that was holding Australian exports to ransom. That is why the Howard government took action. Admittedly it was tough action, but things had reached a point where consensus was not achieving anything. Bob Hawke had tried consensus when he was Prime Minister, and it had not worked on the wharves. Sometimes a government has to stand up and say, 'The government runs the country, not any one sectional interest.' If there is one boast I make proudly, as a member of the opposition and particularly as a member of the Liberal Party, it is that we have no institutional owners. We are not owned by anybody.



Senator Thorp interjecting—




Senator SINODINOS:
  Yes, we have links with business, Senator Thorp, with big business and with small business. We have links with the middle class. We have links with aspiring working-class Australians. We have links with people who have made it in Australia. We have links all over the place. We are not owned by anybody. There are no bloc votes at our national conferences.




Senator Chris Evans:
  Oh, come on!




Senator SINODINOS:
  Senator Evans, you are a very experienced former trade union official. You know what I am talking about.




Senator Chris Evans:
  You're going to tell me there are no factions next, aren't you?




Senator SINODINOS:
  There are factions in all parties, but there are no bloc votes, and you know that, Senator Evans.




Senator Chris Evans:
  No I do not.




Senator SINODINOS:
  None of this confected outrage from you, Senator Evans; we know your form. The Liberal Party is not owned by any section of society; that is very important to remember.


I am disappointed in the contemporary trade union movement. In my maiden speech I talked about the reform surge of the 1980s and the crucial role played by people like Bill Kelty. That was a trade union movement that was forward looking and progressive, that knew Australia had to change. Reform had to happen, and they were willing to help manage the change. Things like the superannuation system that Senator Marshall spoke about were part of the fruit of that sort of partnership.


Today the trade union movement has become fearful, defensive and inward looking. The union movement today wants to mandate job security. They are not outward looking, they are not progressing. They are not sponsoring reform; they are standing in the way of reform, and that is not good for the government of Australia. Australia needs to keep reforming, particularly now that in the period ahead the terms of trade will not be rising in the way they have in the recent past. Our productivity has to go up. Our competitiveness has to go up. Our costs are 30 to 40 per cent out of kilter with the rest of the world. Some of that is the Australian dollar but a lot of it is the way our costs have gone up, particularly during the mining boom, and those costs are now locked in. We need to be more productive and more competitive. We need a union movement that is a genuine partner in that task, and that means that we have to review the Fair Work Act, among other things. It means we have to review all the ways in which regulations potentially shackle productivity and innovation.


The trade union movement today, unlike that of the eighties, seems incapable of leading that debate and that change. It is too defensive. The trade union movement today is more concerned about the perks and lurks of being involved in the superannuation sector. We need a thorough investigation of the role of unions in industry funds and in the superannuation sector. The reason for that is there are too many instances where trade union officials are doubling up. They have their day jobs as union officials and they are trustees of super funds, and sometimes, as in the case of Bernie Riordan in New South Wales, they are also chairing financial service organisations that are providing services to those superannuation funds with which they are associated. What sort of conflict of interest is that?


This is the same Bernie Riordan who was one of the prime movers in blocking the privatisation of electricity assets in New South Wales along with his good friend and now opposition leader in New South Wales John Robertson. How is that good for the government of New South Wales, one-third of the national economy, and therefore good for the state of the Australian economy? Yet today we have the Minister for Resources, Energy and Tourism, Martin Ferguson, who is one of the few Labor people who tells it like it is in the economic sector, saying that states should be looking to privatise their assets. This government should be telling the ETU and everybody else who is in the way to cooperate with state governments to get that done. This will unlock resources which can be used for other, more productive forms of infrastructure.


How is John Robertson good for the government in New South Wales? He is now virtually irrelevant as Leader of the Opposition. Doesn't it say a lot about the structure of the Australian Labor Party that in New South Wales they can have a leader of the opposition who is one of the prime architects of the downfall of the former Labor government? This is someone who oversaw the destruction of that government from the time of Morris Iemma onwards. How is that good for the government of Australia?


These are the structural problems that Labor has to face. All political parties face their challenges. None of us are exempt from criticism from time to time, but this is a structural problem that is getting worse and worse. It is because Labor in one sense became too successful at gaining power and, to paraphrase Lord Acton, power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. The trade unions today have absolute power over the Labor Party, and that is the challenge that the ordinary rank and file of the Labor Party face. These are the people who are out there handing out how-to-vote cards; the ones who trudge up, doing their best, because they believe in old-fashioned Labor values. Then they see their party is effectively run by faceless men—mostly men these days. They think, 'There must be a better way.' No wonder so many young, idealistic people on the left have tended to shift to the Greens or other parties. They think, 'I can't get ahead in the Labor Party. The only way I'll get ahead in the Labor Party is to join a union; I'll have to be sponsored by a union.' That is not a great message to give young people.


This is a time when most young people look at unions and say, 'What can they really do for me in the modern workplace?' Senator Marshall talks about the protections provided by unions. The protection provided to every worker in Australia lies in the productivity and competitiveness of the Australian economy. That is what ultimately underwrites all the benefits that the labour movement and others have been able to get. Those benefits are there because we are a rich country—and, yes, there can be a debate about how we divide the spoils of being a rich country—but those riches were not gained by trade unions simply existing. They were gained by people working hard and having faith in the future.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2012-11-22,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (19:01):  Can I say at once that the opposition supports this bill. I will turn to the terms of the bill in a moment, but I thought I might, with the indulgence of honourable senators, take the opportunity in speaking to this bill to make a few remarks about the judicial appointments announced on Tuesday by the Attorney-General, Nicola Roxon—they being the appointment of the Hon. Patrick Keane, who had lately been the Chief Justice of the Federal Court, as the 50th Justice of the High Court, and of the Hon. James Allsop to be the new Chief Justice of the Federal Court. As I said in a television interview, but let me say it in the chamber and get it on to the parliamentary record, the opposition congratulates both Justice Keane and Chief Justice Allsop on their appointments and warmly welcomes both of them.


I have had a number of fairly harsh things to say about the Attorney-General in the last few months and I do not resile from them one iota. But to give credit where it is due I am bound to say that, in her senior judicial appointments, so far the Attorney has not put a foot wrong: in the appointment of Justice Gageler to the High Court a few months ago and now the appointments of Justice Keane to the High Court and Justice Allsop as the Chief Justice of the Federal Court. In fact, let me record for posterity, as it were, that early this year the Attorney-General did me, as the shadow Attorney-General, the courtesy of writing to me as part of a quite extensive consultation process which she undertook. She invited my suggestions as to the names of suitable people for appointment to the High Court. In a letter I wrote to the Attorney-General on 21 April this year, having myself consulted among a reasonably wide cross-section of senior lawyers and judges in Australia, I proposed six names. I will not say who those six were, but I am delighted to say that the names of Justice Gageler, Justice Keane and Justice Allsop were all among them. I am pleased that the Attorney-General and I have been able to see eye to eye on this matter, because all of the senior judicial appointments that the Attorney-General has made in the last few months were from among the six names recommended to her by the opposition.


I do not know Chief Justice Allsop personally. To the best of my recollection I have never met him, but I do know him by reputation to be a particularly distinguished lawyer. I am told that his expertise is in particular in the field of maritime law, which is a very interesting and arcane area of the law. I know that he is a former associate to the Hon. Sir Nigel Bowen, the first Chief Justice of the Federal Court of Australia and a very illustrious Liberal Attorney-General and member of the House of Representatives.


I do know Pat Keane well, having been his colleague at the Queensland bar for many years and having been his junior on several occasions. Pat Keane has had a stellar reputation. He was a university medallist from the University of Queensland. He took the Bachelor of Civil Law degree and won the Vinerian prize, which is awarded to the best graduate in that particularly challenging law course, in his year. He is the only Queenslander, to the best of my knowledge, to have won the Vinerian prize which, in many ways, is the Olympic gold medal of legal scholarship, certainly in the English-speaking world. He had a very successful practice at the Queensland bar. He took silk after only 10 years. He was the state Solicitor-General for something like 15 years, having been appointed by a Labor government and reappointed by the Borbidge coalition government. He has lately been a member of the Queensland Court of Appeal and was then the Chief Justice of the Federal Court. Pat Keane has had an absolutely stellar scholarly and professional career. I am pleased to say that he is a Magdalen man. I do not say that all High Court judges should be BCL graduates from Magdalen College, Oxford, but it does not do any harm.


Having offered those felicitations to Chief Justice Allsop and Justice Keane, let me turn to the content of this bill. This bill is a bill to amend the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975, the Family Law Act 1975, the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976, the Federal Magistrates Act 1999 and the Judiciary Act 1903 to implement provisions of SCAG model bills relating to procedural and jurisdictional matters pertaining to the federal courts and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The amendments proposed by the bill aim to improve the function and efficiency of the discovery rules in civil proceedings, specifically to provide for more flexibility in cost orders and to allow for pre-trial oral examination to implement the SCAG model bill on suppression and non-publication orders, to implement the SCAG model bill concerning vexatious proceedings, and to align the jurisdictional limit of family law magistrates in Western Australia with the Federal Magistrates Court. That is in turn being overtaken by the bill considered earlier in the week which changes the Federal Magistrates Court to the Circuit Court of Australia. The amendments also aim to provide more flexibility to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal when dealing with the payment of fees.


The amendments proposed by this bill are relatively procedural and non-controversial. As I have indicated, they arise from detailed consideration by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. I interpolate to say that I suspect they in fact arise from detailed consideration by officials reporting to the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. The highest profile issue is that of suppression and non-publication orders, which vary considerably across Australian jurisdictions. Moves to harmonise the rules in favour of open justice should generally be supported.


The bill was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, which reported on 22 March and unanimously recommended that the bill be passed. I want to say a couple of things about the evidence given to the committee. The suppression and non-publication orders in schedule 2 of the bill are modelled on the Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act 2010 of New South Wales, which is the template for other jurisdictions to follow. The vexatious proceedings provisions in schedule 3 of the bill reflect the legislation that has been implemented in Queensland, New South Wales and the Northern Territory as a result of the SCAG process. 


The use of suppression and non-publication orders by Australian courts has been a matter of considerable controversy in recent years. Under the regime proposed by the bill, a suppression order is defined as 'an order that prohibits or restricts the disclosure of information by publication or otherwise' and a non-publication order is an order that prohibits or restricts the publication of information but does not otherwise prohibit or restrict the disclosure of information. The grounds for making an order will be that the order is necessary to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice; to prevent prejudice to the interests of the Commonwealth, a state or territory in relation to national or international security; and to protect the safety of any person and avoid any undue distress or embarrassment to a party or witness in criminal proceedings involving sexual offences, which is the new 102PF. The amendments provide that persons who may appear and be heard on an application are the applicant, a party, an Australian government, a news publisher or any other person who in the court's opinion has sufficient interest in the matter. The contravention of an order is an offence with a penalty of 12 months imprisonment, 60 penalty units or both. In deciding whether or not to make an order the court is obliged to take into account that a primary objective of the administration of justice is to safeguard open justice, namely public hearings. That is not an absolute value; there are circumstances, as you know, Madam Acting Deputy President, in which it is appropriate for courts to take evidence in camera, but those circumstances are rare indeed and ought to be recognised as narrowly circumscribed exceptions to a strongly defended general rule.


Australia's Right to Know, representing the media, submitted to the committee that there were too many and unjustified orders being made, noting an increase in such orders since the passing of the New South Wales act. In its response the Attorney-General's Department could not comment on the reasons for such increases but submitted that it did not anticipate an increase in such orders in the federal courts as a result of the bill's provisions.


Turning to the vexatious proceedings amendments, vexatious proceedings are defined to include proceedings that are an abuse of the process of a court or tribunal; proceedings instituted to harass or annoy, to cause delay or detriment or for another wrongful purpose; proceedings instituted or pursued without reasonable grounds; and proceedings conducted in a court or tribunal in a way so as to harass or annoy, cause delay or detriment or achieve another wrongful purpose. As the definition uses the word 'include', these points should be read disjunctively, namely all or any one of them may apply to a particular case. As the explanatory memorandum states, the definition of vexatious proceedings is an inclusive definition which lists some examples of various kinds of proceedings which could give rise to a vexatious proceedings order. Let me pause to say that litigants with a valid claim are perfectly free to seek vindication by going to the law. For that reason vexatious proceedings orders that seek to restrain proceedings which are otherwise properly made out and properly pleaded are orders that should never be made. They should only be made in circumstances where there is genuinely an abuse of the court's process so that the court is being put upon as a vehicle to traduce another citizen.


Concerns were raised in submissions to the committee about the proposed provisions limiting the ability of the Family Court of Australia to make such orders because of the expression 'proceedings under this act'. The Family Court has some original jurisdiction outside the Family Law Act. The Attorney-General's Department submitted that the intent of the wording is to prevent family law vexatious litigants from making vexatious proceedings under the Family Law Act in multiple courts, for example in the Federal Magistrates Court or the Family Court of Western Australia, rather than limit the Family Court's powers to make such orders. The family law jurisdiction is of course a very difficult jurisdiction in which essentially there are no winners. It deals with people in circumstances which are inherently distressing and as well as the parties before it it deals with children in distressing circumstances through no fault of their own. In that sense, family law proceedings are always vexed proceedings, but that does not make them vexatious proceedings. The term 'vexatious' has a technical meaning in the law which is much more specific and confined than the meaning in ordinary speech.


As I said at the start, the coalition is pleased to support the bill. My only cavil, one I have raised before in this place, is with the misleading nature of the short title of the bill. The government talks a big game when it comes to access to justice. However, its record on access to justice is in fact lamentable. Over the past five years, the Rudd and Gillard governments have increased court fees, starved the courts of resources, sought to abolish and then abandoned the attempt to abolish the Federal Magistrates Court, the most efficient and lowest cost federal court, and sought to introduce new levels of complexity and cost into family law. As I said earlier this year, the Gillard government's attitude to accessible justice is to charge more and provide less.


Not only does this make a mockery of the government's self-serving rhetoric; it reflects a more disturbing approach that reflects a fundamental disrespect for the separation of powers. The courts are not an agency of the executive government. They should not be treated as such. They are a separate institution of government, and they must be sufficiently resourced to perform their constitutional functions and preserve their constitutional integrity.


The amendments made by this bill are welcome. Measures to harmonise the law, provide flexibility in pre-trial procedures and increase transparency are worthwhile aims. However, to describe these amendments explicitly as 'access to justice measures' is pure spin, which risks devaluing the concept and calls into question the government's understanding of the problem. Best to be less heroic and more modest in our entitling of legislation and accept that this bill is a bill about technical aspects of court procedure. I commend the bill to the Senate.

Senator FAULKNER
 (New South Wales) (22:00):  'There is nothing in Australian history to compare with that China visit.' Those are not my words; they are the words of Dr Stephen Fitzgerald, Australia's pre-eminent authority on China and our first ambassador to the People's Republic of China. He is referring to Gough Whitlam's 1971 mission to Beijing, a mission Whitlam himself described as the most exciting and exacting he ever made. The 21st of December this year will mark 40 years since the Whitlam government formally recognised and established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. Gough Whitlam was the first member of the Australian parliament to call for recognition of the PRC as 'one China' and, in mid-1971, as leader of the Australian Labor Party, he was the first Australian political leader, and one of the first Western leaders, to reach out to China.


It was characteristic Whitlam courage and vision that motivated his politically daring adventure to the Great Hall of the People in Beijing for a midnight meeting with Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai in July 1971. At the time, under the dark cloud of Cold War politics, of the Vietnam War and in the mind of many a contrived threat from China, sections of the Australian community were deeply fearful of the insidious and relentless growth of communism in our region. This was of course the time of 'reds under the bed', when former Prime Minister Menzies ran a fear campaign based on the red and yellow hordes pouring down from Asia, and Billy McMahon warned of the Australian Labor Party being tools of the Chinese communists. The former federal president of the Australian Labor Party and Queensland parliamentarian Tom Burns, who joined Gough Whitlam on that first visit to China, called the visit, in the context of international relations and domestic concerns at the time, 'real gutsy politics'.


After a long journey to Beijing, through Hong Kong and Canton, the travelling party arrived at the Great Hall of the People for a midnight meeting with the Premier. Gough Whitlam sparred diplomatically and intellectually with the renowned Chinese leader Premier Zhou. Differences in views and policies were explained and clarified, and assurances were secured on trade—particularly Australian wheat sales. And, Gough being Gough, discussion with the Chinese Premier was not limited to politics, economics, or trade. Topics ranging from Greek mythology to the French Revolution were also canvassed. A sceptical Liberal Prime Minister back in Australia, Billy McMahon, announced that Zhou 'had Mr Whitlam on a hook and he played him as a fisherman plays a trout'. 


But, as they so often do, world events took a dramatic twist—and, as Tommy Burns put it, 'pulled the rug right out from under McMahon's feet'. Four days after Gough Whitlam's visit, US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger arrived in Beijing on a secret mission to meet the Chinese Premier. Secretary Kissinger famously reported back to President Nixon, 'The process we have now started will send shock waves around the world'. It certainly did. On 15 July 1971, President Nixon announced to an astonished world that the United States intended to formally recognise the People's Republic of China and the president would visit Beijing the following year. By October, the General Assembly of the United Nations had decided by more than a two-thirds majority to recognise the PRC. And, to the growing embarrassment of the McMahon government, the People's Republic of China established formal diplomatic relations with Canada, Japan, and 10 European countries, including Great Britain and Germany.


On 5 December 1972, the day the first Whitlam government was sworn in, Gough Whitlam announced that he had instructed our ambassador in Paris to open negotiations with his Chinese counterpart. The joint communique was signed on 21 December, just three weeks after the election. The following year, 1973, strengthening our relationship further, Prime Minister Whitlam met with Chairman Mao in Beijing.


Our relationship with China has come a long way since the formalisation of diplomatic relations 40 years ago. China's economic growth has been phenomenal, and Australia too has enjoyed extraordinary economic growth since 1972. After significant reforms in both countries during the 1980s our terms of trade are burgeoning. But the Australia-China relationship is increasingly deeper and more meaningful than just economics and trade. Our social and cultural relationship grows stronger, with increasing numbers of Chinese students, professionals and tourists visiting our shores every year. Likewise, growing numbers of Australians are heading to China every year.


The Whitlam government's formal diplomatic recognition of China in 1972 was a significant milestone in Australian foreign policy. It was truly visionary and it was the starting point for the flourishing and prosperous relationship we enjoy with China today. The 40th anniversary of formal diplomatic relations between Australia and China, to be celebrated on 21 December this year, is a very important milestone in the history of both countries and I believe it warrants due acknowledgement in this parliament.
