"Nehl, Garry, MP",NP,2000-03-06,"—I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to Tonga, the Cook Islands and the first Pacific Community Conference in French Polynesia, 27 November to 9 December 1999. I am pleased to table the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to Tonga, the Cook Islands and the first Pacific Community Conference held in French Polynesia. Unfortunately, I was required to attend the sittings of the House of Representatives which commenced on 6 December 1999 and, therefore, to my regret, I was unable to attend the historic first meeting of the Pacific Community Conference. Accordingly, the member for Robertson, Mr Jim Lloyd, became the official Australian government spokesman at the conference in my place. I understand he proposes to address his remarks substantially to this part of the delegation's activities. Therefore, I will concentrate my comments on the bilateral visits to Tonga and the Cook Islands, although, with limited time, I can make only a few general comments and touch on a couple of the more notable highlights of the visit.
The delegation undertook an extensive program of meetings with parliamentary, government and business representatives in both Tonga and the Cook Islands. These meetings enabled the delegation to foster and strengthen existing ties between our countries and to gain an appreciation of the ambitions and needs of our hosts. The visits also gave the delegation members an opportunity to assess at first hand the success of AusAID projects in the region and to try to gauge whether the limited funding that is available for aid is being put to good use. The delegation's visit started inauspiciously on the Saturday evening, with several pieces of luggage failing to arrive in Tonga. Sunday flights are not permitted because of Tonga's Sabbath observance and we had to wait until Monday afternoon to be reunited with our bags. Our hosts went out of their way to ensure that we were not too badly affected, including getting a local shopkeeper out of his bed—at about 20 to 12 on Saturday night—to enable us to buy essential items such as clothing.
The delegation spent three days in Tonga. In this time, we met with many people and organisations to discuss the system of government and the state of the economy. The highlight was, undoubtedly, an audience of some 90 minutes duration with the King of Tonga, His Majesty King Taufa'ahau Tupou IV at the Royal Palace. During our meeting His Majesty spoke at length about his time as a student at Newington College in Sydney, in particular his rowing and rugby playing exploits, and it was clear that he recalls his time in Australia with great pleasure.
Turning to the Cook Islands, the delegation shared its four-day visit between the main island of Rarotonga and the outer island of Aitutaki. The Cook Islands are internally self-governing but have a very close association with New Zealand. Its citizens hold New Zealand citizenship. Again the delegation met many island representatives and discussed political and economic issues. Australia's victory in the Rugby World Cup seemed to be mentioned with a degree of monotony, although often through gritted teeth, given the failure of their local heroes—the All Blacks. The Cook Islands government changed only two weeks before the delegation's arrival, amid claims of corruption and mismanagement on the part of their predecessors. The delegation met the new Prime Minister, Dr Terepai Maoate, who, having been a parliamentarian for 15 years, emphasised his appreciation of Australia's past assistance. Having reached something close to financial ruin in 1995, the Cook Islands government, under Maoate's leadership, appear to have the resolve to get to grips with the fundamental problems they face.
I wish to address two broad issues relating to Australia's relationship with the small Pacific Island nations such as Tonga and the Cook Islands: firstly, AusAID programs and, secondly, the Pacific Patrol Boat Program. The delegation examined two of AusAID's projects in Tonga which were aimed at improving the delivery of health and tourism services and a water supply project on the island of Aitutaki. It was clear to the delegation that these projects were highly valued by the local residents and that Australia's efforts were greatly appreciated. On the delegation's behalf, let me state our strong support for the continuation of projects of this nature. 
The delegation also visited the patrol boat facilities in both Tonga and the Cook Islands. The program is about two-thirds through its scheduled life and is currently being reviewed by a consultant on the government's behalf. It was clear to the delegation that these boats play a very valuable role in the lives of the small island nations and we believe the government should give serious consideration to continuing the Pacific Patrol Boat Program.
I believe the delegation was a great success. I wish to acknowledge the significant contributions of my colleague Jim Lloyd and the member for Greenway, Frank Mossfield, and his wife Mrs Jan Mossfield, in ensuring that success. I also thank the delegation secretary, Michael McLean, for performing his role in a highly efficient manner.",REPS,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,"<title>Delegation to Tonga, Cook Islands and French Polynesia</title>",Delegation Reports,0,1,speech
"Mossfield, Frank, MP",ALP,2000-03-06,"—It was my pleasure to be part of an Australian parliamentary delegation to Tonga, the Cook Islands and Tahiti between 27 November and 9 December. The delegation's meeting with the King and Prime Minister of Tonga and the new Prime Minister of the Cook Islands, Dr Terepai Maoate, and other senior ministers and public servants from both nations meant that personal friendships were established at the highest level. The delegation's meeting with the Tongan Minister for Health, Dr William Tangi, who retains a medical practice and has previously trained and practised in Australia, enabled us to receive a report on an AusAID project in Tonga which is aimed at improving the health sector administration in that country. We also met with the Director of Tourism and discussed the tourist project funded by AusAID. The delegation was informed that the NSW TAFE were conducting a number of tourism courses on behalf of the government of Tonga. The delegation also had informal discussions with Australians working in a voluntary capacity assisting with disability and health programs.
A person who was of particular assistance to the delegation was Ms Fatai Pale, who was one of the presiding officers in the Tongan parliament and was part of the Speaker's welcoming committee that met our delegation at Nukualofa airport and continued to provide assistance to the delegation during our stay in Tonga. Also of assistance was the Australian High Commissioner in Tonga, Andrew Mullin, and Mrs Mullin who included the delegation in their farewell function. This enabled us to meet local and expatriate workers in many fields, which helped to improve our knowledge of the general Tongan community. The assistance of Mr Peter Brooks, an Australian High Commission officer in Fiji, was also appreciated.
During our visit to the Cook Islands, we were able to meet with the new Prime Minister and a number of ministers, and the Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Immigration, Mr Edwin Pittman. These were important contacts, as the new government is settling in after being in opposition for a considerable period of time. One issue raised in our discussions was the number of skilled people who were leaving the islands and settling in New Zealand and Australia. The Cook Islands authorities indicated that they were concerned about the loss from the local skills base. It is estimated that some 50,000 Cook Islanders live abroad, mainly in New Zealand and Australia. The remittance from people living abroad is, nevertheless, important to the islands' economy.
One of the ministers who was of particular help to the delegation was the Hon. Ngamau Munokoa—or `Aunty Mau', as the Minister for Public Works in Dr Maoate's government was known to her constituents. The question was asked: why were there no women in the Australian delegation? I felt that the fact that one of the delegate's wives accompanied her spouse and took an active interest in the delegation's activities provided for a more informal communication with our hosts.
The main AusAID project inspected in the Cook Islands was the overhauling of the freshwater reticulation system on the resort island of Aitutaki. In our inspection, our delegation had the assistance of Mr Bruce Dudgeon, an Australian engineer who is an adviser to the project, and Mr Ross Sansom, AusAID project coordinator for the Cook Islands. Australia's involvement includes project management, employment of local workers, purchasing of reticulation equipment and ongoing monitoring. The project is for a four-year period, at a cost of $1.04 million, and is due to be completed in October 2000. The purpose of this project is to provide the local population with a reliable freshwater supply and to provide for an expansion of the island's tourism and agricultural industries. 
Another issue that was brought home to the delegation while on the island of Aitutaki was the shortage of basic medical supplies at the local hospital. The husband and wife Burmese doctors who were the senior medical staff at the hospital were very appreciative of the whip-round that was organised amongst the delegation, which produced a supply of pain relief supplies and other basic medical supplies for the hospital's use that were surplus to the needs of the delegation.
I would like to thank Mr Michael McLean, the delegation's secretary, for his assistance and the leader of the delegation, the member for Cowper, and the member for Robertson for their pleasant companionship during the trip. I am sure our visit will contribute to the goodwill and understanding between the governments and people of these island nations and Australia.",REPS,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,"<title>Delegation to Tonga, Cook Islands and French Polynesia</title>",Delegation Reports,0,1,speech
"Lloyd, Jim, MP",LP,2000-03-06,"—I am pleased to make some comments in relation to the report of the delegation's trip to Tonga, the Cook Islands and French Polynesia. As indicated in the remarks from the member for Cowper, I took on the role of head of delegation for the official Australian government delegation at the First Pacific Community Conference in Papeete, French Polynesia. I will largely restrict my remarks to that conference's proceedings. I am very grateful for having been given the opportunity to take on such an important role on my country's behalf. I have also been the Chair of the IPU for the Pacific Island Nations and Papua New Guinea since November 1998, and I am sure that my experiences in Papeete will prove invaluable to me in that role in the future.
As is described in the delegation report, the First Pacific Community Conference was in fact the 38th in the sequence of conferences previously known as the South Pacific Conference, or SPC. The change of title to Pacific Community Conference was adopted at the 37th SPC, which was held in Canberra in 1997 to commemorate the fact that it coincided with the 50th anniversary of the first meeting in 1947 which was also held in Canberra. As an indicator of the development over the last 50 years, in 1947 there were just six inaugural SPC members. The Pacific Community now has 27 members, and the conference in Papeete was attended by 25 of those 27 members, which is a positive indicator of the high regard in which it is held by the member nations.
The conference itself is akin to the board of directors for the organisation's operational arm, the Secretariat of the Pacific Community, which has responsibility for the administration of a budget of some US$25 million. This naming of the organisation's central body has rather cleverly retained the SPC acronym, thereby ensuring that its positive reputation built over many years will live into the future.
The conference was held on Monday, 6 December and Tuesday, 7 December, in the Outrigger Hotel at Papeete on the beautiful French Polynesian island of Tahiti-Nui. The day before the conference began, a formal flag raising ceremony was held in central Papeete involving the presentation of each member nation's flag and anthem followed by a spectacular display of Polynesian dancing and music.
Because Australia had hosted the previous SPC meeting in Canberra, under the conference rules I was the incumbent conference chair and it fell to me to perform the function of officially opening the conference. That was a particularly significant personal role for me and I certainly enjoyed the opportunity. In my opening remarks, I noted that the title `Ta'imoana', given to the conference by our French Polynesian hosts, which means `sounds that come from across the water', was particularly apt for the occasion given that it was from the shores of French Polynesia that the ancient Polynesian navigators had set out on their long journeys. 
I do not have the time to go into the conference program in detail. However, one highlight for me was to see the success of an Australian, Mr Bob Dun, as the SPC's Director-General. It is clear that Bob was held in the highest regard for his achievements during his four-year term, which was scheduled to conclude last month. Bob will be returning to life in Canberra with his family and, I understand, much lower telephone bills. I wish to record my best wishes for Bob's future career and also to wish his successor, Ms Lourdes Pangelinan, well in her new appointment.
I would like to conclude by thanking those who contributed to the success of the delegation through their assistance: the Hon. Gary Robertson MLA, Minister for Tourism and Commerce for the Norfolk Island government, and the DFAT officers, Mr Joe Thwaites and Ms Kirsty Mitchell, and AusAID's Geoff Miller. I would also like to thank Mick McLean who was also of great assistance to us, and Mr Gary Nehl, Mr Frank Mossfield and his wife Jan for their companionship and assistance during the trip. It was very much appreciated. I would also to thank Minister Downer and the Prime Minister for giving me this opportunity. I realise that it is a fairly rare opportunity for a backbencher to head a delegation of this significance and to represent Australia at a conference of such international importance. I hope that I carried out the role in a way which has enhanced Australia's role in this region.",REPS,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,"<title>Delegation to Tonga, Cook Islands and French Polynesia</title>",Delegation Reports,0,1,speech
"Hollis, Colin, MP",ALP,2000-03-06,"—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I present the committee report on our visit to East Timor on 2 December 1999, together with the minutes of the proceedings.
Ordered that the report be printed. 
—This visit was particularly timely for the committee not only for the foreign affairs implications but because it covered areas of two other inquiries that the committee is currently involved in. The first inquiry covers the suitability of the Australian Army for peacetime, peacekeeping and war, and the second covers our relationship with the UN. Of course, it also covers the important work the committee does on human rights.
Despite the media coverage of Timor, nothing prepares you for the senseless destruction that became so much a part of the life there, not only in Dili but also in other parts that we visited such as Suai. There has been some discussion on possible changes to the Australian defence forces. I believe that our defence personnel have performed magnificently in Timor. They had no idea when they arrived of what to expect on the ground or whether they would be forced into a confrontation with the Indonesian military or the militia. Despite this, they carried out, and continue to carry out, their role. When we talk about our troops there, we should bear in mind that most of them are only young—18-, 19-, or 20-year-old men and women. They have done Australia and its defence forces proud.
There has been some debate in recent days about military training and if the correct emphasis is placed on training, whether it is for peacekeeping or for combat areas. The debate has been made more interesting by the New Zealand Prime Minister's statement last week that New Zealand troops would place a particular emphasis on a peacekeeping role. I am firmly of the view that troops trained for combat can readily adapt to the peacekeeping role. I am not so convinced that the reverse is true. While we are all justifiably proud of the role our forces played in East Timor—and they will be honoured at a luncheon in this building tomorrow—many important issues for Australia have been thrown up by the Timor situation. What would have happened if our forces had had to be replaced by the same number of troops, or what if Australia were committed to other responsibilities at troop level of the same number, or what if another conflict had emerged in this increasingly conflict ridden part of the world? Australia certainly would not have been able to provide two forces of the same strength as were provided in Timor. I suspect that Timor will become like the Falkland Island war. Whatever it is you may wish to prove or indeed disprove, you will be able to make reference to the events in East Timor. 
Although the committee was only in Timor for a short time, our visit was well planned and coordinated. One area of concern that did emerge and has become more obvious since our visit is that there are large numbers of aid agencies there. It seems that for domestic purposes every agency wants a presence in Timor. I believe this will inevitably lead to a duplication of efforts. There must be more coordination between aid agencies, but most importantly there must be a strong local Timorese presence in the planning, coordination and work of the relief effort. No-one should dictate to the Timorese or indeed impose their cultural values on them. Geography and history dictate that we will have a close relationship with this new nation, but it will be a nation whose destiny will be decided by the Timorese. It is too easy for us to bring our own local preconceived ideas on development or what we think is needed. Aid agencies must work with the Timorese. They must let the Timorese determine the pace and direction of future developments. 
I wish to thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs for making this visit possible, and the Minister for Defence for providing air transport. I also thank the committee secretariat and other members of the committee. I thank the committee secretary, Margaret Swieringa, for another outstanding report. I know that for each member the East Timor visit was profoundly moving and a rewarding experience. I hope our report will make a contribution to the ongoing debate on East Timor. In the years ahead, East Timor will figure prominently in Australia's strategic and economic thinking. We managed to ignore what happened in Timor for too long. A price has been paid for this. Hopefully Australia has learnt a lesson. I must say that the Timor people have suffered dreadfully to achieve their independence.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade  Committee</title>",Committees,1,1,speech
"Jull, David, MP",LP,2000-03-06,"—I too would like to make some comments in relation to the tabling of this report as I served as a member of the group that went to East Timor in early December last year. I commend the member for Throsby for some of the points that he made. I know that my colleague following will also be talking about some of the human rights aspects of what went on and what will go on in the future in East Timor. I also commend to the House the publication of a book by the Hon. Tim Fischer. I read his book during the recent parliamentary break, and I think it is quite a good introduction for anyone here who is thinking of reading this particular report because it does build up the scenario in which Australia found itself when our forces first went into East Timor in September of last year. 
The member for Throsby is perfectly correct when he said that nobody really has any idea of the total destruction and devastation that is East Timor. I think that all members of the delegation, especially those who had been there for the vote, found this just by driving into Dili. In fact, Dili is probably not necessarily the greatest example of what went on. I think I have worked out why we get no concept of the range of the destruction: it is simply because we have seen it on television. Virtually the entire footage came from Dili itself and most of it is taken at ground level. It is not really until you take off in a helicopter and get into the countryside and see these great areas of burnt out villages, and the utter destruction and devastation that has gone on, that it really comes home to you just how thorough the destruction has been and the tremendous challenge that is before the East Timorese as they try to build their new nation.
I also commend the Australian troops. I know that accolades have been given to them all over the place but I think that at every opportunity we should praise the efforts they made. One of the highlights of this visit by members of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs Defence and Trade was the fact that we managed to go down to Suai, which was indeed one of the hot spots near the border, to meet with our troops, who were operating in the most appalling conditions. We were there at lunchtime. The heat was 40 degrees, and I would hate to think what the relative humidity was—if it was 290 per cent I would not have been surprised. The troops were there in full battle fatigues. They were headquartered in the old courthouse, which had been burnt out and virtually destroyed. The only protection they had was galvanised iron, and all these people working their hearts out in the most appalling conditions. Yes, all of a sudden they had been granted access to some provisions that had come up in refrigerated containers, but for something like nine weeks they had endured on basic army rations. There was nothing for them to do in terms of any sort of recreational activity. There was nothing in the town to do, and they were working very long hours and very long days. But there was that sense of determination and that sense that they were achieving a great deal, and I think that we must be particularly proud of the efforts they made and, of course, particularly proud of the work of Peter Cosgrove, who has been lauded not only in this country but also around the world for his particular contribution to that effort. 
The challenge for East Timor in the future is enormous. One of the things that came through to the committee as we were driving around some of these areas of destruction was the tremendous warmth of the reception that we received from the locals. The V for victory sign was there, and the graffiti on the wall praised Australia and New Zealand for their particular efforts. There is no doubt that these people are thankful. But theirs is a tremendous challenge, one for which we must be sympathetic. I agree with the member for Throsby about the coordination of the aid efforts. Something must be done so that we do not get duplication because the needs are going to be just so great. The challenge for Australia will be there for many years to come. We are already there once more with the United Nations forces, and one would hope that we will have the capacity to be able to sit back and give help where it is required and when it is asked for, and that the East Timorese themselves will have the capacity to be able to build their own nation, one which will be truly free, independent and, hopefully, democratic.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade  Committee</title>",Committees,1,1,speech
"Nugent, Peter, MP",LP,2000-03-06,"—I support the comments of the previous two speakers, the gentlemen from Throsby and Fadden. The first point I would make is that I think it is important that the parliament, in addition to ministers, the executive, the bureaucrats and officials and so on, actually does go out and inspect where our troops are deployed and come back with a first-hand view of what has been going on. Therefore, we were appreciative of the opportunity for 10 members of our committee to go to East Timor last December.
As has already been said, the performance of our troops has been outstanding in very difficult and trying conditions. Whilst we say that, and I do not want to take away anything from the performance of our defence forces, I think we also need to acknowledge, however, that they were up against a situation where they had been invited into the place and, although there were difficulties with the militia and some difficulties with the TNI on the Indonesian side, our troops have been trained for war. Clearly their opponents were not particularly competent in a war situation; they were much more attuned to a civil disturbance situation. The two things are different, and therefore our troops were able to very quickly establish a military ascendancy. They did that competently and efficiently.
One of the questions that it raises, when we look at the difficulty we had in mustering the numbers and the extra defence budget we have now had to come up with, is that we do need to look at what our role is going to be in the region, if any. We therefore need to look, once we have decided that strategic view, at the tactical issues of what shape and size our defence forces ought to be. Whilst we performed outstandingly in East Timor, I think it does in fact prompt some further questions that this country needs to pay attention to.
We should also acknowledge the contribution of other countries. I think it is important that, in the euphoria about how well we did, we need to recognise that we performed as part of a United Nations force and that many other countries were there on the ground with us. There is also no question in my view, gained as I travelled around the region—and I have talked to many visitors from overseas in particular in the last couple of months—that the action we have taken there has immeasurably improved Australia's standing as a country in this region of the world. 
Other speakers have mentioned the extent of the destruction in Dili and there is no question that, from a helicopter, you get a very good view of that sort of destruction. As we went into Suai, which is a town of about 10,000 or 12,000 people, we could see that every single building was absolutely burnt out—no roof, no doorways and no window frames. They were just burned out hulks. Where there had been wooden buildings there were just scorch marks on the ground. So the situation and the devastation there is absolutely complete, and we are talking now about East Timor having to rebuild its society from the ground up. The spirit of the people is good. The spirit of relationships between the Australian troops and the local people is outstandingly good. Of course, now we are seeing the country move into a new phase. The new part of the United Nations mandate has taken hold. There are still, however, some key issues. One of those I think is that we still need to address more vigorously the problem of refugees who are still in West Timor. Secondly, we need to be conscious that we now have a lot of particularly young men back in East Timor who really have no employment and nothing very much to do. I think we will start to see some terrible social issues unless the United Nations can get the economy working fairly quickly.
In terms of the aid organisations, I echo the comments of my colleagues. I think there is also a need to look at the impact of the training of our military. It is quite clear that, whilst we are very good as a war fighting force, there is a need for some special training for this peacekeeping type of operation. Frankly, if it had not been for the special expertise shipped in from the United States, we would have found ourselves deficient in that regard, and we need to look at that. As a quick aside, let me say that one of our bodyguards in fact was a lady soldier. Whilst probably in an ideal world that should not be something remarkable to comment on, there is no question that, culturally, as a former serviceman I found it a change, but it is something to be welcomed. 
We met with the United Nations human rights team, who were conducting an investigation of abuses of human rights. There is no question that there have been human rights abuses on a huge scale. We must support the United Nations in its investigations, and also Indonesia in its investigations, and pursue those who are responsible for those abuses. Apart from the troops, we should also remember the police and others who served in the East Timor area. For many months before the civilian police were in there, and we need to recognise them as well. I commend the report to the House.

Yes, all of a sudden they had been granted access to some provisions that had come up in refrigerated containers, but for something like nine weeks they had endured on basic army rations. There was nothing for them to do in terms of any sort of recreational activity. There was nothing in the town to do, and they were working very long hours and very long days. But there was that sense of determination and that sense that they were achieving a great deal, and I think that we must be particularly proud of the efforts they made and, of course, particularly proud of the work of Peter Cosgrove, who has been lauded not only in this country but also around the world for his particular contribution to that effort. 
The challenge for East Timor in the future is enormous. One of the things that came through to the committee as we were driving around some of these areas of destruction was the tremendous warmth of the reception that we received from the locals. The V for victory sign was there, and the graffiti on the wall praised Australia and New Zealand for their particular efforts. There is no doubt that these people are thankful. But theirs is a tremendous challenge, one for which we must be sympathetic. I agree with the member for Throsby about the coordination of the aid efforts. Something must be done so that we do not get duplication because the needs are going to be just so great. The challenge for Australia will be there for many years to come. We are already there once more with the United Nations forces, and one would hope that we will have the capacity to be able to sit back and give help where it is required and when it is asked for, and that the East Timorese themselves will have the capacity to be able to build their own nation, one which will be truly free, independent and, hopefully, democratic.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,1,2,speech
"Nugent, Peter, MP",LP,2000-03-06,"—I support the comments of the previous two speakers, the gentlemen from Throsby and Fadden. The first point I would make is that I think it is important that the parliament, in addition to ministers, the executive, the bureaucrats and officials and so on, actually does go out and inspect where our troops are deployed and come back with a first-hand view of what has been going on. Therefore, we were appreciative of the opportunity for 10 members of our committee to go to East Timor last December.
As has already been said, the performance of our troops has been outstanding in very difficult and trying conditions. Whilst we say that, and I do not want to take away anything from the performance of our defence forces, I think we also need to acknowledge, however, that they were up against a situation where they had been invited into the place and, although there were difficulties with the militia and some difficulties with the TNI on the Indonesian side, our troops have been trained for war. Clearly their opponents were not particularly competent in a war situation; they were much more attuned to a civil disturbance situation. The two things are different, and therefore our troops were able to very quickly establish a military ascendancy. They did that competently and efficiently.
One of the questions that it raises, when we look at the difficulty we had in mustering the numbers and the extra defence budget we have now had to come up with, is that we do need to look at what our role is going to be in the region, if any. We therefore need to look, once we have decided that strategic view, at the tactical issues of what shape and size our defence forces ought to be. Whilst we performed outstandingly in East Timor, I think it does in fact prompt some further questions that this country needs to pay attention to.
We should also acknowledge the contribution of other countries. I think it is important that, in the euphoria about how well we did, we need to recognise that we performed as part of a United Nations force and that many other countries were there on the ground with us. There is also no question in my view, gained as I travelled around the region—and I have talked to many visitors from overseas in particular in the last couple of months—that the action we have taken there has immeasurably improved Australia's standing as a country in this region of the world. 
Other speakers have mentioned the extent of the destruction in Dili and there is no question that, from a helicopter, you get a very good view of that sort of destruction. As we went into Suai, which is a town of about 10,000 or 12,000 people, we could see that every single building was absolutely burnt out—no roof, no doorways and no window frames. They were just burned out hulks. Where there had been wooden buildings there were just scorch marks on the ground. So the situation and the devastation there is absolutely complete, and we are talking now about East Timor having to rebuild its society from the ground up. The spirit of the people is good. The spirit of relationships between the Australian troops and the local people is outstandingly good. Of course, now we are seeing the country move into a new phase. The new part of the United Nations mandate has taken hold. There are still, however, some key issues. One of those I think is that we still need to address more vigorously the problem of refugees who are still in West Timor. Secondly, we need to be conscious that we now have a lot of particularly young men back in East Timor who really have no employment and nothing very much to do. I think we will start to see some terrible social issues unless the United Nations can get the economy working fairly quickly.
In terms of the aid organisations, I echo the comments of my colleagues. I think there is also a need to look at the impact of the training of our military. It is quite clear that, whilst we are very good as a war fighting force, there is a need for some special training for this peacekeeping type of operation. Frankly, if it had not been for the special expertise shipped in from the United States, we would have found ourselves deficient in that regard, and we need to look at that. As a quick aside, let me say that one of our bodyguards in fact was a lady soldier. Whilst probably in an ideal world that should not be something remarkable to comment on, there is no question that, culturally, as a former serviceman I found it a change, but it is something to be welcomed. 
We met with the United Nations human rights team, who were conducting an investigation of abuses of human rights. There is no question that there have been human rights abuses on a huge scale. We must support the United Nations in its investigations, and also Indonesia in its investigations, and pursue those who are responsible for those abuses. Apart from the troops, we should also remember the police and others who served in the East Timor area. For many months before the civilian police were in there, and we need to recognise them as well. I commend the report to the House.

"Baird, Bruce, MP",LP,2000-03-06,"—I move:
That this House acknowledges Rugby League as one of Australia's national sports and congratulates the players, referees, fans and administrators of the game on:
(1) the expansion of Rugby League into non-traditional geographic areas during recent years;
(2) the establishment of a Rugby League Foundation which will provide additional funding to junior development in regional areas of NSW and Queensland;
(3) the victory of the Melbourne Storm in the 1999 National Rugby League Grand Final in only its second year of operation;
(4) a rise in average game attendances of 30% in 1999 with over 3 million Australians attending NRL games in 1999; and
(5) the successful implementation of the 1997 peace plan between the Australian Rugby League and Super League which will see the NRL conduct a 14 team national competition in 2000.
It is my pleasure to move this motion today and to congratulate rugby league on its enormous achievement as one of the premier sports in Australia today. There is no doubt that rugby league has expanded into non-traditional, geographic areas during recent years—and, of course, we welcome the Storm's great achievements during this past year to become the premiers. That is the first time they have done so. To do so so quickly after they entered the league was an incredible success, and they did it because of their incredible skills, as has been demonstrated only within the last week. There has also been the establishment of the Rugby League Foundation, which provides additional funding to junior development in regional areas of New South Wales and Queensland, a rise in average game attendance of 30 per cent in 1999, with over three million Australians attending National Rugby League games in 1999, and the successful implementation of the 1997 peace plan with the Australian Rugby League, which will see the NRL conduct a 14-team national competition in 2000.
There has been much negativity focused on the NRL and on the competition by a relatively small disenfranchised group of fans. I thought it was important to put this motion to the House to give the debate some sense of perspective. It is important to commend the NRL for all that it is doing for rugby league, and there is certainly much to commend the NRL for. Rugby league has entered a new era, with the future looking very good for the sport. Last year, average game attendances were up 30 per cent, with over three million people now attending games annually. Television ratings in New South Wales and Queensland are up 20 per cent from pre NRL times. Sales of merchandise, including jerseys and beanies, et cetera, are up 150 per cent to nearly $40 million. Sponsors like Kellogg's and FAI have been signed up in recent weeks, office tipping competitions are growing and the health of the game has never been stronger. The New South Wales government has put out a report on last year's grand final. It found that the grand final contributed $19 million to the state's economy. Rugby league can take much of the credit that one of the growth sectors in the Australian economy is sports tourism.
Contrary to popular myth, rugby league has not become only about money; one need only look at the passion it still inspires in local communities, like in my electorate and the Sutherland shire. The Sharks are a real community team. The club is one of the area's biggest employers. Most of the first grade team members are locals, having grown up in the shire. Other sports like local netball and cricket are affiliated with and are promoted by the rugby league club, and currently the administration is looking at fostering sports like soccer in the summer. The Sharks bring a lot of tourism to Cronulla. The players are heavily involved in junior league development and make trips to visit sick kids in hospital. I met one such young lad from a country hospital a few weeks ago and his grandfather said if it had not been for the visit of the captain, ET—Andrew Ettingshausen—he doubted whether the young guy would have pulled through. This is the type of team they are and this is their level of involvement in the community. 
I have heard the member for Grayndler speak in this place about the Sharks' financial position when eulogising the non-inclusion of his team, South Sydney, in the competition. The Sharks was the natural choice because of its strong financial record, the team's performance and its fan base. In the 1997 financial year the Sharks group's net operating profit was $2.18 million. In the last financial year, as just announced at the annual general meeting, the Sharks' net operating profit was $3.31 million. The team has played very well, being the minor premiers last year, `Shark Park' is a great place for the community to go on a Saturday night and the electorate is well behind the team. In 1998, it was Sydney's No. 1 club in terms of crowd attendance rates, with an average crowd of over 14,000 per game last year. Of course, there have been joint ventures in terms of the West Tigers, the Northern Eagles and St George-Illawarra. St George-Illawarra made it to the grand final last year. The West Tigers' first trial game this year attracted 12,000 supporters.
I have a great deal of sympathy for the supporters of Souths, a foundation team with a passionate support base but with a chronically poor financial record. I accept the NRL's position that it was better to make this hard but fair decision rather than let the club wither and die on the vine. The door is still open to Souths to enter the NRL competition through a joint venture. The logical choice would be with Sydney Roosters because of the club's strong financial base.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rugby League</title>,Private Members' Business,2,1,speech
"McClelland, Robert, MP",ALP,2000-03-06,"—I have pleasure in seconding the motion, and I congratulate my colleague on moving a worthwhile motion. I express my appreciation for his not commenting on last Friday night's game between St George-Illawarra Dragons and Melbourne Storm. On the subject matter of this motion, it was an imperative for the league to move to 14 teams on the basis of simple logistics. It was quite inappropriate to remain at 20 teams. During the 26-week competition of club games, it was not possible for each team to play each other twice. So you had a situation where, for instance, clubs would play a weaker club on two occasions, guaranteeing a virtual four points to that club, whereas others had to slog it out and battle for every point because each and every game was a tough game. It is inequitable to have a competition based on that situation, and it was quite unfair and did not achieve a fair result across the board. And the stakes are very high. To win a premiership, as Melbourne Storm did last year—I note the motion congratulates them on that victory—is a very significant thing, both in terms of pride to the club and the city and in terms of what it means for future financial success. So to win a premiership is a very significant thing.
I note that the member for Cook was gracious in noting the success of St George-Illawarra Dragons in their first year as a joint venture team. They were extremely successful and they really went into the grand final as favourites. They were beaten on the day, but I think they served the district, and themselves, with pride, and all with the solid backing and vision of the administrators behind them, Brian Johnston and Bobby Millward, who brought the two sides together so well. They show just what success can occur when resources are combined and focused.
In the current competition of 14 teams, each team gets to play each of the other teams on two occasions so that there is no unfairness. The other significant thing to bear in mind in the restructure of the competition is that there has always been a tension in rugby league to strike a balance between the interests of the media outlets and the clubs. The media outlets, of course, want people sitting down in their living-room chairs watching it on TV, but the reality is that the clubs receive most of their money through gate takings, through spectators going to the ground. So it has always been necessary for the clubs to focus on creating a spectacle. When you had a disparity of strength in the differing teams, it was difficult to guarantee a worthwhile contest for spectators to see. Now when people go to watch a rugby league game each and every player running out onto the field is an elite athlete. The reduction in teams last year certainly contributed to greater competition and higher crowds, and I am sure this year's figures will show that too. 
There is also a significant resource issue involved in the reduction of teams. Obviously, if the overall income of the game is divided among 14 teams, it will be a more significant slice of the cake than if it were divided among 20 teams, and that is important. This is not intended to be a political motion I know, but it is significant in the context where rugby league teams, sporting teams generally, are going to suffer a heavy burden with the introduction of the goods and services tax, because all the sponsorship money that they receive will effectively be diminished by 10 per cent. It will be important that they offset that loss of revenue as much as they can, and the reduction in the competition to 14 teams will at least partially, but certainly not totally, offset that impact from the GST. I would urge the government when they are considering the imposition of the goods and services tax on sporting teams to give sympathetic consideration to exempting the contribution which comes from registered clubs to the football clubs.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rugby League</title>,Private Members' Business,2,1,speech
"Somlyay, Alex, MP",LP,2000-03-06,"—I support the motion by the honourable member for Cook. Out of respect for my colleague the member for Barton, I was not going to mention the result last Friday night either, but it was good to see that Melbourne proved the victory in the grand final last year was no fluke. If the GST were applied to the score, it would have been 77, not 70.
If I had placed this motion on the Notice Paper, with respect to my colleague the member for Cook, I would have placed more emphasis on the bottom-line fact that, first and foremost, rugby league is a sport. Rugby league does not belong to anyone; it belongs to everyone. I grew up in the western suburbs of Sydney, in the Richmond district, which was part of the Parramatta Junior Rugby League district and is where I played all my junior football. I attended Patrician Brothers, Blacktown, where rugby league was a religion, revered only second to Catholicism. Sometimes I thought it was the other way round.
When I entered this parliament 10 years ago, I became an active member of the Parliamentary Rugby League Group. This group of parliamentarians existed to foster rugby league as a sport. The chairman of the group was a Labor MP, Steve Martin, and the vice-chairman was a National Party MP from Queensland, Ray Braithwaite. I do not recall many New South Wales or Queensland MPs who were not members of that group. We had regular meetings with league president Ken Arthurson and league general manager John Quayle. We had Neil and Meninga from the Raiders along and many other representatives from other clubs. There was real interest and passion among MPs in the interests of rugby league.
That group disappeared. The Super League drama killed rugby league, and rugby league became a pawn in the tug of war between corporate giants. The only motivation was big money of the corporates. Rugby league became entertainment, not sport. Forgotten were the fans and followers who were faithful to their teams and heroes year after year, who would attend games week after week, rain or shine. Then the crowds left. Suddenly it was time for peace and rebuilding. Hopefully, the corporate giants learned a very valuable lesson.
This motion is about peace, rebuilding and development in rugby league. Fundamental in the development of all sports is junior development. I do not mean only the talented juniors who are destined for high honours as elite players, who become big money commodities between the clubs. I mean the thousands of kids who start to play the game for the sake of sport, to be part of a team and to represent their towns or their schools. This motion is also about the dedicated parents who take their children to training and to different grounds week after week. It is about coaches, mostly former players, who love the game and are putting back a bit of themselves into the sport. 
We now have a 14-team competition in the NRL, sadly—I say this with all sincerity—without the presence of South Sydney. Rugby league is bigger than ever. The players are fitter and faster than ever and we have seen some games this year which have been absolute beauties. Not only is there rivalry between the clubs but rivalry between the states. Who would have predicted a Melbourne premiership, their achievement in 1999? I will finish on this note: no matter how big, successful and financial rugby league becomes, its future depends on juniors, and mums and dads, the schools and the volunteers.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2000-03-06,"—Perhaps the motive of the member for Cook in moving this motion arises from the problems he had when he made comments in February of last year about the Sydney Olympics and the deals that were done with media proprietors, and this is an attempt to resemble a human vacuum cleaner in regard to those media proprietors. But I suggest that it will not be successful. It also does not stand up to the facts. I want to acknowledge the presence in the gallery today of a great of the game, a legend, Mr Bernie Purcell, 1956 Kangaroo tourist, Australian representative and, of course, a legend of the mighty South Sydney rugby league team.
This motion fails to acknowledge the fundamental point which the member for Fairfax has emphasised today: that rugby league is a sport, not a big business. Rugby league is suffering from the fact that it is being run by the corporate dollar without regard to the greater shareholders of the game, the fans. If you examine the problems with rugby league at the moment, I think one particular fact that should be borne in mind is the Inside Sport survey in which people have been asked which of the following best describes their feelings about rugby league. It is back better than ever, 10.39 per cent; it is back as good as ever, 13.12 per cent; my interest is slowly returning, 14.44 per cent; I barely give a damn any more, 28.26 per cent; and RIP, 33.8 per cent of respondents. The game is hardly healthy when those sorts of poll results are there.
The member for Cook inadvertently I think misled the House by saying that somehow South Sydney had financial difficulties. The fact is that South Sydney have always paid their way and have not had the sponsorship of corporate giants such as News Ltd; unlike his team, the Sharks. It is notable that throughout his speech he referred to them as the Sharks. He spoke about local commitment and local involvement. Why is it that they have dropped Cronulla and Sutherland out of the name? What we are seeing is an attempt to de-suburbanise, to get rid of the geographical names from the sport and to make it such that it is just Sharks v. Panthers, Raiders v. Eagles and Bulldogs v. Eels. What that does is to take away the local community base that has been the basis of rugby league since 1908. We also have to look at the sponsorship that has occurred. 
Souths are not dead. South will be in court in June, represented very ably by Tom Hughes QC and Richard Whyte QC, with Nick Pappas the instructing solicitor. We will be in court because we believe that the criteria were grossly unfair. To give one example, in the last week it has come to light that the ACT government guaranteed the Canberra Raiders a subsidy of $1.37 million a year to play at Bruce Stadium. What that means is that no-one has to actually pay to get through the gate. One figure that is being cited is that the actual income the Raiders got from Bruce Stadium was $55,000 and the rest of it came from the ACT taxpayer, just as some $20 million was subsidised by the taxpayers, state and federal, to build the stadium on the Central Coast where the Northern Eagles now play some of their games. We have also seen shonky figures used throughout this debate. Last Friday night Chris Johns, one of the founders of Super League, was caught out when he announced the crowd at the opening game at the MCG to be 31,000. The MCG Trust got in touch with him and said, `Hang on a tick, there were actually 23,239 there.' It is typical of the fudging that has gone to justify the decision which had already been made to exclude South Sydney from the rugby league competition because they did not fit in with the determination, which had already been made before the criteria were established, to exclude South Sydney from the competition.
When sport simply becomes run by big business it loses the support of its fans. That is why we have had 50,000 people march in Sydney. That is why we have been able to raise $2 million. That is why at the concert we held with a bunch of old blokes, with due respect, playing touch footy at Redfern Oval, we drew 17,000 people whereas the double-header at the new Olympic stadium could draw—between them—only 60,000. We drew more for one team than those four combined. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rugby League</title>,Private Members' Business,2,1,speech
"Thomson, Andrew, MP",LP,2000-03-06,"—It is true to say that the game of rugby league has come a long way since the original New South Wales competition began and, as members who have spoken in this debate have made clear, some of the directions in which it has been heading in recent times have caused some ill feeling in the community. Since the time competition began, you have to say that on the positive side of things it has moved into areas of the country that have been traditionally dominated by other codes of football. This expansion is testimony to the vision of administrators who believe that the game not only is strong enough to survive in the non-traditional areas but could flourish there. It certainly seems to be doing that. In particular, the victory by the Melbourne Storm team in the last grand final of the century was, I think, an indication of the game's potential for future success.
You would have to say that the NRL decision makers have made some tough decisions in recent times. I have to acknowledge that a large number of my constituents had their feelings hurt very deeply by the decision to axe one of the foundation clubs, South Sydney Rabbitohs. I was disturbed by the way in which this was done. Certainly the success of any code of football must basically be built on a strong network of clubs, much as the South Sydney Rabbitohs are. I offer these views not just from a parochial point of view because I represent a lot of the club's fans but really as a supporter of sport in general and its positive role in the community. 
I would like to acknowledge, along with the member for Grayndler, the presence in the gallery of Mr Purcell. He was an international, a Kangaroo. He held the scoring record as a forward, broken I believe only recently by David Furner of the Canberra Raiders. It is very good to see in the gallery of the national parliament people who represent something real about the debates that take place here. Likewise, I should also mention the club that I support in Sydney, the Sydney Roosters. This club is more than simply an organisation of people who provide a team for the competition; they are an integral part of the community in the eastern suburbs of Sydney. They devote a lot of time and resources to the development of the game at a junior level. Senior players and staff visit local schools and provide some coaching assistance. Senior players act as role models for young people, generally boys, in the eastern suburbs who are interested in the game.
The improvement in participation at a local level is something that must always be bolstered in any code of football. Over the last four years there has been an increase in the number of players competing in the Sydney Roosters junior league by 48 per cent and the number of teams fielded by 58 per cent. This is a very good indication of the club's success. Last night's result aside, particularly the large margin of victory, I think they are going to do very well this year and I wish them the best in the future.
This debate also gives us the chance to reflect in general on the position of the fan or the supporter not only of rugby league but of other codes of football and other spectator sports. The AFL in Melbourne appears to have announced today a proposal to split the traditional Australian Rules competition into two conferences, as they call it, in order to give the weaker clubs a chance somehow whilst maintaining their position in the league. I hope this is really not some cover for a more corporate approach to the game. I grew up in that city. My father, my grandfather and I suppose his father too were always supporters of Carlton. I will be so until the day I breathe my last, but I hope that some of the sponsorship inflation that has wreaked so much damage on various sports as technology progresses will not be allowed to do as much damage to the code as might otherwise be the case.

"Mr LEO McLEAY,MP",ALP,2000-03-06,"—Today I want to make a brief comment about drugs in our society. The recent death of a young man at a rave party in Sydney has resulted in a spate of articles about drug use. It seems that everyone has an opinion about drug use. But what progress are we making with the problem of drug usage in our society? What have we achieved? I would have to say not much. The safe injecting facility in Sydney and the one in Canberra still have not been opened. Obstacles are put in the way at every opportunity by those who are opposed to such places, often on the spurious ground that to recognise illicit drug taking is to condone it. Yet deaths from drugs, crime related to drugs and other tragedies continue to occur while people argue about what they think should happen. 
We do not live in a perfect world. The fact is that illicit drugs exist and people take them for social or recreational reasons. Fear of breaking the law, or even dying does not seem to stop them. While users are dying, some people believe that we should all be perfect. Many lack real compassion and draw their inspiration from the American zero tolerance campaigns. In the USA there are over two million people in jail. In some jurisdictions a majority of these people are there for drug related crime. Jailing drug users or condemning them to an early death from hepatitis or overdosing is not the answer. I would like to see more compassion and more willingness to be flexible in our attitudes. More informed understanding rather than interfering disapproval would see us treat drug use as a health issue rather than a law and order issue. Otherwise, there is no prospect for us as a society of being able to work through the problem of drug abuse.

"Howard, John, MP",LP,2000-03-06,"—Mr Speaker, with the indulgence of the House, I refer to the death in Adelaide yesterday of Dame Roma Mitchell, AC, DBE, CVO, at the age of 86. I think it is fair to say that Dame Roma Mitchell has been a person who has made an enormous contribution to Australian public and professional life over a period of more than 50 years. In many respects, she was a role model for professional women in Australia. She was one of Australia's most distinguished women, who achieved so many firsts in a pioneering career in the law and in community, academic and state affairs, culminating as Governor of South Australia and becoming Australia's first female governor. She was educated at St Aloyss College, Adelaide, where she was dux, and that set a pattern of firsts for the rest of her public and professional life, being the first female Queen's Counsel not only in Australia but in the entire Commonwealth, the first female judge appointed in Australia, the first female governor, and a person who chaired the Human Rights Commission. Right up until her death, she played a very active role in public affairs. 
Dame Roma is remembered with particular affection in her home state of South Australia, where she was Chancellor of the University of Adelaide—once again, a first: she was the first female chancellor— having previously served 11 years as deputy chancellor. She became Governor of South Australia in 1991 and served in that position until 1996. She was honoured on numerous occasions—Companion of the Order of Australia in 1991; Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1982; Commander of the Legion of Honour, France, in 1997; and Commander of the Royal Victorian Order earlier this year. She led a very remarkable and exemplary life. She was, in so many ways, a leader and a role model and I know the House and the Leader of the Opposition will want to join me in recording our sadness at her passing, to mark a remarkable life and to honour the enormous contribution that she has made.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Mitchell, Dame Roma</title>",Condolences,4,1,speech
"Beazley, Kim, MP",ALP,2000-03-06,"—With the indulgence of the House, Mr Speaker, Dame Roma Mitchell has been an inspiration to countless Australians, especially in her home state of South Australia. Throughout her long life she was a pioneer for equality and social justice. She said she was inspired to study the law by injustices that she saw around her in the Depression years. The Prime Minister has pointed to her many firsts. In 1934, at the age of 21, she was admitted to the bar but then, in 1962, she was appointed Australia's first female Queen's Counsel. In 1965, she was the first woman to become a Supreme Court judge and, in 1983, the first woman to become chancellor of an Australian university. In 1991 she was invested as Governor of South Australia, the first woman to be so honoured. In 1981, she became the first chair of the Australian Human Rights Commission, becoming a human rights worker of international acclaim.
Among these pioneering achievements, Dame Roma never lost her personal and healing touch. Whether it was talking to Aboriginal elders or speaking to school children, her good humour and willingness to listen to others shone through. Dama Roma was particularly interested in the barriers to equal rights posed by women's desire to fulfil their work and family commitments, an issue of enormous importance around this nation. Dame Roma had strong views on the need to change attitudes towards working wives, the need for refresher courses for women graduates wanting to return to work after rearing children, and the need for housework to be shared. Dame Roma was greatly loved in South Australia for her personality, her humanity and her words of wisdom. She had this piece of advice for others: `If you have a particular ambition, follow it.

"Beazley, Kim, MP",ALP,2000-03-06,"—My question is to the Minister for Aged Care. Minister, is it a fact that a report by your Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency on Riverside Nursing Home in July 1999 found problems with infection control and the administration of medication at this facility? Isn't it a fact that the concerns raised in the July 1999 report remain problems identified in the inspection conducted on 16 and 17 February this year, one month after further serious complaints about this home were received in January this year? Minister, aren't the elderly residents at this home simply paying the price for your inattention, inaction and incompetence on this issue? Why have you taken so long to act on these complaints and why have you only acted when prompted by media and public pressure?",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Nursing Homes: Riverside</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,question
"Bishop, Bronwyn, MP",LP,2000-03-06,"—The history of the Riverside Nursing Home does it no credit at all. It has form back to 1988.
Opposition members interjecting—
—I ascertained that during 13 years of Labor government you only closed one home in those 13 years. When the new legislation came into effect, those homes which under the old system were designated as `homes of concern', which included Riverside, were referred to the agency. The agency worked with that home to bring it up to standard—
Opposition members interjecting—
—which it did. On 16 January of this year, an incident occurred that is, quite frankly, beyond belief in this day and age. Members will recall that I came into this House in the last week of sitting and said what I had found out on the evening of 15 February and what action I had taken and put in place on the morning of 16 February, having worked through the night to achieve that end.
The fact of the matter is that for a registered nurse in this day and age to order that elderly patients, some with open wounds merely taped up and others with catheters, be placed in a bath containing kerosene is unbelievable.
—So what did you do?
—The action taken by the department was that it received a complaint on the next day, the 17th. It appears from the record that it received that complaint at first instance from the infectious diseases department of the Victorian government. The Victorian government have a responsibility to do with infectious diseases and responsibility under their own act. However, on 17 February, the department contacted the approved provider, and the approved provider was asked to rectify the situation. At that point, if this was not done, it should have been referred to the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency for inspection and investigation. A decision was made by the department not to do this. The system was in place but the process was not followed.
It then came to my attention, at 10 p.m. on 15 February, that this incident had taken place. The matter was referred to the agency by the department at 1 o'clock in the morning and by 9 o'clock there was an inspection team of three nurses, an assessor from the agency and a departmental official who conducted a thorough two-day review. It is the department which makes the decisions about this matter. It is the secretary who has the authority under the act, and the delegate of the secretary makes the decision. As a result of the report written by the inspection team, the decision was made that sanctions should be put in place and that the provider status should be revoked, which meant that all federal funding would cease. The delegate recommended that this action be suspended, conditional upon an administrator being appointed and certain health standards and things about the building being brought up to standard. We then had agency and departmental nurses in that facility every day, at random times, looking after the safety of the residents.  
We then had the situation where we received a report from those nurses, who said that nothing was being done to bring anything up to scratch. Accordingly, the department asked the agency to do another full audit review and report to the department. Under the act the provider had an entitlement to 14 days in which to respond. That 14 days would have been up tomorrow. As a result of the second review, the delegate made a decision that sanctions should be imposed—this means that federal funding of the value of $1.96 million per year is totally withdrawn—and that the licences, which on the open market if they were sold would be worth around $2 million, should also be revoked. The contingency plans worked out were these. Under the act, once the determination is made and the process is served—and I was advised that that occurred at about 8 o'clock this morning—plans have to be in place for the residents to be evacuated. We had an arrangement with the Victorian government to use their ambulances. They were indeed able to supply those ambulances.
Before the action was taken, a communication and a residents kit went from the department to each resident and to the loved ones—
—Mr Speaker, this is not an amusing matter. This is a very serious matter—
—And you did not treat it seriously.
—It is being treated very seriously. The fact of the matter is that my concern all along has been for the residents. By remaining in that home, their lives are at risk. There was an incident last week of a lady who had a broken arm. She described a pain on 19 February. It was not discovered or sent for an X-ray until 26 February. When she came back from the hospital—this is despite the fact that doctors were called—she was put in a position where her life could be at risk because she was not properly put into her bed. In other words, the evidence that was found by the nurses that went in was sufficiently of concern for the most serious of all sanctions to be taken.
This does mean, as I said, that licences have been revoked. It does mean that recurrent funding is withdrawn. I would like to express my thanks to the Sisters of Charity at St Vincent's for working with the department so well and for providing what is a lovely facility—indeed, residents and their relatives are presently being taken on an inspection tour. Residents may then be brought back so that their fears may be dealt with. Under the act there is no provision for notice, and that I believe is something that needs to be remedied because the speed of the action does indeed make things difficult for people when they are told they have to move. The problem of the Victorian government trying to make a political headline on Saturday morning was quite unconscionable.
—The member for Fowler!
—It meant that there were fears that started for the residents—
—The minister will resume her seat. It is evident that no-one wants to have this question answered, or at least the behaviour of the member for Fowler would tend to reinforce that point of view. When the House has come to order, I will recognise once again the minister.
—Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. This matter is one where older, frail Australians have firstly been bathed in kerosene and subsequently have had blisters occur. We have had situations where the building itself is deficient, where there is evidence that bandages that have been used to dress wounds have been washed and reused, where a dressing on a wound that has seeped has been simply taped up and no new dressing applied. Indeed, our department officials went out and spent $400 in order to make these resources available, and this is despite the funding that has been made available to this person. It is no longer acceptable for that money to be paid to that provider. Again I go back to the residents and their need for care and safety. They are not safe in the Riverside home. They will be safe with the Sisters of Charity at St Vincent's.  
Indeed, the action that we have taken has been speedy; it has been accurate. We have been at great pains not to make any statements that would pre-empt the action that the delegate might take which would impugn any of the legality of the action taken. Mr Speaker, I can say to you that I do hope that those in the opposition who think this is an opportunity for political activity will instead see that this reform act is the one that was greatly needed, that the history of this home alone—going back to 1988—means that the reforms were needed.

"SPEAKER, Mr",N/A,2000-03-06,"—The Department of the House of Representatives has provided me with advice concerning the application of the goods and service tax to seminars sponsored by the department. Members will recall this matter was raised during question time on 17 February. The current price for these seminars was set in 1998. It is based on the recovery of direct costs rounded down one per cent to $215. Over 90 per cent of seminar costs relate to staff salaries and other internal costs which do not incur wholesales tax and which will not decrease with the introduction of the GST. At this stage, only two seminars are scheduled for after 1 July—one in July and one in August. Keeping in mind that materials used in the seminars have been purchased well in advance, the department set a GST charge consistent with the subsidised price. Cost recovery on the same basis as that used in 1988 would justify a current charge, similarly rounded down, of $285 per participant compared with the proposed charge of $236.50.
However, the principal aim of these seminars is not to make money but to have the activities of the House, its committees and members known to the widest possible audience. The department kept charges in 1999 and 2000 at the 1998 level. This was done on the grounds of serving the House and the community and of keeping the costs competitive and within the means of likely participants. It also had the added effect of recognising possible tax reform savings. The application of the GST to the price of these seminars is entirely consistent with arrangements which apply to the provision of similar services as from 1 July 2000. I am advised that the department recognises that, with the introduction of the GST, there will be some cost savings across its activities. These savings are now being examined and a review of pricing practices across the department will subsequently occur. Any savings identified as a result of this process will of course be passed on.
—With your indulgence, Mr Speaker, I seek clarification on that answer. Do I take it that the two seminars set in train will attract the full 10 per cent GST and that the embedded costs the Treasurer says have to be passed on immediately from 1 July will not be, and that those will be considered only for subsequent seminars? Isn't what you have just told us inconsistent with what the Treasurer has been tel ling the country? 
—I respond to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition by indicating that the statement has come from the department and me and has not had the Treasurer's input. I would have thought that my comment was entirely consistent with the fact that there will be a fall in costs as a result of the GST but that the 10 per cent is added on the 1998 price, reflecting the fall th at is anticipated.
—Given that the Treasurer has indicated consistently and only recently that the embedded taxes that go and the advantages there from have to be passed on immediately, I ask the question why has that not been taken account of by the House in setting the GST adjusted prices for the two seminars in train? From what you have told us, they go up the full 10 per cent—no deduction for the embedded costs. It is true that you have said that they will be taken account of later, but the government has consistently argued that those embedded costs have to be passed on in full from 1 July.
—I do not intend to enter into a debate on this issue. I merely want to point out to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that, as my statement indicates, the embedded costs in this case are relatively incidental.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Seminar Charges</title>,Questions to the Speaker,10,1,speech

"Emerson, Craig, MP",ALP,2000-03-06,"—I move:
That this House:
(1) acknowledges the irritation caused to television viewers by the broadcasting of advertisements at volumes or pitches greater than those of normal programs;
(2) notes that neither the Broadcasting Services Act nor the Commercial Television Code of Practice requires television stations to broadcast advertisements at the same sound level as their programs;
(3) notes that at present the only recourse for viewers unhappy about the volume of advertisements is to complain to the television stations or the advertisers; and
(4) calls on the Government to amend the Broadcasting Services Act to empower the Australian Broadcasting Authority to regulate the volume and pitch of television advertisements.
I want to speak briefly on the origins of this issue. Since I became a member of parliament and the member for Bass became a member of parliament, we have had numerous representations and complaints from television viewers in our electorates about the volume of television ads. Viewers complain to us that the volume of the TV ads is much greater than the volume of normal commercial television programming. Those are the sorts of complaints that we have been receiving, and as a result of those complaints we thought we would look more intensively at the issue and do some of our own research on it.
Having made that decision, I have to say that this summer just passing seems to have been the worst on record for the loudness of television ads compared with normal commercial television programs. Just before Christmas, when the kids were at home from school, it seemed that the people who were advertising toys for Christmas, trying to convince parents to buy those toys for their kids, were hell-bent on driving parents mad with the TV ads being much louder than the normal commercial programs. Then, just when we thought it was safe to turn the television back on on Boxing Day and thereafter, the major retailers turned our attention, unavoidably, to the sales that were occurring in that period by again blasting through to the lounge room these loud television ads. So my colleague the member for Bass and I continued our research. We found to our surprise that there is in fact no regulation whatsoever covering the loudness of television ads. The Australian Broadcasting Authority has been given no power at all in this respect. All that exists is self-regulation. I think that nowadays when we hear self-regulation, we hear ineffectual regulation.
I can point to the veracity of that statement by referring to advice from the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations, known as FACTS. FACTS wrote to me on 15 February after my colleague and I had raised this issue—and I do put on record my thanks to FACTS for having the courtesy to write to us. I just want to refer to their statements about the effectiveness of the regulation. They say in their letter: 
Australian television networks have for some time ensured that all available technical measures to ensure a consistent sound output are in place. Because audio compression is a significant factor in perceived loudness, the industry has agreed on the maximum level of audio compression that is acceptable in television commercials.
...		...		...
All audio signals leaving a station pass through spectral loudness controllers prior to transmission. As their name suggests, these are designed to maintain a fairly constant level of loudness in the station's audio output.
Now, here is the point:
Once a broadcast reaches the home, the issue becomes one of perceived volume rather than one relating to technical measures taken by the broadcaster.
So we have FACTS saying, `Look, it's all a matter of perception. We're trying our best,' yet we get this continual flood of complaints. I want to emphasise this point: we are not arguing or claiming that television stations are turning up the volume of the advertisements. What happens, to the best of our knowledge and based on our research, is that a cassette arrives from the advertisers. It is then lodged into the television station's system, and the volume of the ads is essentially as loud or as soft as that of the advertisement that was recorded. The stations say that they do apply some measures in relation to this, but clearly those measures are not very effective. I refer again to the FACTS letter, which says:
In response to recent discussion of this issue in the media, FACTS has issued a reminder to members of the need to check audio level settings regularly. We are also reminding advertising agencies and production houses of their responsibility to produce material in accordance with the maximum compression levels set by the industry.
In other words, all is not well. As a result of the initiative taken by my colleague the member for Bass and me, FACTS has had to remind the television stations of their moral obligations in this matter.
Mr Deputy Speaker, the industry says, `Look, we know what you are talking about, but technically it is too hard for us to control the volume of television advertisements.' They say that this is because of compression of the dynamic range of the audio. I refer now to a letter from the Australian Broadcasting Authority, written to me on 27 January. It says:
According to FACTS, the main problem is in the production of advertisements where compression of the dynamic range of the audio is carried out. FACTS advises that this makes the audio louder, although the peaks of the signal that can be seen on a meter are the same as on an uncompressed signal. 
FACTS' approach has been to adopt an Operational Practice for advertisements. The Operational Practice, however, merely provides guidance, and is not mandatory. 
Audio compression is a method whereby an advertisement's sound track is recorded at a constant and maximum loudness level. When such an advertisement is broadcast within a program featuring a range of sounds, the contrast can be disquieting. FACTS has advised that television stations do try to overcome this but technically it is difficult.
So here we have the television stations saying, `Oh, it's all very difficult.' It is remarkable that humanity can send a spacecraft to Venus. We have sent a spacecraft to Venus—we missed it by that much—but what we are hearing from the television stations is, `Yes, we can send a spacecraft to Venus, but we can't overcome the technical difficulties of controlling the volume of television ads.' This is an extraordinary statement. We hear, `Oh, in the digital age it will all be a lot better.' I must say I remain very sceptical about that. The industry is saying that, because of this compression problem, the ads only sound louder. We say that if advertisements sound louder then they are louder. We have never said that TV advertisements smell louder or feel louder, we are saying that they sound louder and therefore they are louder, and the industry is saying, `Oh no, this is very difficult. We can't do anything about it.'
The proposal of my colleague and me is simple: give the Australian Broadcasting Authority the regulatory powers to control the loudness of television advertisements. I see it as working in this way: at the moment, when someone makes a complaint to a television station about the loudness of TV ads, the frequent practice is for them to speak into an answering machine because there is no-one staffing the TV station, particularly at night. Television stations have actually told me that complaints about the loudness of ads receive very low priority because they receive a range of other complaints, so the complainant never knows whether anyone in any position of any responsibility hears that complaint at all. If the Australian Broadcasting Authority had some basic regulatory powers, the authority could receive the complaints and ring up the television station the next day and say, `We've had a flood of complaints about this particular advertisement. We want you to tone it down. If you can't tone it down in the television station, contact the advertiser and tell the advertiser that the advertisement, as it is running, is unacceptable and get them to recast the advertisement.' If the television station remains an offender in this regard, then finally some sort of penalty should apply. 
Mr Deputy Speaker, I simply make this point: if the television stations are right and the ads are not louder, they have nothing to fear from our proposal to give the Australian Broadcasting Authority the power to ensure that ads are not louder. If they are not louder, there is no problem. The problem arises because they are louder. This is a lifestyle issue. People are entitled to a bit of peace and quiet in their own homes. That is why my colleague and I are calling on the federal government to amend the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 to empower the Australian Broadcasting Authority to regulate the volume and pitch of television advertisements. It is a perfectly reasonable request. I look forward to bipartisan support across the chamber on this issue and to early action by the government. (Time expired)

"Hardgrave, Gary, MP",LP,2000-03-06,"—Mr Deputy Speaker, a couple of us in this chamber have worked in what seems to be, according to the member for Rankin, the offending television industry, and the two contributors from the government's side to this particular private member's debate today are just those. The member for Herbert is an expert on the television industry from a technical point of view, and I have been involved in the presentation of television programs as an on air reporter over a long period of time. Perhaps we both can give some real life insight into the problem that the member for Rankin has rightly raised in his debate today.
I guess it is one of those forum shopping kind of questions that are put to members from time to time as people go around trying to find someone to take up the cause. There is a great deal of validity to the general impression people have about the extreme sound that they experience from television advertising. But, of course, the test of the level of sound used by all those who broadcast, including those who are in the Sound and Vision Office and currently arranging for this particular offering of mine to be broadcast around this building, is a thing called a VU metre, which checks the level of decibels involved in a particular reproduction or amplification of sound. For the information of the member for Rankin, the television commercials are not so much excessively loud in the sense of being heard to be loud but rather feel louder because of the compression of the dynamic range.
—So they only sound louder?
—The member for Rankin might just like to listen to a couple of real life examples on this. I understand where he is coming from—this sort of stuff is good for headlines. There is nothing wrong with the aspirations he is putting forward but, in the 20 years or so since I first joined Channel 7, there was a 13-year period called the Australian Labor Party in government. The member for Rankin was an adviser to the Prime Minister at some stage, and I do not remember him ever putting a proposition like this forward. Anyway he is out in the real world in the suburbs just to the south of my electorate, so I suppose he is a little more tested by reality than he was during his time advising Prime Minister Hawke.
The fact of the matter is that in some countries there is no television advertising—you are not allowed to advertise your wares, your views and your concerns—and they are very dark and grey countries. In this nation, where there is great freedom to express yourself, a lot of television ads are designed to annoy. I remember when the member for Lilley was the state secretary of the Australian Labor Party in Queensland and—the organisation career politician that he is—he was an expert when it came to annoying television ads. These loud, annoying, invasive ads are really all about trying to get attention, and of course those opposite understand how to entice some sort of sale or point of view. But there is nothing wrong with that. There is nothing wrong with ads that try to get people's attention or try to entice a sale. By contrast, program content tends to have a broader range of light and shade. Programs are not compressed—that is, the soft sounds and the loud sounds are not brought closer together by artificial means, so the variation in pitch and the variation in volume is very minimal. Program content tends to have the light and shade that television ads do not have. So it is quite understandable that people have the view that they go from watching some very pleasant and quiet movie and, at some poignant moment, are confronted by an ad for Overflow or some other very loud ad for Chandlers or whatever it might happen to be. 
I think perhaps a solution to the problems that the member for Rankin and the member for Bass are raising here today would be to look at the compression ratios—looking at the differences that are actually insisted upon by those who record commercials and the television stations that broadcast them—and to also look at the variations in pitch as well as the variations in compression to, if you like, try to deliberately vary the noise factor that people are confronted by. I wish we could do that in here, especially during question time. As the Treasurer said earlier today, `The louder the noise from those opposite, the more we know they are in trouble.' Unfortunately, all too often the big voice tends to win through. 
I suspect what we could be looking at seriously is the placement of advertisements—that the noisy ones live within the commercial breaks rather than simply at the beginning of commercial breaks. But of course then we would start to see government intrude upon commercial operations of legitimate companies. A particular company will pay a premium rate to be first ad in the break. Before you go off to make that cup of tea or grab that Tim Tam during a movie, that company wants to see that first ad be their ad because they have paid a premium rate for it. So there is a difficulty there. We could perhaps look at the placement of the breaks. I think this in fact might be one of the solutions to the problem. I have often wondered why we do not have a greater set of regulations or rules governing the placement of ads in the sense of ad breaks. The fact that we currently have regulations governing the number of ads and the number of minutes per hour that ads are allowed to appear means that we could also look at the way that ads intrude on the programs. 
I understand that in Germany, for instance, the ads are generally placed at the top of the hour. What a great thing that would be! You would know that from seven minutes to the top of the hour is your latest set of commercials and then for the following hour until perhaps seven minutes to the hour again the program is actually there. When television programs are produced, a 30-minute television program is really only about 24 minutes. An hour program is about 46 minutes. So there is scope in the scheme of things to perhaps suggest that we have a top and bottom of the hour placement of ad breaks. I think that might be a great outcome for consumers. The TNT network I see on Foxtel from time to time has deliberate breaks at the top and bottom of the hour, so it is obviously something that is a fairly standard convention in other countries. I suspect that, if we did have ad breaks in such a way that programs could flow through and ads were located at the top and the bottom of the hour, a lot of the complaints that we are talking about would go away. All too often now you find that that important moment in the movie comes along and on comes Daryl Eastlake or some vocal clone of Daryl Eastlake with a big voice offering some particular observation. 
The issue before us also lends itself to something else—that is, to ensure that the ABA and those responsible for the production of ads also look at making sure there is truth in the advertising that they offer. I am reminded of course of the recent debacle with the Queensland state Labor government with regards to using taxpayer funds to drive home some innovations in legislation up there, and the ABA just last week found that advertisements by the Queensland government of a political nature were not properly authorised. I think those sorts of matters could also be looked at.  
If we are going to start trying to amend the act which governs the ABA intruding into advertising, we should in fact look very closely at making sure that the claims made in advertisements are truthful, because at the end of the day the consumers of products in this country expect advertisers to behave properly. They expect truth in advertising. They expect the advertising that people put forward to be of a decent standard. If consumers find that companies put forward an ad that does not conform to their particular desires as far as the presentation levels are concerned—if it is too loud or if it does not explain things properly—one would suppose that consumers would walk away from those particular companies.
But we live in a free country. A free country means that people can choose their ways of expressing themselves and advertising is, by its very nature, all about the expression of views and of attention gathering, attempting to get people's attention so that advertisers can perhaps bring about a sale of a particular good or service. So at the end of the day for the government to intrude to the point that the member for Rankin is suggesting may in fact be an impossibility to achieve while also maintaining a sense of freedom that we should enjoy in this country. I think there are other ways, as I suggested in my contribution to this debate, to try to bring about a softer circumstance for consumers, but we should not forget that it is advertisers who pay for the television programs that we enjoy—free to air in name but not really in execution.

"O'Byrne, Michelle, MP",ALP,2000-03-06,"—The needs and concerns of our community members are varied and it is not for this House alone to determine what those issues will be, nor to judge any as forum shopping. Rather, this House should be responding to them. Many of my constituents have contacted me concerned with irritations which affect them in their homes, such as the volume of television advertising. The subject of the motion currently before the House is of concern to many members of the Australian community. The perceived volume at which television broadcasts occur is an issue which affects virtually the whole of the Australian population. There are very few people who will not have felt the irritation which accompanies the broadcast of advertisements at a volume which is perceived to be higher than that of regular programming.
You will note that I actually mention `perceived levels'. Sound compression is the use of technology that increases the volume of the quieter parts of a portion of recorded sound and removes any small quiet spaces contained in the recording. While not increasing the peak volume, this has the effect of increasing the mean volume without changing the maximum tested sound level. The reason for this perceived volume change is that, through the application of sound compression technology, the structure of the sound is altered to give the impression of a higher volume.
It has been claimed by a number of people, including on A Current Affair, that there is not a large differential between the volumes of advertising and programming, that sound is only perceived as being louder. The presenter then illustrated the process of manipulation of the sound signal by gradually changing the background noise. There was a significant increase in the perceived volume after the application of sound compression. Apparently, the point that they wish to make is that it only sounds louder. I am not sure what comfort that will bring to the many people who are distressed by this sound technology manipulation.
A Current Affair, however, is not the only body to conduct research. Other tests indicate that there is some disagreement on the reality of the difference in the volume of regular programming and advertising. I refer all honourable members to research undertaken by the Daily Telegraph in Sydney through independent experts which found that the perceived loudness of the television volume increased by as much as 40 per cent during commercial breaks. This was also reported in the Advertiser of Saturday, 29 January. This article further reported that Dr Harvey Dylan of the National Acoustics Laboratory had found in a separate study that ads were louder than regular programs by an average of three to four decibels. The point I wish to illustrate is that, whilst there is some debate about the actual volume implications of sound manipulation, what people hear is louder. The fact that they are constantly annoyed by ads has not changed; we have just come up with a few theories to explain it. 
Many people have contacted my office to add support and encouragement to my involvement in seconding this motion. One constituent characterised the actions to overcome the volume impact as a `great crusade'. It may not be that, but it is an important issue. It is important because the inconsistent volume of television programming has an impact on hundreds of thousands of homes each night. And remember: the impact of louder TV ads on people is not something which only occurs now and then. The commercial television industry code of practice allows for the transmission of non-program matter or ads for up to 15 minutes each hour. The requirement of many members of the community to reduce their TV volume during advertisements can therefore cause these people significant difficulty and distress. For some this is not just an annoyance but a significant problem. Louder volumes can particularly affect Australians who need the assistance of a hearing aid. These people, while watching TV, need to appropriately calibrate their hearing aid to the volume of the program and significant changes in the volume cause a difficulty for themselves and their families.
Television viewers who wish to complain about the volume or pitch of television advertising are lacking any real and effective method of resolving their problem. As there is currently no regulatory requirement on the Australian Broadcasting Authority and no reference in the commercial television industry code of conduct, complainants receive polite replies but are not provided with a solution. However, I was very pleased to read in the Launceston Examiner on 18 January that the advertising industry has no wish to have ads broadcast at levels different from those for regular programs:
Australian Association of National Advertisers President Sara Morton-Stone said the industry would not support any variance in volume between ads and regular programs.
This support from the industry is most gratifying and can give all honourable members confidence that amending the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 to include a reference to the volume and pitch of advertising is something that the community wants and that the industry has given its support to. Regulation through amendments to the Broadcasting Services Act—to enable the Australian Broadcasting Authority to ensure that the pitch and volume, both perceived and actual, is correct—is something required by the community and something that we need to act upon. I therefore commend the motion to the House and call on all honourable members to support it in the interests of those in their electorates who are frustrated by the perceived volume differential between programming and advertising because, quite frankly, the it's too hard line just does not cut it.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Television Advertisements</title>,Private Members' Business,11,1,speech
"Lindsay, Peter, MP",LP,2000-03-06,"—This issue has been around ever since television began in this country. It is an issue that has concerned all Australians and the television stations, but the House should ask itself why nothing has ever happened about it. Before I answer that, I might just say that the motion that has been presented to the House today is simply technically wrong, for two reasons. First of all, it indicates that the Broadcasting Services Act should be amended to empower the Australian Broadcasting Authority to regulate volume and pitch. Volume is fine but pitch is not. Pitch is actually a measure of frequency, so regulating the frequency of the sounds that are broadcast would indicate that the opposition would want to have people with squeaky or deep voices affected. That is what happens when you regulate pitch. So pitch should not be in this particular motion, only volume. 
The second claim is that there is no regulation at the moment. But indeed there is. There is a requirement that all television stations make sure that the maximum deviation of their sound carry does not exceed 50 kilohertz. That is the thing in technical terms that determines the loudness, the peak level of sound that is broadcast. But it is not what is being complained of in this legislation. That is the problem. People do not understand just what they mean by `volume'. They mean that in a television program you might have a very intimate scene being broadcast, and then the station goes to a commercial break. In the intimate scene, sound levels are low, soft, passionate and whatever, and the next minute you get a Harvey Norman commercial or a Lowes commercial. It is exacerbated by the fact that that Harvey Norman or Lowes commercial probably has had some form of compression attached. That makes the thing sound doubly louder. In terms of actual level broadcast, it is not louder—it is the compression. It is a concept called sound density. To work out sound density involves an integration process. It is an area under the sound curve which gives the actual amount of sound power that is being broadcast. It is not the peak level; the peak level is always the same. Stations are not allowed to broadcast more than a certain peak level. It is the sound density that occurs, and that is why things sound louder. So you get what is called subjective loudness, and everybody complains about it. I do not have a problem with that—I complain about it—but the problem is that, if you play a symphony orchestra on television or you just play a piano, they both have the same peak level but the orchestra always sounds louder than the piano. So what do you do about that? Do you impinge on the art of that particular program? 
Truly controlling loudness has eluded everybody. It has eluded the best technical experts in the world. No country, no television system, no industry body, no consumer body has come up with a solution to this particular issue. As much as the television stations would like to find a way of making sure that the perceived loudness is effectively constant, no-one has been able to come up with a solution. Mr Deputy Speaker, I would suggest to you—and this is the best advice that I have and is my understanding of the industry—that Australia would have a world first if it were able to find some way to regulate this problem that everybody around the country sees as a problem. Simply, it is currently not possible. Ultimately, it may be possible to have very sophisticated electronic equipment measuring in real time the sound power that is being broadcast, the density of sound, but that is currently not available anywhere on the market. So now the system chooses to stay with the regulatory restraints on the deviation of the sound carrier and looks to the good offices of the television stations to do what they can to ameliorate this problem. Of course, if we do regulate, we would then need to know how and who would regulate, but I guess that is just a mechanical operation. It has been around for a long time.

"Mr WILTON,MP",ALP,2000-03-06,"—I grieve in particular today for the residents of the Riverside Nursing Home in the electorate of Isaacs. The latest chapter in this somewhat horrendous saga is that residents of the Riverside Nursing Home are being evacuated, almost as we speak, to St Vincent's Hospital; exactly for how long one can only speculate, but we can surmise that it might be for some three or four weeks. We do not know simply because neither I nor the residents are effectively being told for how long they are to be so relocated. In similar terms, the relatives of the residents do not know how long the residents will be away from their normal abode at the nursing home. One can only ask: how can the government leave residents and their relatives in a limboland of this nature?
Earlier this morning I took a call—one of several I have taken—from a distraught constituent, Miss Kay Rossborough, who was almost too upset to speak. Miss Rossborough's 78-year-old mother is one of the residents who is about to be uprooted from the Riverside Nursing Home, which has been a home to her for the past 4½ years. Miss Rossborough is very concerned—quite understandably so—about the effect that the move will have on her mother, who suffers from dementia. If we look at the situation from Miss Rossborough's perspective, this relocation and upheaval that her mother is currently enduring through being relocated from Riverside to St Vincent's Hospital could ostensibly—in fact, in reality—have quite a serious and detrimental effect on both her health and her wellbeing.
Despite the excellent professional and counselling services being offered at St Vincent's by the Sisters of Charity there, one can only be concerned for the welfare of patients. I am certainly not going to suggest for a minute that residents would be better off remaining at Riverside. Perhaps it is a case of quite the opposite. But we cannot ignore this amazing upheaval that these elderly and frail residents will be forced to endure. The ambulance trip, the unfamiliar faces, the strange surroundings and the new routine at the end of the journey will be very unsettling, even frightening, for all the residents, especially those like Miss Rossborough's mother, who suffer from dementia. The government must take the utmost care to ensure that this transition is as smooth and as brief as possible for Riverside residents.
The shame of this whole fiasco is that the government has been caught totally off guard and is clearly resorting to a quick fix in an attempt to resolve it. What the minister has failed to acknowledge is that she is failing, and has failed for quite some time, to address the underlying systemic problem which, for Riverside residents, goes back two or more years—well before the day that Minister Bishop apparently first heard, in her own words, about the unfortunate kerosene incident. It was way back in May 1998 that Riverside was visited by assessing officers of the then Department of Health and Family Services. At that assessment most of the activities and functions of Riverside were identified as requiring urgent attention and action on the part of the provider in order to meet the government's standards. In July last year the home was once again assessed and the report subsequently stated that its operations were, yet again, by and large unsatisfactory. Yet the operators of the nursing home were still able to rake in taxpayers' and residents' money to continue what can only be described as a substandard practice. They continued to offer a very poor quality of service to the elderly and frail residents under their supervision. An endless stream of different complaints about the practices at the home have been made to various quarters, including my office, the department, the complaints scheme, the unions, the minister's office and the state government. Is this not just a case of too little too late for the poor residents of Riverside? Is it not a fact that no action has been taken against Riverside and that it is symptomatic of a flawed system? One can only ask what this government has done to make sure that nursing homes like Riverside get up to scratch and start to provide the quality care that Australians have come to know and expect. 
The minister, Mrs Bishop, says that the safety of residents is her primary concern and that the government, in her view, has a strong commitment to ensuring that nursing home residents achieve an appropriate quality of life. To that end the government has established an agency that is supposed to be responsible for ensuring that nursing homes receiving federal government funds meet its standards and that they provide quality care to their residents. There is also the government's confidential complaints resolution scheme which is similarly responsible for reacting quickly to residents' and relatives' concerns about the goings-on in particular nursing homes. Unfortunately, it is only too clear that the government, the minister, the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency and the complaints resolution scheme have all failed the frail and elderly residents of the Riverside Nursing Home. Given that the government has known about the consistently poor record of the home through the department's assessment processes, how can Mrs Bishop explain that none of the complaints received about this nursing home were treated as a red alert? That is a question that the minister must respond to.
There have, no doubt, been reasons enough for the government to investigate the Riverside Nursing Home, reasons enough for Mrs Bishop or the agency to conduct spot checks on this facility. It is hard for us to believe that the minister's primary concern is for the safety and wellbeing of nursing home residents because it seems to me that the government's commitment to quality of care for nursing home residents and the mechanisms it has in place to ensure that it delivers on that commitment are completely worthless. They are worthless because they can allow a nursing home with a consistently poor record such as Riverside to continue its operations without what would seem to be any form of investigation, without imposing any method of sanction and without procedures in place to ensure that these standards are uplifted. These commitments proffered by the minister in recent press releases and again in question time today are also worthless because, by and large, they are reactive to the crises that conceivably may occur rather than being proactive to prevent those same crises. I conclude by saying that if the situation is as suggested, the residents of this home could have been spared a lot of pain, suffering and indignity, notably brought on them by the relocation and the stress associated with that relocation. As I say, they are frail and elderly and not up to the stresses that this government has placed on them for too long.",REPS,<title>GRIEVANCE DEBATE</title>,<title>Nursing Homes: Riverside</title>,Grievance Debate,12,1,speech
"Ruddock, Philip, MP",LP,2000-03-06,"—I move:
That the bill be now read a second time.
The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1999 implements a number of the government's policy initiatives within the Immigration and Multicultural Affairs portfolio. These initiatives will enhance the efficiency of the administration of the Migration Act 1958, while preserving the integrity of that act and the rights of persons affected by the provisions of the act. Schedule 1 of the bill introduces powers to cancel temporary entry business sponsorships and to request relevant information from people who have applied for, hold or have held business sponsor status. These measures ensure that there will be effective cancellation and monitoring mechanisms to provide a balance to the streamlined temporary entry of key business personnel. They flow from recommendations made to the previous government by the Committee of Inquiry into the Temporary Entry of Business People and Highly Skilled Specialists. That committee was chaired by Mr Neville Roach AO, who has made and continues to make an extraordinary personal contribution to issues of national significance, in particular the framework for managing cultural diversity in Australian society.
The committee chaired by Mr Roach advocated a discretionary system of assessment and sanction to allow for the consideration of any breach of temporary business sponsors' obligations. I am pleased to say that this bill puts into place the final elements of the changes suggested by the committee and agreed to by this government. Schedule 2 of the bill amends provisions related to the ways in which visa applications may be made.  The amended provisions will prevent applicants from making applications that would necessarily be refused under current migration policy. This will save clients time and money that would otherwise be wasted in making applications that could not succeed. 
Schedule 3 of the bill introduces a more flexible method of authorising persons, and classes of persons, to be officers for the purposes of the Migration Act 1958. These measures enable the authorisation of classes of persons, in an administratively straightforward manner, without reducing the obligation of the minister to notify the authorisation in the Gazette. Schedule 4 of the bill is intended to ensure that the Australian community is protected from convicted criminals who are subject to deportation. It will amend the Migration Actto ensure that corrective service authorities can detain non-citizens who are liable for criminal deportation on completion of their prison sentence. The government is committed to providing visa applicants who have a connection to the Australian community with merits review of adverse decisions. Schedule 5 of the bill will ensure that applicants for permanent migrant spouse or interdependency visas have merits review rights. It will align the review of such offshore migrant visas with the current availability of merits review for onshore spouse and interdependency visa classes. Schedules 6 and 7 of the bill introduce two beneficial measures in relation to the migration program. 
In the early 1990s the former government enacted provisions to assist in the management and control of the annual migration program. These allow for the setting of numerical limits or `caps' on the number of visas that can be granted in prescribed visa subclasses in any one program year. The measures introduced by schedule 6 of this bill will allow certain applicants who would otherwise be adversely affected by successive caps to be granted a visa. The people who will benefit from these changes are those who were not able to meet health and character criteria before the cap came into effect. This will only apply, however, where the inability to meet those criteria was beyond the applicants' control.
Schedule 7 of the bill will extend from 12 months to two years the period in which a points tested visa applicant who has not met the prevailing pass mark but did meet the lower pool mark may have their visa application held in reserve. The people whose visa applications are held in reserve in the independent category may elect to provide details of their educational qualifications and work experience for inclusion in a skill matching database operated by my department. This database is a key resource for the Regional Sponsored Migration Scheme and the state and territory nominated independent category, which are designed to encourage a wider dispersal of the skilled migrant intake. It allows migrants to take up opportunities in regional and rural Australia. The extension of the pool period will ensure that state and territory governments and regional employers have available to them a greater number of pooled applicants with a range of skills to meet identified skill shortages.
Schedule 8 of the bill removes the age limitation for full-time members of the Refugee Review Tribunal in line with the government's policy to remove the compulsory age limits for public office holders. Finally, schedule 9 of the bill ensures that the integrity of the scheme for judicial review of immigration decision making is maintained by treating decisions of the new Migration Review Tribunal in the same way as those made by the Immigration Review Tribunal. These amendments are required because the Migration Legislation Amendment (Judicial Review) Bill 1998, which is presently before the Senate, has not been passed. That bill, once passed, will enable the courts to speedily dispose of abusive applications. I take this opportunity to urge members of the opposition to support passage of that bill, which is of even greater importance now with the large numbers of unauthorised arrivals being brought to Australia by people-smugglers. In conclusion, the bill before you today contains measures that are beneficial to clients, while ensuring that the government's migration program is not compromised. I commend the bill to the House and table the explanatory memorandum. ",REPS,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Sciacca, Con, MP",ALP,2000-03-06,"—The opposition will be supporting the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1999, which is an omnibus bill. As the minister has stated, there are nine separate schedules, and the opposition believes that, generally, the measures contained in those schedules will do what they are intended to do. I do not think I could let this opportunity go without making some comments in the general immigration area, as it has been very much in the news of late, particularly after Saturday morning when we saw a most puzzling display of policy making on the run from the Prime Minister, who I have no doubt completely surprised his own minister for immigration on the issues of immigration and population. Until last week, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs was beating his chest and trying to be tough, as he often does, such as when he kicked out the remaining Kosovars, and with the East Timorese, or at least the remainder of them; Madam Deputy Speaker Crosio, you might remember that they were plucked out of the UN compound at the height of the trouble in East Timor. 
Probably one of the most baffling things that the minister has done recently was to implement the freeze on asylum seekers who try to come to Australia legally. There is a great deal of disquiet in the community about this. I have already received an enormous number of representations from members of parliament from my side, and I am quite certain that you, Minister, have received a lot of representations from your side as well. The ridiculous part of what you have done is this—
—So what would you do?
—If you listen, I might tell you what we would do. But you are the minister, not me. 
—We know what we're doing!
—You are the one that is in charge; you are the one that has got to do the work. Don't come this caper about what we would do. You are in government, not us.
—Order! The member for Bowman understands the restrictions, and precisely the same obligation for courtesy is expected of the minister. The member for Bowman has the call
—As I understand it, the minister has frozen offshore applications from asylum seekers on the pretence that there are a number of people that have come here by boat or have come here illegally who will want to make application and will, in many instances, indeed be accepted as genuine refugees. I want the minister at some stage to give me the figures of those he has approved up to now. I understand there is a program of approximately 12,000. The minister has linked them in the past—2,000 onshore and 10,000 offshore. I understand that 5,000 or 6,000 visas have been issued under that program so far, and I take it that, of the illegals that are here at the moment, the minister is expecting anything up to 5,000 or 6,000—to come up to that 12,000—to be in the pipeline. I do not know if that is the case. My understanding is that the total number of boat people that have arrived in the last two years is something like 3,500. I do not know where the rest of them come from; possibly they are people who have come in by air. I do not know. I would be very happy if the minister could give me the figures later on.
—You need someone to brief you on it.
—Yes, and I would be very happy for that briefing. The problem is that there are genuine asylum seekers who are presently in the pipeline. Perhaps the minister can advise me how many in that category are in the pipeline and at the moment will be precluded from coming here. Many of them would probably have been on the cusp of receiving visas. These people have been frozen out; these people have been waiting in queues. 
Over a period of time, and with my support for the three-year temporary residence visa as against the permanent one for refugees—the whole reason for bringing in the temporary residence visa being that we would not sanction queue-jumpers—the minister intended that these people overseas who had been patiently waiting in UNHCR camps were the people that we should give preference to. Then, only a couple of months down the track, the minister says, `Because you have been waiting over there, we cannot do anything for you because we have got too many illegals.' What message does that send out, Minister? The message it sends out clearly is that, if people can get to this country by illegal means, they have a better chance of getting a visa than if they apply from overseas. You have frozen it so that nobody can come from offshore. The position is that you are penalising those very people you were professing to be protecting when you brought in the three-year visa as against the permanent visa. What you have done is put up a big sign outside Australia which says, `Illegals, if you can find your way here, cross that ocean, find the money to pay people-smugglers and arrive on our shores, then—if you are genuine refugees—you are going to be accepted at the expense of the offshore ones.' 
There are many permanent residents of Australia who know people in that category—I do not know the numbers and I would be very interested for the minister to give me those numbers—and who are now contacting their local members of parliament and people in the refugee associations and saying, `How could the minister be that heartless?' A compassionate man such as the minister is stopping genuine people from coming to this country by saying that, if you are an illegal and you can prove that you are refugee, you get precedence. That goes completely against everything you have done in the past 12 months. Every law that you have passed to make it tougher for the people-smugglers, everything you have done—

"SPEAKER, Mr",N/A,2000-03-06,"—I have taken the action of coming into the chair to make a statement simply because certain press statements have been brought to the attention of my office. These press statements follow the statement I made earlier today in reference to a question asked of me by the member for Watson on the last sitting day. I would like to indicate to the House that, as I indicated to the member for Watson today, I have spoken to Professor Fels, and I have faxed him a copy of my statement to the House. I would like to restate the latter paragraph of my statement to the House earlier today. I quote:
The department recognises that, with the introduction of the GST, there will be some cost savings across its activities. These savings are now being examined and a review of pricing practices across the department will subsequently occur. Any savings identified as a result of this process will, of course, be passed on. Consequently, the department will reprice the seminars referred to and the price will, as anyone can see, not go up by 10 per cent.

"Sciacca, Con, MP",ALP,2000-03-06,"—Prior to the suspension of the sitting for dinner, I was talking about the minister's decision to freeze the refugee humanitarian program for offshore applications. I was saying just how unbelievable it is that the minister, after one year's worth of bringing in new laws all the time to try to stop illegal immigrants, would in effect put up a sign outside to the people smugglers saying, `If you can get to this country by illegal means, if you can cross that ocean and you can find the money to pay the people smugglers, as far as I am concerned you have a better claim for refugee status in this country than some poor person who has been waiting patiently in some UNHCR camp in Hong Kong or wherever.' That is exactly the effect of the minister's freeze on the refugee offshore program.
Australia has a very generous refugee program and we have a hard-won reputation as a humanitarian country. Indeed, our refugee intake of some 12,000 yearly stacks up as probably the best in the world per head of population. The problem is that the minister, having slashed virtually all facets of the migration program in recent times—for example, cutting the aged parents category to 500, or 250 couples, which was done in a fit of pique because he did not particularly like the fact that the Senate overturned one of his regulations—having tried to privatise refugee resettlement services, leaving volunteers stranded, and having slashed the budget of the much needed telephone interpreting service, trying to get rid of them under the user-pays philosophy of the government, is now unable to resist the temptation to slash, in effect, our refugee and humanitarian program. Make no mistake about it: that is what he is doing.
I understand that some 5,000 to 6,000 people have been allowed in so far. That leaves roughly another 6,000 to 7,000. As I said prior to the break, he says that there will be so many onshore, but we do not know whether that will be 6,000 or 7,000. Of the illegals that have come in, many of them are economic refugees and are sent back. It is not as if they are going to take up part of that refugee program. The point is that if the minister wants to cut the refugee program, let him say it. Let him say, `I want to cut immigration levels and the refugee and humanitarian program is one I want to cut.' He should not do it by way of the back door and make it look to the overseas illegals that want to come here that they can do so because they will have a better chance of staying if they are genuine refugees than the people that do it the right way. The minister keeps saying to me, `What would you do?' I am not the minister. The opposition is not the government.
—Hear, hear!
—I can tell the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration, who is at the table, that it will not be long. He had better watch his seat too. I give that warning to my good friend Mr Slipper. He has been a good friend of mine over many years. You had better watch your seat. You must have caravan park owners in your electorate. I am sure they will look after you. I should know because they looked after me in 1996. If we were in government we would ensure that our international reputation was maintained and we would maintain the integrity of our humanitarian program. That is the first thing we would do. We would not panic like the minister does. The government seems to panic whenever an emergency presents itself. You have to plan for contingencies and ensure that the program is managed in a flexible way because, after all, we are catering for world events. World events change. No-one can say what is going to happen next year, whether there is going to be another East Timor crisis or more people like the Kosovars that we decide to bring in. What is the difference in terms of allowing an extra couple of hundred people to come in, particularly in the refugee and humanitarian program where you could do what the Labor Party has done in previous years and borrow from the forward program? 
Perhaps the minister can give me an undertaking: I ask him publicly in this House tonight. Minister, you would be aware that there are a number of people in the pipeline who would at this point in time have been given an indication that their visas were about to come. I suspect there would not be that many of them. These are the legal ones that are trying to come from overseas. There could be 500, there could be 1,000; I do not know. This is something on which, no doubt, the minister will give me figures. All I say to the minister is this: I know that you have a heart—at least it is there somewhere. You used to have one. I do not know what has happened to it over the last couple of years, but you had a heart. Surely those people—there may be 1,000 of them—who are waiting, have relatives here waiting for them and have been led to believe that their visas are imminent, should be allowed to come in. Let those that are in the pipeline come in. If they are ready to come, why make them wait another year? Who knows what the position will be with illegal immigrants then? The minister might give some consideration to that point because, even today, I have been approached by a number of my parliamentary colleagues who have said to me that they feel so bad because constituents are coming to see them and are saying, `They were about to come over and all of a sudden the minister said, “Freeze”.' 
It would be fine if we had the problem of tens of thousands of them coming over illegally, but we do not have tens of thousands. My understanding is that only just over 3,000-odd have come in by boat, many of whom have been returned. So I still cannot see where this differential is between the five or six thousand that would be allowed in now and the 12,000 that we would normally let in.
On Saturday morning, the Prime Minister seemed to show a change of heart in terms of the question of immigration numbers and population policy. Until recently, Minister Ruddock has been telling anyone that would listen that the migration program was correct and any increase in migration would be detrimental, and that Australia does not need a population policy. I have just been through some of the old reports from AAP last year. I want to read a few statements out to the House. The first one is an AAP report of 11 August 1999 headed `Immigration levels about right—report'.
CANBERRA, Aug 11 AAP - Increasing the immigration intake would do little to combat Australia's ageing population, a new report has found.
...  	...	   ...
Immigration minister Philip Ruddock seized on the report as proof the government was on the right track with its immigration program, which currently has an intake of 80,000 migrants per year.
“This research indicates that calls for a significantly larger migration program on the grounds that it would help keep Australia younger are misdirected and ill-informed,” Mr Ruddock said.
Whilst it is in a different context, I wonder whether he thinks the Prime Minister is ill informed and misdirected, because that is what it seems the Prime Minister was saying. On another occasion, Monday, 20 September 1999, a report headed `No population is needed—Ruddock', said:
CANBERRA, Sept 20 AAP - The federal government today rejected opposition calls for a formal population policy, saying Australia's immigration program was balanced and on track.
Immigration minister Philip Ruddock said research continued to show that Australia's current approach to immigration was the right one.
He rejected the findings of a report by ALP president Barry Jones which called for a formal population policy to plan future migrant intake.
...	   ...	  ...
Mr Ruddock said the current immigration policy was achieving the right balance between economic, social, humanitarian and environmental goals. 
“I have not seen any evidence to suggest that the government should make radical changes to the path that we have set,” he said.
This was in September last year, only six months ago. I put it to Mr Ruddock that perhaps he should speak to the Prime Minister because I think the Prime Minister disagrees with him. This is the one point that does not seem to have been picked up by the press. There is no question in my mind that Mr Ruddock was absolutely blind-sided by all of this. When he woke up in the morning and saw that front page article in the Australian which said `More skilled migrants needed; Prime Minister “open” on immigration', he must have fainted, because it is exactly the opposite of the signal that he has been sending for some time—certainly over the 12 months since I have been the shadow minister. 
AAP do a good job in making sure that a lot of these things are recorded. They are not even up there to hear that compliment. It is very good. What they record here shows a pattern on the part of this minister of saying, `What we are doing is correct and there is no need to change.' Another AAP report, of Monday, 15 November, is headed `Business not taking advantage of migration scheme'. It says:
By Deborah Way
CANBERRA, Nov 15 AAP - Australia's business community had failed to take advantage of the federal government migration scheme despite its calls for more skilled migrants, Immigration Minister Philip Ruddocksaid today.
...  	 ... 	...
Mr Ruddockrestated his opposition to creating a formal population policy, saying no comparable immigration countries, such as the US, had such a policy.
“While population policy may be a topical catchcry for those seeking a significant increase or decrease in immigration numbers, the fact is no country in the world whose example we may wish to follow has a formal population policy,” he said.

Opposition population spokesman Martin Ferguson said, Labor remained committed to a population policy for the 21st Century which set itself the broad goal of achieving moderate population growth rates.
“Labor believes that a larger population will culturally enrich us, assist us to achieve stronger economic growth, build our regions and help us afford the extra cost we will face as our population ages,' Mr Ferguson told—
a conference that he was speaking to—
Mr Ferguson said Labor would establish as a priority an Office of Population to advice on a range of population options and ways of achieving them.
I agree entirely with the sentiments of my colleague the opposition spokesman Martin Ferguson and, it seems from the reports on Saturday morning, so does Prime Minister Howard. He is now saying completely the contrary of what was being said by his minister for such a long time—that is, `There is no need for a population policy.'
In Saturday morning's newspaper, the article on page 1 headed `PM open to more migrants' by Dennis Shanahan was the lead story. I welcome that. I welcome the fact that the Prime Minister is prepared to open the debate and, as he says, have an open mind on these issues. I notice the honourable member for Hindmarsh is in the chamber. She comes from Adelaide, an area which is screaming for more people. You want more people, you want a population debate, you want an immigration debate and now finally your Prime Minister has said that he wants one too. It is a bit of a slap in the face for the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. I do not think there is too much coordination between those two. Nevertheless, I welcome the fact that there seems also to have been a change of mind on the part of the minister. On Saturday, 4 March 2000, the Australian came out with this front page report `PM open to more migrants'. Amongst other things it says:
JOHN Howard has signalled a shift of government policy on population and immigration, leaving room for an increase in the annual migrant intake.
...	   ...	  ...
It is the first sign that Mr Howard may be prepared to drop government resistance to having a population policy and sustaining a larger migrant intake.
...    ...	  ...
While Kim Beazley has committed Labor to having a comprehensive population policy, Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock has opposed suggestions that key ministries should co-operate to complement immigration policy with a broader population policy.
...	...	... 
 “I think we need a comprehensive debate about population and immigration,” he told The Weekend Australian.
The Prime Minister said a population debate could be part of “nation building”, a theme he wants to promote after the implementation of the GST.
I want to say a bit about this notion of nation building shortly. At the end, he is quoted as saying:
“One of the things I would like to develop more as we get beyond the GST is the notion of nation building in its broadest sense: not only infrastructure, which is important, but also nation building in terms of knowledge, skills.”
That was on Saturday, 4 March 2000. Lo and behold, the day after the minister had been contradicting that on television reports that afternoon by saying that he did not see any reason for an increase, AAP reports: `Room for more skilled migrants—Ruddock' on Sunday, 5 March at 9.34 a.m. It did not take the Prime Minister long to pick up the phone and say, `Phil, mate, you'd better not leave me out there stranded. Better you look stupid than me.' So what happens the next day? `Room for more skilled migrants—Ruddock', Canberra, 5 March, AAP, and I quote:
Australia's skilled migrant intake could rise as early as next year if given Cabinet approval, Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock said today.
Mr Ruddock, who has been canvassing public opinion on immigration, said he would take submissions to Cabinet in April.
“There are people putting the view that there should be a rise in immigration,” he told the Seven Network's Sunday Sunrise program.
“I think I should look at the arguments and hear what is being said, and I am involved in very comprehensive consultations around Australia right now.
“I'll put to Cabinet a range of options (so) that we can deal with the matter in an informed way.”
Mr Ruddock said there was some room for population growth.
“But the important point in relation to any discussion of increased migrant numbers needs to be in the context of whether we can choose people ...”
What an extraordinary change of tack by this minister. It is an extraordinary change of tack. All last year he has been saying exactly the opposite. Having said that, I welcome the fact that the minister has now been ordered by the Prime Minister to engage in a meaningful debate. Immigration has built this country in the past. There is no reason why good quality immigration cannot continue to build it in the future. This country is an extraordinary example of multiculturalism. It is a country of diverse cultures that live together without any pain, without any bloodshed or without any demonstrations in the streets. We are an example to the whole world. Those that are against immigration—whilst in many respects one can appreciate what they have to say and the reasons behind what they have to say—really should remember that.
It sometimes grieves me to see that a lot of people who are anti-immigration are immigrants themselves, and longstanding immigrants. I, as one who is Italian born, know from my own background that a lot of Italians, Greeks, Yugoslavs—people who have been here for years; the postwar immigration people—do not want further immigration either. But I think it is the responsibility of governments and leaders to lead on these issues. I believe that they should be telling the people of Australia—these people who have in their minds legitimate reasons to not want further immigration—`Look, it's been great for this country and there is no reason for you to have that attitude,' and try to at least explain to them why this country can benefit from a good, healthy migration program. Instead, over the last two, three or four years, the Prime Minister and the minister for immigration have been sending out signals indicating that really we do not want too many immigrants. We have these high risk factor lists—which I am sure the honourable member for Calwell will talk about later on—which say to people: `We don't want you, even to visit.'
Today in question time the minister for immigration said that I had made some comments with respect to that, where I had implied that there was racism. I have never accused anyone of racism, and I would not—certainly not this minister because I know he is not a racist. There is no way in the world that I would say it. In fact, I said as a matter of a personal explanation that he ought to apologise to me for even thinking that I would call him a racist because I did not. A lot of journos wanted me to say it, and I said, `No, you go and jump,' because there is no way that I am going to say something that is not true. But I did say to them: `There must be a perception out there amongst some people in the community that there is discrimination against certain people from certain countries.' I will leave that particular point at that. 
I was quite chuffed when I read the comments of the Prime Minister in which he referred to the notion of nation building. In fact, I might say that only recently the minister and I were both asked to make contributions to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia. They have put out a book called Immigration and multiculturalism: global perspectives edited by James Jupp. I wrote this probably eight months ago and it has only now been printed, and it is headed: `Labor nation building for a new millennium'. We have used that term for 12 months. Kim Beazley used it at a global conference on population in Adelaide last year or the year before. I have made a number of speeches to the Federation of Ethnic Community Councils of Australia and the Migration Institute of Australia, and we have talked about that. I am extraordinarily happy for the Prime Minister to have copied our words.
If the Prime Minister is fair dinkum about what he said on Saturday morning—and I remain to be convinced—then I welcome what he has said. I hope that he can win over his minister for immigration and let him see the error of his ways. Let him see that, with perhaps a little bit of leadership from himself and the minister, we might be able to engage in a meaningful debate on this question of immigration. Let us not always play wedge politics on these issues. These are issues which are vitally important to the economic wellbeing of this country, to our national defence, to our regional development. There are many ways that we can think laterally when it comes to the question of immigration. We need to have a fair balance. We need to get skilled people into this country who will contribute to the overall economic wellbeing of the country. At the same time, you cannot expect good, skilled people to want to come here if they are not allowed to bring their families with them. What is the point? Last year, over 20,000 young Australians left the shores of this country to go overseas to further their work opportunities. We need to make sure, if we can, that we can replace these people, that we can try to keep them here, as well as having quality migration programs that will enhance the economy of this country.
If the Prime Minister is fair dinkum, I can assure him that we will involve ourselves in a meaningful dialogue with him and his minister. If he comes up with innovative programs that we can take on a bipartisan basis to the public of Australia we will do so, provided that the bottom line is what is best for this country, not what is best for the next election. When you start to make something like immigration an issue for election time, you only do it and you are only successful at it by playing wedge politics and by pitting minorities against minorities. That is not what this country has been built on. Immigration has been a bipartisan issue for a long time. Generally, 90 per cent of everything that this minister has put up in this parliament we have accepted, which includes this bill.
—He's a good minister.
—A lot of people used to say that he is good minister. I have no doubt about the fact the he is a good bloke, but I will tell you something: he is under the orders of the Prime Minister, who vacillates from one way to the other. Go back to 1986 and see what his views were then and now see what his views are in accordance with that article in the Weekend Australian the other morning. The fact is that this minister has become very tough of late. I think what Mr Howard is saying to him is, `Relent a little bit. People out there are pretty intelligent and they do not really believe anymore that good immigration is bad for this country.' So if the Prime Minister is fair dinkum, we welcome his change of heart. I for one, and I know Mr Beazley and our population spokesman, Martin Ferguson, would be very happy to sit down and have a dialogue that would be of benefit to this country. I look forward to the minister's supplying me with those figures. I notice that his departmental officials are sitting over there. Perhaps they can supply us with the figures as to how many people are in the pipeline who would have been granted a visa under the refugee and humanitarian program over the next couple of months, and also the number of people who have received their visas and how many are left from the 12,000. 
Turning back to the bill, we support the bill, as we have supported just about 90 per cent of everything that the minister has put up on a bipartisan basis. We welcome the change of heart of the Prime Minister, as it appeared in the Dennis Shanahan article last Saturday morning.",REPS,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1,speech
"Gallus, Christine, MP",LP,2000-03-06,"—That was a very interesting contribution by the shadow minister, who I think missed his true vocation, which is writing fiction. Attending to his speech, he seemed to be inventing conversations between the Prime Minister and the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs.
—Hypothetical.
—I think it was more than hypothetical. It was, as I said, an interesting speech but entirely fictional.
—He has a vivid imagination.
—Yes, he has a vivid imagination. What was missing from his speech were comments that I heard on the radio from the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Carr, who I think did not welcome the Prime Minister's statement about immigration to the extent that the shadow minister did. He in fact criticised the statement quite vehemently. In what I later heard as a `Sydneycentric' comment, he said that certainly Sydney did not need any more migrants.
I am sure that the Prime Minister would agree with him, and so would the minister for immigration, because indeed Sydney does not need anymore migrants, but the rest of Australia does. This minister and this Prime Minister have been concentrating on a program that is trying get skilled migrants and more migrants into the regions of Australia where they are needed. That was missing from the shadow minister's attack today: that recognition that it is not migration per se that we need, that migration has traditionally gone to the big smoke, to Sydney, where the premier says, `We can't take any more in Sydney. We are landlocked and we already have too many people.' But we need migrants in the regions, and that is what this government has been doing, specifically with its state migration program, which I will get to later on. The shadow minister also criticised, amongst the various points that he touched on in what was an extremely wide-ranging d ebate—
—Disjointed.
—I would not be so unkind, Parliamentary Secretary, but it was very difficult to find a particular theme. The shadow minister did seem to move in various conflicting directions from time to time. He did criticise the freeze in offshore applications, without actually indicating what he would do. He said that we should be flexible enough to cope with international changes. Indeed, I believe that is what the minister is trying to do. He is saying, `We are getting an unprecedented number of offshore illegal arrivals and this will affect our refugee program. So, let's have look at how this is going with the numbers that are predicted to come to Australia in the next months and see how that will affect our program.' So he did the only thing he could to keep an ordered migration program in circumstances that he could not predict but has reacted to in a sensible way. He is indeed catering for the contingencies that the shadow minister asked for.
I will turn now to the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1999, which is an omnibus bill with nine different schedules that look at nine different areas of migration. It is mostly for the purpose of streamlining for greater efficiency in the program. I congratulate the minister on the effort he has put in to make an efficient migration program. Almost weekly he is looking at the regulations and the visas and saying, `How can we make this more sensible, more efficient and more streamlined?'
Of the nine schedules, several are beneficial to people wanting to migrate to Australia. Schedule 5 allows offshore applications for spouse or interdependency visas to have the same right of merit review as onshore applicants. That is clearly of benefit to them. Schedule 6 applicants affected by the cap can now get a visa when they would have come in under the cap if delays had not come up, delays not of their making. That now will allow them to come in under the previous cap. 
The more interesting one, which I would like to focus on just briefly, is schedule 7. Schedule 7 of the bill extends from 12 months to two years the period in which a points tested visa applicant who did not meet the prevailing pass mark and did not meet the lower pool mark may have their visa application held in reserve. That means that, at present, if you just miss out on meeting the required number of points to come to Australia as an independent migrant, you are put in a pool. If your skills are required, they can be accessed by the regional sponsored migration program. At present, until this bill becomes law, those people will remain in that pool for only a year. After this bill becomes law, they will remain in the pool for two years.
This harks back to what I said earlier about the need in regional Australia not only for more migrants but for more skilled migrants. The minister has requested that the Joint Standing Committee on Migration undertake a study of the specific state specific mechanisms for migration. As part of this, the committee has been touring around, and we have held two public hearings. While I would not want to canvass any of the recommendations or conclusions of the committee, I think it is safe to say that there is a recognition in the regions that they are short of skilled personnel. They are looking to this regional sponsored migration program to provide those skills in the regions, because the truth is that currently they are not getting it from the cities and the more developed regions.
There is out there a desperate need for people such as chefs and people with mechanical skills. The regions are desperate. In my tours lately, not as part of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration but as part of another committee looking through regional Australia on an issue, I have been struck by the number of regional towns that are in decline. Migration will not totally solve their problems, but even one family can make a difference to a town. A family with children can bring the number of people in that town to a level where two teachers are required rather than one, and that can prevent the closure of a school. So, not only are the regions desperate for these migrants with the skills but also for the people to come there to increase the population. My hope would be that the committee will come up with recommendations that will assist this program, because to date this has been an extremely underutilised program. There are only 2,000 people who have accessed it since the beginning, and the minister is keen that more migrants access the regional migration program.
The program has several aspects to it. Employer nominees can bring out employees who fulfil the specific skills that they need and cannot get anywhere else in Australia. It could be used for particular skills that the states want. As I said earlier, these migrants may not meet the pass mark normally required for independent migration, but if they come to the region where their skills are needed, they can move there. There are also fewer points required for family reunion if that family lives in the regions. I commend the minister for allowing migrants who are in the pool to remain there for two months. I commend the minister also for this program. If I can speak on behalf of regional Australia, the message they are sending to us is they want those migrants out there and, in particular, they want the migrants who can provide the skills that they do not have in their towns at the present. There is little else that I can add to this. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1,speech
"Theophanous, Dr Andrew, MP",ALP,2000-03-06,"—I rise to speak on the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1999. The member for Hindmarsh suggested that these new schedules and amendments come from the ingenuity of the minister. They do not. They come as recommendations from the department. They are recommendations to put into place a number of measures to fix up problems created by the incoherence of the immigration program. There are difficulties because of the way the immigration program is now run. For example, there are provisions to deal with the capping issues. But why do we need capping of the kind that we have at the moment? That is an interesting question. 
We started off with the idea years ago that we would use the capping mechanism only in extreme circumstances, and now we have capping in virtually every category of the immigration program. We even have capping informally—not formally, informally—because the minister will not admit that it is formally there. But, if you read the DIMA papers, you will see that there is an informal form of capping in the form of queues for spouses. Australian citizens and residents marrying somebody overseas very often have to wait nine, 12 or 15 months for reunion with their spouses. This has nothing to do with a spouse not being a genuine spouse or anything like that; it is simply to do with the way in which the program is structured and the way the numbers are determined. The minister sets a certain level for spouses or for fiances or for any other category, whether it be for child, parent, interdependency or preferential family. If there happen to be more than that number, then this capping mechanism comes into place. This is in addition to the points system which exists in some of these categories.
We have a situation in the immigration program at the moment where we have the department running the show, running the minister, and not even being prepared to compromise on some of these topics with respect to the minister's own ideas. The shadow minister, the member for Hindmarsh and many other people in this House have mentioned that the history of the minister appears to be very different from the bizarre statements that he has been making recently in relation to a whole range of issues pertaining to immigration, particularly refugees. Does this sound like a minister who is putting forward his own convictions in relation to his portfolio or does it sound more like a minister whose views are being determined by the bureaucracy of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and those people in the department who have never been prepared to take into account the realities of Australian life or to take a more humanitarian and sympathetic approach to immigration? Is it any wonder that in the ethnic communities the department of immigration is known as the department of anti-immigration? Most of the time you have people complaining about their treatment—thousands and thousands of people complaining—and many of them go to members of parliament with those complaints in relation to the way in which they are treated.
There is no doubt of course about the ingenuity of the department of immigration when it comes to justifying their position. The member for Hindmarsh mentioned the scheme which gives additional points to people who want to live in the country. I will make an immodest comment to you, Mr Deputy Speaker. That scheme was first suggested by me in a paper to the immigration conference in 1990. When I suggested that proposal, the immigration department gave the then minister and other people information saying that this program would be impossible—it would be impossible to differentiate in this way; it would be impossible to give extra points in the way that had been suggested for people to go to the regional areas. Of course, after many years we finally find that they put into place a program of that kind. But the rationalisations of the department for their behaviour continue.
Today we had the minister becoming very upset about the visitors visa issue. On the question of visitors visas, he asked the shadow minister how he could say that there was discrimination in the visitors visa program. I wrote to the minister last year, pointing out that for certain countries the levels of visitor visa rejections were ridiculously high and outrageous—for example, 46 per cent from Lebanon, 30 per cent from Turkey, 25 per cent or so from China and 20 per cent from Vietnam, just to mention some. Of course, the minister preferred to mention Greece, where the rejection rate is very low—it suited him. What about these countries, Minister? What did the minister do when I pointed this out? Are we really saying that nearly one in two people from Lebanon who make an application for a visitors visa are shonky—they are not genuine people; they do not want to come and visit their relatives or their friends in Australia? Is this really what the department is saying? You might think that if there is a figure of 46 per cent the department might think, `Maybe we're getting something wrong here.'  
Does the government of Lebanon not feel insulted when 46 per cent of the people applying for visitors visas—not for immigration—to visit friends and relatives in Australia or to come for a holiday in Australia are rejected by this department? The minister says, `Oh, there's the risk assessment factor.' But what did I point out in my letter last year? More than 50 members of parliament whom I wrote to wrote back to me with examples in relation to this matter, including members from the government side. What is this risk assessment factor? A risk assessment factor was put in even by the previous Labor government. I pointed out in my letter to the minister that the department's statements about the levels of risk assessment were mistaken and were in fact fraudulent. Why are they fraudulent? Because the figures relating to the so-called non-return rates include not only people who do not return to their country and whose visas have expired but also people who applied for a second visa. For example, if a person comes in on a visitors visa and they then apply for a second visitors visa—an extension—they are listed under the department's figures as non-returnees. On that basis, the department then says, `There's a hell of a lot of non-returnees from China. So, in proportionate terms, we will say that China's non-return rate is 14.59 per cent. Therefore, because of their very high non-return rate they are a very high risk and that explains imposing this factor.' But as I pointed out with respect to, for example, Lebanon, the deemed non-return rate is 25.5 per cent but, if you take out the people who applied for a legitimate visa here and were accepted by the department itself for a legitimate visa, that rate goes down to 3.65 per cent.
That figure is a bit different, is it not? Does this justify the treatment of Lebanon, China, Turkey, Vietnam or a number of other countries in relation to this so-called non-return rate? This is another example of the fraudulent behaviour of the department whenever they want to get their way. They are misusing these figures and they are claiming that there is a risk factor of the kind that does not exist. As a result of those figures they then say, `If you are from the United Kingdom you don't even have to go to the department of immigration.' If you are from 29 other countries you do not even have to go to the department of immigration to get a visitors visa. But if you are from any of those other countries you not only have to go there but also are subjected to interviews and requests about your assets and your family as if you were migrating to Australia rather than coming for a visit of six, eight, 10, 12 or 16 weeks. 
We have had situations in relation to this matter of a very humanitarian nature—parents who cannot come to visit their children, not come here to stay but to visit. And we call ourselves an enlightened humanitarian country! We are very good at promoting ourselves, but look at the facts and the statistics. The behaviour of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs in relation to visitors visas is an outrage and has to be fixed especially for people who are coming to visit their family. If somebody has a wedding, has a funeral, has a baptism or just wants to see their sister or brother after five or 10 years, they cannot come as immigrants because, as we know, we have stopped the family reunion programs—and I will get back to that later—but surely they are entitled to come for a visit. Surely they are entitled to come for a few weeks. That is not happening and, as a result of that, we are being disadvantaged.
We are also being disadvantaged when people from a whole range of countries other than the 29 want to come to Australia for tourism. The tourism industry itself, the tourism councils of Australia, have made representations to the government over and over especially in relation to visitors from Asia. China is a good example. We signed an agreement with China for a special tourism relationship, but the fact is we still have these figures on visitors visa rejections for China. Half the government wants to promote tourism with China and the department of immigration does something else.
I call on the minister to openly reply to these points. He sent a second letter to all the members of parliament. What did he say in that letter? Did he actually meet these points? No, he did not. He said, `There is another reason why we have to be careful with people from these countries. There are health checks. There are problems with tuberculosis and things of that sort.' That was a complete argument ad hominem. That was a nonsense argument. If there are problems with health for visitors visas, any person wanting a visitors visa from this country would be very happy to go and have a health check, even pay for it themselves, if they are going to visit their family or their friends. This is only an excuse. This is not a firm basis for making public policy. And if we are going to make public policy and are going to talk about the risk assessment, let us at least have the real figures about what is actually happening in relation to this rather than the nonsense that has been put out as propaganda to justify these ridiculous differences in the treatment of people from different countries with respect to applications for visitors visas. 
The minister got annoyed earlier today about the allegation that the system is discriminatory. Of course, nobody wants to throw about comments about racism, but the fact is that some of the communities feel that they are being discriminated against, and impressions are just as serious as the reality when it comes to immigration matters and matters of this kind. The minister ought to get his act together. He ought to reflect on what he has been standing for in this place for many years and he ought to say, `I had better examine this matter once again, especially the issue of the risk factor, rather than hitting out at the shadow minister or the member for Stirling for daring to raise these issues.' I can tell him that there are members on his side of the House who have raised these issues about what is happening to visitors visa applications and their treatment by the department.
I want to turn to the other issue, which concerns the way in which the immigration system is operating. Again, we have fictions being created by the department. One of the saddest things that we ever did in this country on immigration policy was to create the fiction about the family reunion program. We took the spouses and fiancees—who used to be, as the department well knows, separate from the total program—and put them into the family reunion program. The minister goes around Australia saying, `We have a very balanced immigration program because 50 per cent is family and 50 per cent is skilled migrants.' But what he does not tell the Australian people is this: previously, the spouse and fiancee component was not part of what was considered the family program in that sense. If you look at the projected program for 1999-2000, there are 32,000 listed under family. But, of those 32,000, 24,000 are spouses and 3,000 are fiancees. That is 27,000, which has left us only 5,000 people out of 70,000 for what is real family reunion.
You cannot talk about a man and his wife or a woman and her husband coming together as part of the family reunion program. But that is a natural human right. Are we going to say that spouses should not be allowed to come together just because somebody marries someone from another country? We have misused this figure in talking about the immigration program. Therefore, we have talked about the family stream and yet the real family stream is only 5,000 people out of 70,000 and of those, if you look at brothers and sisters—the preferential family—it is only 1,850 in the whole world. No wonder people say there is no hope of bringing your brother and sister here. Migrants who came here in the 1950s and 1960s used to say, `We had settlement conditions that were really tough.' I say to those communities, `Yes, you had settlement conditions that were tough; you didn't have the sorts of services you have today,' but there was one thing that they had—family reunion. They had the possibility that they could bring their brother and sister or their mother and father, their parents, here.
Look at what has happened in the parents category. This year in the planning program, the minister set the total number of parents, for all countries of the world, at 500. That is 500 positions out of 70,000. This is irrespective of the fact that in the previous year, notwithstanding that his planning level had been low, he was forced to accept 3,120. So he puts down a program with one-sixth of that as the planning level for 1999-2000. No wonder he has been forced to revise that in recent weeks. What sort of department does this when there are 20,000 people who are prepared to pay? Their children have to sign a paper saying, `We will pay the pensions of our parents.' There are 20,000 people in the queue, and the minister sets the level at 500. These people are prepared to pay for their parents to be looked after. They sign a paper. At that level of 500, it would take 40 years to bring those people here. And what does this mean? It means that in that period of time most of them will die because they are elderly parents. 
It is all very well for us to go around internationally talking about what a great humanitarian country we are when what we have done with the immigration program in relation to family reunion is totally outrageous. What is happening with the program is creating a quiet rebellion amongst all our ethnic communities. People are saying, `What's going on with the family reunion program is incredible.' There are many more things that could be said about this matter. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1,speech
"Hardgrave, Gary, MP",LP,2000-03-06,"—The member for Calwell was a strong advocate even back in the days when he first entered parliament some 20 years ago, in the previous Parliament House. Legend has it around this place that my esteemed predecessor, Sir James Killen, was noted to have answered an interjection from the member for Calwell with, `Pipe down, Pythagoras.' I am sure he will take that in the good spirit in which I offer it, because tonight we have heard Theophanous's theorem, and I suspect all honourable members who have witnessed it would realise that he nearly popped his hypotenuse on a few occasions. It is a bit sad that those who may read these debates for whatever reason cannot pick up the passion with which the member for Calwell has made his contribution tonight.
It is really important that all Australians who follow matters relating to migration in this country understand that at the heart of the way the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, a man of great repute, has administered his department is dignity and integrity—integrity of the system, integrity of those in the system and dignity for those in the system. As a member on this side who represents many people from a wide cross-section of migrant communities—some affluent, like the Taiwanese community who are generally quite well off, some extremely poor, like those who have come from the Horn of Africa, Somalia, the Sudan, Eritrea and Ethiopia—I understand very well how important it is for those people to know that they are highly regarded by all Australians from all walks of life, that they are welcome, that their role in this country is assured and that there is no question about their integrity or the checks and balances which were applied to them before they came to this country.
I do not have the experience in migration matters of the member for Calwell, both in close detail and in policy areas, but I can say that in the four years that I have been proud to represent the electorate of Moreton I have got more than a fair handle on the aspirations of people in my electorate—those who are more recently arrived migrants as well as those who are perhaps longer-term migrants, those who are of well-established families that have been here for more than a hundred years and others. Indeed, I can say without any hesitation that people in my electorate expect the government of the day to have in place a policy framework that tests all of those who put a submission to us to come to this country. What is really important about the measures before us again tonight is that they are a continuation of this constant theme of integrity in the system, of making sure that those who do come here can hold their heads high with a great deal of pride and say, `I've made it through all the hoops, over all the high jump bars through all the tests of the system.'
It is not just a simple matter of testing their bona fides as far as their criminal, health and character records are concerned—they are the absolute basics. People in this country expect to be sure that people arriving here from another nation, either as a temporary visitor or as a permanent resident bringing whatever skills and assets they have to this nation, are of high character, that they are of competent and safe health and that they bring no problems with them. People in this nation expect those who migrate here not to bring the troubles from their old countries to their new country. They do not want to see a continuation of what may have been a tribal fight in their old country carried on here. We have just seen an instance of this in the southern suburbs of Brisbane in recent times: a tragedy just outside my electorate in the electorate of Griffith involving what is essentially an African community gang versus another African community gang. The African community in my electorate, to their great credit, have met to discuss how they, as a community, can make those who do not understand realise that clashes with machetes and that sort of violence have no place in this country. They realise, even though they have only been in this country a short space of time, the importance of proving their credentials as good citizens, first and foremost as good Australians, and how this affords them the opportunity to then carry on their traditions and their culture and to display this to the broader community. This is an exciting country in which to be a citizen— 
—And a tolerant country.
—It is more than just a tolerant country. This is a country whose citizenry right across the board is vitally interested in finding out about other cultures. That is why multiculturalism is so well accepted, that this nation says to people who have come from cultures other than the predominant Anglo-Celtic culture that I guess has been the mainstay of this nation, `You can come here in peace, you can come here with enterprise, with aspirations, with care and concern for your families, with skills to help continue to build this nation, and you can practise your own culture here. First and foremost you must be good Australians'—that is the challenge to all those who come here—`but practise your culture, educate the broader community, teach them something about you and learn something about them.'
—With hard work you will succeed.
—With hard work you can succeed. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration, at the table, is quite correct. One of the great maxims, especially amongst those who have come from the refugee community in my electorate, is a determination to work, a determination to find a job and a determination to succeed. I am going to talk about some of those aspirations and some of the problems associated with that in my contribution this evening. 
In fact, it is a very important thing to realise that those who come to this country appreciate being here. Those who are genuine refugees, who have passed the very heavy set of criteria that we set—and quite rightly so—value the fact that they have come through the system and want to make a contribution. There are those in my community whom I see daily who have left behind horrors that I would not want to inflict upon even, if I had such a person in my world, my worst of enemies. I would not want to inflict the horrors that some of those people from Somalia, Eritrea and Ethiopia, whom I am proud to represent in this place, have encountered during their lives. I would not want to wake up with the smell of burning bodies with the knowledge that your brother, your sister, your mother or your father was killed the night before because of some tribal clash. I would not want to inflict that upon another soul. Those sorts of traumatised people exist in this country, but they are, despite all that, making their way. One of the reasons that they are able to make their way with a great sense of dignity and a great sense of purpose is knowing that there is in place a system of migration which ensures that once they are here they can hold their heads high and be treated extremely well.
This migration bill contains a variety of measures which are all going to ensure that those who arrive as a result of these changes are going to be welcomed by Australians as bona fide migrants to this country. This bill contains measures which are going to assist in the recognition of the skill base that we desperately need to continue to reinvent in this nation. The other week I was privileged to visit the Moreton Institute of TAFE, named after the same district that my electorate was named after. Although it is in the electorate of Griffith, they adopt me as a namesake on occasions. This occasion was the plastic and rubber industry joint venture with the Technical and Further Education Institute at Moreton, at Mount Gravatt. 
—Plastic and rubber: that sounds like a Tory sort of interest.
—That is a disgraceful interjection from the member for Denison, given some of the stories. The PARTEC project is from the plastic and rubber industry that operates in south-east Queensland and is exporting a number of very viable commodities to the world. There is a desperate skill shortage in that particular area, in particular in the area of skilled toolmakers. It is extraordinary to think that in this nation, where we have had a manufacturing base in place for a long time, we are short on people capable of making the sorts of tools to make the sorts of moulds that are necessary for whatever it is that particular industry may happen to make. I was stunned, and I place it on the record here. The Minister for Employment Services, now at the table, looks after things like the Job Network. Minister Abbott would be shocked like I was to know that they are saying that we need to import skilled workers in the area of toolmaking from England and Germany, where there is a surplus. That is a matter which I guess is contained within this bill. If Minister Kemp were at the table, I guess I would be saying that perhaps we as a government need to invest more in that particular area, because I am sure most Australians would prefer to think that home-grown products were more available than those who migrate here. 
Nevertheless, this bill does allow those who have something to offer to Australia, who can meet the criteria of what is in it for Australia, and bring skills to Australia, to come here. Schedule 7 of this bill will extend from 12 months to two years the period in which a points tested visa applicant who has not met the prevailing pass mark but did meet a lower pool mark may have their visa application held in reserve. They may miss out on the first brush but they are kept up our sleeve, because of their skills, for another occasion. Those people whose applications are held in reserve in the independent category may in fact elect to provide further details of their educational qualifications and work experience for inclusion in a database for skills matching so that people at PARTEC at Moreton Institute of TAFE will be able to contact the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and say, `These are the sorts of people we need; who have you got?' They are the sorts of practical measures that are contained in this bill before us.
It also gives me an opportunity to comment that the lethargic nature of the Queensland government in recognition of the skills that a lot of people have brought to this country is robbing people in my electorate of the chance to take a rightful place in the work force. I spoke before about people who have come as refugees from the Horn of Africa. There are amongst them people who have developed skills or who have received qualifications that are not readily recognised here in this country. That is handled by state and territory governments, and it is important that state and territory governments proceed quickly to understand who we have in our communities, what assets we have achieved among our citizenry and what individuals are lying dormant waiting to offer something in this country and prove their worth to their fellow citizens. State and territory governments should do something about upgrading their understanding so that these people with unrecognised skills can take their place in society and with it achieve even greater dignity than they have already gained simply by passing the tests set by the department of immigration before they actually even come here to this country.
On that note, I want to acknowledge the assistance of the Minister for Employment Services, who responded very quickly, on a visit to my electorate a few months ago, to some very real observations made by the African community about the frustrations that they had in trying to break through the Job Network—although it is a very effective network—because of their English language skills. The minister received a submission from them on the basis of a touch screen, a submission which I know he felt very much in favour of. He encouraged departmental officials to look at ways of trying to assist them and the department came through with the goods. So the African community in my electorate are very well served by the minister, Tony Abbott, and they think very highly of his ability to respond quickly to their needs and concerns. I would like to place on record my thanks to the minister, seeing that he is in the chamber right now. 
Hand in hand with that was the migrant employment program that was established by the Queensland government. It is a sad thing to report that the Queensland government took that migrant employment program and ran it for six or nine months and that now it has gone down a big hole. I certainly would hope that the Queensland government would find the money necessary to try to keep that project going because, particularly amongst vulnerable people, if the program is taken away, there will be a great sense of loss and frustration felt by these people. That really is the last signal that they need to feel from any level of government.
Also, in relation particularly to these refugee members in my electorate and their prospects to go on and become good and productive Australians, they are equally very concerned about what is happening in Australia and the concern that Australians broadly have about this people smuggling racket. The measures that this government has undertaken to try to combat people-smuggling—a heinous crime against individuals, a dreadful thing, a crime against humanity—are being received with wholehearted support amongst those who have been legitimate refugees, who have lived in camps in Kenya, such as the Kakuma camp outside Nairobi and who have gone through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees chain of events which eventually brought them through the system and to our shores. There is a great distaste for those who are perpetrating this crime of bringing people into this country as victims of people smuggling more than just as refugees. There is a great distaste for them. There is, however, an understanding of the frustration, the slowness and the sluggishness of the system that perhaps encourages those who try to queue jump, but there is a great determination among those who have come here as refugees through the system to live as law abiding Australians to play their part in our community, to uphold our laws and to encourage the government to continue this whole of government approach to combating people smuggling.
On each occasion that Minister Ruddock has come into my electorate to talk to people from the various ethnic communities, both as individual communities and as one, he has been well regarded and well received, because the integrity that he has imposed on this system and under which we operate our migration system in this country is well understood and well appreciated by those who come through it. I understand the pent-up frustrations of the member for Calwell in his contribution here tonight, because I too get a lot of people who come through the door of my office who want instant answers to their reasonable set of circumstances. One of the best ideas has been put forward to me by a migration agent who operates out of my electorate and does a lot of migration work for students and others who come out of the People's Republic of China. In fact, the day after you, Madam Deputy Speaker Crosio, and I visited the Australian embassy in Beijing in April last year this same chap was there. I raised this chap's idea with migration officials at the Australian embassy and he told me a few weeks later, `I know you've passed my idea on to all those involved.' This particular idea is that migration agents themselves should lodge a bond and say, `I'm going to vouch for the integrity of the person I am acting for.' I think the idea has some merit on the basis of the bona fides of the migration agents being up to speed. Of course it is not going to suit everybody, but it may clean out a little bit in the waiting list. It is an idea that I think is worth looking at. It is an idea of self-help and self-start which is born out of a genuine frustration with the fact that the process—which we all endorse in this place—that ensures integrity in the system and that ensures dignity for those who come through the system does in fact take time. Those sorts of measures and the results that we achieve are very important. 
Not too long ago in this place there was someone who sat here for a short time who attempted to divide this nation through race and bigotry, misconceptions and falsehoods about those who aspire to come to this nation to live and about those who aspire to come to this nation to visit. We do not want to see a system which evolves, develops, enhances, creates or even opens up the opportunity for that sort of debate to ever begin again in this country. Very simply, what we want is a system in place—and I believe that the measures contained in this bill will enhance the system that we currently have in place—that has the support of all Australians, whether they were born here or whether they have come here, and whether their family has been here 50 years, 150 years or 50,000 years. Everyone has to feel as though indeed they are a part of the equation in an equal and correct way. I suspect those who come to this country and choose to take an oath or affirmation of citizenship, as a declaration of support, care, and concern and attachment to this country, have something over those of us who have not had to take an oath or an affirmation like that.
I welcome the minister's initiative to try to give Australian born citizens a chance to get themselves up onto that same platform to say that they care about Australia. What is important is that we do not divide, like those opposite did for 13 years. What is important is that we bring together all people from all communities and from all backgrounds to continue to build a great nation.

"Zahra, Christian, MP",ALP,2000-03-06,"—In rising to speak to the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1999, let me state from the outset that I am not afraid to have a talk in this chamber about racism. It is one of those terms which has been bandied around this chamber, and there have been accusations of racism cast across this chamber on more than one occasion. It is a debate which Australia needs to have. It is a discussion which we as a nation need to have so that we can better understand the issues involved in matters relating to race and identity. I have cause from time to time to visit a great centre of ethnic diversity, that being Richmond, one of the greater suburbs in the fine city of Melbourne. This suburb in many ways describes the migrant experience, at least in part, in Australia. For many years, at least during the 1940s and 1950s, Richmond was dominated by the Greek community. My father tells me stories of how for years and years people would say that Richmond was an enclave of Greece. 
Right across Richmond, whether it be in Bridge Road or in Swan Street, there would be shops which would have Greek writing on the front of them, and people of Greek origin would congregate there, speaking their own language comfortably amongst friends. Many people at the time, my father tells me, would say, `Those Greeks, they never mix. They will never mix, they just stick to their own. They form ghettoes. They do not associate with everyone else. We don't want them mixing with us.' It is bitterly ironic that so many people echo that debate now when we see new migrant communities emerging in areas around the inner city, like Richmond, Fitzroy and Brunswick, where some of these new migrants, in particular the Vietnamese community, have quite a few shops next to each other in a number of streets. Some people still, 50 years on, parrot exactly the same arguments which were used to try to denigrate the Greeks when they came to Australia all those years ago.
Of course, the Greek community have been one of the great success stories of Australian immigration. Those Greeks who did have all of those shops and who did congregate and live their lives around Richmond during that time have now gone on to become wonderful Australian citizens and to raise great families here. They have happily formed a vibrant part of Australian culture. Those people now live not only in Richmond but right across Melbourne and right across Australia. They fit very comfortably into Australian life. The previous speaker referred to Pauline Hanson, at least by inference. It is interesting to note that those arguments are 50 years old. They were irrelevant then and they are even more irrelevant today. 
I want to reflect, at least for little while, on another great example of multiculturalism in Australia, that being the Latrobe Valley in my electorate. In so many ways, I am a product of that push towards multiculturalism in the Latrobe Valley which took place throughout the 1950s and 1960s. I think most people in this chamber would appreciate that I am from a Maltese family. Both my mother and my father are Maltese, and in fact I was born in Malta all those years ago in 1973. In many ways like the Snowy Mountains project, we had a massive infrastructure undertaking in the Latrobe Valley. Migrants came from every corner of the globe to the Latrobe Valley to contribute to building the massive power generation assets which we all take for granted today. We had people who came from Greece, from Italy, from Malta, from the Ukraine, from the Baltic States, from Ireland, from Wales and from everywhere that you could imagine. These people made an enormous contribution. There are some great Latrobe Valley migrant stories which are told from that period.
An Italian migrant to whom I spoke only last year told me that he stepped onto the boat in Italy when he was just 14 years old. I think in those days the boat trip from Italy to Port Melbourne was at least 2½ months. This 14-year-old boy, after a 2½ month boat trip by himself, met his brother at Port Melbourne, found his way to the Latrobe Valley and went straight to work. These are amazing things for people to countenance today, yet that was just one typical story—a great and courageous story—of people from that period. There are so many other stories which convey just as much courage and dash on behalf of those people who took that great journey years ago.
They did not come here to Australia to not contribute. The thing that I always find in speaking to migrants from different parts of the world is that they came here because they wanted to make a better life for themselves and a better life for their families. They wanted to build a life here which they could not have in the country from which they came. It was a difficult decision for so many of these families to make: a heart-wrenching decision to leave their families, many of whom have been there for literally thousands of years, to come to Australia to build a new life. In those days you did not have the telecommunications or the Internet or any of those things which you have today; the only thing you could do was to write a letter—and you would be lucky if it got there in two months time. It is important for us to acknowledge in this House the hardship which those people went through because it was a hardship they endured in order for them to build a better life for their families.
One of the stories so many migrants who came to the Latrobe Valley during that period always tell me is of how peaceful it was amongst people from different migrant backgrounds. We had people coming to a smallish place in the Latrobe Valley who were from different backgrounds and who, not that long before, had been fighting on different sides in World War II. Yet there was almost no violence, almost no antagonism, and very little in the way of racial denigration or abuse relating to the side that any person's family had been on during the war. I think this has a lot to do with the fact that, when they came to the Latrobe Valley, all of these migrants came there to work. They did not come to make trouble or cause any sort of disturbance amongst the people. They came because there was work to do, and they wanted a part of that work so that they could build the life they hoped for for their families. There was no shortage of work for them to do in the Latrobe Valley, and the massive assets we have in the Latrobe Valley today are testament to the amount of work they did.
There are a thousand other great stories of hardship and of success built around that period in the Latrobe Valley. Even today we see many of the products of their hard work and of their coming together as communities within the Latrobe Valley. We have wonderful institutions like the Italo-Australian Club in Morwell, the Latrobe Valley Maltese-Australian Association, Club Astoria and, more recently, the Commonwealth funded Gippsland Migrant Resource Centre. All these clubs were formed with the intention of people coming together within Australia, sharing their lives together and making friends, not in a way that would exclude them from participating in Australian culture but rather in a way that would encourage them to be comfortable and confident enough to participate fully in Australian culture. This is the point of difference that I want to draw the attention of the House to. We often hear criticism of ethnic groups, people from different backgrounds, for coming together in different areas. We often hear the criticism that these people should somehow run about and roam in the country as some sort of group of nomadic workers to meet the whim of any agriculturalist or grazier who happens to want some itinerant workers. It is pretty understandable that, when people from different backgrounds, especially those from non-English-speaking backgrounds, come to a new country one of the first things they will look for is someone who speaks the language they speak and someone who understands the customs and traditions that they are used to. This is not an unnatural thing for them to want to do. There are still quite a few people who believe and who say that these people should be somehow forced to assimilate with Australian culture, whatever that means in their mind. I say to them that they do not understand and they should soften their hearts a little and try to find some understanding of what these people genuinely experience. 
I often think of how hard it might have been for those people who came to the Latrobe Valley all those years ago, those people with the courage and dash to actually make that trip. When they arrived at Port Melbourne after the three-month boat trip, that was not the end of their trouble—as if it were not enough. Many of those people came from countries no more than 50 or 100 km long. So they had just sailed all the way around the world, arrived in Australia and, in the case of those who drove to the Latrobe Valley, driven for around five hours on pretty rough old track, as it was in those days. They drove for about five hours on mostly unsealed road through the wilderness and through the forest and arrived in the beautiful Latrobe Valley. I do not know what those people must have been thinking. They must have been thinking that they were arriving at the very ends of the earth. And yet those people stuck it out and did not despair despite how far and isolated they were from their families and loved ones. I admire their courage because, surely, without courage, a trip like that would simply not have been possible. When they did arrive in the Latrobe Valley, they quickly realised that their way to success was to work. The way to build the life they wanted was to build it through work;  their industry and their labour. 
That is why we have so many success stories in the Latrobe Valley of people from non-English-speaking backgrounds who have built a real life for themselves and their families. There are people from Italian backgrounds who run successful engineering contracting businesses. Di Fabro Constructions, which built the great southern stand at the MCG, is a Latrobe Valley based firm established by two Italian brothers who arrived off a boat in Australia in 1950. There is a place of some significance in the Latrobe Valley called the Ridge, which was an old migrant workers camp. The story goes that their tent was the first one up on that migrant workers camp called the Ridge all those years ago. So we have plenty to look back on in the Latrobe Valley, and we are fond of saying that, whilst Australia has just discovered the word `multiculturalism', we in the Latrobe Valley have been practising multiculturalism for some 50 years.
I do not want to confine my remarks to that glorious period of post World War II migration in the Latrobe Valley. It is important to consider what more recent migrants have to deal with. In particular, we have quite a few Bosnian refugees, who arrived in the Latrobe Valley after having experienced awful traumas in their countries—traumas more horrible than you or I could possibly imagine. I have been heartened to see the warm embrace given by the Latrobe Valley community to these people, recognising, as we do, the awful situation they have come from. I have been particularly moved in recent times to see the sensitivity that a lot of the students and staff at Lowanna College, which is the public secondary school in Moe, have shown to a number of students there from Bosnian refugee families. Such is the case as well with the Filipino community in the Latrobe Valley, who are one of our most recent ethnic community groups. Again, these people have fitted very quickly into the Latrobe Valley scene. I do not think there is an event I go to where I do not get to enjoy some of that magnificent Filipino cooking, which the women in particular insist that I eat every time they see me. It has been a very quick transition for these very hospitable people, the Filipinos, finding their way into the Latrobe Valley culture. 
When people talk about new migrants, they often make the mistake of characterising them as either boat people or some type of person who might not make a great contribution and who will probably be a burden as opposed to a wonderful contributor to Australian culture. From time to time, when I get asked questions about migration, I enjoy explaining to people some of the experiences in my electorate. There are at least a dozen doctors that I know of in my constituency who are from non-English-speaking backgrounds. They make a wonderful contribution. I have to say that in many cases I admire their earthiness and their feet on the ground approach to the way they conduct their medicine. It is often in stark contrast to some of the stodginess which is associated with the professional classes and the medical profession.
As you would know, Madam Deputy Speaker Crosio, we have a wonderful university in my electorate—Monash University's Gippsland campus. You do not have to travel too far at Monash University, Gippsland, to experience the great gift that it has been given in terms of the many academics who are from non-English-speaking backgrounds and who are making a magnificent contribution there in terms of the professional studies which they conduct. I know that we as a community benefit from having them there. Our students benefit from having people from all across the world at Monash University, Gippsland, talking about their experiences in places like India, Sri Lanka or Africa and just speaking with the worldliness which perhaps even as recently as 10 or 15 years ago we simply would not have found at a regionally based university. We thank those people for coming to us and we thank them for the contribution they are making.
One of the terms in this whole debate which most annoys me is the word `tolerance'. I often hear people saying, `We need to be tolerant. We should exercise tolerance.' It is a term which makes my skin crawl. What does `tolerant' mean? It seems to me to mean that, hopefully, if we summon all of our goodwill and everything, we should just be able to tolerate one another, as if that is the best that we as a nation can possibly hope to achieve. Two people can sit next to each other on a tram—a lady from a Muslim background who might be wearing a headdress, and a farmer perhaps even from my constituency—and they can just tolerate each other; they can only just stop themselves hitting each other. I think our language is all wrong. We should be talking about celebrating our cultural diversity because surely this is what is our great strength as a nation. We truly are a nation full of different cultures and full of people who have contributed to Australia as a result of the different culture that they bring to our nation. Yet time and again we talk about Australia's great reputation as a tolerant nation. I do not ever want us to be a tolerant nation. I do not want the best that we could ever be to be the scene of that farmer from my electorate and maybe a lady from a Muslim background—perhaps from Brunswick in Melbourne—just managing to put up with each other for 15 minutes on a tram on Sydney Road. I do not want that to be the best that Australia could ever hope to be.
We need to be seriously a country that celebrates its cultural diversity. We need to be seriously a nation that enjoys and appreciates every minute where we come across new cultures, where we come across people who bring new knowledge from different nations. We need to be a nation that is not afraid of new things. In 1950, we were a nation that was not afraid of new things. We were a nation that was prepared to open its doors to the world and say, `Come and join us. We would welcome you here.' Yet we still hear some of those same old arguments.

"Gambaro, Teresa, MP",LP,2000-03-06,"—The member for McMillan certainly has a smorgasbord of multiculturalism in his electorate, in many forms. I am sure that he could have spoken even further about what multiculturalism means to him in his electorate. I have always had a particular interest in immigration issues. I am very happy tonight to speak on the government's initiative in relation to Australia's migration program. There are several issues covered by this piece of legislation and I will touch on those very briefly. Firstly, I acknowledge the wonderful contribution the government has made in implementing a fair immigration system. I congratulate the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs on his hard work in this particularly difficult period where the migration program has been under constant pressure. I also thank him for meeting with different members of the ethnic communities in my electorate and for the intensity and pace with which he visits Australia. I refer particularly to the public meetings and consultations that he has with various groups. It was interesting to listen to previous speakers tonight referring to their multicultural experiences, either as elected representatives or being part of multiculturalism themselves, including the previous speaker, the member for McMillan. I would like to add briefly to some observations, coming from a migrant family. Madam Deputy Speaker Crosio, I know that you are also a proud recipient of multiculturalism through your association with your husband and the opportunity that migration brought to you. 
In the postwar and early 1950s migration, some 3.1 million migrants came to Australia and were willing to give up much from their own homelands. In my own case, my father, grandmother and mother migrated with very limited English skills. In those days, they managed with great difficulty. The greater emphasis on English skills and the way that technology and services have gone in present times would certainly have made it a lot more difficult. My grandmother probably spoke 10 words of English in the whole time that she was in Australia. It was not because she did not want to learn, but it was very difficult to teach someone in her sixties a new language.
One of the things I remember growing up in an Italian household was the hard work, perseverance and determination my whole family had, and particularly my grandmother. She was always in the back of my parents' small business, helping them in whatever way she could. It is this hard work and determination that really built this country. The wonderful contribution of migrants from all backgrounds needs to be acknowledged. In my electorate, I have a very large number of people of Greek and Italian origin, and from Sudanese, Filipino and Chinese communities as well. They live in a very harmonious manner. They work very hard. I have people from the Sudanese community and refugees who have experienced great difficulties and have come to this country from war torn conditions. The honourable member for Moreton spoke about the horrifying experiences of war and personal trauma that they have experienced.
There have been some wonderful success stories. I would like to acknowledge some of the people from my electorate, from backgrounds from all over the world, who have contributed. We have Raptis seafoods, who are very well known for their contribution to the seafood and building industries. I would also like to acknowledge the De Pascuale family, the family that sold pasta to Italy—the Nanda spaghetti factory. They sold that a few years ago to the Nestle company. There are also people like Nick Tsminas, who runs one of Redcliffe's most famous restaurants, the Ox, and Joe Camillieri, who has established one of Australia's most successful Mazda dealerships. I would like to acknowledge all of those people. They have worked very hard.
There are also a number of people in the community who work hard every day to make Australia a much more tolerant society, as the member for McMillan said. I would also say a much happier and more integrated society than we used to be. Some of the things that I do not ever want to see repeated are taunts in the playground that I experienced when I was younger, being called a `wog' and similar things. One of the things that I experienced later in my life was people speaking about immigration and immigrants to me and, because my skin was not olive and my eyes were not dark, they reflected their true feelings about immigration. Sometimes I wish I had not heard those things. But I think we have moved on quite a lot in 40 or 50 years. We have become a proud nation and we have become very proud of immigrants and the contribution they have made. They have come from all over the world. That is one of Australia's greatest strengths. We have a multicultural policy here that is the envy of the world. We do not have people fighting in the streets. We do not have war based on culture or religion. We do not have one side of a street not speaking to the other because they happen to be a different religion. We have a society that is very much in tune with others from different backgrounds. 
We have an immigration policy that is focused on finding a balance between skilled migration and genuine refugees. Most importantly, the migration program should serve our national interests together with our international responsibilities. For every migration place that is held up by lengthy administrative matters, there is a possibility of a genuine applicant somewhere in the world not having the opportunity to immigrate. That is the reality that this government faces every single day. With this in mind, the government has introduced today's amendments which deal with the unnecessarily complex aspects of the Migration Act. The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1999 will implement procedures to oversee the temporary entry business sponsorship and cancellation of permits where necessary. Temporary entry business visas are available for skilled applicants to enter Australia temporarily for the purpose of business, cultural, social and other activities. The new sections included in these amendments will ensure that the conditions of this temporary class of visas can be monitored and that the visas may be cancelled where the rules are breached. In addition, the amendments will prevent people from applying who would have been refused under the current migration policy. This saves an enormous amount of time, particularly time wasted by applicants who would have had absolutely no chance of succeeding. It is my belief that the migration program should allow genuine refugees and skilled applicants the opportunity to enter Australia through the proper channels.
Empowering state and territory corrective services authorities to detain non-citizens who are liable for deportation at the end of their prison sentences ensures that migration places can be filled by legitimate migrants as well as protecting our community from convicted criminals who are subject to deportation. These amendments also allow for flexibility in the appointment of migration officers. Under the amendments, the merits review rights are extended to some visa applicants who are not currently merits reviewable. In certain circumstances, visas will be granted to applicants who otherwise would be adversely affected by the visa capping provisions. The period in which a points tested visa applicant can remain in a pool is doubled. On an administrative level, the amendments remove the age limitation on the appointment of full-time members of the Refugee Review Tribunal. Additionally, decisions made by the Migration Review Tribunal will be treated in the same way as those made by the Immigration Review Tribunal. These measures protect the integrity of the Australian migration program while also allowing fair passage for legitimate applicants. The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1999 complements other good work that has already been done by the government in this area.
The spate of recent illegal immigrant arrivals is a cause of concern amongst the community at large. There is not a day when my electorate office is not phoned by members of the community concerned about the recent arrival of illegal immigrants by boats. It is fair to say that the media has had an absolute frenzy over this issue over the last few months. They really have not put forward a full picture of how this government is dealing with this particular problem. The other day when some 1,500 illegal refugees were returned, it was interesting to note that one of my local newspapers carried only a very small caption. Yet when 50 or a few hundred boat people arrive in northern Australia, you have full front page headlines and the media frenzy feeds on it for days on end.
The fact of the matter is that the Howard government is doing everything in its power as the government of a democratic nation to ensure that queue jumpers and non bona fide refugees do not take advantage of the Australian community's compassion. One of the most important steps recently taken by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, particularly in his travels to overseas countries in dealing with illegal boat people and arrivals, has been to ensure that there is a very extensive public education campaign offshore so that people understand that, when they pay a smuggler to bring them to Australia, they will also pay a far greater price. They need to be assured that this is a serious matter, that people smugglers face penalties of up to 20 years jail and fines of up to $220,000, that immigration officers will be at overseas posts and airports and that illegal immigrants will not be sent off to metropolitan cities like Sydney but detained in centres that are quite remote. It is important that these illegal arrivals understand that there is a penalty for coming out here, particularly for people smugglers. I applaud the government on the recent advertising and the harsher measures taken to ensure that illegal boat people do not come to Australia or that they are deterred in the strongest possible way. 
Currently, all unauthorised arrivals are detained under the Migration Act 1958. They are returned to their country of origin, unless they apply for a visa or they make claims that invoke Australia's international treaty obligations. Refugees making claims or applying for visas are then assessed under this protection visa process. If an applicant is refused and subsequent appeals to the Refugee Review Tribunal are also rejected, then the applicant is liable for immediate removal from Australia. This is a point that is rarely made in media reports about illegal immigrants: they are removed. Even if an unauthorised arrival is found to be a genuine refugee, that does not guarantee them permanent residence. Under the new measures implemented by this government, refugees are given a three-year temporary protection visa. This reverses the decision of previous Labor governments that allowed such cases access to permanent residence. In practical terms, while people have the right to work, they will not have the right to family reunion or the right to return to Australia if they go overseas. Additionally, they cannot have an application for permanent protection considered before 30 months, unless the minister decides that it is in the public interest.
These changes send a message to other people considering illegal travel to Australia that we are certainly not a soft touch, and that queue jumpers will be dealt with very harshly indeed. Other changes send a message to people who instigate these illegal entries that trafficking simply does not pay. The border protection bill passed by the parliament on 25 November introduces very tough measures to combat people smuggling by sea. Whilst making our laws for illegal immigrants fairer, we need to also give customs and immigration officials the power to detect and enforce Australia's border strategies in international waters. Some of those powers being looked at in the border protection bill include detention, forfeiture, seizure and disposal of vessels found to be unseaworthy or a risk to safety or navigation or a threat to the environment, as well as seizure and disposal of ships and aircraft used in people-smuggling operations. It is also important to ensure the safety of officers. Changes to the Customs Act will allow Customs officers to carry and use approved firearms and other approved items of personal defence equipment in certain circumstances for personal defence.
Another issue that has been addressed by the government's changes is the problem of forum shoppers. People who hold protection in another country will no longer be owed protection by Australia, unless they have taken all possible steps to avail themselves of the alternative protection. News of these tough new measures is being spread via an information campaign that I mentioned earlier, and it particularly targets the countries from which people illegally immigrate. The campaign will alert people to the futility of trying to enter Australia illegally and will inform people of significant consequences of their actions. These measures and today's amendments are evidence of the government's hard work and willingness to deliver a fair and efficient migration program. I commend this bill to the House.",REPS,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1,speech
"Ripoll, Bernie, MP",ALP,2000-03-06,"—I rise tonight to speak on the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1999. I, as does the Labor Party, fully support the bill. To an extent, this bill is the crossing of the t's and the dotting of the i's and removes the anomalies contained in this legislation. This amendment bill provides an opportunity for the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to tidy up the legislation and to get on with matters of higher priority in relation to the whole process of immigration. I believe these are matters of concern not only to the people of Oxley but to everyone in Australia. The better utilisation of resources and an equitable application and review process are essential if our immigration system is to be effective and efficient. This is particularly important in areas where Australia actively seeks immigrants. We should be making the process as user-friendly as possible and taking into consideration the difficulties faced by individuals in regard to the timing of the process and how this affects not only the applicant but also their family. 
Business migration is an exceptional element to immigration in Australia. It is a recognition that a business and the skills that it requires are unique and that they sometimes cannot be satisfied by any individual in Australia. Although I always find it difficult to believe that there is not one person in this country who is not able to do any task or who cannot be trained to do any task in comparison with someone from overseas, perhaps there are circumstances and times when special businesses with very unique skill sets can only be sourced from overseas.
It is essential that this form of migration sponsorship is not abused by either the employer or the employee. The jurisdiction that the minister will be granted under this amendment will ensure that business migration will remain a legitimate program. If a company is genuine in its commitment to commerce in Australia, it will not be threatened by schedule 1 in this legislation.
The majority of the migration detention centres in Australia are in fairly remote locations, with most being in very remote locations. They are nothing like what is sometimes portrayed by the media or those who would have people believe that illegal immigrants are lodged in either 3- or 4-star accommodation with resort-like conditions. I have had the opportunity, through my membership of the migration committee, to visit all of Australia's detention centres for illegal immigrants. From my inspection of these facilities, I have found them to be adequate to house people for short periods of time but in no way would they qualify for long periods of detention.
The point I am making is that we have a duty to properly house and feed all detainees, regardless of why or how they have arrived here or why they are being detained. No-one expects plush conditions but we certainly do expect fair standards. I believe that all Australians would expect this in our detention centres, hence the urgency to process and make decisions on the status of illegals and to establish their rights as soon as possible. In this way the stress would be reduced not only on our facilities and resources but also on these people themselves.
Queensland does not have a migration detention centre, and so detainees are placed in existing state correctional facilities until they can either be moved or otherwise processed through the system. With the advent of schedule 4, detainees who have committed a criminal offence will be legitimately held in custody for the duration of their sentence and until possible deportation. Schedule 4 will ensure that detainees endure the full force of our judicial system by having to serve their prison sentence before being removed or deported. Schedule 4 also allows DIMA to utilise the exceptional facilities and custodial knowledge of the state correctional systems. Upon the serving of a custodial sentence, the state corrections will have the authority to detain individuals who have been identified by DIMA for deportation or removal.
My own ongoing experiences with DIMA continually reinforce my view that the department needs to place a very high importance on the accuracy and validity of information that is provided by these people. Schedules 2, 3 and 5 tighten this practice further for a very good reason. There are many ambiguous elements to the migration application and review process. Hopefully, these amendments will rectify a seemingly endless source of contention and delay and, might I also say, the cause of a lot of work for the staff in my office in assisting people through the process on matters that otherwise should be straightforward and dealt with in a timely and efficient manner by the department. I am sure that many applications for migration are completed with an individual's interpretation of the requirements, supporting documentation and soundness of circumstances.  
The clarity of DIMA definitions is essential to the accuracy of the inquiries and applications. The migration process is a very personal and, I believe for many people, frightening ordeal. The precision of definitions and the avoidance of interpretation as being proposed in schedule 2 should alleviate some anguish for applicants and go some distance to reducing the workloads of not only the department but also many federal members across the country, as was alluded to by several prior speakers.
I am often asked to assist people with their migration applications. I do not believe it is appropriate that a member of parliament be involved directly at such an early stage and so, to some degree, I have always declined to directly assist them at that point. But I make it clear that I have always been and will always continue to be very active in assisting people with migration matters and in ensuring that they receive fair and comprehensive assistance from not only me but also the department.
A hidden benefit of this personal practice is that I do not have to enter the daunting realm of `DIMA-speak'. If the definition of officer in schedule 3 saves one inquiry, it is very welcome. The clarity of terms, definitions and authorities can only assist the migration process in the end. This clarification of definition and process is also applicable to the review process proposed in schedule 5. The conditions of review placed on applicants are quite harsh, but at least a non-citizen is given the opportunity to have his or her application considered further.
I am concerned that this addition to the workload of the Migration Review Tribunal will further delay the review process. The applicants, however, are forced to accept these delays, often regardless of personal representations made by members such as me and I am sure many others in this House. Unfortunately, the government continues to fail to realise that an applicant's decision to migrate to Australia far outweighs the indignity they suffer and the financial burden they endure throughout the migration process. They often come from places where there is nothing to return to, or from places where their lives are in danger. Fortunately, schedules 6 and 7 of this bill rectify somewhat part of the indignity of which I was just speaking.
I have had many constituents contact me requesting guidance with overcoming the frustrating experience of missing out on gaining a visa because of the `capping' process. Having undertaken the lengthy task of providing all the information and documentation required for a visa, their application is eventually refused because of the sheer numbers. These people have satisfied the entire selection criteria of the migration process and have been assessed as successful applicants, but they cannot receive a visa because it has been deemed that there are too many applications before theirs.
An extraordinary number of people accept the capping limit as sheer bad luck. I am very pleased that schedule 6 will allow DIMA to accommodate the legitimate reason for missing the cap as beyond the control of the applicant at least. When a migration application requires interaction with many government agencies, migration systems should accommodate the inevitable delays and misplacement of material that is universal to the Public Service. The lengthening of the pool period for applications is also a very welcome amendment. I believe that anyone who can successfully complete a DIMA visa application should be granted the reward of not having to do it again for at least another 24 months.
I am very pleased to have learned this week that the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs has had a change of heart and wants to increase the migrant intake to Australia. This is an unbelievable turnaround from a minister who has gone out of his way to reduce numbers, to make criteria harder and to reduce access to family reunion. While Australia can obviously benefit greatly from skilled migration, the government's efforts to attract these people to invest in Australia to start businesses and to live here are failing to meet the same test. It is often the case that conditions on family members' access to visas and their ability to stay in Australia are very different from those that apply to the original applicant. This causes skilled and business migrants enough problems that this alone can affect their decision on whether to stay or whether to follow through with their application at all. 
There is currently a lot of talk about encouraging or forcing migrants, depending on their status, to migrate directly to regional country areas. Most people recognise that regional areas are in need of more people to boost their economies and to create a critical mass that can sustain them. If the government is serious about trying to achieve this, it needs to look closely at the whole process of immigration and the efficiencies, or lack of them, that currently exist. There are clearly a number of anomalies with the government's position on migration matters and issues of overstaying and illegal entry. While on one hand the government spends a great deal of taxpayers' dollars on propaganda and resources on illegal entrants, it is in total disproportion in relation to the number of overstayers currently in Australia and the resources that are spent on either detecting these people or making some efforts to have them leave our country.
The department's and the government's priorities seem to be more focused on keeping people from certain countries out rather than tackling the very large numbers of people who overstay their visas from countries where there are often no visa restrictions or requirements for them to enter Australia in the first instance. There are currently more than 50,000 people overstaying in Australia. This to me is a massive problem and is one that the government and the department are doing very little to address. While on one hand the government is now talking about increased migration, it has reduced access at the same time to family reunion migration. This government is saying that it is okay for you to come to this country, but forget about bringing your family. `Yes, we want you to migrate under the state specific migration mechanisms, but we will make it difficult for your family to enter or we will not allow them to enter at all.'
The ethnic communities of Australia have much to be disappointed about in this government as do many others in the community. We have a government that says it is pro-family, a government that says it wants to help regional Australia, and a government that says, if only just very recently, that it wants to increase migration. But the claims are a great distance from the reality. The attacks on family reunions have caused many of my constituents great hardship and a longing to be reunited with their parents and siblings. It is not good enough just to cap or to restrict the number of direct family members that can be reunited in Australia based on the current criteria. There are many cases for compassionate family reunion—cases where family members have only a short number of years to live or cases where families have made a great commitment to our country, have come here on goodwill and have been accepted by our country. Yet, when they want to be reunited with their parents, with their brothers and their sisters—with their direct family—this government tells them that that is not good enough and that their family will not be reunited.
I believe a much more compassionate approach is needed. When the government says it wants to help regional Australia through state specific migration mechanisms, it could begin by looking at the difficulties and the obstacles placed in the path of those that may be interested. It is a government that says—and again, if only just recently—it wants to increase migration yet does everything it can to make the process difficult, prohibitive and ineffective, if not at the very least totally inefficient. There are many examples of this, but one that demonstrates the government's position perfectly is the freeze on the refugee program. This punishes the legitimate refugee applicant. The unfortunate message being conveyed is that if you can find the money to pay a people smuggler, you can get to Australia and tell them you are a refugee. But do not bother trying to prove that your human rights are threatened by remaining in your country of origin. Forget about seeking refugee status under the sanction of the United Nations. Stop trying to prove that in your country you are not allowed to practise your religion or voice a political opinion different from that of your government. Do not think that the daily breach of your human rights is going to be enough to get you anywhere near Australia. Surely you do not think that the Australian government is going to assess your case separately from those who have landed on our shores illegally. I find this absolutely unbelievable. I cannot understand how this government on the one hand says one thing, but then does another thing. It makes it easy for some people and harder for others. It seems to me that, if you are a person trying to enter this country legally, it is made even more difficult by this government. 
The common theme of this government's migration policy today is that every application for migration is a dodgy one. It does not matter how you get here, it does not matter where you are applying from and it does not matter what your background is. The member for Moreton earlier mentioned the need for integrity in the migration system. I honestly believe that a successful migration applicant has been stripped of their integrity and dignity before they get here and certainly stripped of their dignity by the process put in place by this government and by this department. How nice of the member for Moreton to condone the suitable migration of those who have sufficiently survived the humiliation of the application process and now accept the position of immigration in the 21st century so sanctimoniously outlined by the member for Moreton.
The member for Moreton also talked about the expectations these people have of Australia, and no doubt there are many. But the point that he made was more about them not carrying on their own traditions and cultures rather than about what might be our expectations and their expectations of Australia. But progress has been made today with the changes contained in this bill—changes that will be welcomed not only by the members on this side of the House but also by many ethnic communities. 
There are probably many examples of immigration cases that could be brought to the attention of the government for special consideration, but tonight I want to use the changes in this bill to highlight one. It is the plight of the 633 stateless Vietnamese living in the Philippines who are seeking a home in Australia. They all have sponsoring relatives in Australia who are willing to support their family members financially and for all their needs. These people have been languishing in the Philippines for well over a decade. These people have close links with Australia, with about 250 of them having sponsoring relatives who are parents and siblings and with the others having sponsoring aunts, uncles and cousins. In a letter that I received from one of my constituents—a constituent who is personally affected by this situation—outlining their plight, he says that the resettlement of these sons and daughters of Australian citizens is not a burden on our society. I agree with him, and I believe that these 633 people would make a great contribution and would be a benefit to our country. He also states that this will not open the floodgates, as the Vietnamese people have stopped fleeing their country since the early 1990s. While these 633 stateless Vietnamese remain in the Philippines, they are denied basic rights—for example, basic rights to own property and, in the case of the Philippines, to work and/or to have access to any public facilities.
I believe a great deal of good could flow not only from the changes that have been made in this legislation and which are being debated tonight but also for the Vietnamese community of Australia by reuniting them with their lost families. I believe 633 people is a small number if we consider some of the recent events of the last couple of years in terms of people who have tried to enter illegally for whatever reason or in terms of the current immigration intake that Australia has. I believe that the message that would be sent out to the world about these 633 people waiting to be reunited with their families is that Australia can be compassionate on immigration and can set about to put in place a process that could deal with a very specific circumstance. I believe that could have a huge impact on our image internationally and for our ethnic communities in Australia. If the minister is serious about increasing the number of migrants, this would be a great place to start and a very compassionate place to start. I commend this bill to the House and I ask the minister to examine very closely the case of the 633 stateless Vietnamese in the Philippines and look forward to his favourable response.

"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,2000-03-06,"—What a fine speech my colleague from Oxley just made. It shows you the talent that has come into the parliament for the Labor Party. The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1999 is an omnibus bill that is designed to implement a number of initiatives and amendments to the main legislative instrument—the Migration Act of 1958. The proposed amendments cover a wide range of areas, including amendments to the temporary entry business sponsorship and transitional arrangements which reflect the creation of the new Migration Review Tribunal. 
The opposition supports the amendments, but these amendments really go no way to helping develop a proper immigration policy that will start to bring more suitable people to this country legally. We need to have a larger population, specifically directed, in order to help people in regional areas. The current process is so slow that those who have skills and family and want to start putting together their lives here are finding it very difficult. Information for migrants from immigration officers is always at a premium. Everything seems to be secret. People wanting to know even if their forms have been received and are at least in line to be processed cannot glean this bit of information. These people have also been terrorised into not seeking information because they have been told that it will affect their chances of entering the country and might slow down the process of their papers being passed through the processes. 
Yes, we have to have checks and balances, but surely there must be a staged process that each application goes through and surely it would be fairer if, after each stage, that person could be informed that they have passed through that stage of the process. It would be much fairer and would be a more decent way of processing these applications. A person can wait for over 12 months to hear something and then be told no. Then they have to pay again to have the application reassessed if new information comes to light and, if they have to get—as has been the case in several I have come across—certification and qualifications from qualifying certification bodies, they have to pay for them again. That can be very expensive and it certainly does not encourage people to continue to want to migrate. 
It was interesting to note that the Prime Minister has pushed his Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to open the debate to bring in skilled migrants in greater numbers, but what I really see here are the dollar signs in the Prime Minister's and minister's eyes. According to the Australian this morning, recent research has shown that 1,000 skilled migrants would bring an additional $35 million to revenue over four years compared with family migration, which costs $1.5 million per thousand, and humanitarian migration, which costs $21.5 million per thousand. So, when the dollar signs beckon, this government's policy is to forget about the existing families who have made their homes in Australia and have made a great contribution and not to consider humanitarian migration as part of that skilled migration, which I think is a major mistake.
Skilled migration means that a person and his or her family have to find a job and that their host has to employ them for at least four years, yet they are still not eligible for things like education and health support until they have been here for the mandatory two years. This automatically rules out other groups for greater access to migration programs, as most of the time they do not have that sort of money. For some time I have been trying to have state specific migration put into the system. While some states such as New South Wales are not keen to have more migrants at this stage—and one could understand their propositions—Tasmania and South Australia, as you will see statistically and as you will note from the comments of their state leaders, are more than keen to add to their populations, but they are finding obstacles all the way to those opportunities.
Why is it so hard? When some of the Kosovo refugees wanted to make their homes in Tasmania—those who were in the safe haven at Brighton in my electorate—they were told categorically by this government that they were not welcome. Among that group there were a medical doctor, several academics, a well-known artist, many tradespersons of many descriptions, and a number of bright and cheery children who made many friends in our communities. Surely it would not have been too much of an effort to give them temporary resident visas until normal checks could be made to process the proper immigration applications. So here were some people who would choose to live in Tasmania and wanted to do that not being given that opportunity. I think that was a tragic and foolish policy pursued by the minister. 
Just for the record, many have been forced to return to a totally unsatisfactory situation in Kosovo. Those that remain are tied up in camps and are not allowed to participate in their communities. In trying to trace friends that have returned, a number of young people in Tasmania have contacted my office to say their letters have been returned. I have made inquiries through the postal systems and the United Nations and I have found that letters go to Belgrade and no further. There is no mail or contact system set up in Kosovo. People are still living in tents and temporary accommodation, many ordinary services just do not exist and there does not appear to be any way of contacting those who have returned and have been scattered throughout that country. One shudders to think what the rest of the conditions are like there and about the difficulties that people are having. From time to time we read of those continuing difficulties, and of course those people are in the middle of their winter.
Tasmania needs people who are prepared to have a go, people who are prepared to work in all the sorts of areas that many of our brightest have left. If there were a program to encourage those who are prepared to work and be trained in the new areas in our state, that would be to everyone's advantage. Additional people living in an area provide additional jobs: they need to buy or build a house, they need to put their children through schools and they need to buy groceries, clothes and transport, just like everybody else. Australia receives only 80,000 immigrants per year, coming into a population of 19 million. This figure has become fewer in recent years. We allowed in 150,000 immigrants a year after World War II, and that did not count all those British immigrants who came in as automatic citizens in that period.
Australia would benefit by a greater population. Labor has identified that a greater population would achieve higher economic growth rates in rebuilding rural areas, in improving the quality of life in rebuilt rural areas and in strengthening international relations. It would also assist us in affording the extra costs associated with an ageing population. Labor recognises that it is not a simple question, but this country cannot afford to have a falling population. Pressures from outside our shores are already here. Our regions are just dwindling away as what is left of the work force moves to where work can be found. The country is emptying. The economic situation in rural areas is chronic.
I understand that only 369 migrants came to Tasmania last year. That is a quarter of the number of those who came 10 years ago. We have been told by the federal minister that we could use a special program for sponsoring skilled migrants, but of the 2,000 migrant places filled under the scheme last year none came to Tasmania. When you link migrant intake to specific jobs, Tasmania is going to be left behind the eight ball. That is because of the time taken for people to come through and the fact that many of the jobs we would like those skilled migrants to undertake have either not yet been invented or need more people to set up, as the skills are not readily available in the state. We might be able to put on a few things like call centres, but we have many people looking for work, people who are quite capable of being trained in those sorts of jobs. What we want are new skills to help those with the ideas to develop the new jobs. I think the shadow minister for population has hit upon the right combination: we need to link skills, regional development and immigration. If we link skilled migration to regional skills shortages, there will be the potential to contribute to the local economy while breaking down some of the misconceptions that many people have about immigration. 
Many wish to come to the state and start something up or redevelop an existing business, but not only do they have to provide up-front a large amount of cash to prove their bona fides but also they are stuck with the expenses of dealing with their children and spouses for the statutory period of time while awaiting permanent status. They are treated like overseas visitors and have to pay overseas rates for everything, including the university education of their children. Their health costs also have to be paid without the opportunity of tapping into our national health scheme. It can be very expensive for a business migrant putting all his capital into a business to then try to educate two or three children at university, while paying the same price as for an overseas student. That needs to be looked at, and we need to apply our inventiveness to overcome that problem. Frankly, it is putting a lot of people off the business migration scheme, and we need to rectify it. We need to have more user-friendly sorts of schemes to attract the people we would like to see settle in our country. So far, we are only stopping people that we do not want.
The amendments recommended to the House in this legislation really only tinker around the edges of the existing legislation. There is not much innovation or deep thinking from the minister or this government in the amendments. There is nothing concrete yet to assure me that increasing the numbers which are being bandied about at the moment in the skilled migration program will address the whole problem with migration in my state. I hope that, once the Joint Standing Committee on Migration has finished its deliberations on state-specific migration, the federal government will take some notice of the outcomes.
There is another matter I want to touch on. The member for Oxley, who preceded me in this debate, touched on several very important points. Recently, with him and others from the Joint Committee on Migration, I was able to visit some of the detention centres. I had read articles in which commentators had built these centres up as four-star accommodation set aside for those who had arrived illegally by boats. I can assure the Australian public that the facilities are not four star, but I can also assure them that, in humane terms, they are quite adequate for a short-term stay. The staff in these centres are very well trained and adequate, and I believe that they are doing an excellent job. They certainly look after the health and education of these detainees. There are many children among them. It is very sad to look at these children who have certainly come through a very stressful situation, as I agree the adults have.
I was very interested to discover that there are 21½ million people in the world who are of refugee status, are under threat or have nowhere to go. It is an enormous amount of people, and we take only 12,000 a year under the refugee program. I think the general public of Australia is very decent, and if we can explain to them that there are that many people out there who are looking for a genuine home we might be able to increase that 12,000 in the future. Every time there is a conflict in the Balkans, Afghanistan or Iraq, people are displaced—ordinary people who lose their homes, their opportunities and their educational facilities, who are usually separated from their family. Sometimes families are split up and contact is lost altogether. That is very sad, and those people should be given opportunities to improve their situation.
The other thing I want to mention tonight involves people who overstay their visas. Although we focus a lot on boat people and the illegal immigrants arriving on our coasts, just the other day I discovered that about 50,000 people overstay their visas. Most of those people come in by plane. The people receive a visa through the normal channels and then overstay that visa. There are about 50,000 people a year in Australia with that status. The 2,000 people who arrived by boat recently are really only small in number, but we seem to spend an enormous amount of money and effort on those 2,000 people compared with what we spend on the 50,000 people. That needs to be given some consideration as well. 
Immigration in this country has been extensive in the postwar period, and I think it is time to look again at its role in building our nation. In Tasmania, many immigrants post war and in the 50s and 60s helped build the infrastructure of our road and energy systems. They fitted into our community very well and have become great Tasmanians, as have their children and their children's children. We can look with pleasure at improving opportunities in the future. The opposition does not have any objection to what is being proposed, and we would like to see some more useful programs put in place to try to attract more people to Australia so we can continue to develop the nation.

"Moylan, Judi, MP",LP,2000-03-06,"—I rise tonight to speak on a matter of concern to my electorate, to Western Australia and probably to Australia as a whole. It is a matter that goes to the heart of concerns of the grape growing industry principally in my electorate, but it is a matter that concerns others as well. AQIS is currently going through a process of examining the issue of the importation of table grapes to Australia. There is strong pressure coming from growers in California and from some retailers to export table grapes from California to Australia. The growers in the Swan Valley have raised some serious concerns about the process adopted by AQIS and question the rigour of the highly technical pest risk analysis. Page 8 of AQIS's own handbook states that the process is designed to ensure that the risks of entry, establishment and spread of pests and disease and their potential impacts are fully evaluated, that the risk is managed in a manner consistent with Australia's very conservative approach to acceptance of pest and disease risk and that stakeholders are fully informed and satisfied with the process followed and understand the basis for the decision. It defines stakeholders in this handbook as including the applicant/proponent for a specific proposal and all interested parties. 
Unfortunately, the reality is that the time for consultation for this process was very short. Agriculture WA had 60 days to consider the draft import risk analysis but it had only 11 days to consider the pest risk assessment. This assessment is a highly technical and critical part of the analysis. Agwest met with growers 30 days into the process and were very surprised to learn that none of the key grape or viticulture groups in Western Australia had received copies of the draft. I understand that AQIS was unable to provide a list of stakeholders to the WA growers, so the stakeholder consultation could not be checked against those organisations that should have been consulted with. This is a highly technical matter involving pests and diseases that could potentially destroy Western Australia's outstanding reputation for near disease free table grapes. Responding to the report within the time frame represented a significant effort by technically competent people. 
The future of the industry is at stake, and it would be reasonable to expect the early dissemination of both the import risk analysis and the pest risk analysis to all stakeholders. It is reasonable also to expect that the time for response should take into account that growers are at their peak period at this very moment, at a time when they are expected to respond to this report. It is absolutely imperative that there be application of technical rigour in this matter so that this issue can be properly examined and so that pests and diseases do not wipe out the crops of our growers and the livelihood of a large section of Australian industry. According to independent technical people, they do not believe that this rigour has been applied. I understand from my growers that AQIS has not been prepared to provide the scientific reasons behind the draft data so that technical rigour can be reasonably assured and measured. I remind the House that the gross farm gate value of production of currants, raisins, wine and table grapes in Western Australia is around $29 million. In addition to that, value adding is very significant in the wine industry at about $50 million.  
I have taken the opportunity to outline my growers' concerns to the Secretary to the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and I have also spoken to the minister, because I think these are serious matters. My growers are not afraid of competition, but they have protected Western Australian industry from pests and diseases and they recognise just how important that is to their livelihood and also to Western Australia overall. I had a letter from the growers that outlined a number of issues. As I said, there are genuine concerns about the health of the viticultural industry if this process is not entered into properly. AQIS have set out the terms for going into this analysis and they seem to have just ignored the requirements set out in their own handbook. I think it is a serious matter and it is one I certainly wanted to draw to the attention of the House. I have appreciated the assistance of the Grape Growers Association in Western Australia and Agwest in being able to put this information—(Time expired)",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Grape Growing Industry</title>,Adjournment,19,1,speech
