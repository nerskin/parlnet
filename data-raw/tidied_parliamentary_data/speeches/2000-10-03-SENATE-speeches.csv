"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2000-10-03,"—I indicated to Senator Faulkner during question time that I would expedite inquiries as to whether anyone in my office had discussed any matter in relation to the execution of a warrant against a staffer's home with anyone else. I said I would not come back if my answer was the same but I would if it was different. Since I now have the answer and I am here, I am happy to put on record that during the remainder of question time I spoke to my chief of staff. He confirmed for me that he has discussed it with no-one outside the office. He has also confirmed that with the other personal staff member who was there and with the Federal Police departmental liaison officer, who is not actually a personal staff member of mine but nonetheless was also in the room at the time. So the bottom line is that the matter has not been discussed by anybody in my office with anybody outside of my office—that is, not in the office on the phone. Do you know what I mean?

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2000-10-03,"—I move: 
That the Senate take note of the answers by the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp) and the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (Senator Alston), to questions without notice asked by Senator Cook and Senator O'Brien today, relating to fuel excise.
During question time I put a number of questions to the Assistant Treasurer on what has become the white-hot political issue in Australia: why are Australians paying too much for their petrol? Once again the government ducked, weaved and avoided answering directly any of those questions. This is now a serial offence. The government has refused to come clean about its position on petrol prices in Australia for the last sitting fortnight, for the sitting weeks before that, earlier when we pressed it, and again today. Indeed the government, along with the Australian Democrats, declined to conduct a properly based inquiry into why Australians are paying too much for their petrol in order to defend itself from not having the facts presented to the community so that ordinary Australians, who are now more heavily taxed at the bowser than ever before, can have before them all the information to enable them to make proper judgments about what the factual situation is. This is a question that concerns Australians everywhere but it concerns them no more importantly than in regional Australia, where petrol prices are recorded at levels well above the dollar. In fact, in Kalgoorlie at the present time $1.11 is the standard charge at the bowser. People in country Australia are finding that petrol prices are not only higher than in urban Australia, where they are at record levels, but that as well the higher prices are present on supermarket shelves, in the cost of consumer services in country Australia and in the cost of doing business in country Australia. 
The government have been falsely proclaiming that there is nothing they can do about it. On 1 July they imposed a GST on petrol—a tax on the already existing tax of excise; a tax on a tax. The questions today were about whether the Premier of Western Australia, who has publicly postured in that state, calling on the federal government to do something, has actually done anything about it. Since the government declined to answer that question, one presumes that what Richard Court has done in Western Australia is for public consumption, given that there is an election due in that state this year or early next year and that the standard requirement of putting any questions in writing to this government has not been undertaken by him. As well, the government have declined to answer the question that the Premier of Western Australia clearly has declared his support for—that is, the removal of the CPI effect based on the GST tax on a tax from the forthcoming adjustment in February of the petrol excise level. Richard Court has called for that. It is clear that he has done nothing about it, other than make public statements. But when asked today what the government would do, again they obfuscated, again they avoided the point.
We still have no answer for the estimated GST contribution to the consumer price indexed fuel excise increase due in February. Again, the minister avoided that question. How much revenue windfall—that is, how much from the taxpayer—will the federal government gain from the fuel tax windfall? They refuse to say the figure. Of course, one can see the political device here. They will not name the amount because as soon as Australians realise how deeply into their pocket the federal government have got their hand over petrol prices, they will rightly demand that that money be given back to them. The government's estimated revenue windfall in the budget from petrol prices is much less that what they are currently receiving. We know the budget is in a very high surplus, generated in part by this windfall. How much is it? And why won't you tell Australia how much it is? Why won't you say that you will give it back so as to afford some relief to ordinary Australians who have to pay the higher costs of petrol prices? It is no good railing against the sheikhs in the Middle East who push up the OPEC barrel price when it was within the competence and ability of this government to hand some of that money back to reduce the burden on ordinary Australians. It is for the reasons that this government will not come clean on that the Australian Labor Party have announced today that we will conduct our own inquiry. We believe that the first thing should be that the Prime Minister be held to account—(Time expired)",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Fuel Excise</title>,Questions Without Notice,8,1
"Gibson, Sen Brian",LP,2000-10-03,"—I rise to speak on the motion about a tax on fuel. Isn't it ironic that the Labor Party are carrying on about the tax on fuel when they are really talking about the scheme that they introduced when they were in power?
—We didn't introduce the GST, Brian.
—Yes, you were. You were talking about the excise scheme that you introduced. I think you raised the excise from 5c a litre up to 34c a litre when you were in power. That was a big hit on all users of transport in Australia. You did that when you were in power. When this government came to power we offered tax relief by way of tax reform to the Australian community, and you opposed it all the way. The ALP opposed it all the way. We offered tax relief on incomes. We offered relief and reorganisation of the indirect tax system. We offered family tax relief and we offered fuel tax relief, particularly to rural and regional Australia. How did we do that? We offered relief from excise, particularly for heavy transport—that is trucks over 20 tonnes—with a 24c a litre reduction in excise. For trucks over 4½ tonnes outside the city areas, we offered similar relief. As a consequence of that and the GST, the estimates were that trucking costs would go down very substantially. In fact, I well remember the Road Transport Forum before the Senate inquiry into the ANTS program claiming that if everything stayed the same—in other words, if all prices did not go up—our reduction in wholesale sales tax on trucks, trucking equipment, tyres et cetera and the reduction of 17c plus seven in excise on their fuel would lead to reductions of between 15 and 19 per cent in road transport haulage rates in the long term.
—Where did it all go wrong?
—Oil prices have gone up, Senator. That is what has gone wrong. World oil prices have gone up. We in Australia, being two per cent of the world economy, do not control oil prices. You know that; everyone in Australia understands that. That is what has happened. The excise is a fixed price. It is not related to the price of oil. The excise is a fixed quantity and it stays level. The only changes to the excise are the six-monthly CPI adjustments, which your government brought in.
—What about the GST?
—The GST was backed off from the excise so that the price of fuel basically stayed the same, and that is what has happened. Everyone in business can get their 6.7c or thereabouts GST back from the price of fuel. Those in the transport business using heavy trucks or those in regional Australia with trucks above 4½ tonnes get the excise back. So transport costs have in fact gone down in real terms, leaving aside the world price changes for oil. Apropos that, everyone is really concerned about world oil prices going up. The price was less than $US12 a barrel 18 months ago; it hit a peak of $US37 a couple of weeks ago. It dropped back to $US30 three days ago, and I noticed it was $US32.4 this morning. So it is a volatile market. 
I am sure the Senate would be interested, and the Australian community would be interested, in knowing that there was an interesting article in the Financial Review of three weeks ago quoting Sheik Yamani. Those of us who are old enough will remember Sheik Yamani was the leader of OPEC during the oil crisis in the 1970s. In this article, Sheik Yamani criticises his OPEC colleagues for allowing the world price of oil to go up so high just recently. He reminds them that, by allowing the oil prices to go up, they will allow substitutes to come in—be they gas or other substitutes—and as a consequence they will be shooting themselves in the foot, and that it was a silly program by OPEC to do that and, of course, all the other oil producers will come about. He predicts that the world price will collapse down into the 20s level next year. Let us hope, on behalf of all Australians, that that happens. That is what we have to pray for. Let us hope that Australian producers and other producers around the world lift their production and drive the price of oil and hence of petrol at the bowser down.

"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,2000-10-03,"—What an interesting defence of the government's GST tax take on petrol! Senator Gibson, for whom I have the greatest respect, I know had great difficulty in putting up that defence. In fact, he only mentioned the GST in response to interjections from me. Apart from that, you would think that the GST never existed. You would think that the government never put a GST on petrol. In fact, that is exactly what the public are dirty on, Senator Gibson. That is exactly what the public are upset about, because this government and its National Party and Democrats coalition partners told the public before the last election, and subsequent to the last election: `The GST will not increase the price of fuel'—will not increase the price of fuel, will not affect the price of fuel.
Sure, the government went about a process where they reduced the excise. Sure, excise is a fixed amount of tax on petrol. But they then introduced the GST, which is a tax on petrol. Excise is a tax and GST is a tax on petrol. After they did all their sums, they said: `Well, we think that there is a 1.5c per litre savings within the industry,' as a result of all of these other good things that they have introduced with the GST. They said: `Somehow the industry has to deliver 1½c of what we should really deliver in excise reduction. We want them over there to do it.' When the 1½c a litre did not materialise, because it was never there—that is the reality—they sooled the poor old ACCC out there to try and find it. They sent them out scurrying about looking for 1½c of industry savings. I do not think they are going to find it. I know they are not going to find it.
The government is now here trying to defend the situation. Of course we all know that crude oil prices is a reasonable factor in the price of fuel. We know that, and we know that crude oil prices have gone up. But the government promised the Australian public—and that is why we have to keep reminding them—that the GST would not increase the price of fuel. Well, it has, and I do not know how the government can continue to maintain that it has not.  The reality is that the GST goes onto the retail price of petrol, diesel and LPG. That is what the government ought to address itself to if it is not about increasing the price of fuel. It is not a budgetary matter. I listened to the Treasurer today during question time. He said in response to questions, as has the Prime Minister, `Well, we can't give any money back because that will affect the budget outcome.'
You may well have factored into a budget projection what you set the GST on in terms of the strike rate, which was 90c litre, but nothing else. Crude oil prices have gone up and the flow-through effect has followed. But at the end of the day it is the GST that is adding at least 2c to 3c per litre over and above the tax take which would have occurred if you only had excise in place. That is a reality. That is what the government has to confront. That is which the government ought to be looking at. Rather than saying, `Well, look, we can't give anything back,' you could certainly address the questions insofar as excise is concerned in terms of the GST inspired CPI spike. You have an obligation to deliver a promise—at least one promise.
We carried a motion a few minutes ago about the success of the Olympics. Well, let me tell you the GST has not been the government's Olympics here. If ever there has been a disaster, if ever there has been anything that has run amok, it has been the introduction of the GST. I heard Senator Alston saying that prices have gone down since July. Well, they may have done in one or two places recently, but outside of that the price of petrol has gone up and it is having a heavy impact on the regions of Australia. The government ought to deliver on its promise. It can deliver on its promise without affecting the budget bottom line, without affecting the surplus, because you do not know what is out there at the moment.

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2000-10-03,"—Senator Murphy was talking about `realities', and perhaps there are a few realities he should hear about, as should the people of Australia listening to this. The first reality that I would like to confront Senator Murphy with is the fact that Australia has the fourth lowest price of petrol in the world. The only countries that have a lower price than us are Canada, the United States and New Zealand. I was in the United Kingdom the week before last, and the price of fuel there was £1.80 a litre, or $4.68, and the amount of tax charged in European countries, compared with Australia, is much, much higher. In relative terms, fuel is very cheap in Australia. It is very hard to believe that Senator Murphy is really serious when he complains about the fuel price in this country. He talks about GST and the fact that Senator Gibson did not make any reference in what he said to the GST, but the facts of the matter are that the government has taken measures to ensure that the GST need not have affected the price of fuel. 
You will recall, Senator Murphy, that on 1 July this year the Commonwealth government reduced the excise applicable to fuel and diesel by 6.7c a litre. This excise reduction, combined with petroleum industry cost reductions of 1.5c per litre, the abolition of the wholesale sales tax and the effective reduction of diesel fuel excise on heavy transport by 24c a litre, means that the price of petrol need not have risen at all to consumers as a result of the GST. We have to ask ourselves: why in fact has it risen? Of course, the reasons underlying the rise in the price of fuel are really out of the hands of this government. The real reasons why prices have gone up are that the price of crude oil has gone up and the Australian government does not control the price of crude oil. We do have a GST on it but, as I have said, compensatory mechanisms have been introduced, so the price of the fuel need not have risen. If it has risen, then the reasons are factors out of the control of the federal government. The price of crude oil is a major one. Maybe there are matters concerning the oil refining industry and the oil companies which need to be looked at, but there are certainly no factors related to the GST introduced by this government as part of the new tax system, which the Labor Party, as we all know, has found works well and in fact endorses—which, one must assume, will never ever change in the future.
The government does not benefit from higher fuel prices. The excise remains the same—that is, the Commonwealth receives no extra excise when the price of petrol is high. However, the states receive any extra GST revenue through higher petrol prices. It is important to note that the coalition, since coming to office in 1996, has not increased petrol excise except for the usual indexation of excise in line with the consumer price index, which the Labor Party introduced. 
—Indexation of the excise was not something that the coalition introduced; it was introduced by the Labor Party. An argument has been put that the government could reduce the excise and that would mean that the price of fuel would drop. But reduction of the excise would not have that effect at all, because of the rising price of crude oil. That is the key factor which underlies the increased price of petrol around this country. That is a reality, Senator Murphy, which you have to face. The government has put in place compensatory mechanisms to ensure that the GST does not affect the price of fuel, and the factors which do affect the price of fuel are outside the province of control of the Commonwealth government.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Fuel Excise</title>,Questions Without Notice,8,1
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2000-10-03,"—For the last two weeks we have seen quite a wonderful spectacle in Australia, the Olympics, and the media have really focused on it. That has been very difficult for all of us who have wanted to keep doing our job as politicians by raising issues in the media that were other than Olympic in nature. However, there was one issue that was maintained, throughout that whole wonderful two weeks of the Olympics, in the community's mind and in the media, and that was the issue of petrol pricing. In fact, the top two issues that were recorded in the last week were petrol prices and petrol regulation and the role of the federal government. There were four times more stories on radio and on television related to the price of petrol than to any other issue. The people who have raised those issues are farmers, truckies and generally consumers in the community. They have all expressed outrage at the lack of a response from the federal government to their legitimate concerns over petrol pricing. In the time that I have left, I would like to focus my comments on the plight of people who live in regional, rural and remote Australia. 
—We all know—and I would like to remind the coalition of this—of the reality of life for people who live outside the capital cities of our nation. It is true that people who live in regional Australia have lower incomes than those who live in the cities. It is also true that they have longer distances to travel than their city cousins. They have higher petrol prices—they have continued to see higher commensurate petrol prices in the last three months—and, of course, they have a much higher reliance on road based transport. I was quite astonished at Senator Gibson's comments about how he was going to explain how petrol pricing has in fact reduced the costs of transport. That has certainly not been the reality in the state of Queensland. Finally, the reality for people who live in regional and rural Australia is that they have limited access to any type of public transport. As we know, country people are very angry—they are quite rightly angry—that their legitimate concerns about the pricing of petrol have not been listened to by this government. They remember very clearly, during the last election campaign in 1998, the Prime Minister's words: `Petrol prices will not rise as a result of the GST.' I cannot find one person who lives in regional Australia who believes that is the case. Petrol prices have risen as a result of the GST, and the question that we need to ask is: by how much have they risen in regional Australia? That is why the Labor Party requested a full inquiry into the pricing of fuel, especially as to how it affects regional Australia. Unfortunately, the people on the other side of the chamber and the Democrats did not agree to ensure that there was community clarity on the issue of petrol pricing.
As we know, petrol pricing includes an excise. Now on top of that we have a GST. This is a tax on a tax. The excise will increase next February as the CPI adjustment is attributed to it and, as a result, the GST will also rise. Where will it rise the most? The answer to that question is very clear: it will rise more in the country than it will in the city. Labor has always said that the GST is an unfair tax. The GST as it applies to petrol and other fuels is a particularly unfair implementation of a taxation system with particular disadvantages for those people who live in regional and rural Australia. Senator Eggleston said a moment ago that it was out of the hands of this government. That is not believed by the people who live in regional Australia who know that between 2c and 3c of the increase—more in some areas—has been attributable to the GST. The Labor Party has announced today that it will be conducting an inquiry into petrol pricing. As a senator who represents a regional part of a state, I welcome this very much and I look forward to a full and proper inquiry, one that should be conducted by this parliament and one that we have to take the responsibility of running.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2000-10-03,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the documents.
There have been three occasions now on which we have sought from the government information about how they intend to spend $22 billion of public money and the distribution methods that they will be using for the spending of that money on schools in this country. On two occasions the government have sought to play games with the parliament. On the second occasion they refused to implement the order of the Senate and only partially responded to our request to provide individual SES scores by name for each of the schools and other details. These were the schools that participated in the 1998 simulation study. The government, of course, claimed that this was confidential material that the parliament could not have. Today, we are provided with some 80 pages of documentation, which I was fortunate enough to see a very short time ago. It will take a little while to establish the extent to which the government have responded to this return to order. It would appear on the surface, though, that the government have backed down and have provided a level of information about the distribution of moneys to the schools, a matter which the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education Committee is currently examining in relation to the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 2000 which is currently before the parliament.
The issue of schools is becoming increasingly important in this country as Australians become increasingly concerned about the failure of this government to respond to the real needs of this community, insofar as it has taken responsibility for developing a new model for the distribution of $22 billion in school funding over the next four years. Concern has been expressed about the total inequity of the arrangements that this government has entered into, arrangements which will see the wealthiest, most powerful and elite schools in this country get a disproportionate share of the public money that is available for school education. The richest 62 schools—as they are currently categorised under the ERI formula—will receive $50 million, but 1,623 schools under the Catholic education system will receive only $100 million. We have a situation where 65 per cent of schools will receive $100 million and 5.6 per cent of the richest, most elite schools in this country will receive $50 million. We have seen documents today that, I suggest, confirm that.
This government will say that it is spending money on government schools as well. This is why this bill will have to pass some time this year. The form of the bill is yet to be determined, but it will have to pass this year because there is an imperative there for this parliament to ensure that money does flow to all of the schools in this country. But the concerns are being reflected in the fact that this government's plans will see a drop in the Commonwealth contribution to public education—to government schools—from about 43 per cent of total Commonwealth outlays on schools in 1996 to 34.7 per cent by the year 2004. That is dollar on dollar, program on program. Let us not try to mix it up, jumble it about and use the spin doctor tricks that this minister is so happy to pursue. That is a quite clear comparison of the shift that this government is imposing upon its priorities in terms of the distribution of public moneys. Some examples have come forward in the figures we have seen today. 
Concern has been expressed in the past about the estimates that I have made as a result of the preliminary figures that we were able to glean through the Senate estimates process. It has been said that we made some estimates which were incorrect. It was said, for instance, that the figures we had used were wrong. What we see today is that perhaps we were wrong in part insofar as we had underestimated the level of discrimination against people who are attending the poorer schools in this country. The Labor Party remain committed to ensuring that schools are properly resourced, whether they be public schools, which of course are our chief concern, or needy non-government schools. 
But what this government seems to suggest is that if you go to wealthy, elite schools you are entitled to a bigger cut of the action than if you go to the local parish school. It goes on to say that, if you go to a government school, you are entitled to even less of the action under its proposals. For schools like Wesley College, which we originally said were going to receive $1.8 million, we now find that the estimates we made were incorrect. This government suggests to us that they will in fact receive $4.7 million. Under the ERI—the current arrangements—in 2001 they would receive $3,840,000. In 2004, under the new arrangements, they will receive $7.8 million. That is a $4.7 million increase.
Kings School in Parramatta, another well-known `struggling', `poor' and `depressed' school, would receive $1.38 million if the ERI were continuing. Under this new arrangement, they will receive $2.946 million. What you have is a $1.9 million increase for that school. Caulfield Grammar will get a $3.8 million increase. It goes on. These are not what you would call struggling school communities. What we have here is a situation where we have a new model being imposed that will see Haileybury College in Melbourne get $3.1 million extra, Penleigh and Essendon Grammar get $4 million, Caulfield get $3.8 million, as I said, and Ivanhoe Grammar get $2.5 million. You will see claims being made that there will be an opportunity here to reduce the fees for some of these elite schools that are currently charging in excess of $11,000 a year. How many battlers are able to pay fees of $11,000 a year per child?
What this proposal essentially suggests is that we can measure neighbourhoods, not people. It effectively means that no matter what the mix of any particular suburb, we should measure the suburb students come from—not the wealth of the parents, the assets and income of the schools or the capacity of the schools to attract donations. The private income of the school would be ignored. So when Scotch College attracts a $1 million donation for a library from Mr Pratt we should ignore that. How many government schools are able to attract a $1 million donation to improve their library? It is a very worthy cause, no doubt, but at least you ought to be able to consider the full range of factors. That is exactly the position that the Catholic Education Commission has put to this Senate. They have argued consistently, and I quote:
A combination of measures—
I emphasise `combination of measures'—
of the needs should be used. These include recurrent and capital resources, geographic spread, the necessity to provide a wide range of central services and the socio-economic status of the population served by the schools.
There are other schools such as Addas Israel in Melbourne, to take the other extreme. It is a relatively small Orthodox Jewish community school the members of which, for religious reasons, are required to live around the synagogues in Caulfield—an extremely wealthy suburb in Melbourne. The school population itself happens to be quite poor, if you look at measures such as health cards and those sorts of things. That school is receiving, in fact, a disadvantage under this arrangement, because relatively poor people who live in Caulfield, a wealthy suburb, will be measured by this arrangement as if they were all wealthy. This whole scheme is predicated on one fundamental flaw: by its very nature, it does not recognise that people who go to private schools are from a minority in any suburb, be it Brunswick or any other suburb. No matter what conditions there are in the suburb in which people from private schools live, they tend to be atypical of the suburb at large. It strikes me that it is not surprising therefore that these sorts of discrepancies arise within the formula.  
Professor Richard Teece and various other educational experts have drawn to our attention that the claims we have been making are accurate and sensitive to the real issues. I quote:
The government's proposals are, in fact, a betrayal of need and a vote for privilege.
We have seen editorials in the Age and in the Australian and a very wide-ranging number of newspaper letters to the editor indicating a growing community concern about this simple proposition: this government proposal will see $157 going to each Catholic school student but $908 going to each student in an elite category 1 school.

Thank you for your letter dated 17 July 2000 concerning the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Regulations 2000 (No.2), Statutory Rules 2000 No.48. The Committee considered your response at its meeting today and agreed that it met most of its concerns.
However, in your response you advised that the power of delegation in regulation 5Q(5A) is `necessary to stop an offending advertisement as quickly as possible after the Panel has upheld a complaint about it'. There is nothing in the Regulation itself to indicate that the power of delegation is limited to such situations. The Committee therefore reiterates its concern with the appropriateness of permitting the Secretary to delegate the power to withdraw approval of an advertisement to the Chairperson of the Complaints Resolution Panel when it is the Panel that recommends to the Secretary the withdrawal of approval.
The Committee also notes that the Therapeutic Goods Administration will monitor the changes to the Regulations, and the performance of the Complaints Resolution Panel, during a transition period. The Committee would appreciate further information about the length of time of this transition period. It would also appreciate information on the mechanism for monitoring performance.
The Regulations are subject to a notice of motion to disallow which is set down to be resolved on 5 October 2000. The Committee would therefore appreciate your response as soon as possible but before this date to allow it to finalise its consideration of these Regulations.
Yours sincerely

Dear Senator Coonan
Thank you for your letter dated 17 August 2000 in which you raised further issues relating to a provision in the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Regulations (No.2) 2000, No.48. The Committee remains concerned about the operation of subregulation 5Q(5A) of the Regulations because it permits the Secretary to delegate to the Chairperson of the Complaints Resolution Panel (the Panel) the Secretary's power to withdraw an approval for an advertisement. The Committee is concerned that this may be inappropriate because the Panel also has the function of entertaining complaints about advertisements published in mainstream media and making recommendations to the Secretary to, among other things, withdraw an approval for an advertisement. 
The Complaints Resolution Panel is established under Part 6 of the Regulations to, among other things, receive and consider complaints about advertisements and to take action in accordance with Subdivision 2 of Division 3, Part 6 of the Regulations, as well as make recommendations to the Secretary in relation to complaints.
Action that the Panel is entitled to take includes, for example, requesting a person (under R.42ZCAI(1)) to withdraw an advertisement. Where a person fails to do so, the Panel may make recommendations to the Secretary to exercise a range of regulatory powers. Apart from recommending the withdrawal of the original approval for the advertisement, the Panel may recommend to the Secretary the ultimate sanction, which is to remove the goods the subject of the offending advertisement from the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (the Register). The effect of removing therapeutic goods from the Register is to preclude their lawful supply.
However, by allowing the Secretary to selectively delegate his power under R. 5L(2) to the Chairperson of the Panel, the power of the Chairperson to take regulatory action is limited to less significant measures, such as withdrawing an approval, and this action can only be taken following a recommendation of the Panel (made in accordance with the requirements of the Regulations) that such a measure be adopted. The Chairperson of the Panel cannot be, for example, delegated the power to remove therapeutic goods from the Register. It is considered appropriate that the Chairperson be in a position to act directly to withdraw an approval following such a recommendation from the Panel, an expert committee established for the purpose of dealing with complaints lodged against advertisements about therapeutic goods published in mainstream media.
It could be noted that, under R.5L, the Secretary may withdraw the original approval for an advertisement in a number of situations. However, in circumstances where a complaint has been lodged against a particular advertisement, the Secretary may only take this action upon the recommendation of the Panel. Many other circumstance where the Secretary may withdraw an approval the Secretary may do so without any reference to the Panel. This re-enforces the appropriateness of the Chairperson of the Panel to take action to withdraw an approval for an advertisement.
It could also be noted that the decision of the Chairperson to withdraw any approval is subject to independent review, including merits review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.
For all the reasons outlined above, it was considered appropriate that the Chairperson of the Panel be delegated the power to withdraw an approval for an advertisement following the recommendation of the Panel to take this course of action. The Panel is required to follow strict procedures before arriving at any decision to recommend the withdrawal of an approval for an advertisement. These procedures are set out in regulations 42Y (quorum), 42Z (voting), 42ZB. (disclosure of interest), and 42ZCAC to 42ZCAE (procedures for dealing with complaints) and 42ZCAJ (active court proceedings).
The Committee also enquired about how the changes to the Regulations will be monitored, including the performance of the Panel during a transition period. The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) has an observer on the Complaints Resolution Panel and also has a member sitting on the Therapeutic Goods Advertising Code Council. The application of the new Therapeutic Goods Advertising Code and the implementation of that Code by the Panel will be continuously monitored during the transition period while the industry and the Panel familiarise themselves with the new Code. There is no fixed transition period before this occurs, but the TGA will have an ongoing role in monitoring the performance of the Panel, and the operation of the Regulations, as part of its regulatory functions.
I trust the information and reasons provided above meets with the requirements of the Committee.
Yours sincerely

Child Support (Assessment) (Overseas-related Maintenance Obligations) Regulations 2000, Statutory Rules 2000 No.79
Child Support (Registration and Collection) (Overseas-related Maintenance Obligations) Regulations 2000, Statutory Rules 2000 No.80
22 June 2000
The Hon Lawrence Anthony MP
Minister for Community Services
Parliament House
CANBERRA   ACT   2600
Dear Minister
I refer to the following instruments:
Child Support (Assessment) (Overseas-related Maintenance Obligations) Regulations 2000,Statutory Rules 2000 No. 79; and  
Child Support (Registration and Collection) (Overseas-related Maintenance Obligations) Regulations 2000,Statutory Rules 2000 No. 80.
Statutory Rules 2000 No.79
These Regulations prescribe, in relation to those countries with which Australia has maintenance enforcement arrangements, matters relevant to the recognition and enforcement of child support and spousal maintenance liabilities. The Committee has concerns with this instrument.
First, the enabling Act for these Regulations - the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 - is modified, to a greater of lesser extent, by regulations 6, 7, 10, 11 and 15 of these Regulations. While this is permitted by paragraph 163B(3)(b) of the enabling Act - a fact which is recorded in a Note to regulation 3 of these Regulations - the Committee considers that the modifications made to the Act by this instrument are so extensive as to suggest that the relevant changes ought to be made by primary legislation.
Secondly, subregulation 25(2) limits the discretion of the Registrar, in making an administrative assessment of the child support payable by a person, to assuming that the person's income is no more than 2.5 times a figure based on average weekly earnings in Australia for that period. Although it appears from the enabling Act that this formula is used as a basis for assessing child support liability for persons in Australia, the Explanatory Statement does not indicate why it is considered still relevant for persons living overseas.
Thirdly, although the Explanatory Statement concludes by saying that “[d]etails of the Regulations are set out in the Attachment”, no Attachment was provided.
Statutory Rules 2000 No. 80 
These Regulations prescribe, in relation to those countries with which Australia has maintenance enforcement arrangements, matters relevant to the recognition and enforcement of child support and spousal maintenance liabilities. The Committee has several concerns with this instrument.
Although the Explanatory Statement concludes with the observation that “Details of the Regulations are set out in the Attachment”, no Attachment accompanied the Explanatory Statement.
The enabling Act for these Regulations - the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988 - is modified, to a greater of lesser extent, by regulations 24, 25, 26 and 29 of these Regulations. The Committee also considers that the modifications made to the Act by this instrument are so extensive as to suggest that the relevant changes ought to be made by primary legislation.
It is difficult to see how subsection 24A(1) of the enabling Act, subregulation 10(4) of these Regulations, and subregulation 10(3), are to be read consistently with one another. Subsection 24A(1) provides that 
where the Registrar makes a child support assessment under which a registrable maintenance liability arises, the Registrar must immediately register the liability ...
However, subregulation 24(4) appears to require the Registrar merely to fulfil his or her obligation of registration as soon as practicable after it arose. While subregulation 10(3), when read with paragraph 10(1)(a), provides that if the Registrar fails to fulfil the obligations imposed by subsection 24(1) of the Act within 90 days after the obligation arose, he or she is taken to have refused to comply with it.
It is also difficult to understand how subsection 25(2) of the enabling Act is to be read with subregulation 12(1). Subsection 25(2) obliges the Registrar to register a registrable maintenance liability within 28 days of receiving a duly completed approved form, whereas subregulation 12(1) requires the Registrar to register a registrable maintenance liability within 90 days of receiving an application for registration.
The Committee would be grateful for your advice as these matters as soon as possible but before 17 August 2000 when disallowance action may be initiated.
Yours sincerely

Dear Senator Coonan
1 refer to your correspondence dated 22 June 2000 concerning the following instruments: 
Child Support (Assessment) (Overseas-related Main-tenance Obligations) Regulations 2000, Statutory Rules 2000 No 79; and
Child Support (Registration and Collection) (Overseas-related Maintenance Obligations) Regulations 2000, Statutory Rules 2000 No 80.
In relation to both Statutory Rules referred to above, you make the comment that “the modi-fica-tions to the Act ... are so extensive as to suggest that the relevant changes ought to be made by primary legislation”. I share your concern in this regard and advise that it is intended that the relevant primary legislation be amended. In fact, it was originally proposed that the matters currently provided for by the Regulations be achieved by amendments being made to the primary legislation. With this in mind, the assistance of the office of Parliamentary Counsel was sought to draft the Child Support Legislation Amendment Act 2000 (the Amendment Act) which was intended to contain therequired amend-ments. However, due to existing drafting priorities, that Office advised that it was not able to undertake the relevant amendments in time to meet the 1 July 2000 deadline (which arose as a result of the agreement between our Prime Minister and the Prime Minister of New Zealand for the Agreement between the two countries to have a commencement date of 1 July 2000). As a result, the Amendment Act merely provided for regulations to be made. Regulations were then prepared to prescribe the matters necessary for the implementation of the new arrangements. It is intended that the primary legislation be amended as soon as practicable to incorporate matters currently provided for by these Regulations. 
You also make the point that, in relation to both Statutory Rules, no Attachments were provided, despite the fact that the respective Explanatory Statements concluded that “details of theRegulations are set out in the Attachment”. 
1 regret that the attachment to the explanatory statement for the Amendment Regulations was not provided when those Regulations were tabled. I am advised that this was due to processing errors in the Departments preparing the regu-la-tions and that the attachment to the statement has now been tabled. 
Child Support (Assessment) (Overseas-related Main-tenance Obligations)
Regulations 2000, Statutory Rules 2000 No 79
Section 58 of the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1988 (the Act) is concerned with certain situa-tions where a person's taxable income is not readily ascertainable. In the relevant circum-stances, section 58 provides for the Registrar to determine an amount that the Registrar considers appropriate. That discretion is constrained by the limitation that that amount cannot exceed 2.5 times the yearly equivalent of the relevant AWE amount for the period. In broad terms, regulation 25 mirrors that provision for the purposes of Australia's overseas maintenance arrangements. You have enquired about the relevance of the stated limitation in the cir-cum-stances contemplated by regulation 25.
It was recognised that it would be appropriate, as well as consistent with the Act, for a limit to be set on the amount that could be determined for the purposes of regulation 25. However, given that there are approximately 80 countries specified as `reciprocating jurisdictions' in Sched-ule 2 of the Child Support (Registration and Collec-tion) (Overseas-related Maintenance Obli-gations) Regulations 2000, certain matters (such as different average earnings and the cost of liv-ing) meant the method for establishing a relevant, appropriate upper limit was not amenable to simple resolution. In these circumstances, it was decided that an Australian standard, consistent with the current approach provided for under the Act, was most appropriate.
I also make the point that it is anticipated that, in practice, payers overseas will provide the Regist-rar with information concerning their income which will enable appropriate assess-ments to be calculated. The regulations ensure that the rights of appeal and objection currently contained in the Act will be available in cases where the new arrangements apply.
Child Support (Registration and Collection) (Overseas-related Maintenance Obligations) Regulations 2000, Statutory Rules 2000 No 80
I note your comments concerning the inconsistency between certain provisions of the primary legislation and some of the regulations. This approach is authorised by section 124A of the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988 (the Act) which was inserted by the Child Support Legislation Amendment Act 2000. Although the subject matter of certain provisions of the Act and the regulations may be identical, the regulations provide for Australia's international maintenance obligations which involve arrangements and circumstances which are not identical to those that are contemplated by the provisions of the Act. To effectively provide for those obligations, it was necessary for the effect and operation of the regulations to differ in some material respects from the provisions of the Act.
I discuss below the particular inconsistencies you highlight.
Sections 24, 24A and 37A of Child Support (Registrationand Collection) Act 1988 and subregulations 10(3) and (4)
Sections 24 and 24A of the Act are concerned with different subject matters and require those matters to be undertaken in different time frames. Section 24 allows the Registrar 28 days to undertake the relevant action while section 24A requires him to act immediately. With that in mind, it would seem appropriate that subregu-lation 10(3), which deals with the effect of section 24, and subregulation 10(4), which deals with the effect of section 24A, also provide for time frames that are different. 
Subsection 24A(1) provides that where Registrar makes an assessment under which a registrable maintenance liability arises, the Registrar must immediately register that liability by entering particulars. Subregulation 10(4) provides that, for overseas cases, this action must be done as soon as practicable. I am advised that certain overseas jurisdictions would not be willing to enforce an assessment unless the payer has been notified of the existence of the assessment and has had time to object to it. Accordingly, subregulation 10(4) provides for flexibility with respect to registration so that any desirable prior action can be undertaken.
Similar matters are relevant when considering the inconsistency between section 37A (which deals with amendments to assessments) and subregula-tion 10(4).
Section 25 of Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988 and subregulation 12(1)
Section 25 provides that, where a payee applies to have a registrable maintenance liability regis-tered, the Registrar is to register that liability within 28 days. That period allows the Registrar to make further enquiries if required. As it is anticipated that similar matters may take longer to finalise when dealing with overseas matters, subregulation 12(1) allows the Registrar 80 days to register a liability when registration relates to international arrangements.
I hope these comments are of assistance.
Yours sincerely

Family Law Amendment Regulations 2000 (No.2), Statutory Rules 2000 No.81
22 June 2000
The Hon Daryl Williams AM QC MP
Attorney-General
Parliament House
CANBERRA   ACT   2600
Dear Minister
I refer to the Family Law Amendment Regulations 2000 (No. 2),Statutory Rules 2000 No. 81 that allow Australian courts to enforce overseas maintenance orders, or to make maintenance orders for the benefit of persons living in countries with which Australia is entering new international spousal maintenance agreements.
Although the Explanatory Statement concludes with the observation that “Details of the Regulations are set out in the Attachment”, no Attachment accompanied the Explanatory Statement.
The new definition of Secretary substituted by item 2 of the Schedule to these Regulations permits the Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department to authorise “a person” to carry out functions under the Regulations. There appears to be no limit to the width of this power of delegation, by reference to such matters as qualifications, or the holding of a particular office or employment in the Public Service. In the absence of an item-by-item explanation of the amendments made by this instrument, it is impossible to determine the reason for such a wide power of delegation.
Subregulation 28(2) - inserted by item 10 of the Schedule - and subregulation 28C(2) - inserted by item 11 of the Schedule - oblige the Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department to make an application calling on a respondent to a petition to show cause why various orders should not be confirmed. However, neither subregulation puts any time limit either on the Secretary's obligation to make the application, or within which the respondent to the notice must show cause.
New regulation 30, substituted by item 13 of the Schedule, deals with proceedings for the enforcement of some types of overseas maintenance liabilities. Subregulation 30(3) provides
The Act, these Regulations and the Rules of Court, so far as they are applicable, and with such modifications as are necessary, apply in relation to the proceedings.
It is not clear from the context whether it is intended that modifications may be made to the Act and to the Regulations, as well to the Rules of Court. If the purpose of this subregulation is to permit, inter alia, the modification of the Act, it is suggested that this is beyond the regulation-making power in section 125 of the Family Law Act 1975. Even if the intention of the subregulation is to permit modification of the Rules of Court only, it does not specify by whom the modification may be made, nor who is to decide whether such modification is necessary.
New subregulation 39(2), substituted by item 22 of the Schedule, requires the Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department to apply to a court for confirmation of any provisional order made overseas and transmitted to the Secretary. Subregulation 39(3) obliges the Secretary to serve a copy of that application on the respondent to the order. However, neither subregulations imposes any time limit within which the Secretary must carry out these obligations. 
The Committee would be grateful for your advice on these matters as soon as possible but before 17 August 2000 when disallowance action may be initiated.
Yours sincerely

Dear Senator Coonan
Thank you for your letter of 22 June 2000 concerning the Family Law Amendment Regulations 2000 (No.2).
I regret that the attachment to the explanatory statement for the Amendment Regulations was not provided when the Amendment Regulations were tabled. I understand that the same problem occurred with child support regulations tabled at the same time. I am advised that this was due to a processing error during the transmission of the documents from the Department of Family and Community Services, through the Executive Council Secretariat, to the Office of Legislative Drafting in my Department. I understand that all the attachments to the statements will be tabled as soon as possible in the Spring sittings of Parliament.
Your letter notes that the Amendment Regulations permit the Secretary of the Attorney- General's Department to authorise any person to carry out his functions under the Regulations. You suggest that the power of authorisation should be limited by reference to matters such as qualifications or the holding of office in the Public Service. I am advised that this issue was carefully considered in the preparation of the Amendment Regulations. While some of the Secretary's functions will be carried out by officers of my Department, functions such as the representation of overseas maintenance claimants in court proceedings will be carried out by persons who are not Commonwealth public servants (for example, officers of State and Territory legal aid bodies or by private legal practitioners). Other functions, such as serving process on behalf of overseas courts, will be carried out by persons who cannot be identified by reference to the holding of particular qualifications (for example, process servers). Thus I do not think it would be practicable to limit the authorisation power in the way suggested in your letter. I also mention for your information that the Secretary will in future be involved in only a small number of overseas maintenance cases, as the Child Support Agency is taking over the bulk of this work. For this reason I do not expect that there will be many authorisations by the Secretary.
The Committee also raises the question why new sub-regulations 28(2), 28C(2) and 39(2) do not set time limits for the Secretary to institute proceedings on behalf of overseas maintenance applicants or for respondents in Australia to show cause why they should not be ordered to pay maintenance. I am advised that these new provisions do not alter the procedures which applied under the former regulations for the establishment of maintenance orders for the benefit of overseas claimants, other than to transfer responsibility for initiating proceedings from court staff to the Secretary. In practice applications from overseas applicants are usually incomplete and considerable time is often spent in obtaining additional evidence from applicants before it is appropriate for proceedings to be commenced. A requirement for proceedings to be commenced within a set period would therefore be impractical. I am also advised that it is not necessary for the regulations to specify a time limit for a respondent to show cause in response to proceedings as this is determined by the applicable rules of court once proceedings have been initiated.
Your letter refers to the fact that the Amendment Regulations refer to the Family Law Act 1975 applying with such modifications as are necessary in proceedings under the Amendment Regulations. In so far as the Amendment Regulations may contain provisions which are inconsistent with the Act, this is authorised by section 124A of the Act which was inserted by the Child Support Legislation Amendment Act 2000. In this regard I refer the Committee to the following statement made by my colleague Senator Newman, the Minister for Family and Community Services, during debate on the Amendment Act in the Senate on 10 April 2000:
 “This bill we are debating tonight was intended to include the measures that are now going. to be tabled as regulations. But as most senators would recognise, there has been huge demands on the Office of Parliamentary Counsel over the last few months with the pressure of legislation and they were unable to complete the work in time for a 1 July start-up for these measures. The problem was caused by an agreement between our Prime Minister and the New Zealand Prime Minister. They had agreed that the new arrangements would start up on 1 July. In order to honour that commitment, Australia is bringing forward some of the details by way of regulation......they will also be brought into legislation later...... I think that is not an unreasonable way of proceeding in what is a very tight time frame not for the government but for the legislative draftsman and also for Australia's reputation in making agreements with heads of other governments.” 
I hope that the Committee will find the above information helpful in its consideration of the Amendment Regulations.
Yours sincerely
Daryl Williams

A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Amendment Regulations 2000 (No. 4), Statutory Rules 2000 No.110, 
A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax Transition) Regulations 2000, Statutory Rules 2000 No.111, and
A New Tax System (Wine Equalisation Tax) Regulations 2000, Statutory Rules 2000 No. 113.
Statutory Rules 2000 No.110
Schedule 2, Item 2, new subregulation 168-5.12 relates to the tourist refund scheme (TRS). The Committee notes that the Explanatory Statement, but not the new subregulation, states that a decision of the Customs officer of whether or not the acquirer is entitled to a refund is not subject to review, and that the acquirer's entitlement would still be enforceable under section 168-5 of the Act. The Committee considers that it may be appropriate that this information be included in the subregulation and, further, that it would be helpful to explain the specific procedures that should be followed by an acquirer in such a case. The Committee would appreciate your advice on this matter. 
Schedule 2, Item 2, new subregulations 168-5.15, 16 and 17 each specify a mechanism whereby the amount of TRS refunds may be posted from Australia to an acquirer within 60 days. The Committee presumes that these payments (either by cheque or bank credit) will be in Australian dollars and will therefore be subject to currency fluctuations. The Committee would therefore appreciate your advice as to whether this may have the potential to work to the disadvantage of TRS refund recipients.
Statutory Rules 2000 No.111
The Committee notes that new subregulation 5(5) provides for a payment to be made `as soon as practicable' after the application is made. The Committee would appreciate your advice as to whether the subregulation could be reworded to set a definite time frame for payment, rather than requiring payment `as soon as practicable'.  
New subregulation 7(4) specifies 8 July 1999 as determining whether certain requirements must be met by certain suppliers. The Explanatory Statement, however, provides no information about the significance of this date. The Committee would appreciate your advice on this matter. 
Statutory Rules 2000 No.113
New subregulation 25-5.03 specifies the amount of wine tax borne on wine as `29% of half of the GST inclusive price paid by the purchaser for the wine'. The Committee would appreciate clarification of the basis for using the figure of 29% to calculate the amount of wine tax.
The Committee would be grateful for your advice as soon as possible but before 31 August 2000 when disallowance action may be initiated.

Dear Senator Coonan
Thank you for your letter of 17 August 2000 regarding the following Regulations
(a) A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Amendment Regulations 2000 (No 4), Statutory Rules 2000 No 110.
 (b) A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax Transition) Regulations 2000, Statutory Rules 2000 No 111.
 (c) A New Tax System (Wine Equalisation Tax) Regulations 2000, Statutory Rules 2000 No 113.
In relation to Statutory Rules 2000 No. 110 the Committee raised two issues. 
The first concerned new subregulation 168-5.12. You asked whether it would be appropriate to include information in the subregulation concerning reconsideration of decisions in relation to tourist refunds.
While understanding the reasons for suggesting this approach, on balance I am not sure that it is appropriate in this case. The power to re-consider a tourist refund claim arises under the general operation of the law (in particular section 168-5 of the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999), rather than under any specific power to review decisions in relation to tourist refunds, and there is no legislative requirement as to the methodology for any such re-consideration. Given the lack of specific legislative authority, a cross-reference in the Regulations may be somewhat ,confusing, and any other explanation would be long and complex.
However, to make sure that tourists are aware of their rights in this regard, when a Customs officer denies a claim for a refund, the officer gives the tourist a “Rejection notice”, which sets out the reasons why the claim has not been paid, and provides contact details for having the claim reconsidered (postal address, e-mail address and telephone number). This process is effective in providing information about the reconsideration process to those people who most need access to that information.
The second issue concerned subregulations 168-5.15 - 168-5.17.
The presumption by the Committee that payments can be affected by currency fluctuations is correct, but this can work both ways. While some claimants may be disadvantaged by currency fluctuations, other claimants may benefit. The problem is that the only way to completely eliminate the effect of currency fluctuations is to pay the refunds on the day that the goods are acquired, which, of course, is not really possible with a mailback system. The complexity of any process designed to compensate even partially for negative currency fluctuations would be prohibitive.
In relation to Statutory Rules 2000 No. 111, the Committee was concerned about the time for payment of special petroleum credits.
A pre-determined time for payments was not set because this is a “one off' scheme, and it was expected that most claims would be lodged and paid early. As it happens, I am advised that approximately 90% of all claims will have been paid by September 30 2000. The Australian Taxation Office has said that it does not anticipate any difficulty in paying the remaining claims (approximately two hundred claims will be outstanding after September 30) within a reasonable time frame.
The Committee also asked why the date of 8 July 1999 was chosen in subregulation 7(4) of Statutory Rules 2000 No 111. The date was selected because it is the date of Royal Assent to A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999.
In relation to Statutory Rules 2000 No. 113, the Committee asked why the rate of 29% was chosen.
The reference to 29% in the regulations is because wine equalisation tax is levied at the rate of 29% of the wholesale or notional wholesale value of wine. The formula “29% of half of the GST inclusive price paid by the purchaser for the wine” is used to calculate the amount of wine tax included in the retail price of wine.
As to why the rate of wine equalisation tax is 29%, the aim was to levy the tax which replaced the 41% wholesale sales tax and only increased the price of a four-litre cask of wine by the estimated general price increase associated with indirect tax reform.
Please contact Julia Neville on 02 6277 7360 in my office if the Committee has any further questions.
Yours Sincerely

Dairy Adjustment Levy Collection Regulations 2000, Statutory Rules 2000 No.98

The Hon Warren Truss MP
Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry
Parliament House
CANBERRA   ACT   2600
Dear Minister
I refer to the Dairy Adjustment Levy Collection Regulations 2000, Statutory Rules 2000 No. 98, that make the necessary administrative provision for the collection of the dairy adjustment levy.
New subregulation 11(5) states that an agreement under subregulation (2) can only be entered into if the Secretary or authorised person is satisfied that the payment of levy “can be verified other than by requiring the agent to issue a receipt”. The Explanatory Statement advises that alternative methods of verification may be approved but provides no information on these methods. The Committee would therefore appreciate clarification on what methods may be used.
The Committee notes that new regulation 19 provides for review of a decision by the Secretary or an authorised person to either refuse an exemption for a collection agent or collection sub-agent to issue a receipt, or refuse to refund a levy payment. New subregulation 19(3) specifies that the Secretary must reconsider the original application “within 45 days” after receiving an application. The Committee would appreciate your advice on the reason for this long time period. 
The Committee would be grateful for your advice as soon as possible but before 31 August 2000 when disallowance action may be initiated.

Dear Senator Coonan
Thank you for your letter of 17 August 2000 regarding the Dairy Adjustment Levy Collection Regulations 2000 (DALCR).
Regulation 11 provides that collection agents or sub-agents do not need to issue receipts for levy payments if they obtain an exemption from the Secretary or an authorised person. The exemption can only be granted if Levies and Revenue Service (LRS) acting as the authorised agency within my department can be satisfied that levy payments can be verified by alternative means. As most company arrangements are unique, LRS must assess the accounting arrangements of each company requiring an exemption from issuing receipts.
I am advised that LRS will consider granting an exemption in circumstances when it is not the usual practice for a collection agent or sub-agent to issue a receipt for payment of a milk invoice, and payment of the levy can be independently verified by LRS via some other means. This exemption will usually be granted if the company is willing to allow LRS to examine sales system records, and access to invoicing and internal reporting systems. If LRS are satisfied that an audit of these systems is sufficient to verify payment of the levy an exemption is granted.
I am informed that most of the major processors have been successful in obtaining an exemption by allowing LRS access to their records.
Regulation 19 provides for review of a decision by the Secretary or an authorised person to refuse an exemption for a collection agent or a collection sub-agent to issue a receipt or refuse to refund a levy payment.
The levy collection arrangements were modelled on provisions in the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991 (PILCC) in order to streamline the administration associated with the collection of the Dairy Adjustment Levy and other dairy levies already collected by milk processors. Regulation 19 of the DALCR has been modelled on Section 28 of the PILCC Act which provides for review of relevant decisions. It is important that the treatment of collection agents for the Dairy Adjustment Levy and the dairy producer levies be as consistent as possible and hence the period for receiving notice of an appeal of 28 days and the 45 day period for review are the same for both types of levies.
The milk processing industry, which will be the collection agents, was consulted extensively in the development of these regulations. The collection agents are familiar with the review process for producer levies and indicated they would prefer the review process for the Dairy Adjustment Levy to be the same.
I trust this information will assist the work of your Committee.

CANBERRA   ACT   2600
Dear Minister
I refer to the Income Tax Amendment Regulations 2000 (No. 4), Statutory Rules 2000 No. 117, that exempt from income tax the pay and allowances earned by members of the Defence Force deployed on the United Nations Transitional Administration East Timor.
The Committee notes that the Amendments introduce an exemption which is to apply after 19 Feb-ru-ary 2000. The Explanatory Statement does not refer to the retrospective effect of the Amendments, nor to the operation of section 48(2) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 in this regard. Whilst there does not appear to be any disadvantage or liability resulting from this retrospectivity, the Com-mittee considers that an assurance that no per-son other than the Commonwealth has been disadvantaged should nevertheless be dealt with in the Explanatory Statement.
The Committee would also appreciate your advice on when the certificate issued by the Chief of the Defence Force under subsection 23AD(1) of the Act was issued.
The Committee would be grateful for your advice as soon as possible to enable it to finalise its consideration of this matter. 
Yours sincerely

Dear Senator Coonan
Thank you for your letter of 17 August 2000 regarding two issues the Standing Committee has with the Explanatory Statement that accompanied the Income Tax Assessment Regulations 2000 (No 4), Statutory Rules 2000 No 117.
Firstly, I confirm that the amendments to exempt from income tax the pay and allowances of Defence Force personnel deployed on the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (gazetted on 15 June 2000), will have retrospective effect from the date of deployment being after 19 February 2000. Subsection 48(2) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 operates to allow retrospective effect where the rights of a person are not disadvantaged, or liabilities are not imposed. I confirm that the amendments would not disadvantage or impose a liability upon any person to which this retrospectivity applies.
Secondly, the Committee queried the date on which the certificate issued by the Chief of Defence under Subsection 23AD(1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 was issued. I advise that this date was 17 February 2000.
Yours sincerely

Dear Minister
I refer to the Telstra Corporation Regulations 2000, Statutory Rules 2000 No. 103, that specify the class of persons within the “inner extended zones” in remote Australia for the purposes of the enabling Act.
Regulation 3 defines `charging precinct' and `extended charging zone' by reference to section 16 of the Telstra Public Switched Telephone Service Standard Form of Agreement. The Committee would appreciate your advice as to why these definitions are not included in the Regulations so as to ensure that the scope of the Regulations is sufficiently clear to the public.
The Committee would be grateful for your advice as soon as possible but before 31 August 2000 when disallowance action may be initiated.

Dear Senator Coonan
I refer to your letter of 17 August 2000 concerning the Telstra Corporation Regulations 2000 (SR No. 103 of 2000), that specify the class of persons located in an `inner extended zone' in remote Australia for the purposes of paragraph 54(1)(b)(iii) of the Telstra Corporation Act 1991.
Regulation 3 defines `inner extended zone' to mean a charging precinct that forms part of an extended charging zone. `Charging precinct' and `extended charging zone' are defined by reference to section 16 of the Telstra Public Switched Telephone Service Standard Form of Agreement (Telstra PSTN SFOA).
You have sought advice as to why these definitions are not included in the Regulations so as to ensure that the scope of the Regulations is sufficiently clear to the public.
The Regulations take advantage of section 49A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 which allows for matter to be prescribed by reference to other instruments as in force at a particular time. This approach was taken to enable extensive technical details relating to extended charging zones and charging precincts to be incorporated by reference rather than having to be set out in the Regulations. A similar approach was adopted in regulation 9 of the Telecommunications (Remote Area Rebate) Regulations. 1998 (SR No. 339 of 1998) which defines `remote area call' by reference to the definition of a pastoral call in Telstra's PSTN SFOA as in force at 1 January 1998.
 `Extended charging zone' is defined in section 16 of the Telstra PSTN SFOA to mean an allocated group of telephone numbers, for call charging purposes, in remote regions of Australia as listed in Attachment 6 to that document. Attachment 6 is some 112 pages in length. It includes details for relevant areas, including extended charging zones, of exchange codes, adjoining zones, the relevant district, charge points (map co-ordinates) and community access details. 
 `Charging precinct' is defined in section 16 of the Telstra PSTN SFOA to mean an allocated group of telephone numbers for call charging purposes, as listed in Attachment 7 to that document. Attachment 7 is a 5 page document containing technical details of the relevant area, Exchange code and zones, including extended zones.
I trust this will satisfactorily address the Committee's concerns.

"Chapman, Sen Grant",LP,2000-10-03,"—I present the report of the Parliamentary Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities, entitled `Shadow ledgers' and the provision of bank statements to customers, together with the Hansard record of the committee's proceedings and documents presented to the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
In June this year, I drew the attention of the Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities to serious allegations about practices of the Commonwealth Bank in its commercial dealings with a group of rural and regional customers. The committee un-ani-mously decided to hold a special hearing in relation to the allegations and invited all the principal players to give evidence. This report follows the committee's investigations into the matter, both at the hearing and in subsequent action taken by the committee.
There were four main allegations made against the Commonwealth Bank. These were that the bank: firstly, failed to inform rural customers that their debts had been written off; secondly, used a `shadow ledger' system to improperly claim tax benefits; thirdly, wrote off loans as bad debts while still receiving interest payments to service those debts; and, fourthly, refused to issue account statements to customers. The committee heard as witnesses three of the principal complainants, Mr Bruce Ford, Ms Wendy Murray and Mr Bernie Madigan; three senior representatives of the Commonwealth Bank; a deputy commissioner and an assistant commissioner of the Australian Taxation Office; and the Queensland Regional Director of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. The committee is most grateful to all of those witnesses for the valuable evidence they gave.
Although this was not a formal inquiry, the committee received 17 submissions. In particular, submissions were received from all of the witnesses and from the Financial Services Consumer Policy Centre, the main support body for the complainants. Four of these groups made supplementary submissions to expand on matters raised at the hearing. The committee is confident that the witnesses, the submissions and the supplementary material gave a thorough perspective on the issues and enabled it to arrive at appropriate conclusions and recommendations.
May I say as chairman of the committee that it was very pleasing to note that there was virtually unanimous agreement among committee members about the findings and recommendations contained within this report, with only one paragraph of the report indicating a difference between government members and opposition and Democrat members. I will speak to this issue a little later. However, in relation to the allegations and concerns placed in front of the committee, members were unanimous in their views: that taking into account all of the evidence in relation to the cases before it, the Commonwealth Bank did not make wrongful use of shadow ledgers and that the failure to produce bank statements did not constitute unlawful behaviour; that the ATO should address shadow ledgers in a tax ruling which provides that, after a bank classifies a loan as non-accrual, any interest received thereafter will not be derived for income tax purposes until it is received; that the committee is satisfied by the findings of the bank's independent auditors that activity on the shadow ledger accounts is in accordance with accounting and taxation requirements; that the Commonwealth Bank exacerbated an already difficult situation for some customers who were in default of their loan obligations, making it difficult for them to budget, to refinance loans and to submit taxation returns; that the bank's explanation that identification did not provide bank statements because it did not want to inflame a dispute is poor banking practice, that the bank subjected customers to unreasonable confusion in relation to shadow ledgers; that the management practices of the Commonwealth Bank were seriously flawed in terms of best practice customer relations, even if the number of customers affected was small; that the need for the committee to take action indicates a failure by the bank to resolve internally some types of disputes with customers. The committee is disappointed that the positive commitment of the bank to provide regular and full statements to customers in default on their loans did not eventuate until the committee initiated its investigations; however, this positive outcome does demonstrate the benefit and effectiveness of parliamentary committees investigating issues. The committee also was unanimous that deficient practices in the treatment of shadow ledger accounts are not limited to the Commonwealth Bank but are industry wide. 
On the basis of these findings, the committee has made the following recommendations: that all banks commit to providing statements to customers who are in default on their loans in all circumstances short of litigation; as a matter of principle, such statements should include the amount that the bank believes the customer owes under the terms and conditions of the loan and should not reflect any write-downs made by the bank for accounting or taxation purposes; in addition, all banks, if they do not do so already, should inform customers of the consequences which result when a loan gets into difficulties; and finally, in order to meet any outstanding public concern about admitted administrative errors in relation to the accounts of Mr Bruce Ford, the Commonwealth Bank should confirm that the taxation treatment of these accounts was correct.
The committee will refer the first three of these recommendations to the independent consultant undertaking the review of the banking code of practice, and we certainly recommend and will seek to have those three recommendations included in the code. The committee will monitor the review of the banking code of practice to ensure that its recommendations are indeed implemented and that they become binding on banks through common law obligations. I also hope that the Commonwealth Bank, in considering our requests, will move quickly to act upon them. I have faith that the bank will respond positively to our recommendations, given that they have already given an undertaking to provide full statements to customers in default, once the committee moved to have an interest in this particular issue.
Finally, let me address the one paragraph of the report where there was not complete agreement between all members of the com-mittee. While all committee members were in agreement that the Commonwealth Bank should extend mediation to any customers who still have concerns about the way their accounts were handled by the bank, Labor and Democrat members of the committee felt that the Commonwealth Bank should appoint an independent mediator and have this advertised in the national press. Government members feel this is not appropriate. Indeed, in all cases presented to the committee the Com--monwealth offered mediation services to disaffected customers, which, in the major case before the committee, was refused by the customer. Thus, government members of the committee believe that the bank has acted in good faith in terms of its offer of mediation and that this dispute resolution process needs to be given an opportunity to work before the committee asks the bank and its custo-mers to undertake alternative mechanisms. 
In making our recommendations, government members are particularly cognisant of the need for the committee not to overstep its jurisdiction in these matters and to make recommendations that are enforceable. I conclude by saying that I believe this was certainly a matter of importance to the rural and regional customers who were affected by the issue of shadow ledgers and, in particular, by the previous non-provision of bank statements to those customers when their loans fell into default. The committee certainly does not accept that the Commonwealth Bank's behaviour during that period was accept-able, and we believe our inquiry into the matter has therefore been beneficial in meet-ing the needs of those customers. Finally, I thank the committee secretary, David Creed, and the committee staff for their professional and tireless assistance in this matter. I commend this report to all honourable senators.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Corporations and Securities Committee</title>,Committees,20,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2000-10-03,"—I would also like to add my thanks to the committee secretariat for their work on this and I would like to comment on the report entitled `Shadow ledgers' and the provision of bank statements to customers, which was produced by the Parliamentary Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities and which Senator Chapman has just tabled. The report is the result of a hearing that the Parliamentary Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities held on 16 August 2000 into allegations that the Commonwealth Bank of Australia had refused to provide customers with bank statements and had improperly used shadow ledger accounts to claim tax benefits.
The joint parliamentary committee received submissions from individual consumers, the Financial Services Consumer Policy Centre, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the ACCC and the Australian Taxation Office. The committee concluded that the Commonwealth Bank had, by not automatically issuing account statements to some customers who were in default on their loan obligations, exacerbated an already difficult situation for these customers, making it difficult for them to budget, re-finance loans and submit taxation returns. The committee concluded that the Commonwealth Bank's practice of not providing customers with bank statements was poor banking practice, unreasonable and seriously flawed. It is of serious concern that a parliamentary committee has come to the conclusion that the Commonwealth Bank's practices were seriously flawed. While the Commonwealth Bank com-mitted to the parliamentary inquiry that it would provide statements to customers who requested them, it is of serious concern that it took a parliamentary committee to inquire into this issue before the bank committed to changing its practices.
I would like to briefly discuss a number of issues that the committee examined. Let me firstly deal with the issue of shadow ledger accounts. The Commonwealth Bank advised the committee that its shadow ledger accounts had been audited by the bank's internal auditors, who confirmed that activity on those accounts was in accordance with accounting requirements and taxation requirements. I also note that the Australian Taxation Office drew the committee's attention to specific tax rulings that cover bad and doubtful debts. In particular, tax ruling 94/32 allows that, for non-accrual loans, any interest accruing from the time of write-off will not be derived for income tax purposes until it is actually received.
On the basis of the ATO's rulings and the audit of the Commonwealth Bank's accounts, it appears that shadow ledger accounts are a legitimate accounting function. However, while shadow ledgers may be a legitimate accounting function, it is not possible, from the evidence presented to the hearing, to make a judgment as to whether the Commonwealth Bank have operated their shadow ledger accounts properly. In particular, I refer to evidence presented at the hearing by Mr Bruce Ford and Ms Wendy Murray in respect of their company, Traztea Services Pty Ltd. The committee heard that moneys paid into Traztea Services accounts were not reflected in their statements. An amount of $404,809.06 was paid into Traztea Services accounts and yet the bank statements accounted for only $355,416.16. I can understand why a customer of the bank would be suspicious when amounts of money appear to simply disappear. Given that the bank acknowledged to the committee that there were errors in the processing of transactions to Tratzea Services Pty Ltd's accounts, I ask that the bank confirm that the taxation treatment of the moneys was in fact correct. 
Let me now turn to the issue of bank statements. The Financial Services Consumer Policy Centre submitted to the joint parliamentary committee that the refusal of the bank to provide bank statements to customers had meant that some customers had been unable to complete tax returns and some found it difficult to budget and carry on business normally. Many experienced refinancing problems and some faced insolvency.
The refusal to provide bank statements is not a trivial matter. The basis of a relationship between a bank and its customers is one of trust. In order for a customer to deposit their savings with a bank, the customer must trust that the bank will keep their money safe. Could you imagine a situation where a customer went into a bank and asked for the bank balance, only to be told, `No, we won't tell you'? Would anybody in this chamber accept that? And yet this is the basis of the allegation against the Commonwealth Bank. When customers who were in default on their loans requested bank statements so that they could determine their financial position, the bank refused to provide them. At the hearing, Mr Michael Ullmer, Group General Manager from the Commonwealth Bank, acknowledged that the bank had refused to provide bank statements to some customers. He stated:
... when dealing with an impaired loan, the relationship between the bank and the borrower may be vexatious. The borrower may dispute the amount owed and the Commonwealth Bank may cease to issue further statements as in the past there has been little purpose in providing information that the customer may perceive as incorrect and may further inflame the dispute that may well be in place between the customer and the bank.
He went on to say:
In dealing with business customers, we are aware of a small number of instances where officers of the Commonwealth Bank Group have refused to issue statements on request to borrowers who are in default of their loan obligations.
I find it hard to accept the bank's rationale that they did not provide bank statements to some customers because they did not want to inflame an already vexatious situation. Indeed, I would have thought that the refusal to provide bank statements would inflame a dispute with a customer. I wrote to the Commonwealth Bank and specifically asked whether they had refused to provide bank statements to customers with bad debts in March of this year. On 23 March, the bank responded in writing. They stated:
There is not a standard time at which the Bank would decide not to provide statements to a customer on a regular basis. It may for instance decide not to issue regular statements if the debt is subject to legal proceedings and the only change to the amount owing is the accrual of interest and or the costs of recovery action. In these circumstances, issuing a statement is seen as unnecessary, as the customer has either decided to not repay or is unable to repay the debt. However, if at any time a customer who has not been issued regular statements requires a statement, this will be issued.
That is what the Commonwealth Bank said to me in my capacity as a senator. The bank's original advice to me that they do provide statements when requested has now been contradicted by the bank's own submission to the joint parliamentary committee. The Financial Services Consumer Policy Centre stated in its submission to the hearing:
The facts seem clear—it is a formal bank policy not to send statements once a shadow ledger is opened. The bank deny this but they have been inconsistent on this issue.
Their evidence stated that at a particular point in time they delete the address of the cust-omer involved and substitute the manager of the branch. They actually admitted to the committee that, without telling the customer—without advising them in any way—the customer's address is deleted and the bank branch's address is substituted. So when the bank produces their statements, they send the statement to themselves. This is the evidence given by the bank to the com-mittee. 
The Commonwealth Bank drew the committee's attention to the uniform credit code, which provides that a credit provider does not have to provide bank statements where a loan is in default and where no further amount has been debited or credited to the account during the statement period. While the uniform credit code applies only to consumer credit and not to small businesses, there is no doubt that we need to examine a situation where the law actually tolerates the withholding of bank statements to customers who are in default on their loans. Customers must have a legal entitlement to receive bank statements, even when their loans are in default. The government must seek to amend the uniform credit code to ensure that there is a legal obligation for banks to provide statements to all customers. I am also aware that the Australian Banking Association is currently conducting a review of the banking code of practice. The banking industry must amend the code of practice to ensure that the code provides an entitlement for consumers to receive bank statements in all situations.
The government now has an opportunity to address the issues that have been raised in the joint parliamentary committee's report. The government must seek to amend the uniform credit code and must ask the ABA to amend the banking code of practice. There is no doubt that this committee's report will be a test of whether the government takes seriously the banks' meeting of their social obligations. We hope it will not let consumers down. In view of the time, I seek leave to table the last couple of pages of my speech.
Leave not granted. ",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Corporations and Securities Committee</title>,Committees,20,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-10-03,"—The remarks made by Senator Chapman, the chair of the Parliamentary Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities, and by Senator Conroy have covered the field very well. So I do not propose to deal with the issue in as much detail as they have, but I do want to make a few points which I do not think have been made to date. Before I do that I wish to thank Senator Chapman, the chair of the committee. Senator Chapman has, in my experience, always dealt with these matters in a practical and consultative manner. The interaction between him, Senator Conroy—who acted as the shadow Labor spokesperson on this matter—and me, has produced a very good report. In my view this report is a victory for the small man. It is a report that is strongly critical of a banking practice which, it seemed, was long overdue in terms of being corrected. On a large committee like the corporations and securities committee, where we see strong opinions expressed by individuals and strong positions taken by political parties on that committee, the regular resolution of these matters, to come to a considered and uniform view, is probably indicative of some of the best features of our parliamentary system. Senator Chapman, I think you deserve some personal congratulations for your approach in that matter.
Senator Chapman has also brought forward some recommendations on behalf of the committee which, as Senator Conroy rightly points out, put an obligation on government to take particular note and particular action and to try to enforce better standards from banks in these practices. I have used the term `banks', and people would have noted in the speeches made by Senators Chapman and Conroy that it was only the Commonwealth Bank which was identified in these issues. We do, however, as a committee suspect and believe that these practices are across all banks and that all banks should pay attention to the very vigorous criticisms very rightly put down by the committee. Banks in this country often run up against a very fierce wall of criticism about their attitudes and behaviour—and here is another instance where it was deserved. A bank that was sympathetic to its customers would not have behaved in this manner. 
Banks have immense resources and very deep pockets and can affront their customers in ways which are, frankly, terrifying for people, particularly when they are at the end of their financial rope—in other words, when they are in financial difficulties or are in default. The little people—little men and women, figuratively speaking—up against the Goliath of the big bank deserve parliamen-tary support and congratulations for fight-ing for attention with respect to what has undoubtedly been bad banking practice and bank customer relations. Those witness-es who appeared before us have had a long and bitter battle to get recognition of their problem and their needs. The persons concerned, in contrast to the banks, have had to put an inordinate amount of their own time and resources to get this problem recognised. That is why I said earlier that I thought the outcome of the committee's consideration is indeed a victory for the small people in these relationships who, hopefully, as a result of their campaign will now see better banking practices established for other customers in that situation. 
Absolutely key to the whole matter is the right of any customer in a financial relationship to know exactly what their full obligation is. Customers in these situations may be at the end of their financial rope and there is always the danger of them being found to be trading whilst insolvent, either technically or in actuality, which is one of the most serious things that can happen to any commercial entity. If you do not know what your maximum liability is to the bank you could easily slip into that circumstance. The committee has said that, at all appropriate times and as regularly as possible, a customer is entitled to know what the bank considers customers' maximum liability is to the bank. Without that they cannot proceed in a businesslike fashion to deal with their debt, their refinancing needs, their budgets, their tax returns and their other financial relationships. That is a particularly important aspect that has emerged.
It is possible that the witnesses to the hear-ings may feel aggrieved that a finding has not been made by the committee that the actions by the banks were illegal. It is import-ant to note that as a result of the full consid-eration of the shadow ledger issue it has been determined by the committee that there is no evidence of illegality in the issues we ex--amined and in the evidence that was put before us. The issue became one of propriety and of due care, if you like, towards customers. The aspect of a second set of books being managed by the banks—an internal set of books, if you like—sounded very murky in the original description of the matter to individ-ual senators and to the committee, but it turn-ed out to be less alarming than it was orig-inally. Most of all, our criticisms relate to the communication with customers, the inform--ation that was put before customers and the way in which banks should deal with their customers. I would hope that all banks would see it proper to read the committee's report and to write to the committee and to the responsible minister advising them of what proactive action they have taken with regard to that report and what improvements they intend to make to their own internal practices. As I said at the commencement of my remarks, the field has been covered quite fully by Senators Chapman and Conroy, so I will not speak further for the sake of speaking.

"Chapman, Sen Grant",LP,2000-10-03,"—I present the report of the Parliamentary Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities, entitled `Shadow ledgers' and the provision of bank statements to customers, together with the Hansard record of the committee's proceedings and documents presented to the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
In June this year, I drew the attention of the Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities to serious allegations about practices of the Commonwealth Bank in its commercial dealings with a group of rural and regional customers. The committee un-ani-mously decided to hold a special hearing in relation to the allegations and invited all the principal players to give evidence. This report follows the committee's investigations into the matter, both at the hearing and in subsequent action taken by the committee.
There were four main allegations made against the Commonwealth Bank. These were that the bank: firstly, failed to inform rural customers that their debts had been written off; secondly, used a `shadow ledger' system to improperly claim tax benefits; thirdly, wrote off loans as bad debts while still receiving interest payments to service those debts; and, fourthly, refused to issue account statements to customers. The committee heard as witnesses three of the principal complainants, Mr Bruce Ford, Ms Wendy Murray and Mr Bernie Madigan; three senior representatives of the Commonwealth Bank; a deputy commissioner and an assistant commissioner of the Australian Taxation Office; and the Queensland Regional Director of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. The committee is most grateful to all of those witnesses for the valuable evidence they gave.
Although this was not a formal inquiry, the committee received 17 submissions. In particular, submissions were received from all of the witnesses and from the Financial Services Consumer Policy Centre, the main support body for the complainants. Four of these groups made supplementary submissions to expand on matters raised at the hearing. The committee is confident that the witnesses, the submissions and the supplementary material gave a thorough perspective on the issues and enabled it to arrive at appropriate conclusions and recommendations.
May I say as chairman of the committee that it was very pleasing to note that there was virtually unanimous agreement among committee members about the findings and recommendations contained within this report, with only one paragraph of the report indicating a difference between government members and opposition and Democrat members. I will speak to this issue a little later. However, in relation to the allegations and concerns placed in front of the committee, members were unanimous in their views: that taking into account all of the evidence in relation to the cases before it, the Commonwealth Bank did not make wrongful use of shadow ledgers and that the failure to produce bank statements did not constitute unlawful behaviour; that the ATO should address shadow ledgers in a tax ruling which provides that, after a bank classifies a loan as non-accrual, any interest received thereafter will not be derived for income tax purposes until it is received; that the committee is satisfied by the findings of the bank's independent auditors that activity on the shadow ledger accounts is in accordance with accounting and taxation requirements; that the Commonwealth Bank exacerbated an already difficult situation for some customers who were in default of their loan obligations, making it difficult for them to budget, to refinance loans and to submit taxation returns; that the bank's explanation that identification did not provide bank statements because it did not want to inflame a dispute is poor banking practice, that the bank subjected customers to unreasonable confusion in relation to shadow ledgers; that the management practices of the Commonwealth Bank were seriously flawed in terms of best practice customer relations, even if the number of customers affected was small; that the need for the committee to take action indicates a failure by the bank to resolve internally some types of disputes with customers. The committee is disappointed that the positive commitment of the bank to provide regular and full statements to customers in default on their loans did not eventuate until the committee initiated its investigations; however, this positive outcome does demonstrate the benefit and effectiveness of parliamentary committees investigating issues. The committee also was unanimous that deficient practices in the treatment of shadow ledger accounts are not limited to the Commonwealth Bank but are industry wide. 
On the basis of these findings, the committee has made the following recommendations: that all banks commit to providing statements to customers who are in default on their loans in all circumstances short of litigation; as a matter of principle, such statements should include the amount that the bank believes the customer owes under the terms and conditions of the loan and should not reflect any write-downs made by the bank for accounting or taxation purposes; in addition, all banks, if they do not do so already, should inform customers of the consequences which result when a loan gets into difficulties; and finally, in order to meet any outstanding public concern about admitted administrative errors in relation to the accounts of Mr Bruce Ford, the Commonwealth Bank should confirm that the taxation treatment of these accounts was correct.
The committee will refer the first three of these recommendations to the independent consultant undertaking the review of the banking code of practice, and we certainly recommend and will seek to have those three recommendations included in the code. The committee will monitor the review of the banking code of practice to ensure that its recommendations are indeed implemented and that they become binding on banks through common law obligations. I also hope that the Commonwealth Bank, in considering our requests, will move quickly to act upon them. I have faith that the bank will respond positively to our recommendations, given that they have already given an undertaking to provide full statements to customers in default, once the committee moved to have an interest in this particular issue.
Finally, let me address the one paragraph of the report where there was not complete agreement between all members of the com-mittee. While all committee members were in agreement that the Commonwealth Bank should extend mediation to any customers who still have concerns about the way their accounts were handled by the bank, Labor and Democrat members of the committee felt that the Commonwealth Bank should appoint an independent mediator and have this advertised in the national press. Government members feel this is not appropriate. Indeed, in all cases presented to the committee the Com--monwealth offered mediation services to disaffected customers, which, in the major case before the committee, was refused by the customer. Thus, government members of the committee believe that the bank has acted in good faith in terms of its offer of mediation and that this dispute resolution process needs to be given an opportunity to work before the committee asks the bank and its custo-mers to undertake alternative mechanisms. 
In making our recommendations, government members are particularly cognisant of the need for the committee not to overstep its jurisdiction in these matters and to make recommendations that are enforceable. I conclude by saying that I believe this was certainly a matter of importance to the rural and regional customers who were affected by the issue of shadow ledgers and, in particular, by the previous non-provision of bank statements to those customers when their loans fell into default. The committee certainly does not accept that the Commonwealth Bank's behaviour during that period was accept-able, and we believe our inquiry into the matter has therefore been beneficial in meet-ing the needs of those customers. Finally, I thank the committee secretary, David Creed, and the committee staff for their professional and tireless assistance in this matter. I commend this report to all honourable senators.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,20,2
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2000-10-03,"—I would also like to add my thanks to the committee secretariat for their work on this and I would like to comment on the report entitled `Shadow ledgers' and the provision of bank statements to customers, which was produced by the Parliamentary Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities and which Senator Chapman has just tabled. The report is the result of a hearing that the Parliamentary Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities held on 16 August 2000 into allegations that the Commonwealth Bank of Australia had refused to provide customers with bank statements and had improperly used shadow ledger accounts to claim tax benefits.
The joint parliamentary committee received submissions from individual consumers, the Financial Services Consumer Policy Centre, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the ACCC and the Australian Taxation Office. The committee concluded that the Commonwealth Bank had, by not automatically issuing account statements to some customers who were in default on their loan obligations, exacerbated an already difficult situation for these customers, making it difficult for them to budget, re-finance loans and submit taxation returns. The committee concluded that the Commonwealth Bank's practice of not providing customers with bank statements was poor banking practice, unreasonable and seriously flawed. It is of serious concern that a parliamentary committee has come to the conclusion that the Commonwealth Bank's practices were seriously flawed. While the Commonwealth Bank com-mitted to the parliamentary inquiry that it would provide statements to customers who requested them, it is of serious concern that it took a parliamentary committee to inquire into this issue before the bank committed to changing its practices.
I would like to briefly discuss a number of issues that the committee examined. Let me firstly deal with the issue of shadow ledger accounts. The Commonwealth Bank advised the committee that its shadow ledger accounts had been audited by the bank's internal auditors, who confirmed that activity on those accounts was in accordance with accounting requirements and taxation requirements. I also note that the Australian Taxation Office drew the committee's attention to specific tax rulings that cover bad and doubtful debts. In particular, tax ruling 94/32 allows that, for non-accrual loans, any interest accruing from the time of write-off will not be derived for income tax purposes until it is actually received.
On the basis of the ATO's rulings and the audit of the Commonwealth Bank's accounts, it appears that shadow ledger accounts are a legitimate accounting function. However, while shadow ledgers may be a legitimate accounting function, it is not possible, from the evidence presented to the hearing, to make a judgment as to whether the Commonwealth Bank have operated their shadow ledger accounts properly. In particular, I refer to evidence presented at the hearing by Mr Bruce Ford and Ms Wendy Murray in respect of their company, Traztea Services Pty Ltd. The committee heard that moneys paid into Traztea Services accounts were not reflected in their statements. An amount of $404,809.06 was paid into Traztea Services accounts and yet the bank statements accounted for only $355,416.16. I can understand why a customer of the bank would be suspicious when amounts of money appear to simply disappear. Given that the bank acknowledged to the committee that there were errors in the processing of transactions to Tratzea Services Pty Ltd's accounts, I ask that the bank confirm that the taxation treatment of the moneys was in fact correct. 
Let me now turn to the issue of bank statements. The Financial Services Consumer Policy Centre submitted to the joint parliamentary committee that the refusal of the bank to provide bank statements to customers had meant that some customers had been unable to complete tax returns and some found it difficult to budget and carry on business normally. Many experienced refinancing problems and some faced insolvency.
The refusal to provide bank statements is not a trivial matter. The basis of a relationship between a bank and its customers is one of trust. In order for a customer to deposit their savings with a bank, the customer must trust that the bank will keep their money safe. Could you imagine a situation where a customer went into a bank and asked for the bank balance, only to be told, `No, we won't tell you'? Would anybody in this chamber accept that? And yet this is the basis of the allegation against the Commonwealth Bank. When customers who were in default on their loans requested bank statements so that they could determine their financial position, the bank refused to provide them. At the hearing, Mr Michael Ullmer, Group General Manager from the Commonwealth Bank, acknowledged that the bank had refused to provide bank statements to some customers. He stated:
... when dealing with an impaired loan, the relationship between the bank and the borrower may be vexatious. The borrower may dispute the amount owed and the Commonwealth Bank may cease to issue further statements as in the past there has been little purpose in providing information that the customer may perceive as incorrect and may further inflame the dispute that may well be in place between the customer and the bank.
He went on to say:
In dealing with business customers, we are aware of a small number of instances where officers of the Commonwealth Bank Group have refused to issue statements on request to borrowers who are in default of their loan obligations.
I find it hard to accept the bank's rationale that they did not provide bank statements to some customers because they did not want to inflame an already vexatious situation. Indeed, I would have thought that the refusal to provide bank statements would inflame a dispute with a customer. I wrote to the Commonwealth Bank and specifically asked whether they had refused to provide bank statements to customers with bad debts in March of this year. On 23 March, the bank responded in writing. They stated:
There is not a standard time at which the Bank would decide not to provide statements to a customer on a regular basis. It may for instance decide not to issue regular statements if the debt is subject to legal proceedings and the only change to the amount owing is the accrual of interest and or the costs of recovery action. In these circumstances, issuing a statement is seen as unnecessary, as the customer has either decided to not repay or is unable to repay the debt. However, if at any time a customer who has not been issued regular statements requires a statement, this will be issued.
That is what the Commonwealth Bank said to me in my capacity as a senator. The bank's original advice to me that they do provide statements when requested has now been contradicted by the bank's own submission to the joint parliamentary committee. The Financial Services Consumer Policy Centre stated in its submission to the hearing:
The facts seem clear—it is a formal bank policy not to send statements once a shadow ledger is opened. The bank deny this but they have been inconsistent on this issue.
Their evidence stated that at a particular point in time they delete the address of the cust-omer involved and substitute the manager of the branch. They actually admitted to the committee that, without telling the customer—without advising them in any way—the customer's address is deleted and the bank branch's address is substituted. So when the bank produces their statements, they send the statement to themselves. This is the evidence given by the bank to the com-mittee. 
The Commonwealth Bank drew the committee's attention to the uniform credit code, which provides that a credit provider does not have to provide bank statements where a loan is in default and where no further amount has been debited or credited to the account during the statement period. While the uniform credit code applies only to consumer credit and not to small businesses, there is no doubt that we need to examine a situation where the law actually tolerates the withholding of bank statements to customers who are in default on their loans. Customers must have a legal entitlement to receive bank statements, even when their loans are in default. The government must seek to amend the uniform credit code to ensure that there is a legal obligation for banks to provide statements to all customers. I am also aware that the Australian Banking Association is currently conducting a review of the banking code of practice. The banking industry must amend the code of practice to ensure that the code provides an entitlement for consumers to receive bank statements in all situations.
The government now has an opportunity to address the issues that have been raised in the joint parliamentary committee's report. The government must seek to amend the uniform credit code and must ask the ABA to amend the banking code of practice. There is no doubt that this committee's report will be a test of whether the government takes seriously the banks' meeting of their social obligations. We hope it will not let consumers down. In view of the time, I seek leave to table the last couple of pages of my speech.
Leave not granted. ",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,20,2
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-10-03,"—The remarks made by Senator Chapman, the chair of the Parliamentary Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities, and by Senator Conroy have covered the field very well. So I do not propose to deal with the issue in as much detail as they have, but I do want to make a few points which I do not think have been made to date. Before I do that I wish to thank Senator Chapman, the chair of the committee. Senator Chapman has, in my experience, always dealt with these matters in a practical and consultative manner. The interaction between him, Senator Conroy—who acted as the shadow Labor spokesperson on this matter—and me, has produced a very good report. In my view this report is a victory for the small man. It is a report that is strongly critical of a banking practice which, it seemed, was long overdue in terms of being corrected. On a large committee like the corporations and securities committee, where we see strong opinions expressed by individuals and strong positions taken by political parties on that committee, the regular resolution of these matters, to come to a considered and uniform view, is probably indicative of some of the best features of our parliamentary system. Senator Chapman, I think you deserve some personal congratulations for your approach in that matter.
Senator Chapman has also brought forward some recommendations on behalf of the committee which, as Senator Conroy rightly points out, put an obligation on government to take particular note and particular action and to try to enforce better standards from banks in these practices. I have used the term `banks', and people would have noted in the speeches made by Senators Chapman and Conroy that it was only the Commonwealth Bank which was identified in these issues. We do, however, as a committee suspect and believe that these practices are across all banks and that all banks should pay attention to the very vigorous criticisms very rightly put down by the committee. Banks in this country often run up against a very fierce wall of criticism about their attitudes and behaviour—and here is another instance where it was deserved. A bank that was sympathetic to its customers would not have behaved in this manner. 
Banks have immense resources and very deep pockets and can affront their customers in ways which are, frankly, terrifying for people, particularly when they are at the end of their financial rope—in other words, when they are in financial difficulties or are in default. The little people—little men and women, figuratively speaking—up against the Goliath of the big bank deserve parliamen-tary support and congratulations for fight-ing for attention with respect to what has undoubtedly been bad banking practice and bank customer relations. Those witness-es who appeared before us have had a long and bitter battle to get recognition of their problem and their needs. The persons concerned, in contrast to the banks, have had to put an inordinate amount of their own time and resources to get this problem recognised. That is why I said earlier that I thought the outcome of the committee's consideration is indeed a victory for the small people in these relationships who, hopefully, as a result of their campaign will now see better banking practices established for other customers in that situation. 
Absolutely key to the whole matter is the right of any customer in a financial relationship to know exactly what their full obligation is. Customers in these situations may be at the end of their financial rope and there is always the danger of them being found to be trading whilst insolvent, either technically or in actuality, which is one of the most serious things that can happen to any commercial entity. If you do not know what your maximum liability is to the bank you could easily slip into that circumstance. The committee has said that, at all appropriate times and as regularly as possible, a customer is entitled to know what the bank considers customers' maximum liability is to the bank. Without that they cannot proceed in a businesslike fashion to deal with their debt, their refinancing needs, their budgets, their tax returns and their other financial relationships. That is a particularly important aspect that has emerged.
It is possible that the witnesses to the hear-ings may feel aggrieved that a finding has not been made by the committee that the actions by the banks were illegal. It is import-ant to note that as a result of the full consid-eration of the shadow ledger issue it has been determined by the committee that there is no evidence of illegality in the issues we ex--amined and in the evidence that was put before us. The issue became one of propriety and of due care, if you like, towards customers. The aspect of a second set of books being managed by the banks—an internal set of books, if you like—sounded very murky in the original description of the matter to individ-ual senators and to the committee, but it turn-ed out to be less alarming than it was orig-inally. Most of all, our criticisms relate to the communication with customers, the inform--ation that was put before customers and the way in which banks should deal with their customers. I would hope that all banks would see it proper to read the committee's report and to write to the committee and to the responsible minister advising them of what proactive action they have taken with regard to that report and what improvements they intend to make to their own internal practices. As I said at the commencement of my remarks, the field has been covered quite fully by Senators Chapman and Conroy, so I will not speak further for the sake of speaking.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-10-03,"—The Renewable Energy (Electricity) Bill 2000 is an important piece of legislation which fails to do what its objects set out but the objectives of which should be far clearer, which is what this amendment from the Australian Greens is about. Right up-front the objects of the act that come from this bill should be very explicit: to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and to ensure that renewable energy sources are ecologically sustainable. My amendments will add those to the objects laid down in the government's bill, that is, to encourage the additional generation of electricity from renewable resources, to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and to ensure that renewable energy sources are ecologically sustainable.
Chair, you will remember from the earlier Senate debate on this legislation that the government is acquainted with how far short of the mark this piece of legislation falls. The legislation is meant to be the key piece of the government's reaction to the Kyoto protocol, which put the world on notice about the impact of greenhouse gases. You will recall that in Kyoto a couple of years ago, the Australian government got away with having the most lax standards accorded this nation of any other nation in the world, with perhaps the exception of Iceland, and notwithstanding Saudi Arabia and Russia; that is, Australians, who are under this government the biggest polluters of greenhouse gases per head of population in the world, should be allowed not only to not reduce that pollution level by the year 2010 but to increase it by an extraordinary 10 per cent over 1990 levels by 2010.  
The rest of the world acceded to that because the government put the case on behalf of the coal industry in Australia, which was part of the delegation of this government to Kyoto and was calling the shots for the minister for the environment, Senator Hill, that we needed to pollute more, notwithstanding the fact that the earth is warming—and I do not think anybody in this chamber is going to dispute that—and that that has massive economic, social and environmental consequences for everybody and our fellow creatures on this planet in the coming century. Moreover, even if we were to stop increasing pollution and keep it at 1990 levels, the process of environmental and economic and social consequences will continue for three or four centuries through the impact of the pollution that has already occurred. Sea rise levels are predicted to continue that long, even if we stop further pollution now.
Notwithstanding all that, this government has buried its head in the sand. It has buried its head in the sand because it is not a govern-ment of future generations; it is not a gov-ern-ment that even pays lip-service to the environ-ment; and it is not a government that res-ponds to the huge environmental intelligence and concern there is amongst 19 million Australians. It is a government that responds to sectional interests and big corporations, not least the coal and aluminium industries, whose profit line, they believe, will be affected by doing the right thing. Rather than being able to fall within the extraordinary laxity of the deal that the rest of the world gave to Australia at Kyoto—that is, a 10 per cent increase on 1990 levels of greenhouse gases by 2010—this government, through failing to bring into this place any legislation with teeth in it and to have Australia act responsibly and, in particular, to have Australian industry act responsibly, has allowed a phenomenal blow-out. The minister for the environment—who is not here for this important piece of legislation because he is off to try to have the rest of the world haul off on Australia as we move to the next round of global warming talks in The Hague next month—has told us that by 1988 Australia was already 18 per cent over 1990 levels, that is, 80 per cent over the level which we committed ourselves to be at so far as increased greenhouse gases were concerned 10 years from now. 
The Australian government has set up the Australian Greenhouse Office, and beats its chest about that. When you look at what the Australian Greenhouse Office is doing—which is all based on self-regulation, par-tic-ularly with industries which do not want to bite the bullet as far as global warming is concerned and which use the perennial excuse that other developing countries are yet to be drafted into this global respon-sibility for reducing greenhouse gases—it has no teeth, no stick. All it has got is carrot: money to give out to the big polluting indust-ries. When one analyses that performance, one sees why the Australian government is such a failure. Let me make that difference and that distinction. Australians want to tackle this issue; the Australian government does not. Australians are environmentalists; the Australian government is not. Australians are concerned about the next generation and the legacy of damage which is being built into this failure to tackle global warming; but the government is not. What we have before us is a piece of legislation which is timid, to say the best, and a complete abrogation of government duty, to put a fair spin on it. 
We have the Australian government moving to ensure that between now and 2010 Australian new energy will include two per cent provided from renewable sources—from greenhouse friendly resources like wind power, solar power and so on. How does the target of this bill, which is two per cent, sit in comparison with similar countries elsewhere around the world? Let me point out that the government even welshed on that between the announcement of this legislation and it getting into this chamber, so that the target is now one per cent. The government said, `We'll make it two per cent of electricity production as of the start of this legislation,' knowing that, on current projections, we will have doubled our power consumption by the year 2010. In other words, it becomes one per cent of the target year, 2010.
Let us compare that with overseas. The average worldwide target for renewable energy by the year 2010 is 7.4 per cent. Worldwide it is 7.4 per cent; for Australia it is one per cent. Japan is also at one per cent. Luxembourg and the United States, however, are at four per cent. Austria is at five per cent. Belgium and France are at six per cent. Portugal is at seven per cent, and let us remember Portugal is one of the worst performers in Europe. Germany is at eight per cent. The European Union overall is the same, at eight per cent. The Netherlands, Italy and the United Kingdom are at nine per cent. Remember that Australia is at one per cent. Ireland and Finland are at 10 per cent, Sweden is at 11 per cent renewables as its target by the year 2010, Greece at 12 per cent, and Denmark at 20.3 per cent and moving towards a target of 100 per cent renewable energy by the middle of the century. This bill has no target beyond 2010. It is at one per cent compared with Denmark's 20 per cent in the same time frame. Remember, this is the action of the government that has it incumbent upon it to be the best performer in the world because so far Australia is the worst performer in the world—not because Australians do not want us to perform well but because the big resource extractive industries and power consumers refuse to take their responsibilities and have influence on this government to ensure it does not do anything to cut across them and make sure they carry out their responsibilities. 
With that awesomely poor performance before us at the outset, I think we should amend the government's objectives by adding these specific objectives to this legislation: it ought to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases that it is aimed to reduce—that is what the legislation is about; it is not just about promoting renewable energies—and it ought to ensure that renewable energy sources are ecologically sustainable.
Chair, I know that you will agree with me that that ought to be an aim in this legislation, but in this debate we are going to see the government trying to defend the indefensible. The target of this legislation is to promote green energy, but when it gets to this matter of green energy we find that this bill is a fraud. We find that this bill has at its core deliberate deceit by the Howard government. For example, it allows electricity coming from large dams, which, as we all know, can have a huge impact on the environment, to be classified within this `renewable' definition. We do this in the absence of the government—I will guarantee this—being able to provide any figures about the contribution to global warming of large dams. This is a matter of international debate. The Australian Greenhouse Office does not seem to have the figures on it, so I know the minister will not. Besides the direct impact of large dams suffocating environments—and they are nearly always wilderness environments and wildlife habitat in Australia, and the experience of the Franklin Dam makes me recall all this—the damming of large rivers and waterways has a very considerable long-term impact on global warming, because the suffocated vegetation rots over the subsequent decades, producing methane, one of the most potent greenhouse gases of the lot. If you have ever walked beside the inundated precincts of Lake Pedder in Tasmania, and I suspect you have, Chair, you would have seen bubbles rising to the surface. That is not platypuses; that is rotting vegetation releasing methane, which is going into the atmosphere and which is contributing to global warming. But you will not find that the Bacon government in Tasmania has any information on that or wants to know about it. It does not want to have that on Tasmania's inventory. You cannot get figures from Australian authorities on that sort of matter. 
The second matter is even more a patent disgrace by this government in that it includes in this `green energy' the facility for burning wild forests in Australia—for having them woodchipped, the woodchips put into furnaces, the furnaces producing electricity and that called `renewable energy', when it is not. Those forests are not renewable. The wildlife habitat is not renewable. The environment is not renewable. This is an appalling tribute to the power of the logging industry in this country, desperate for new markets, and I will be talking about it as this debate proceeds. I move Greens amendment No. (1):
(1)	Clause 3, page 2 (lines 5 and 6), omit the first paragraph of the object/outline, substitute:
		The objects of this Act are:
	(a)	to encourage the additional generation of electricity from renewable sources; and

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-10-03,"—Greens amendment No. 1 goes to the objects of the act. This amendment by Senator Brown goes to the government's stated objective in this legislation. While it is one objective that we may share, as Senator Forshaw said when we were last debating this legislation, we do not really have much confidence in the government's measures actually achieving what they are setting out to achieve. This legislation is probably the one important aspect of the government's armoury in respect of climate change. As Senator Brown quite accurately said, much of what they have done so far has been ineffectual and has not succeeded. But we think this legislation, flawed as it may be, should be passed by the Senate. We believe that, in order to try to target the legislation and make it more effective, Senator Brown's amendment No. 1 is one that not only we but also the government should live with. It states very clearly what the objects are, what the objective of the legislation should be, and as such we do not believe the government should have any problem with it. Basically, what Senator Brown has done is reflect in his amendment the government's rhetoric about the importance of this measure. As a consequence, if they believe in what they say, they should also be supporting this amendment.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2000-10-03,"—I indicate that the Democrats will be supporting this amendment. As has been said previously, this is a straightforward amendment which goes beyond the government's object in the bill, which was simply to encourage additional generation from renewable sources. Surely we are on about a bit more than just encouraging generation from renewable sources; indeed, we are on about reducing emissions of greenhouse gases and ensuring that renewable energy sources are ecologically sustainable. I indicate that this should be what the legislation is about and that the Democrats will support it.  ",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2000-10-03,"—I state for the record that the coalition is of course committed to its Kyoto undertakings. In fact, of all the international examples cited by Senator Brown in his contribution and of the many that I have briefed myself on in preparation for this debate, Australia actually stands out in the world as one of the few that has actually got to the final stages of passing legislation through its national parliament, its federal parliament, to enforce a well thought out and principled policy position. For example, the European Union, Senator Brown, as you would know—through you, Mr Temporary Chairman—has a range of wish lists—on a wing and a prayer sort of stuff. Most of the other jurisdictions have got nowhere near contemplating legislation, let alone getting it into their Senates.
Senator Brown suggested that Australia was behind the pack internationally in terms of generating electricity from renewable resources, when in fact he should know—if he does not already—that Australia already produces in excess of 10 per cent from renewable sources. In fact, we anticipate that will increase nationally to something like 12.7 per cent or potentially better as a result of these sorts of measures. He stated a figure in the realm of seven point something per cent as the international benchmark. Australia is therefore on that growth path approaching nearly double the international average in terms of developing renewables.
The government is committed, in the very practical, sensible and achievable way within this bill, to increasing the share of energy production in this country from renewable resources. This is a practical and achievable demonstration of our will to do that. The renewable energy sector in Australia, I am informed, is incredibly keen to ensure that this legislation is passed. The government has committed itself to reviewing the progress and effectiveness of these measures as part of this legislative package. One of the reasons that we oppose the broadening of the objectives and outline statement, as suggested by Senator Brown in his amendment, is that in fact the whole range of measures, the whole range of programs, across the whole of government that are put in place to address the greenhouse gas issue seek to achieve the sorts of broad objects that Senator Brown is talking about. This particular bill, this particular piece of legislation, in fact seeks to achieve exactly what the objects at clause 3 say; that is, `to encourage the additional generation of electricity from renewable sources'. If you want legislation to be part of a whole range of policies, an integrated program to achieve these aims, then you ensure that the legislation that you are passing is accurate, does not send mixed signals and in fact achieves the policy outcomes that you are seeking to achieve. We are seeking to do that through the creation of these certificates to generate additional electricity from renewable sources—and this is part of the policy package. 
This is not the bill—as Senator Brown should know better than just about anybody else in this country—that seeks to be the beginning, the middle and the end of the Australian government's and the Australian community's response to the undertakings that we made in good faith at Kyoto. We made undertakings that we believed we could fulfil. We made them with goodwill, and a great mark of the goodwill of this government and its responsibilities internationally is that we are in this parliament right now passing a piece of legislation that will be binding upon not only the electricity industry but also the renewable energy sector. 
It is not an easy policy road to navigate, but it is one that we as a government have sought to navigate. I think Senator Brown's cheap political shots at this government—the first government that has taken seriously the international greenhouse challenge, with the first piece of legislation that in a practical way addresses that challenge—are nothing but that: a cheap political stunt. But that is his platform; there is nothing else he stands on. He opposed the investment of over $1 billion in the environment through the Telstra sale proceeds, and he made an absolute fool of himself in doing that. He has to continue his cheap political stunts, garnering the handful of extreme-left votes in his home state of Tasmania. He has to get up here and filibuster and make a big fellow of himself on these sorts of issues, otherwise he stands for nothing. 
Senator Brown, get up here and add your greenhouse gas emissions to the Senate chamber, emissions which will drift up into the ether. You will achieve very little, as you have done over the whole of your political campaign, the whole of your political life. Here is a realistic measure that can actually affect the global environment and which will see renewable electricity increased in Australia from about 10.7 per cent now to 12.7 per cent and higher as a result of this measure. You can slow it up, you can filibuster it, you can have your little games in this place—get your cheap headlines on page 3 of the local papers and get yourself into Socialist International, beat up cars and play your games—but let us just get this bill passed. Let us strike a blow for the environment and not just for your cheap political outcomes and your purposes; they are a joke.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-10-03,"—You might spot a government that is already in trouble over this legislation. I do not intend to get personal because this matter is too important, but a government in trouble will always do that. However, as we are on the definition at the outset here, I ask Senator Campbell what the government's definition of renewable energy—that is the title of the bill—is.
 (Senator Murphy)—The question is that the amendment be agreed to.
—I have asked the base question here. The government wants this legislation to move along. This is the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Bill 2000, but there is no definition of renewable energy in it. The government has already taken me on for wanting to expand the intentions of this legislation and the objectives. We will move on to some definitions in a moment, but I think the committee deserves to have the government's explicit definition of renewable energy. So I again ask the minister to tell us what the government means by `renewable energy'.
—The question before the chair is that the amendment be agreed to. I am not sure that I can direct the parliamentary secretary to respond to your question.
—I know that I do not get another say, but isn't the government's attitude at the outset telling?
—Senator Brown, you are right: you do not get another opportunity to speak. The question is that the amendment be agreed to.
Question resolved in the affirmative. 
—We now move to Australian Greens amendments Nos 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D and 1E on clause 5.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-10-03,"—I would like to move No. 1A separately, if I may.
—You may move No. 1A separately.
—I move Australian Greens amendment No. 1A:
(1A)	Clause 5, page 3 (after line 22), after the definition of document, insert:
ecologically sustainable means that an action is consistent with the following principles:
	(a)	it enhances individual and community well-being and welfare by following a path of economic development that safeguards the welfare of future generations; and
	(b)	it provides for equity within and between generations; and
	(c)	it protects biological diversity and maintains essential processes and life-support systems;
	(d)	it does not rely on lack of full scientific certainty as a reason for postponing use of a measure to prevent damage to of the environment where there is a threat of serious or irreversible environmental damage.
I move this amendment separately because we now move on to definitions, and I think we are going to find the government refusing to say what it means. This legislation is not honest legislation in that it talks about renewable energy but does not end up being about renewable energy. It ends up including extraordinarily environmentally destructive measures as renewable green energy. This includes chopping down, woodchipping and burning wild forests in Australia to provide energy and calling that renewable. I am certainly not going to treat the government lightly on that matter as this debate unfolds. 
I have a number of definitional additions in my amendments. I will address one in particular, which is the matter of the term `ecologically sustainable'. Renewable energy is energy which comes from ecologically sustainable resources, the sun being the basic resource. Whether you are looking at solar power or wind power, it is the sun that drives the earth's systems which produce the winds. It is the sun which is the inexhaustible source of not only wind and solar power but even hydro power. I am not going to divert at this time to say that energy efficiency is better than all these forms of power—that is, saving energy which currently is being wasted. If we had good saving mechanisms, we could as a nation save 30 per cent of the electricity currently being used and divert it to new uses. We would not need any new power schemes at all, even solar energy or wind power. Efficient energy is the best form of energy, but that is ignored altogether by this piece of legislation.
We then move to the question: what does the government mean by `renewable'? This has to be defined under the title. Renewable energy comes from ecologically sustainable resources. `Ecologically sustainable' cannot be allowed to mean anything that anybody wants to make of it. That is why I have brought an extra definition into this legislation on behalf of the Australian Greens. It is a very important definition because it is germane to important amendments which I believe the committee may well pass as we move through this debate, because they are commonsense amendments. After the definition of `document', which you will see on page 3 of the bill, through this amendment I seek to insert a definition for `ecologically sustainable':
ecologically sustainable means that an action is consistent with the following principles:
	(a)	it enhances individual and community well-being and welfare by following a path of economic development that safeguards the welfare of future generations; and
	(b)	it provides for equity within and between generations—
that means it really makes sure that we do not disadvantage the next generation—
	(c)	it protects biological diversity—
wildlife, plant life—
and maintains essential processes and life-support systems—
that is, the ecosystems on which our native animals and plants depend—
	(d)	it does not rely on lack of full scientific certainty as a reason for postponing use of a measure to prevent damage to the environment where there is a threat of serious or irreversible environmental damage.
In other words, the precautionary principle comes into play: you do not pursue an action which threatens the environment until you know that that threat has been lifted, that the environment is safe. The government uses this sort of terminology all the time, because it is part of international parlance now. 
I do agree with Senator Campbell from the government when he said that it is important that legislation be clear and state what it means. It is important that we have definitions for terms like this which otherwise become very rubbery and are wide open to abuse. So I recommend and I commend to the committee this new and very pivotal defi-ni-tion of `ecologically sustainable' as set down in Australian Greens amendment No. 1A.
Amendment agreed to.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-10-03,"—I intend to now move amendments Nos 1B, 1C, 1D, 1E, 3, 4, 5, 7, 14 and 15 together. These are very important amendments. They involve a number of definitions.
—Mr Temporary Chair, I indicate that the Democrats will not be supporting all of those amendments.
—I thank Senator Allison for that. I would be very happy to regroup these to facilitate putting separately those which the Democrats might wish to treat with a yes and those that they might want to treat with a no. 
 (Senator Murphy)—I can put them separately from the chair if Senator Allison or indeed Senator Bolkus wish any of them to be put separately.
—I will move amendments 1B, 1C, 1D and 1E together and then I will move the others later. I move:
(1B)	Clause 5, page 3 (after line 29), after the definition of government body, insert:
Green Power Product means a product that enables power consumers voluntarily to make a financial contribution to the development of Green Power electricity generation in accordance with the program known as the National Green Power Accreditation Program.
(1C)	Clause 5, page 4 (after line 5), after the definition of identification code, insert:
independent person, in relation to a public environmental assessment, means a person who:
	(a)	in the Minister's opinion possesses appropriate qualifications to undertake the assessment; and
	(b)	is not employed by the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth authority and has not, since the commencement of this Act, provided services to the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth authority under or in connection with a contract.
(1D)	Clause 5, page 4 (after line 14), after the definition of National Electricity Code, insert:
native vegetation means vegetation that is indigenous to the land, local government area, Territory or State in question.
(1E)	Clause 5, page 5 (after line 8), after the definition of protected information, insert:
public environmental assessment means an assessment carried out in accordance with the procedures set out in Schedule 1 by an independent person appointed by the Minister for the purpose.
The first thing is the definition of green power product so that it means a product that enables power consumers to voluntarily make a financial contribution to the development of green power electricity generation in accordance with the program known as the National Green Power Accreditation Program. The second definition is that an independent person in relation to a public environmental assessment means a person who, in the minister's opinion, possesses appropriate qualifications to undertake the assessment, is not employed by the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth authority and has not, since the commencement of the act, provided services to the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth authority under or in connection with a contract. That is pretty clear. It is seeking true independence. Amendment No. 1D would put in a definition for native vegetation. That means vegetation that is indigenous to the land, local government area, territory or state in question. Amendment No. 1E has a definition of public environmental assessment. That means an assessment carried out in accordance with the procedures set out in schedule 1 by an independent person appointed by the minister for that purpose. 
These definitions are explicit, but I want to again come back to the definition of native vegetation. It is very important that we get the parameters clear for one of the core objections to this legislation, and that is that native vegetation should not be a subject for producing so-called renewable green power, firstly because it cannot be. You cannot renew native vegetation, put it through a furnace and turn it into energy, because by definition you are destroying it, you are destroying wildlife habitats and, whether you put plantations or whatever in afterwards, as you know, Mr Temporary Chairman, once native vegetation is knocked down, clear-felled or cut down then it is no longer a natural ecosystem. It is important that we know exactly what we are dealing with when we get to these crucial amendments down the line and try to cut across the intention by the government in this legislation to allow woodchips from native vegetation to be burnt in furnaces and turned into electricity, which then would be accredited as green power. It is an unthinkable thing to do to the Australian public. There are people out there paying premiums to get green power now. They want to do the best they can by the environment. They are happy to pay quite large amounts extra on their power bills to get renewable energy, to get energy from existing hydro systems, but more particularly they are after wind power systems and solar power systems. New South Wales is a leader in this field and has to be congratulated for it. Australians are prepared in their tens of thousands to pay extra on their energy bills for the privilege of getting clean green power, and along comes the government in this piece of legislation and says, `We will allow the burning of native forests to be classified as clean green.' That is inexcusable duplicity towards the Australian people. 
I note already that we are having difficulty getting answers to definitions from the representative of the minister in this debate. I say again that it is very unfortunate that the Minister for the Environment and Heritage is not here for such an important piece of legislation. I do give notice that I will be asking the government to explain that incoherent core to its argument for this legislation. The government might say, `This is Senator Brown on a hobbyhorse about the environment.' I see it as far more serious than that. I think the government will expedite this committee's debate if it will simply explain how it could be that the burning of native vegetation and forests can be classified as renewable energy with a view to selling it as green power.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-10-03,"—The opposition do not support the amendments because for us there are consequential and other amendments which we will not be supporting, but we do understand Senator Brown's concerns. Having said that, I also rise to ask the parliamentary secretary handling this legislation to address Senator Brown's question. There is widespread concern about native vegetation and whether it will be impacted upon either directly or indirectly by this legislation. I think the question that Senator Brown asks is one that really needs to be addressed in full by the government.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-10-03,"—I again ask the parliamentary secretary if he will answer that question.
—Yes, I was taking advice.
—He is taking advice, so I would be happy to give him a little bit more time to do that. I express a bit of alarm, as far as I am concerned, at this juncture that Senator Bolkus has just bought into the debate and, if I am hearing correctly, indicated that the opposition may well support the government on the burning of woodchips being classified as green power. I hope that is not the case.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2000-10-03,"—I am happy to respond. I did brief myself fairly extensively on this bill before I came in and I did read about the issue of the use of remnants of forestry, not necessarily only from native forests but also from plantations and other sources. Both from my briefing and from my experience I know that there are a number of options for what you can do with what is left over from forestry activities. I think I heard Senator Brown referring to what happens to forests that get stuck under the water where a river has been dammed. You obviously see things degenerate and bubble up. Of course the remnants of forests that have been logged degenerate and cause all sorts of by-products. You can use them for a range of different things. Personally, I get lots of bits of old wood and turn them into pieces of furniture. That is one thing, but I doubt that you could use all of the remnants of forestry for beautifully handcrafted pieces of furniture like the ones I make. You would have to cover the world from end to end with handcrafted furniture.
I am aware, for example, that remnants of forestry are used to create energy. The policy is, in terms of those classified and approved eligible renewable energy sources, that as they relate to bioenergy they would only be able to be from forestry practices that were approved under the existing legislative framework, including the RFA processes. So they would have to have been approved under all appropriate federal, state and local planning regimes and legislation. ",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-10-03,"—So we have the first admission from the government that this piece of legislation will involve the burning of components of native forests in Australia which will then be classified as green power and sold to the Australian public. The government response is that this is covered by RFAs and other sets of acronyms for actions already past. Let me tell you exactly what that means. Prime Minister Howard, who has never visited the Tasmanian wild forests and who has assiduously refused repeated requests for him to do so, so that he is informed on the ground of his actions, flew to Tasmania—he has been to other states as well, but let me cite the Tasmanian case—in 1998 and signed the RFA that the parliamentary secretary just referred to, which is the regional forest agreement. That is an agreement between the federal and state governments, taken up by the Bacon Labor government in Tasmania at the moment, hand in hand with the Howard coalition government, to destroy at the greatest rate in history Tasmania's wild forests. Whatever is argued about the intention of the legislation, that has already been the outcome. At the moment in Tasmania, on the last quarterly figures for the second quarter of this year, more than five million tonnes of wild forest processed as woodchips is being log-trucked to the export sites in Tasmania to be sent to Japan, where it is turned into paper and, ultimately, ends up on the rubbish dumps in the Northern Hemisphere, producing greenhouse gases.
The Greens, in tandem with the Labor Party—which went into an accord with the Greens in 1989 to secure government in Tasmania—put a ceiling of 2.88 million tonnes per annum on woodchip levels. That had never been breached before then but, by 1991, the Labor Party in Tasmania wanted to break the agreement it had signed with the Greens and manifestly did so. As a result, it lost office. But here we are, not 10 years down the line and the rate of export woodchips—this is destruction of Tasmania's wild forests and wildlife habitat—is double that of 1989. Out of the small island of Tasmania come two-thirds of the export woodchips, ripping the heart out of Australia's wild forests under the signature and express target of Prime Minister John Howard, who refused to go and see these forests.
In this legislation, we are now being asked to give a stamp of approval to a woodchip industry which is being caught up in and passed by world events—that is, plantations of Australian gum trees the size of Tasmania have been planted in South America, for one. They are growing at uniform rates, they come to maturity for export pulp purposes within 15 years and are being shipped to Japan. They are high quality, they are even quality, they are low price, and the growing and cutting are mechanised. The Japanese, who control what happens in Tasmania's forests through the several Australian woodchip companies—which  go to the Imperial Hotel in downtown Tokyo and have breakfast to discuss logging royalties  and dictate to Australia a spiralling downward rate for these woodchips; we are getting about $10 a tonne for these wild forest woodchips at the moment—are saying, `We are getting better quality from these plantations of your Tasmanian blue gums growing in South America and in Spain and in other places. We want you to reduce your prices further.' As the volume of woodchips being exported to Japan increases, the amount of money that Australia gets back falls. Moreover, the number of jobs falls. 
Prime Minister Howard went to Tasmania and to the other states saying, `I want to sign these regional forest agreements, because it will secure jobs.' But since the agreement was signed in Tasmania the big woodchip corporations have sacked 800 people in two years while moving to, as I said, increase the rate of exports out of Tasmania to the record level in history. It is the greatest rate of destruction in the history of our forests for the lowest return in history for the fewest jobs in history—all under the signature of Prime Minister John Howard and now Labor Premier Jim Bacon in Tasmania, in tandem tugging their forelocks to the big woodchip corporations. This seems inexplicable. The opinion polls show that 80 per cent of Australians do not want it, but we have 80 per cent of politicians in this place wanting it—the big parties want it. The only thing I can come up with is that donations to the big political parties come from those logging corporations in their hundreds of thousands of dollars per annum. The big political parties—the Labor Party as well as the coalition parties—have been bought off to destroy Australia's forests, for diminishing job returns and for a lower price at the cheapest rate possible. It is politics at its lowest. I believe it is corrupt. 
Now we have a piece of legislation before us in which the influence of the woodchip corporations is writ large. The Japanese are buying Australian blue gum forests and plantations laid down elsewhere in the world, and saying increasingly that they will not buy our native forest woodchips. So the native forest woodchippers are looking for an alternative way to use the resource which the Howard signature gives them a right to in Western Australia, in Victoria, in New South Wales and in Tasmania. 
What do we find in this legislation? We find that the woodchips can be put into furnaces and burnt, turned into electricity and sold as green power to the Australian public. That is straight-out deception. I do not know who the proper advertising watchdog in this country to deal with this is, but you would have to mount no other case than the facts to have this government incriminated for moving a process of deceiving Australians into believing the green power they are buying in the future is green when, in fact, the cost of it is the destruction of Australia's forests and wildlife habitat. I am talking here about the grandest forests in the Southern Hemisphere and, in my home state, about the tallest living hardwoods in the world as well as extensive rainforests. 
—They're in Western Australia, incidentally.
—The interjection from a latecomer from the government opposite about Western Australia simply spreads the odium of this legislation. I cannot see how anybody who is responsible for Australia's environment, or thought well about the right of future generations to inherit these forests, could come within a country mile of this odious legislation. The acting minister—who is being informed, no doubt, by absent Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Robert Hill—has said, `This will just be waste from other forest operations that gets put into the furnaces.' That is exactly the argument the woodchip industry itself used when it came and set up in Australia in 1969 at Eden and then in 1970 at Triabunna in Tasmania. It said it was only going to use the waste from the forest floor following sawmill operations. 
Do you know what the latest figures are in Tasmania? They show that a record rate of more than five million tonnes of woodchips per annum is being shipped out of Tasmania from these wild forests. Three per cent of that is sawlogged. It has become a slaughter of the forests for woodchipping. This is a deceitful argument to enable the continuation of that destruction. Let nobody in here deceive themselves that this prescription for putting Australian forests and woodlands into furnaces and selling it as renewable energy is not a come-on to slaughter forests into the future and a justification for knocking the forests down as export woodchipping of native forests becomes more and more difficult.
Let me give you a case in point. Forestry Tasmania, the harbinger of destruction of Tasmania's wild forests, has now thought up a project called Southwood in the Huon Valley south of Hobart. It proposes to utilise in various ways 800,000 tonnes of native forests ripped out of the Huon Valley, the Picton Valley, the Weld and the other wilderness valleys that are of world heritage value. The acting minister says, `Well, it'll only be the waste from that process.' It will also be from the woodlands elsewhere that beautify the Huon and give the real value to its job creating tourism industry, as against this job shedding woodchip industry. Of that 800,000 tonnes of forest, 300,000 tonnes are to be put into a furnace and burnt to produce electricity to send up Basslink—the link between Tasmania and Victoria—to sell to unsuspecting Victorians as green renewable power. Already, before we get into the passage of this legislation, the forest destroyers in this country not only have gone beyond saying it is going to be a waste product but are into huge proportions of the forest being knocked down and burnt—with wildlife habitat destroyed—to sell to Australians as renewable energy. What a deceitful process this is. 
We have not heard yet, but I get the impression that the Labor Party is going to support the government in this legislation. Can you believe that, Mr Temporary Chairman Murphy? Can you believe that, in this so-called two-party system, once again the opposition, which has a great chance in the run-up to the next election to differentiate itself from the government on environmental grounds, is selling out the forests and will vote with the Howard government on this destructive formula for Australia's wildlife and Australia's forests? All I can say is: thank God that, in this chamber at least, we do have the opportunity for alternative voices to be raised. These alternative voices on this occasion represent the vast majority of opinion in this country. This legislation is disgraceful. The amendments that I am bringing forward on behalf of the Australian Greens seek to turn the legislation into a truly worthy piece of environmental legislation. At the outset, we need to change not only the definitions but also the direction in which the government has taken this piece of legislation. My second set of amendments is to give a formula to ensure that `eligible renewable energy sources' means that.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,2000-10-03,"—I would like to make a few comments with regard to Senator Brown's amendments. At one end, I have a tendency to agree with some of the things that he says—and I have some sympathy for some of the things he is pursuing—but the situation in respect of biomass energy worries me. On the one hand, I understand Senator Brown's position that he does not want to see forests become a principal focus for generating a resource for biomass energy, but on the other hand we have to look at the circumstances that exist in this country within the forest industry. It is an industry that, I suspect, will continue for a very long time into the future.
An industry like the forest based industry does generate a residue from its operations. From my point of view, in many respects it generates waste at an amount that is totally unacceptable. I would have thought that, with regard to Senator Brown's proposed amendments to this legislation, it would be possible to look at rating various aspects of renewable energy—biomass energy probably could be rated differently from wind energy and/or solar energy, et cetera. When we look at biomass energy generation, we have to look at the overall management. This is where I have some sympathy with Senator Brown's views. When we are dealing with another industry, we must ensure that that industry is being responsibly run. We have embarked upon a process that has led us to regional forest agreements that are supposed to do all manner of things—but, I have to say, have achieved very few—and I speak with some knowledge in terms of my own state. I would never have said this a few years ago, but it does cause me great concern that the forests in Tasmania are being grossly overcut, and we are losing employment as a result of that. I would not like to see that cut increased as a result of an effort in terms of biomass energy.
I just wish to put something into perspective with regard to residue as a result of forestry operations in Tasmania that I think it is very important for us to understand. In Tasmania, as a result of the current harvesting of native forests, both crown forests and private forests, the in-forest residue generated—I am not talking about the sawmill residue; that is, the trees that are left behind, or the heads of trees or the butts of trees, et cetera—is probably around six million tonnes per year. Where I have a difficulty and a difference with Senator Brown is this: when I watch that being burned on the forest floor, it gives me great cause for concern because that also adds to the greenhouse problems much more significantly than it would if we were able to manage it appropriately and utilise that waste in biomass energy generation. But, as I said, I do not think that will be the case. I think we will still have that waste on the forest floor and that what will happen is that it will be driven—and I do share the concerns that have been expressed about plantation development—for the specific purpose of biomass energy. There will be more and more pressure on Australia in the future in relation to fossil based fuel energy. They will look for ways and means of actually decreasing the greenhouse gas emissions, and biomass energy and a mixture of wood and coal is one way of doing that. 
When we are looking at this, I would urge the government to seriously assess—I took the time to ring the regional forest agreement implementation committee and I asked them for their view on what is ecologically sustainable management. What does that mean in terms of the forests? If you look at where we started off, going back to the national forest policy statement and the protocol that was put down, what does `ecologically sustainable management' mean? It means that you manage an ecosystem. So if you harvest a native forest, essentially what you should replace it with is that native forest. But we are replacing it with a monoculture. That is a real problem, particularly when we are dealing with a monoculture that may well have been genetically modified. 
In dealing with this legislation and the part of it that relates to biomass energy, I would urge the government to very seriously consider the circumstances that can occur as a result of this piece of legislation, as it would affect another industry and the environment in terms of the ecology of the forests of this country. There are some very serious issues to consider here. They are not issues that I considered even three or four years ago but, when you look at the circumstances occurring today, it is a very serious matter. If we do not address it we will live to regret that fact. So I urge the government to look very seriously at how it is going to oversee the interaction of biomass energy generation with the management of the country's forests, and indeed the plantations.
I would just make a comment on plantations. We have seen in this country a significant increase in the effort to put trees into the ground in plantation developments. That is likewise the case in other parts of the world, and Senator Brown made the point about other countries growing eucalypts and, because of climatic conditions, being able to grow them more quickly and more uniformly. That is true. That is not something that Senator Brown is the first person to say; it has been said by many experts in the industry. What is happening in this country, though, is that we are embarking upon a plantation effort that has no strategy. We have no plan for where we are heading with the stock that will be produced in those plantations. In this country there is not even an organised strategy about when to plant and when to bring that resource on line. There are plantation developments in Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria, Tasmania and New South Wales, and there are probably some in Queensland, but there is no organised strategy about what will happen in 10 or 15 years time when all of this resource will become available, as will be the case elsewhere in the world. ABARE and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations are saying that if we do not start to look at this we will have a problem. Of course, we experienced a bit of this problem back in the 1960s, with pine plantations. There are some lessons that ought to have been learned. I would not like to see us in a position where, in five, 10 or 15 years time, the plantations that come on stream, which are basically principally funded by the taxpayers of this country, will be put into biomass energy at a very low value that will not provide a dividend to the people of this country and where they will not be able to get back the taxes they have paid out over a course of 15 years. I think that is something the government has to consider very seriously.
There must be a much more orchestrated and better managed system in approaching these issues. If we do not do that we are going to end up with a big mess. We already have a big mess in the forest based industries and it is going to take some sorting out. But if we head down this road, they will see it as an easy out to the problems they confront. As I said, I urge the government to consider this very seriously. I do not agree with Senator Brown that we should not allow forest residue, et cetera, to be used in the form of biomass energy, but I do have some sympathy with the view that it ought to be rated differently from renewable energy, but that is my personal view. But I would say that the government ought to have a long, hard look at what is happening and where things are headed in the future.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2000-10-03,"—I think it is necessary to respond to Senator Murphy. He has made a very good case for removing native forests from this legislation as eligible sources, but he says that the reason for not doing that is the waste, which can be utilised in this process. Those of us at this end of the chamber have been listening to this argument about waste for a long time, and we know that the so-called waste is actually in the form of logs—logs which look like the logs that go to sawmills. Logs are absolutely necessary for woodchippers, because they have to debark the timber and the tallest, straightest timbers are the ones that are most suitable for woodchipping. 
It is not the treetops, the branches, the roots, the leaves or anything else that people might imagine to be waste products that go into woodchipping, and those things will not go into biomass and into coal fired power stations in order to generate electricity. Those things are not the waste that will be used. There might be a bit of material that comes from sawmills, but, as the Tasmanian Conservation Trust pointed out just a week or so ago, only three per cent of the native forest timber delivered to mills in Tasmania this winter ended up as sawn timber and veneer. That was down from 3.8 per cent in the previous winter. So the remaining 97 per cent of forest wood was classified as so-called waste. It defies all credibility and all rationale to say that if we have native forests being put into biomass burners to generate electricity we are going to get the waste. This is the broadest imaginable definition of `waste'. As I said earlier, this 97 per cent of timber does not include treetops, leaves or roots. That will remain on the forest floor and will still be burned, and there will be absolutely no difference in terms of utilisation of so-called waste.
The Tasmanian Conservation Trust pointed out that the extraordinary levels of so-called waste—97 per cent—have arisen for two reasons. First, worsening market conditions for hardwood timber in the face of fierce competition from softwood plantation timber means that mills will accept only the highest quality sawlogs, with large volumes of sawlog-quality logs being designated for pulp. Second, worsening market conditions for old growth woodchips from pulp and paper mills in East Asia, in the face of similar competition from woodchips from hardwood plantations, are expected to render such chips unsaleable within two or three years. 
ABS data for September shows that Tasmanian woodchip production is at its highest levels since woodchip production surveys began 30 years ago. Before the RFA process, woodchip exports were pegged at less than three million tonnes per year, but they have now reached a staggering 5.1 million tonnes per year. So it is crucial that the ALP change its views about native forests being burned for electricity. The RFA process is already damaging our forests in Tasmania, in Victoria, and in other states, including Western Australia. This will provide another impetus for cutting down native forests to use for this purpose. The government cannot satisfy us on the question of biomass and the impact on native forests, and Senator Murphy ought to talk with his colleagues and try to persuade them, to remove the doubt, to join the Greens and the Democrats and vote for our amendments, which would make that quite clear. You would be in line with the Labor government in New South Wales, which does not allow native forest products to be used in green power. I do not know what has gone wrong with the Labor Party that it cannot support an amendment which would obviously be in line with policy in New South Wales, at least. 
I will always leap to my feet when I hear Senator Murphy talking about waste, because we know that waste is not real waste and that the industry has been getting away, for a long time, with trying to persuade ordinary Australians that all that woodchipping is doing is cleaning up what is on the forest floor. That is a nonsense; let us put it to bed now and recognise that the timber which goes to woodchips is fine, tall, quite large timber, and it looks very much like what goes to sawmills. ",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-10-03,"—I wish to say a few words in response to Senator Brown and Senator Allison. Senator Forshaw, in the previous debate, made our position on these amendments clear, and I do not think that anyone should be surprised today, having had some notice—particularly Senator Brown, who put out a press statement this afternoon criticising us for taking a position which he now expresses surprise at—
—You might have been surprised some time ago rather than now. Our position is one of concern about the potential impact of this legislation, but I must say it is not the unbridled concern that the minor parties have. We recognise that we need to closely monitor and scrutinise the legis-lation. We recognise that further harvest-ing of RFA areas is not unlimited and that there are significant constraints on resource availability. We have indicated that it is not really clear at this stage—from the evi-den-ce presented at the Senate inquiry—whether the financial incentives resulting from the eligibility of forest waste under the pro-posed legislation would result in in-crea-sed extraction of biomass from our native forests. I think if you were to look at the evidence of that committee you would come to an understanding of the difficulties involved in addressing this issue and the diverse range of projected outcomes of these provisions.
We are not saying that we are prepared to give this legislation a blank cheque. We are saying that, despite some fundamental concerns we have in respect of it, we think it should be passed, and we think that an amendment such as the one that Senator Brown moved will ensure that the legislation does not get through this place and the House of Representatives in time for it to be implemented and to have any impact at all. 
It is basically a question of whether we want the legislation or whether we want to make an amendment to it at this stage. Given that, in many ways, the jury is out on these particular clauses, we have said that we will allow these clauses to go unamended. But we have already signalled a review of the legislation, and one of the close areas of scrutiny will be the way that native forests may be encompassed by the impact of the legislation. As I say, the judgment of the opposition is that the jury is out with respect to that, but we should approach this with a degree of scrutiny to ensure that the measure does not result in an increase biomass extraction in non-plantation forests. That is something that we have placed on the record before. Senator Forshaw mentioned it just a few weeks ago. I take this opportunity to restate it because we have had quite a deal of representation over recent weeks, as have other members of parliament, with respect to these provisions in particular. They are provisions that do raise concern but they are but one of a range of provisions that raise concern within the committee. 
In a sense, the jury is out on the whole legislation as to whether it will be effective. I think there is cause for people in the community to be concerned that it may not be effective. It is not only the impact on native forests that needs to be monitored but also whether the legislation will create the new technology that we are talking about or whether the level of the penalty, for instance, will ensure that industry takes a softer option than the one that the government states it will achieve. However, on the plus side, we have been led to believe that we can anticipate a degree of impact in terms of industry development, particularly in rural Australia. That is an impact that we want to see and it is an impact that we think justifies support of the legislation at this stage.
The Senate in a sense is in a hard position. The government has taken a number of years—two years at least—to come up with this legislation and has basically said to us that, unless it is passed for implementation in January next year, it will not be in a position to ensure its implementation for another six months or so. The government has also said to us that any substantial amendment to the legislation will ensure that the legislation is not implemented. It is a hard decision. We have come down on the side of supporting the legislation with the reservations we have, with an amendment to provide a mechanism for scrutiny, which we will be moving in the not too distant future in this debate, and also with a warning to the government: `So far your greenhouse measures have not taken effect. We are not going to give you the opportunity to blame us or the rest of the parliament if you do not have this measure in place. You cannot blame us for your failures. This is basically your measure and you will be judged on it.' ",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,2000-10-03,"—I would just like to comment on some of the points that Senator Allison made. Senator Allison, there are few people who know more than I do about Tasmanian forests and the management practices that are employed there. I think even Senator Brown might even acknowledge that I have some understanding of what happens. In terms of waste, I accept the argument and quite readily accept the fact that there is poor management. But I do not think this legislation is the place where you address a management practice with respect to another industry. I would suggest that, if you are so concerned about whether good logs are going to woodchip mills or not—which they are; I accept that but I do not agree with it—we ought to do something in terms of legislation in another area. It is not for this legislation to address a problem that is a management practice that essentially relates to another industry. I have spoken with the Wilderness Society and, on the odd occasion, Senator Brown and others about this issue. What logs go where and what residue stays in the forest is a management practice. That is what it comes down to. The regional forest agreement, as you probably heard me say, sets down a practice which is supposed to be ecologically sustainable management. I would suggest that it does not happen. But, by the same token, I would not agree that you try to change that through this legislation. 
Where genuine forest residue exists and is being burnt on the forest floor, it could be more effectively utilised with a lesser impact on the very issue that you express concern about in terms of this legislation—a concern we all have—and that is greenhouse gas emissions. I accept your argument that there is a lot of non-genuine forest residue—a huge amount. As I said, in Tasmania it is somewhere in the order of six million tonnes. Forestry Tasmania acknowledge that, of the public forests—and this is not the logs that go to woodchip mills; exclude all that, this is just the wood that is left in the bush—it is three million tonnes per annum. That is a lot of smoke when it gets burnt, let me tell you—including what they additionally burn when fires get out of control. My view about it is that we ought to at least try to implement and bring about better management practices. But in terms of the utilisation practices that exist in the Tasmanian forests—and, Senator Allison, it is not much better in Victoria—I suggest that you address that through another process. There is other legislation available to be amended.
I think the reason that you are pursuing this in this way is that there is a fundamental underlying opinion or view that there ought not be any native forest harvesting at all. I accept that. I know that is Senator Brown's position, and I accept that. It is a democratic country. We are entitled to our own opinions and our own views about various things. But, at the end of the day, we have a forest industry and it will continue—and it will continue to a significant degree in native forests. I accept the concern, and I do not want to see it happen either, that we may end up channelling a whole heap of either plantation or native forest timber—that is, log form timber—into biomass energy because we have mismanaged the general forest industry. That is what is happening, and I can see it heading that way. But I hope that somebody somewhere—governments at federal and state levels—will come to grips with the problem and address it. But it will not be addressed through this legislation.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-10-03,"—I feel sorry for Senator Murphy because he is more closely aligned with the Green's position on this than he is with the hardcore Labor position, which is one of gross mismanagement written into legislation. Senator Murphy says that it is a democratic country and we are entitled to our own opinions—but not if you are in the Labor Party. What we are going to see here will be the same as what we saw with the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998, which was all about management. The amendments were there because the Greens put them forward to make sure the forests were managed properly. Senator Murphy and the other more enlightened people in the Labor Party went over and voted against those amendments because the logging industry dictates Labor policy. 
You cannot see that any more obviously than in Tasmania, where the Tasmanian Bacon Labor government is the most awful destroyer of forests in this nation—it is the brigand of forest destruction in Australia. Senator Murphy cannot do anything about that. He has tried once or twice but he gets squashed every time. I commiserate with people of conscience in the Labor Party who have to put their conscience in their side pocket and walk across and vote against that conscience time and time again as Australia's wild forests and wildlife go to destruction. There are differences in the positions we hold, but that gross mismanagement is written into the regional forest agreement legislation, which Labor, to a person, supported.
Let me remind the chamber that an amendment by Labor, which was a good one, to at least allow those regional forest agreements to be brought before this chamber so that we could see what was in them and democratically have an input into them, excluded Tasmania. In other words, the Labor Party said yes for all the mainland states but for Tasmania, where the real massive wood chipping operations are occurring, they said, `No, not that one.' Every member of the Labor Party said, `No, let's not have Tasmania involved.' There is not even a review by this place. 
We are in the position where all of us know that this legislation is a prescription for a new round of destruction of wild forests in this country—this time in the name of producing green energy. The Labor Party are saying, `We want to wait and see how it goes.' Senator Bolkus said, `This is not the place to be knocking this out; we'll wait for some future time.' That is a cop-out by the Labor Party. The Labor Party have discussed this; they know exactly where they stand, and the majority in the Labor Party side with the Howard-Bacon Labor government position, which is woodchippers first, forests second—the interests of the woodchip corporations are first and the interest of the nation, including those people employed in forest industries, because their jobs are being shed at a rate of many hundreds if not thousands per annum as the rate of destruction increases, is very secondary.
I ask the Labor Party and Senator Bolkus whether Labor supports the concept of 300,000 tonnes per annum of woodchips being put through the furnaces in Forestry Tasmania's Southwood project, which is creating massive opposition meetings in tiny towns—talk about rural Tasmania: at Sandfly over the weekend and at Huonville where the town hall has been packed. There is massive disapproval of this huge project, which is not going to do the locality any good. The international corporations will make huge money out of it, but for the locality, which depends on service industries and tourism, it is a huge negative. They have heard it all before, but apparently the Labor Party has not. It is the Tasmanian Labor Party in government which is up to its eyes in supporting this legislation. 
I ask Senator Bolkus and I ask Senator Campbell for the government at the same time: do you support Forestry Tasmania's Southwood project to burn 300,000 tonnes of woodchips per annum out of the wild forests of Tasmania to produce so-called renewable energy to sell on to the Australian market?
 (Senator Lightfoot)—The question is that amendments 1B, 1C, 1D and 1E moved by Senator Brown be agreed.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-10-03,"—This time it is not only the government which are glued to their seats but also the Labor Party. It is a pretty simple question, and I will be asking it again tomorrow. I ask the government and the Labor Party to consider overnight this simple question: do you support the burning of 300,000 tonnes of woodchips from the wild forests of southern Tasmania in a furnace in the Southwood project put forward by Forestry Tasmania and the Bacon Labor government in Tasmania, or do you not? Whose side are you on in this, and is this an example of what this legislation is preparing the way for? 
I also flag a couple of questions on other matters that I will be asking tomorrow, and the government might take note of these so we can get answers tomorrow: what environmental scrutiny will the Commonwealth apply to renewable energy projects like new dams, new wood fired power stations and even large wind energy installations, how is that scrutiny going to be applied and what transparency and democratic systems will there be for reporting back to this chamber, or indeed to the public, about the performance of these big projects, with particular reference to their environmental kudos? 
Senator Campbell and you, Mr Chairman, coming from Western Australia, will be particularly interested in these questions about the Derby tidal power project in far north-western Australia in the Kimberley. Tomorrow I am going to ask: does the government support the Derby tidal power project and has any discussion taken place about the funding of that project and, if so, what is the nature of that discussion and will it be a potential claimant under this legislation as a producer of renewable energy? I think the government is indicating that there will be some substance to the answers to those questions when we come together tomorrow.
I want to come back to Senator Murphy's asservation that six million tonnes of waste will be left on the forest floor; that we should do something about it or it will be burnt and sent up in smoke. He said that he does not think any of that six million tonnes will be picked up to be put into the furnaces; they will simply redirect current woodchipping, including valuable saw logs. Can you imagine 150,000 log trucks of this going to the woodchip mills in Tasmania each year? I went to Launceston a week ago this Saturday, to the Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery to see paintings of the Tarkine wilderness in north-west Tasmania by Dr John Wilson. The Tarkine area is a prime target for this destruction. After getting off the plane in Launceston, on the way into town at the turnaround I saw three huge timber jinkers—many of them are B-doubles these days—carrying 30 to 40 tonnes of the trunks of grand old trees from Tasmania's forest going round in a circle on their way to the woodchip mill. That is the first thing you see when you land in Tasmania. It is an absolute historic destruction of Tasmania's wild environment.
But the question comes down to: what else are we going to do with these forests? I say to Senator Murphy: leave them alone. We have 170,000 hectares of plantations in Tasmania—mostly blue gums—already. They cannot be sold into the Australian market. A lot of those plantations, particularly the softwoods, are being exported to Korea as whole logs, as Senator Murphy, I think, indicated. But let me say this on my own account: what we are seeing now is a process whereby these plantations are likely to be fed into the furnaces in the future—simply because that is the easiest market—and sold as green energy. What an appalling situation. Those plantations, which were largely subsidised by public money and through the Commonwealth, were planted so that we did not have to go on cutting native forests. But around the country the prescription is the same: this nation's wood needs, including that export woodchip quotient, can be met from plantations now. There are mature plantations all over the country. Mr Howard himself has signed the document to say, `Well, that may be the case, but the big woodchip corporations see native forests as dollars on stumps and I am going to give them permission to go in harder than ever and destroy those forests while those plantations are sitting there available to meet our needs.'
We do not need to burn anything. We do not need to leave any waste on the forest floor. We should be leaving those forests for the monumental part of Australia's heritage that they are; and, moreover, because they are creating jobs by standing there. In Tasmania, some 3,000 of the 18,000 or 19,000 jobs in tourism are there because those forests are there. People want to see and enjoy those forests. All up, 2,000 jobs are involved in the destruction of the very forests that are creating those jobs for the long term. Once those forests are gone, nobody will want to go there—not even Forestry Tasmania with its greenwash and cheap sell about how it is ecologically this and that, while it moves into even greater rates of destruction of the forests. I commend these amendments to the chamber. I note again the appalling loss of opposition responsibility in effectively supporting the government in knocking these amendments down.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2000-10-03,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I wish to draw the attention of the Senate this evening to document No. 19, the Australian Federal Police annual report 1999-2000. It is a document that needs some comment. I particularly want to take this opportunity to congratulate the Australian Federal Police on their contribution to the success of the Olympics. The dot points on page 28 of the annual report specify their duties during the Olympics: 
Provide leadership and management in the investigation of Commonwealth offences.
Provide close personal protection.
Participate in the provision and analysis of strategic criminal intelligence. ...
And so on and so forth. It is well worth taking this opportunity to congratulate the Australian Federal Police on their success, the success of the Olympics and the contribution that they made to it. In addition, the attention of the Senate should be drawn to the good work that the Australian Federal Police have done over the years. They were brought into existence by the Australian Federal Police Act of 1979, and they are responsible to the federal Minister for Justice and Customs. The AFP's mission is to provide dynamic and effective law enforcement to the Australian people. Under the stewardship of the AFP's chief executive, Commissioner of Police Mick Palmer, the AFP have met that goal. The AFP provide the government with the capacity to investigate and prevent crime against the Commonwealth and to protect the Commonwealth's interests in Australia and overseas. I also take this opportunity to extend the gratitude of the Australian people to the AFP for the provision of their services overseas and to remember those people that participate, at some personal risk to themselves, in such operations as those in Cyprus and East Timor and the Peace Monitoring Group in Bougainville and in the police services of the Commonwealth territories of Christmas Island, Cocos (Keeling) Island, Norfolk Island and Jervis Bay. It is well worth informing the Senate of the valuable work of the AFP which has been outlined in their annual report. I thank the Senate.

"Lightfoot, Sen Ross",LP,2000-10-03,"—I want to speak tonight on what is less than a fuel crisis but I am sure that senators know what I mean when I talk about the OPEC cartel that has, by restricting the flow of oil, created artificial prices that went from between $10 and $11 a barrel of crude oil 18 months ago to just over $US36 a barrel. Oil currently is sitting somewhere between $US31 and $US32 a barrel. In fact, the last price I saw from the New York Mercantile Exchange was $31.68 a barrel, considerably down on its highest price—a drop brought about, I might say, by the release by the President of the United States of 5 million barrels of oil held as a strategic reserve in the United States.
There is no one single fix for the problem. Those countries are not exclusively of Middle Eastern origin but certainly the majority of those countries are in the Middle East. I do not think any of them are democracies as we would know them. Some of them are entirely unstable, as Iran and Iraq indeed are. It is not up to us to tell them what they can sell their product for, nor is it up to the government to dictate to the private sector what it should do or what price it should charge. However, I do think the government should clear itself and unhook itself from world parity pricing and let the market sector find its own level. I have no doubt that it will not be much different from what the price is today.  
The problem as a lot of people see it, and I have some sympathy with this particular hypothesis, is that the excise on crude oil is a significant cost to the oil consumer. But I might remind the Senate that, whilst that is indexed, there are many other things within the government's control such as pensions, superannuation, wages and some other commodities that are indexed themselves. Australia has a $50 billion a year social services program, most of which is indexed. One can imagine, having indexation on our social service payments, including superannuation, and not having an index of other commodities to raise taxation for that purpose, what sort of chaos would ensue for any government. That would be entirely irresponsible, and this government, of course, is not irresponsible. 
I think what one has to do as a government, as an individual, as a company or in any other way, where one can do something with respect to changing the stranglehold that the OPEC cartel has on the fuel prices, is to look to alternative sources for energy. I might say that excise was introduced by the Hawke government, I think at 6c a litre. I may stand corrected here for a cent either way. By the time Prime Minister Keating left office, it was something around 36c or 38c a litre, which is very difficult to remove once it is woven into the fabric of taxation. 
Notwithstanding all that, we have got to look at alternative fuels. Among those fuels that readily spring to mind and which are often pushed by all sections and parties in this house is solar, but unfortunately solar is not much at good night. Wind power is very good, and the Western Australian state government has taken the initiative of committing $45 million to a wind farm down at Albany, one of the most southerly towns or cities in Western Australia, and is doing something about that. I cannot remember how many megawatts that will produce, but certainly with tourism and the contribution that it will make it will significantly lower the dependence of the city of Albany on fossil fuels. I am not against solar or wind. I think they are excellent fill-ins or innovative areas and, unless you start them, you never know how you can reduce the costs of them. I understand that the wind power costs something like 45c per kilowatt hour, and that of course is prohibitive for householders, who pay now 12.5c per kilowatt hour in Western Australia, which is even quite high by some eastern states' standards. 
Other areas that are being explored throughout the world and could be very well emulated here are the renewable crops of, say, canola and sunflower—any high oil crop in fact. Let me take canola. Canola is selling for about $1,000 a tonne, and I speak in generic figures. Sometimes it is more and sometimes it is considerably less. But at $1,000 a tonne that extrapolates to about 57c to 60c a litre for canola oil. Canola oil burns cleaner than diesel, it is renewable and it can be produced in vast quantities in Western Australia. At 57c—or 60c, to round it off—a litre, there is no reason why the government should not encourage the production of canola oil, or any other high oil crop, as a clean green energy source that is both renewable and far less polluting than the high particulate fuel of diesel.
Another area that is cleaner, though not as clean as canola and not as clean as gas, is the vast oil shale deposits of Queensland. Queensland has deposits that, in terms of barrels, equate to nearly 25 billion barrels of oil. In dollar terms, that is about $US612 billion as a contained and delineated source or asset. In Australian terms, that is over a trillion dollars not yet exploited. It is cleaner and it burns with more energy than conventional oil. It makes Australia self-reliant. It becomes an export commodity. It reduces our balance of payments, which are not bad in any case. Our national debt has decreased since we have been here, Mr Acting Deputy President, as you would know, from $90 billion down to about $41 billion. That is an excellent record for any government in any part of the world, but there is still a long way to go to get it back to what it was in the early eighties, when it was about $16 billion. That will be done, but it needs to be done with exports. We do not want imports adding to our inflation, and that is in fact what is happening at the moment. Oil shale is an oil of the future. 
The other one, which is in Western Australia, is dear to my heart and to that of most members from Western Australia: the Derby tidal power station. The Derby tidal power station can be built without any cost to the state government in Western Australia through grants from the federal government. It is not so much that the 48 megawatts of the Derby tidal power station is anything vast. Yes, it will service the towns of Broome, Derby and part of the West Kimberley, if not all of the West Kimberley. It will not go beyond that. But it is a harbinger of what is to come. It is a microcosm of what can be done. We can produce over 300 megawatts through tidal power, and that could introduce another industry into the Kimberley, which is terribly short of any industries at the moment.
I have to be very quick because I have only a few minutes left. The fuel cell that uses predominantly hydrogen is certainly the engine of the future and is something that ought to be exploited. It is 50 per cent efficient, unlike the internal combustion engine, which is about 15 to 20 per cent efficient. It is clean. It has no moving parts. It produces electricity by electrolytes that run over a platinum catalyst. That electricity is collected and turns an electrical motor. The only emissions, of course, are water and unused air. It runs at about 90 degrees Centigrade, unlike an internal combustion engine that is cooled to about 125 degrees Centigrade. I say again that there are no moving parts. 
The biggest asset we have in Australia is gas. In Western Australia we produce more gas for export than anywhere else in the world. Burrup Peninsula is one of those areas that I will talk about next time I have the opportunity to enlighten the Senate on alternative fuels to oil.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Oil Prices</title>,Adjournment,29,1
