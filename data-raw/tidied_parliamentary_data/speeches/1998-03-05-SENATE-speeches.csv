"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-03-05,"—I indicate to the Senate that those bills which have just been announced are being introduced together. After debate on the motion for the second reading has been adjourned, I will be moving a motion to have the bills listed separately on the Notice Paper . I move:
That these bills may proceed without formalities, may be taken together and be now read a first time.

"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-03-05,"—I move:
Schedule 1, item 6, page 27 (line 20) to page 28 (line 2), omit ""21 years old"" (wherever occurring), substitute ""18 years old"".
Essentially, this is the crux of our difficulty with this whole bill. Even though we had not got to that stage of the debate, there was some discussion already in this chamber yesterday evening about the age of independence for non-students. It has generally been accepted both in law and in practice by most of the community that at the age of 18 years a person is independent and is an adult. This bill attempts, almost through backdoor provisions, to try to change that age from 18 years to 21 years, at least for the provisions of social security.
I was quite interested to see the sheet that was delivered yesterday evening by the minister which set out a table whereby a family with a child—as described—at 19 years was affected. It struck me immediately that we are getting a re-run of a brave new world. Suddenly by calling someone who is 19 a child, it is quite reasonable to expect their families to support them long past the age where we have, in Australia, accepted them as being adults, that is, at age 18. I do 
 not believe it is acceptable to expect an adult to be supported by their parents when they are seeking work and I believe that just because you are 19 years of age, a young person, you are no less entitled to financial support than an older adult. This is very much what this bill is saying in relation to the age of independence, that is, that you are a less valuable adult when aged between 18 and 21 than an older adult.
I found Senator Harradine's contribution to the debate and his questioning of the minister very helpful. The view that was put by the minister that only affluent families would be losers in this change, I find completely untrue.
—Denied payments.
—I have heard the minister just say that only more affluent families would be denied payments, but I confess I think she is playing with words because, after some questioning yesterday evening, she had to truthfully advise the Senate that a family on an income of $23,400 would start to lose benefits, if they had one child, as soon as they earned $4 over that sum. By definition, a family involves an income that supports more than one person. So we are talking about two people at a minimum sharing $23,400 and, because they have an adult who was born to them and is over the age of 18 years, that adult starts to lose their benefit. In my mind, that is absolutely and completely unacceptable and unfair. That is why the opposition is moving request No. 5, which reinstates the law as it presently stands, that is, that a person is an adult at 18 when they have left education.
I talked before about the consequences of turning 18. I thought we had this debate some years ago, probably when I was in primary school, that, if you are 18, you are an adult, you are entitled to vote, you can enter into legal contracts which you are bound by and in criminal offences you are treated as an adult. It seems to me, if this government is going to say that you are not an adult at 18 and that you are only an adult when you reach the age of 21, then they should be recommending to the states that, if you enter a contract when you are 19 or 20, you can 
 turn around and say, `Sorry, I'm not bound by that contract. I'm not an adult.' If you are going to be fair about these provisions, that would be the natural conclusion to be drawn from this change.
I was quite interested to hear the minister denying that these are savings. I asked for some figures to be provided. I still have not received them, despite being told that I would receive them. Maybe the minister, when she has the opportunity to get on her feet, can let us know why they have not arrived and when they will arrive. We are told that over two years there will be an increase in expenditure of $125 million. It is a very common trick of the government to make these sorts of statements and claim that that means that everybody wins and that there are no losers. They engaged in what I believe is a dishonest ploy in relation to child care in this way as well. Because the population is growing, there is a general upward trend in the social security area and in all other payments of benefits. So even if the guidelines as to the benefit and the eligibility remain identical, expenditure in social security benefits climbs each year.
I have asked the minister to provide the figures as to who would access these benefits each year in an attempt to see whether this was another one of their ploys, where they were using the general increasing trend of a population which increased the total expenditure to hide the fact that there were losers, that there were people who lost benefits and that there were people under the existing legislation who would have been able to access the benefit but will not be able to under these new changes. Minister, I think this is one of those cases. Obviously, if we leave the legislation as it is, there will be people who, when they reach the age of 18 years, would be able to access benefits. But if we pass this bill in its present state, there will be 18- and 19-year-olds who are unemployed, who have no access to benefits or whose access to benefits will be reduced because of the income of their parents.
One thing I am a little concerned about is that even though most parents do support their children—or attempt to—there is no obligation whatsoever on parents to support 
 their children once they have become adults. To prevent someone who is an adult accessing a benefit, on the basis that they may or may not be given support by their parents, is extraordinarily dangerous. I do not believe that this government should deny people who are adults—despite the fact that they are young adults—a benefit that every other member of the community is entitled to, if they comply with the eligibility requirements except for their age. It seems to me quite discriminatory. I might allow other members of the Senate to make their comments on this matter, and I would appreciate it if some indication could be given in relation to request No. 6.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-03-05,"—I can certainly give you an indication in relation to request No. 6, Senator Neal. I do not think it is the indication you are after. The Democrats will not be supporting it, because we find opposition request No. 5, in relation to the age of independence, much more palatable, and you will be receiving support from the Democrats in relation to the maximum age being 18.
In fact I am quite surprised. I thought you put forward quite a compelling argument for the legal status of adulthood being recognised at 18, and for independence being granted and established at 18. I thought you might even withdraw request No. 6 in relation to the age of independence for a student, because in fact all the arguments and all the logic that you have just applied are equally relevant to students. I am at a loss to explain the opposition's position on this. Thank goodness I do not have to explain it, because I think it is particularly indefensible as well as illogical.
—I don't think you know what our position is. I think you should wait until we have stated it until you make wild statements.
—I will take that interjection, and I will happily wait and be corrected if the ALP will change the maximum age to 18 in both cases. I look forward to it if that is the argument that comes through. But the rationale for the Democrats opposition to request No. 6 is 
 because we believe it should be somewhat reduced. We do support in principle the changes to ensure that the maximum age of the youth allowance is 18 for the unemployed.
As I say, we are opposing any move by the government, or the opposition for that matter, to enshrine what we consider to be a ridiculously out of touch student age of independence at 25 years. This is going to be covered in a number of amendments which follow—in relation to minimum and maximum ages et cetera. The Australian Greens have a similar amendment to the one before us: request No. 5, which is in two parts and follows this. We are more inclined to support the Australian Greens amendment, rather than No. 6 as provided by the opposition.
I have stated many times in this chamber—and I do so for the record again now—our moral and philosophical as well as our legal and economic objection to the rates and the ages of independence that are set down in this legislation—not only in this legislation and other legislation which has come from the current government; I put on the record the Democrats' opposition to the former government's concocted and ridiculous ages of independence. I still do not understand—and I take on board Senator Harradine's comments from yesterday—why there is such a gap, a difference, in legal nominations as to what the relevant age of independence is—whether it is for a young unemployed person or whether it is for a student. I have put on record before the arrangements which exist for legislation such as child support, maintenance and the family tax initiative as opposed to when social security and other benefits have kicked in previously and when they will kick in under this legislation.
The Democrats find it appalling that a young unemployed person—or someone who is seeking work—is considered independent at age 21. We find it perhaps even more offensive that 25 is the nominated age for those engaged in full-time study or training. We believe this is contrary to community norms. We believe it is contrary to even the government's own practice. Senator Harradine certainly gave us some examples yesterday in relation to the inability of taxation laws to 
 take this into account; and I have provided others on record in relation to other government legislation.
I cannot leave this debate without noting that the former government is in many respects just as responsible for setting such differentiated and illogical standards on the age of independence. Senator Neal said that this debate may have happened when she was in kindergarten, but I am afraid I remember the debate that took place in the late 1980s and early 1990s, under the Labor government, in relation to the age of independence and in particular the age of independence for a student. Many of us were involved in that debate to ensure that 25 was reduced, ideally, to 18—the Democrats have always believed that 18 should be at least the recognised age of independence, regardless of the occupation, career or institution the person is involved in. Certainly, we were involved in that debate to reduce it to 21.
I acknowledge that the former education minister, Mr Baldwin, did eventually reduce the age of independence—incrementally, year by year. I note that Senator Neal interjected earlier about it being rubbish that this debate had happened, but I remember the year-by-year reduction—25 down to 22. But didn't it take a long time for that to happen. As soon as we finally got to the point where we had perhaps a more relevant definition of an independent age—I am not suggesting it was the fairest or most appropriate—but an age at which people could attain the independent rate of student assistance in the form of Austudy, up it shot again under this government.
I have seen little progress on this issue over the years and that is why I still believe that, ideally, 18 should be the recognised age for independence, whether you are a student or whether you are young unemployed. That is why we will not support request No. 6, and that is why we will continue to push—along with other people in this place who have moved amendments to this effect—for 18 and, failing that, 21, to be the recognised age of independence for students. Certainly we will be supporting the amendments before us in 
 relation to the maximum age of 18 for young unemployed people.
I record my objections to the legislation as it stands in relation to this issue. I also very strongly put on record the frustration and the anger that a lot of people—be they students, young people, political parties or community, youth and advocacy groups—have towards the previous government, because they could have resolved this issue. This issue could have been resolved. I am not suggesting it would have been changed or that regressive amendments or legislation would not have been passed by this government. The point is that they could have done it. I appreciate Senator Neal making a statement now, but I wish this had been done a lot earlier in law because we still have ridiculous standards and differentiation among legislation as it relates to the age of independence in this country.
—Before calling Senator Brown, I clarify that the committee is dealing only with request No. 5 at this stage.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1998-03-05,"—I want to endorse what Senator Stott Despoja said and point out Australian Greens request No. 2, which would bring the maximum age for youth allowance back to 18. The reason for doing this is so that people who are 18—whatever they are doing—are regarded as adults and have access to the alternative benefits that are available. There will be some difference with the Labor Party, apparently, in so far as the maximum age for unemployed people is concerned, but that will come up later. Senator Stott-Despoja is quite right in what she said, and that is why we will move a similar request to this one.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-05,"—I found it fascinating—obviously so did Senator Stott Despoja—listening to Senator Neal criticise the government for taking action which is very similar to the action taken by her government such a short time ago. Her government was able to justify moving the age for students to 22 on the basis that they were not financially independent. We are not talking about the question of adulthood; we 
 are talking about the question of financial independence.
Surely today, when young people—as we said earlier in this debate—move in and out of education, sickness and unemployment, the need for a flexible system is demonstrated. But it also demonstrates that, for quite a prolonged period these days, young people are not financially independent. They are not financially independent whether they are students or whether they are looking for work. It is not a question of whether they can sign contracts or what the criminal law says about them; it is a straight factual question about their financial independence. We are not suggesting that they are less valuable. Senator Neal said that we would claim that they are less valuable than older adults. No, on the contrary, they are more in need of help. We believe that this more flexible way of supporting young people through the different phases of their move to financial independence is a recognition of the reality of young people's lives.
When my father and his generation left school—usually this was at the age of 14—they went straight into the work force. For most Australians over the previous decades, it has been a relatively painless progression from dependency, to leaving school at quite an early age, to financial independence. We all know that that has changed—that there is a greater demand for skills, a greater demand for people to have more education. In the sixties, when I was leaving university and looking for work, there was a natural progression into jobs. Now that too has changed. Families and the community are faced with the issue of protecting and helping young adults who have not yet achieved financial independence.
The youth allowance is very much a natural progression from the Labor government's move to have young people supported by Austudy, with a parental means test up to the age of 22. Therefore, the arguments that Senator Neal has been using do not, as far as I am concerned, wash. She said something like, `Families on $23,400 would start to lose after they have income over that sum.' Doesn't she understand that is exactly what 
 happens with Austudy now? We are not treating young unemployed people differently from the way her government—and now our government—treated students of the same age in the same circumstances.
I want to make clear to Senator Neal that we are endeavouring to get the figures that she asked for yesterday. They were sought overnight, but they are not yet ready, Senator Neal. They are not yet available and for that I am sorry, but I hope to receive them during the course of the morning. As I said yesterday, we need information from other departments—namely, Treasury and DoFA. I explained that to you yesterday. We are endeavouring to get the figures for you. I am also advised—in case this is really the crux of what you want from those figures, because it sounded like it from what you said this morning—that the increase in numbers, the demographics, in other words, would have a minimal impact on expenditure. So if you were using that as an argument as to why there would be an increase in expenditure in each of the next four years then, as I told you yesterday, I am afraid that argument does not hold up.
I have also been advised that the cost of reducing the age of independence for students to 21 years would be $178 million per year, and the cost of reducing the age of independence for unemployed people to 18 years would be $135 million per year. That is a total of $313 million per annum.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1998-03-05,"—In relation to the financial impact of these measures, I understand that the minister is actually claiming that this is a cost-neutral proposal. Is that the case?
—No. It is an expense.

 natory memorandum and that the figures I gave you yesterday are drawn from that.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1
"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-03-05,"—Are you saying that they are different?
—The ones I gave you yesterday are the up-to-date figures; the ones that Senator Carr has in front of him are the previous explanatory memorandum figures.
—Could you explain, Minister, what assumptions have been changed to make those figures different?",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-05,"—I will read to you the explanation for the change which is in the corrigendum, rather than try to tell you from my own notes. It says:
The amounts set out in the Financial Impact Statement when the Bill was introduced were expressed in 1997 dollar values, based on AUSTUDY and Department of Social Security customer numbers for 1996. However, since that time, the youth allowance initiative has been recosted using out-turned dollar values and recent projections of potential youth allowance customer numbers. In addition, extra expenditure will be incurred in 1997-98 converting payments to students to a fully retrospective basis ($14 million) and in making a one-off payment in 1998-99 of family allowance in respect of young people attracting more than minimum rate family allowance as at 18 June 1998 ($0.05 million).
If you have a copy of the corrigendum you will see where I have read that from.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1998-03-05,"—Minister, you are referring to the figures of financial impact statements for the whole initiative. How do these compare with the particular bill we have before us? How do they compare in that regard?
—Mr Chairman, for the committee's sake, we will get that ready for Senator Carr and I will get back to him in a minute with that information.
—I appreciate the difficulty, Minister. I have been watching this issue carefully and I am concerned about the way in which these questions are being developed without an examination of the financial impact of this particular bill and its measures.
—They have been available. 
—I accept that they have been available to me, and I note the particular document that you have drawn my attention to. I am concerned that we get these figures clear. While those figures are being calculated, I ask: how do these compare with the consideration of other budget measures that have already been introduced in regard to changes to Austudy and Abstudy over the last two years? Do these costings include changes to student assistance that the government has already announced?
—I am advised that they would all be included.
—If that is the case, then I am troubled by the proposition that the government is suggesting that there are no savings involved in this particular bill. Perhaps you could explain that to me again.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-05,"—You were not here yesterday, Senator, when I was explaining that, as a budget measure, this is a spend. I listed the next four years of additional expenditure. That does not mean that there are no savings in part of it and extra expenditure in other parts of it. It is a balance of bringing together two programs, giving people new entitlements who did not have them and means testing people who had not been means tested before.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1998-03-05,"—I appreciate the point you make but is it the case that the savings of $514 million over the outyears have been included in your calculations?  Five hundred and fourteen million dollars is the figure that I get by examining the changes to student assistance already introduced. Half a billion dollars is a substantial sum of money, which reduces the support for students by a considerable degree. I would ask a simple proposition:  are these savings—assuming assistance of half a billion dollars—included in the government's calculations of the costs of this bill?",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-05,"—If I gave any cause for you to be misled, I am sorry, but this is expenditure on top of what has gone on before. It is taken into account but it is not included in these costings.

"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-05,"—I am afraid that you are trying to draw a long bow here to get another piece of legislation drawn into a committee stage debate on the youth allowance.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1998-03-05,"—The question arises when we talk about the impact of these particular measures. I understand the government has calculated that some 50,000 people will be worse off financially as a result of the measures undertaken by this government in regard to the common youth allowance. Does that figure of 50,000 people include the 125,000 people who will be affected by the changes to student support measures announced by this government in regard to Austudy and Abstudy?",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-05,"—I am afraid that I am not the minister responsible for Austudy. I am having a bit of trouble trying to get advice on what it is exactly that you are talking about. When you say `student financial assistance', specifically what are you talking about?",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1998-03-05,"—This is the problem that needs to be attended to. What you have here are measures which will allegedly go towards simplifying payments to young people who otherwise would have received Austudy or other payments. Under this proposal—the so-called amalgama 
 tion of five payments into one—what I am arguing is that there will be significant impacts which are not being considered in the explanatory memoranda that are put to the parliament.
What I am concerned about is that other government measures in regard to student support have already had an impact with 25,000 persons being adversely affected, which is a much more substantial measure than the government has led us to believe to this point. When you talk about the costs of this measure, I think you have to conclude that there are measures already introduced by the government which affect the payments made to students and as a consequence—
—Which ones?
—Changes that the government has made in the cessation of schooling incidentals allowance for secondary students; changes in the reduction to the maximum rent assistance payable to singles in shared accommodation; changes in the introduction of the two-year waiting period for Austudy for newly arrived migrants; tightening the actual means test; and raising the age of dependants. How much have government measures already introduced, which have raised the age of independence for Austudy to 25, saved the government?",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-05,"—No wonder you are not prepared to be specific, because they are not relevant to this legislation. They are matters on which you have had an opportunity to debate before in this parliament. You have the information you need. We are now debating not whether students should be means tested to the age of 25, not whether there should be a sharers rate for rent assistance, et cetera—we are debating whether students should be entitled to rent assistance like young people who are unemployed, people of the same age and in the same circumstances. That is not relevant to the motion before the chair, and you should be pulled into line.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1
"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-03-05,"—Minister, I suppose we have to say that it is very relevant. Obviously this youth allowance goes to the sort of financial support 
 that we are providing for our young people in Australia. How it interrelates with other changes that you have made in the legislation that affect benefits to both students and non-students is very important.
If you look at it as a total package of benefits payable to young people who are either in education or unemployed, even though you are saying in this particular bit, this particular bill, expenditure is increasing, it appears that, if you put all the benefits payable by the government to young people together, this government seems to be making substantial savings by taking money out of the pockets of those young people—who in most circumstances are living essentially in poverty.
To say that it is not relevant is avoiding the essential point. We are here today to talk about what is fair support for young people—for students and for the unemployed—and it is very important that we look at it as a total. When you speak to young people on the streets, they are not going to say, `I am only going to look at the benefits that comes from the youth allowance bill. Any benefits that arise from any other piece of legislation, I am not interested in.'  They are going to say, `What I am interested in are what benefits I get as a whole.'  It is quite proper and reasonable that you should be able to answer questions in relation to that.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-05,"—If the opposition think that this is an appropriate place to be widening the debate when we are looking at their amendment on this specific part of the bill, I presume they would have no problem with me also widening it to include, for example, the reduction in the unemployment rate, the increased participation in the work force and the increased hope that young people in Australia have now because of the actions of this government. Perhaps they would also like to take into account the reduction in interest rates that has come about because of our better management of the national economy and the national budget to the extent that the family that is supporting a young person, because of the reduction in the interest rates on their home loan mortgage, is 
 now in a position where they have had an effective pay rise of between $90 and $100 a week. I presume you are happy to have that included in the record as well.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1
"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-03-05,"—Minister, if you think mortgage payments are relevant to most young people under the age of 21, you are not in touch with the real world. Very few young people pay mortgages.
—Their parents. You are talking about them.
—That is exactly what we are talking about. You seem to misunderstand that we are talking about adults. We are not talking about their parents. Most young people do not have a mortgage. The government were very quick to claim credit for interest rates, even though they had just been elected, but I would like to see whether they are so quick to grab responsibility for interest rates when they start to see them go up again. I guess that is a debate we will have then, but I suspect that their enthusiasm for taking responsibility will not be as strong.
To go back to the issue at hand, we are really interested in what sorts of benefits are payable to young people. I think it is quite reasonable to debate that issue here in the context of the youth allowance bill. Minister, I asked you yesterday for a breakdown of the figures that you provided on this bill. I asked how many young unemployed people and how many people in education you assume would be taking advantage of the youth allowance up to the year 2002 and what assumptions you base that costings on. I have not received that information yet. I would like to know if you have it available and, if not, when it will be available, because it is very difficult for us to proceed with this debate without those figures available.

—Where are they?
—I explained why they are not here yet.
—When are they going to be here?
—If I have to go through it all again, I said that the figures are being worked on, that they will be brought here as soon as possible. I apologise that they are not here yet.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1998-03-05,"—I hope the minister will bear with me in going back over some figures she has given to the committee this morning. Did I hear correctly, Minister, when you said that a reduction of the maximum age to 18 for unemployed people would cost $178 million and for students it would cost $135 million?
—No, back-to-front.
—So for unemployed people it would cost $135 million and for students it would cost $178 million. You did give the total then of $213 million. I think you meant $313 million in total.
—Yes, you are right.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1998-03-05,"—Minister, has consideration been given to the potential for conflict within a family when this legislation comes through, because the application of the means test on the parental income results in a drop in the youth 
 allowance payable to the young adult, the 19- or 20-year-old? Has the government given consideration to the possibility of conflict arising in the event that the young adult may be blaming his parents for his losing some money and maybe not making it up? Maybe they cannot make it up. Under the proposal here, under the means test, it may well be that they cannot make it up, depending of course on their commitments—mortgages and this that and the other. I acknowledge what you say about the mortgage because that is a very important thing. It is understood, I think, to be brought in and implemented.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-05,"—Yes, we have considered it. The information that I wanted for Senator Harradine is not what I have got in front of me now, although I can give him some statistics that may be a bit of help. Two-thirds of the unemployed 18- to 20-year-olds will not be affected by the youth allowance parental means test either because they are independent or because they come from low income, pensioner or beneficiary families.
Although young unemployed people in those circumstances may have their payments reduced because of the application of the parental means test, the overall financial position of the family may, in fact, improve. For example, a family that has a student and an unemployed child, which is not unusual, both aged over 18 will be better off if the family income is below $30,700 because the increase in benefit paid to the student is greater than the decrease to the benefit paid to the unemployed person. If there were a second student in the family—two young people studying—and one unemployed, that would be even more so.
We will be monitoring trends in the homelessness figures, as we do all the time anyway. The eligibility criteria for homelessness, if that were to occur through family conflict, which is what you are worried about, will be the same under youth allowance as they currently are for Austudy and youth training allowance. There are tight eligibility criteria.
You know that we have looked at homelessness very carefully since we have been in 
 government and set up pilot programs with St Vincent De Paul, the Salvation Army and others to work with those who are claiming a homelessness payment. That is not yet completed. It will be evaluated when it is finished. We are concerned that young people are being given money and not the other help that might be needed if they are genuinely homeless. There are now much more vigorous verification procedures than there were when we came into government to make sure that people who are getting assistance from the taxpayer on the grounds of homelessness are in fact homeless.
I have just been handed more information. I knew there was something that we were using as a bit of a guide. We have to be assessing what the implications will be, we cannot be certain. Parentally means testing 18- to 20-year-old unemployed young people is not expected to lead to an increase in homelessness. About two-thirds of the group will not have payments affected at all, as I said. The average duration of payment is only five months, as I said yesterday.
The other point I would like to make is that the increase in the age of independence from 20 to 25 for Austudy last year does not appear to have led to a significant increase in the overall homeless student population. You would expect there to be a parallel with what you might be looking at here with increasing the age for the unemployed. In fact, in 1997 only 485 students aged 22 to 25 received the student homeless rate, representing 2.8 per cent of that population for that year. That is the best answer I can give you at this time, Senator.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1998-03-05,"—As I understand it, Minister Newman indicated to the committee that $135 million was the amount of savings.

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1998-03-05,"—Here we have a situation which bears 
 out what I was saying last night. What I said last night was that the government was in fact proposing to transfer the cost of its social security responsibility for young adults from its own budget to parents in these particular circumstances, and that goes to the extent of $135 million. I do believe that it is incumbent upon the government in fairness to the families affected if it is going to insist, and as I understand it it is going to insist, on this particular measure—whatever we do here it is going to bat it back to the House of Representatives and bat it back here—to have regard to the principle that I was suggesting last night—that is, if it is going to recognise the transfer of incomes within a family for the purposes of applying social security legislation, then it ought also do so in its taxation legislation by way of rebate.
I indicated yesterday that there were certain measures that should be adopted, and in my view that ought to be done in the lead-up to the budget. That issue should be addressed very thoroughly by those people within the government who are considering the imposition of a consumption tax. That is a matter that really greatly concerns me, because a consumption tax treats spending on children and these young adults—our future taxpayers—as simply consumption expenditure. Yet that spending on children is really an investment in human capital and a consumption tax would in fact hit families very hard.
I know that that is not, as the minister said yesterday, part and parcel of this particular legislation, but it is a relevant consideration. It is a matter to which the government should give thorough consideration in the first instance in the lead-up to the budget and in the second instance in its considerations of general taxation policy. Bear in mind, Minister—and I do ask you to bear this in mind—that it is not only the rich parents that you are talking about but also parents on $23,400. So, really, that is $450 a week.
You could have a situation, for example, where that is the income of a one income family where the spouse decides—because of circumstances within the family or because of extraordinary circumstances that may occur from time to time—to go out to work. Say, 
 for example, that spouse earns $100 a week part time. The effect of that $100 a week earning on the youth allowance of $87 a week is going to be $10. So the youth allowance will be reduced by $10. I could use the fortnightly figures, but I work better with weekly figures.
Because of the operation of the $1 drop for every $4, if I am correct a person who, say, earns $80—actually, it is $10 in $40. It is more, isn't it? If you lose $1 for every $4, it is $10 in $40; for $80 it is $20. So it is not insignificant that, if the spouse goes into part-time work for $80 a week, it is $20 a week that the youth allowance comes down. That is not insignificant. What I am saying to the government is that it really does have to have a thorough look at this in order to compensate the families concerned and to acknowledge the proper principles of taxation.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-05,"—I first of all thank Senator Harradine for his recognition of the importance and the impact of those interest rate reductions on families' mortgages, because when we are focusing here on families' disposable income and their ability to support, educate and feed their children, an effective pay rise of $90 to $100 a week is certainly nothing to be sneezed at and is important to factor into our consideration. I thank him for acknowledging that. I share his concern about the problems of families who are trying to raise families today, especially when the expectation is that they will need more education than their parents or their grandparents did. In other words, they will remain financially dependent for longer than previous generations, so it is much more of an issue for the parents of today than it was for the parents in the past.
I said yesterday that we recognised as soon as we came into government the costs of rearing children, and we did that by implementing our election commitment of the family tax initiative, which was a billion dollars worth of extra money going into the pockets of Australian families with children. That is not where we intend to end. We do have more work to do in tax reform, but that was a recognition of the urgency of helping 
 families as soon as we came into government and of honouring that commitment.
The Prime Minister (Mr Howard), you will recall, in announcing Senator Gibson to chair a special government members task force on taxation, listed the principles under which our tax reform process was going to be based. He said that those making public submissions should bear in mind the government's view that, firstly, there should be no increase in the overall tax burden; secondly, any new taxation system should involve major reductions in personal income tax with special regard for the taxation treatment of families; thirdly, consideration should be given to a broad based indirect tax to replace some or all of the existing indirect taxes; fourthly, there should be appropriate compensation for those deserving of special consideration; and, fifthly, the reform of the Commonwealth-state financial relations must be addressed. You would know that Senator Gibson has been very busy over recent months chairing that task force. Increasingly, organisations in the community are adding their voices to, firstly, the need for taxation reform so that we have a tax system that is appropriate for modern Australia and, secondly, what form that should take, and people do have different views.
You should be reassured that the Commonwealth is committed to any new taxation system involving major reductions in personal income tax with special regard to the tax treatment of families. I cannot say more than that at this stage because decisions have not been made on the fine print of the tax reform, as you would realise. It is certainly something I would direct your attention to when we are considering this responsibility which the youth allowance will place on families. It already places it on those very same families if they have students in the family.
Senator Harradine, when you were speaking just now, you were looking at the extra impact on families if they have a young unemployed between 18 and 20, but I do urge you to think about the fact that the typical family is likely to have students as well as unemployed in the family. Therefore, within that family, there is a transfer of payments so, 
 even though they might lose some through means testing for the young unemployed person, the swings and roundabouts mean that the benefits that accrue to the student make the family at least as well-off if not better off than they were to begin with.
One thing that has not been mentioned in this debate is the increase in benefits for those under 18. Students under 18 will have an increase in the rate if they are away from home. It is the away from home rate for under 18s. For many country people or people in regional Australia, at the age of 16 to 18, they may have to be sent away so there may be an increase in the assistance to those families. And those families will be a mix. They might have their under 18s going on to a matriculation college, while one young person is looking for work and another young person is at TAFE or university.
So it is very hard to just sit here and say that all parents will be disadvantaged because they are now going to be parentally means tested if they have an 18 to 20 year old unemployed. They are already parentally means tested for those under 18s and some would find they have more income coming in as a result of that. They are already parentally means tested for students up to the age of 25, so the change in terms of the parental means test is for the 18 to 20 year old unemployed where there may be a mixture of children in the family in different circumstances. It is a little complex to make claims about what will happen to any group of families. It is easier when you get a particular family and you can talk about the specifics. You can be assured that we are intending to address the issue of family taxation very carefully. Beyond that, I cannot say more today.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1998-03-05,"—One of the reasons I asked the question was as a result of the information given by the minister to the committee that there will be a saving to the government budget of $135 million as a result of the means test—
—And a redistribution.
—and the increase of the age to 21 years. Obviously, that tab is going to be picked up by some of the families. I think you mentioned that two-thirds of 
 the families will not be worse off and some of them will be better off. That implies, does it not, that a third of those families with young unemployed adults will not be better off. Presumably, they will be the same or worse off.
The point that I am making is that it really is incumbent upon the government to consider this not only at the stage of their consideration of the future tax regime but also in the context of the forthcoming budget. I know that you are the Minister for Social Security, Senator Newman, and not the Treasurer, but I would be obliged if you would refer my concerns to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in that regard.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1

"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-03-05,"—The debate that we have had and the information provided by the minister, if anything, have confirmed in my mind the concerns that the opposition had. That is, there was a transfer from the governments and those people who were previously treated as adults and entitled to some sort of support if they are unemployed are no longer able to access it.
The minister gave it away when she said that the change proposed by me as a request—that is, the  reduction of the age of independence of the unemployed to 18—would cost $135 million. It has been confirmed that the reverse is also true. If this measure is not amended, $135 million will be taken out of the pockets of unemployed people between the ages of 18 and 21. They are both reflections of the same picture, but they mean very different things to the government than they do to the particular individual who is affected.
In relation to this request, I would continue to press it. I feel that all the information the minister provided indicates that, if this is not moved, those young people who are unemployed will certainly be the losers, and many families starting at an income figure of $23,400 will also be the losers. I do not think by any stretch of the imagination that those 
 people are well off, and I certainly would not like to see that occur.

"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-03-05,"—The opposition is withdrawing request No. 6. I want to say a few words about this because, from some comments made from the crossbenches, there seems to be some misunderstanding. The intention of request 6 was only ever to rectify a technical error that we saw in the bill which related to making sure that there was a maximum age for every possible type of person.
We have brought that to the attention of the government and they now seem to have recognised the problem and fixed it. They had a maximum age for everyone except people who are undertaking full-time study in a course of less than 12 months and who are not receiving newstart allowance. That was the intention of that request. It certainly was not to determine the age of independence. The age of independence is obviously determined at section 1067A of the bill and not in this section that we are presently dealing with. I wanted to put that on the record because there seemed to be some misunderstanding that arose from the format of that request. We will not be proceeding with it.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1998-03-05,"—There appears to be some confusion about the effect of these changes. I understand that there is an attempt being made to secure further liaison about the implications of these particular measures. I ask the government whether it would be prepared to review this whole issue of the age of independence. It is quite clear from what we have heard today and yesterday that this question of increasing the age of independence for students will have a very harsh effect on individual students. It will have a very serious impact upon families, who will be required to provide financial support for those who have been regar 
 ded in the very recent past as adult children. Minister, I ask you directly: will the government withdraw these matters to allow some time to consider the implications of these particular measures?
—The answer to that is no.
—I am very disappointed, Minister. It strikes me that there is a need for the chamber to review this issue of the implications of forcing families to carry the additional financial burden of supporting adult children while they are undertaking study. The government, until recently, has provided support to families to undertake that matter. It has withdrawn that support in the education area in terms of changes to Austudy and various other student support measures, to the effect that 125,000 students are actually worse off.
There has been a withdrawal of half a billion dollars of support for students as a result of actions taken by this government. In this particular measure, we see that program now extended so that some 50,000 additional people will be worse off. This is particularly serious for families with adult children who are undertaking study. As already indicated, I have urged the government to review this measure—to withdraw it and to give the matter further consideration.
Mr Temporary Chairman, these issues should be considered in regard to section 1067A(4) where there is a reference to the age of independence. I move:
Schedule 2, Item 8, page 125 (line 26), at the end of subsection (4), add ""This age will be progressively reduced over time."".",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-05,"—Senator Carr has not been here for the full debate; Senator Neal has carriage of this matter for the opposition. I have already put on the public record in this place that there has been an enormous amount of time for the consideration of this legislation and for the principles behind it, in that the broad principles were announced in the 1996 budget. Senator Carr does not appear to be very interested in my answer. I would be very happy if you would listen, Senator.
—Mr Temporary Chairman, on a point of order: that is an extraordinary proposition by the minister. I am very interested. I am disturbed by the callous disregard this minister has for working people in this country. It is an appalling measure. She cannot dismiss it in this cavalier way. To suggest that we are not interested in this proposition is a gross distortion of the facts.
—There is no point of order.
—I know he is having a lot of fun, Mr Temporary Chairman, but we have had a committee stage in which this issue has been thoroughly canvassed. Before that, there was committee consideration last year. We have had the bill for five months. We have had consultations with the community. It came about as a result of requests from community organisations to your government which you ignored; you would not take any action. When there was a new government, they came to us, saying, `Please do it. We've got to do better.' I have told this to the chamber, Senator Carr, when, obviously, you have not been here, because I am sure you would have listened.
As you are not aware of it, there has been an enormous amount of consultation—an enormous amount of time for the impacts to be studied. I think that it is a bit late in the day for you to try to produce delaying tactics when the matter has been very thoroughly canvassed.
Many parents around Australia believe this is a very important measure. If you live in regional Australia or have any aspirations to live in regional Australia, you will have a better understanding of why it is badly needed. We are not taking money off young unemployed people; we are benefiting families who have a mixture of unemployed people and students—and that is the typical Australian family.

"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-05,"—I cannot produce such a piece of research for you today, Senator, but I can say that I and my officials have spent a very great deal of time going around Australia—not just sitting in Canberra—talking to organisations like the Smith Family and talking to parents who have concerns that their children were taking unemployment payments in an attempt to be `independent' in lieu of continuing of studies because of the level of income that they could get from Austudy. That is my research, and I spent all the first year that we were in government doing that in small towns, in big towns and in cities around Australia.
My officials have met with people too. When we opened the consultation process after it was announced in the budget in August 1996, Senator Vanstone and I had

"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-05,"—The work that has been done by my department has not gone to customer surveys, but it has gone to ABS data and to our own customer data.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-05,"—I thank the minister. Perhaps she might give us the ABS data which has been used in their predictions on the impact of these changes on families. Of course, existing ABS data puts people in specific categories. So that does not tell us what the impact will be on families—not just the dollar impact, but the likely impact on the extra stresses on families of young unemployed people. Quite frankly, what has been coming out from both what Senator Harradine has been asking and from questions from the rest of the Senate is that you are clearly admitting that there are at least one-third of families with young unemployed people who, at the very least, will not only be worse off but may also be worse off in real terms.
The statistic that was admitted last night is that those, for instance, on a total family income of $26,000 may be about $120 a fortnight worse off. If people are trying to cover mortgages and do the other things that families do, then I would expect that most families do not have—even on an income of $36,000—a slush fund where they could find $121 a fortnight because they are usually budgeting close to the limits of their income.
Have there been no social impact assessments, no statistical studies of that one-third of families who are likely to be worse off because of unemployment of young people? In effect, Minister, are you blaming not only young unemployed people but blaming the families of young unemployed people for 
 their young people being unemployed? It is a whole new way of looking at scapegoatism for young unemployed people.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-05,"—We are not blaming anybody for anything, and that is a cheap shot too. The statistics that have been used by my department in analysing the impact on the customer population have been largely drawing on the household income and the household composition of families. That is why I keep emphasising to you, Senator, that families in Australia are rarely have one unemployed young person. They are a mixture of young people at various ages and stages of life and stages of financial independence or dependence. Consequently, what might be a reduction to the family income for one of their children could well mean an increase in payment to that same family for the other one or two of their children, or more of course.
As I said the other day, for country families who have more than one child to educate, it is a terrible dilemma as to how they share the dollars available from that family income to allow all their children to have the benefits that they want for them.	This will make an important difference. So while you may focus on some bit of the package that you do not like, I say to you that parents see it as being beneficial across-the-board to them as a family unit because the level of support for students has not been adequate.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-03-05,"—I am now in a position to view the Labor amendment moved by Senator Carr. I want to suggest to the Senate that this amendment would be more appropriately dealt with in schedule 2 where it would, I believe, be more appropriately debated in conjunction with the Greens (WA) and Democrat amendments that also make changes to this particular section 1067A.
As I understand, the effect of this amendment is to reduce 25 as the age of independence progressively over time. I believe that the Democrat and similar Greens amendments suggest that, instead of having a cop-out progressively over time, you put in the age of 
 either 18 or 21 years. Our amendments deal with those particular alternatives. I would much prefer to deal with this under schedule 2 where most of the other amendments to this age of independence are being dealt with. Now that the amendment has thankfully been circulated, perhaps we can progress to the next amendment before us which I believe is from the opposition.
—We have to dispose of this amendment moved by the Labor Party so, if that was your wish Senator Stott-Despoja, we would have to have a motion postponing this particular amendment to wherever you suggest. I do not know whether the Labor Party are happy with that or not.
—We are happy to postpone it.

That consideration of the amendment be postponed.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1

(14)	 Schedule 1, item 6, page 29 (line 27), after ""times"", insert "", being places and times which are reasonable in all the circumstances,"".
The amendment moved in my name on behalf of the Democrats relates to the youth allowance activity agreements. The amendment is designed so that there is an inclusion about reasonableness when the secretary is giving notice to a person about places and times at which the youth allowance activity agreement is to be negotiated. We have moved this amendment in response to those cases where a person is required, say, to attend two interviews at the same time in different places or at a place which a person has no ability to get to. I raised examples of this previously in the debate.
Examples have been given to us from various centres—such as Welfare Rights—of when young people have been able to attend interviews at the Centrelink to which they have access only by public transport but have then been required, for whatever reason, to attend one which may be even geographically closer but is not necessarily easily accessible to them. I can think of a range of physical or other possibilities that may make travel difficult. We believe this amendment quite simply puts in a test of reasonableness and alleviates that problem.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-05,"—The amendment that Senator Stott-Despoja has moved is certainly reasonable. The irony is that we talking about how we can cut students down to the bone. We will be dealing with an amendment later about how the government is trying to reduce liquid assets in conjunction with the youth allowance to $2,500. So basically the ability to do things like fixing up a car and so on, if you had a car, might be very limited. It is not reasonable to suggest that there might be a technical requirement to attend an interview at a time which you could attend only by automobile if there is no indication that any of these allowances would provide for people to run their own car.
We have to be reasonably careful to make sure—when we are talking about such critical issues as how people survive and eat—that they are able to actually meet their technical commitments and that we do not have the minister coming in and boasting how many people she has thrown off youth allowance this month based on the fact that there may be people setting unreasonable times for interviews et cetera, and it is not technically possible to meet them. So I think it is very reasonable to suggest that there should be some humanity built into the system, which allows people to abide by the conditions set for them.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-05,—This is similar to an amendment which was proposed earlier. Senator Stott Despoja does assume that people can be made to take unreasonable steps to comply with requests. I did point out earlier to you that administrative law principles insist that requests and decisions be defensible. The department and Centrelink would not be in a position to deny that at all. So I think this amendment adds an unnecessary and ineffective addition to a provision that is clearly meant to be beneficially interpreted. The requirement in this case is for the secretary to let the person know when and where they are to attend to enter an agreement. I do not think it needs any further expansion.,SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-05,"—I think we must be totally imagining the increasing number of people who are ending up in the Social Security Appeals Tribunal these days. It must be totally our imagination that an increasing number of people are ending up with the Ombudsman—
—It is.
—Oh yes, we are imagining it, sorry.
—Table the figures.
—Yes, please table the figures. Basically, whether something is defensible or reasonable might end up having to be argued later on in some kind of appeals tribunal—for those people who know how to 
 go about appealing a decision which might be unreasonable. I do not think `Leave it with us. Trust us. We are the government' is a good way to think about it on this occasion. At the outset, we have to decide whether we are going to be fair in the way things are being addressed. Remember that yesterday the minister said this is not a punitive legislation. It is punitive if the non-attendance at some required interview ends up with a person losing their benefit. It is punitive if you have nothing to live on.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-05,"—I would like to answer that. I would not want you to misunderstand what I said to you across the chamber, Senator. I was not commenting on Ombudsman's figures, because I cannot remember them. But I do know that over the last many months the number of appeals to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal has diminished quite significantly. I put that down to a focus on much better decision making within Centrelink and a better review process within Centrelink. That is, after all, more humane and more beneficial to our customers than having to wait to get to a tribunal to get redress. If you are claiming that there are increased numbers of people going to the Ombudsman or to the tribunal, first of all, you are wrong about the tribunal. But, if that were the case, that would suggest that there is not a problem with people having an opportunity to get redress if something is wrongly done.

"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-03-05,"—The opposition will be supporting this amendment. I understand that we all hope that decisions are made beneficially, but unfortunately there often are disputes about the way provisions are applied. When there is a dispute, the employees of Social Security often will fall back to the absolute, strict, black-letter provisions in front of them. I suppose that is reasonable for someone in that position if there is uncertainty. In that situation, I think it is quite fair and reasonable to state very clearly that requirements must be applied in a reasonable way and to re-emphasise that point—a point that we would hope is already occurring, but unfortunately does not 
 always. This is an attempt to try to ensure that it will be most usually done in a reasonable way. I point out very clearly that, in the legislation, in the black-letter law, that is required.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-03-05,"—I will respond briefly to the minister's comments. I do not think that it detracts in any way or makes any unfair implications or inferences to simply add what I think are quite tame and reasonable words. If we look at the secretary's obligations in relation to `notice of requirement', we see that he or she has to state the places and times at which the agreement is to be negotiated. I think to add to that or to add specifically after `time' the words `being places and times which are reasonable in all circumstances', only value adds to this particular section of the bill. I did not put it in there because I want to be sneaky or to suggest that the government has nasty intentions. I do think it is quite a fair addition. I think it is probably in line with a number of other amendments that we have looked at in the chamber—be they in relation to notification in writing, having to outline the effects of non-compliance or be they even the 14-day period that we nominated. I think it is just one of those value additions that also adds to the reasonableness and the fairness of the bill. That is what we are all hoping to achieve.
Amendment agreed to.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-05,"—I move:
That the House of Representatives be requested to make the following amendment:
(9)	 Schedule 1, item 6, page 47 (after line 8), after subsection (2), insert:
	 Exception—full-time students
(2A)	 Subsection (1) does not apply to a person who is, or who is about to become, a full-time student.
This amendment exempts full-time students from the onerous liquid asset test requirement, and it also exempts students from the liquid assets test waiting period. Students often save considerable sums of money in order to pay for rent, books, computers, fees, transport, and to top up the miserable amount of money a 
 person receives on Austudy or youth allowance. It would be unfair for a student to be penalised for up to 13 weeks for being responsible enough to save money for their education. There are already income tests. There is already a number of other means by which a person's income is taken into consideration in relation to Austudy and youth allowance. I believe that it is not reasonable to impose this on a full-time student. We are looking at something as mean and miserable as setting the liquid assets test for a full-time student at $2,500, and for every $500 over that there will be another week's waiting period, up to a total of 13 weeks.
The reality is that the average cost of, for instance, a motor going in an automobile—if it is necessary for a student to try to run a car—can be close to amount. Any other major problems with health, transport or even accommodation may cost close to that. The legislation is trying to make people of all categories, including full-time students, as vulnerable as possible. Basically, it means that, at the secretary's whim, at the wave of a wand, a person's means of living can be given, taken away or reduced at any particular time. The minister has strenuously resisted clarifying the guidelines.
We have a situation where the liquid assets test for full-time students is set at $2,500. For some courses, this amount could be spent on books. For other courses, it could be spent on other means of getting around. What do you get for $2,500 if you are looking for a reliable means of transport? I really think this is not a fair amount to set it at. Perhaps if the government had set it at something like $50,000 or less it might actually have been realistic. I am suggesting that to set a liquid assets test and to say that a person will lose their means of support if they have anything more in the bank than $2,500—so that they have to run it down until they have no more than $2,500—is unrealistic for the needs of full-time students. We are asking for full-time students to be exempted.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-05,"—It might be helpful if I answered Senator Margetts's question at this stage, because obviously it 
 would be handy for senators to have some pieces of information. By way of introduction, the liquid assets test waiting period applies to other DSS allowances and ensures that people use their own resources before turning to income support. However, it should be understood that it only applies at the time of a claim and, therefore, if a person comes on to youth allowance and then, in the main study break for example, acquires some more liquid assets, they do not face a subsequent liquid assets test waiting period. That is the first thing that I want to make sure people understand.
The application of the test to all youth allowees provides fair and consistent treatment of all young people. We have tried to do that as much as we possibly can with this, although the income bank for students is a special entitlement for students. Senator Margetts, I particularly want to emphasise that the consequential bill contains changes to the liquid assets definitions which recognise the considerable costs of education.
Concessions are made so that students can deduct amounts for immediate educational expenses or one-off payments—for example, HECS debts—from the assessable amount of liquid assets. Examples of that could be—although this is not a complete list—fees, HECS, union fees, textbooks, which you mentioned, tools and equipment where that is relevant for study or training, and field trips. I am trying to give you the flavour of the sorts of payments that could be deducted from your liquid assets before the liquid assets test, as it applies to everybody else, would affect you as a student.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-05,"—We are going on a bill that obviously has not arrived—
—That's the definition.
—Yes. We are dealing with a bill which we were asking to have dealt with together with this one. Certainly, the Greens (WA) were asking that we did not deal with this bill without dealing with the other bill at the same time, but we are now being asked to deal with this bill as it is so far. You are also asking us to deal with a bill that has probably got a lot of 
 nasties in it and which may not get immediate support. It may have a lot of other things which may be very contentions and which may hang around in the ether for a considerable amount of time.
What the minister says is correct: it might be possible for someone to try to raise some money subsequently in the holidays and so on. However, the present situation is that it is going to be extremely difficult for someone at the outset to survive if they are required to reduce their liquid assets to such a small figure. For many people, $2,500 does not seem to be a small figure, but it is when you look at the cost of education.
The consequential bill does not exist yet and it is likely to be very contentious, so we do not know what the outcome will be. There might be some nicer bits in this bill—and we understand that there can be—but there are also some bits which I think many people are going to find very contentious. To suggest that it will be okay because something that comes in a bill subsequently might make this a little bit better is, I think, playing games with the lives of students.
I urge the Senate to support this amendment. If the minister comes up with a better definition of liquid assets at a later time then we could reconsider inserting this, but at this stage I do not think that is good enough. Over time, this government is saying to people on various kinds of social security that they have to run down either their savings or their superannuation to a very low amount, despite what they have done and what they have put aside over the years. I do not think that is a good principle.
It is certainly not a principle that the Greens (WA) have supported over time. The fact that your government is doing this in a number of other areas does no make it right—61 wrongs do not make a right, or whatever the number of occasions may be on which you are doing this to people and making them as dependent as possible. To me, it sounds very similar to the way people thought about themselves in the Great Depression when, basically, people had to prove that they were totally miserable and totally bereft of any support before they could go to the soup kitchens. Maybe that is 
 what we will end up with in this country: the worthy and the unworthy poor, soup kitchens, and people who have to run their assets down to almost zero, and then, at the whim of the secretary, some bureaucrat or the minister, find out whether or not they can continue to live. I do not think that is a good way to look at things.
If the starting figure were more reasonable, I am sure the Greens (WA) would look at it, but $2,500 as a total amount of assets in the bank is not a sovereign's ransom. I do not believe it is a reasonable amount to reduce to cut back the waiting period for assistance for full-time students.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-03-05,"—The subdivision relating to the liquid assets test waiting period is obviously putting in a waiting period for the youth allowance. Minister, could you clarify what the current situation is with liquid assets tests for other social security payments in terms of consistency across the act, particularly whether there is any difference between what is being proposed here and what currently exists for other social security recipients?",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-05,"—The clearest thing is to reiterate that the liquid assets waiting period which applies to Department of Social Security allowances means that people claiming income support may have to wait before they can be paid if they have access to readily available liquid assets. The liquid assets test for the youth allowance is the same as is available to all other allowances under the Social Security Act. We want to maintain that consistency.
However, as I said in my answer to Senator Margetts, we do recognise that the special needs of students in terms of such things as HECS payments, union fees or textbooks are essentially what they have accumulated liquid assets to meet, and they will be allowed for in the consequential amendments bill which all parties received last week. This legislation will not be implemented until the consequential bill is also passed. So the chamber will have not only my word for it but also the legislation in front of them to see the fine 
 print of the definition which I was just describing.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1
"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-03-05,"—The opposition will not be supporting this amendment. As you are aware, we have raised some grave concerns in many debates on the liquid assets test and various amendments have been moved in the past. But it is very difficult for us to justify the non-application of this particular test to students when it is being applied to everybody else.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-03-05,"—The Democrats will be supporting the Greens (WA) amendment. We are very concerned about the possibility of students running down their own savings before they commence study. I acknowledge the minister's comments on the consequential bill but, in the meantime, I believe that this is a much more appropriate exemption in relation to full-time students.
We are very concerned that the only liquid assets that many students have include that money and those assets that they have saved for the very purposes of their education—whether it is up-front or full-cost fees at TAFE or uni, HECS payments or incidentals such as equipment, books and other study materials. We are hoping that if people are truly and honestly wealthy, then they will be subject to other appropriate means and income tax arrangements. But we are not particularly happy with the bill as it stands in this regard and, for that reason, we will be supporting the Greens' amendment.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-05,"—I was just looking at the figures for every $500 over $2,500. For instance, if a person has liquid assets of $3,000 and let us just say, generously, that the interest rates on $3,000 were five per cent, that works out to be about $150 a year, and $150 a year divided by 52 weeks does not work out a lot on a weekly basis. The amount of money that is going to be deducted from a full-time student is not commensurate with anything like any income that would be earned from that extra $500.
I understand what is being said about the social security payments. As I say, the Greens 
 (WA) did not agree with those kinds of proposals being put into social security in that way because I believe it is once again blaming unemployed people for being unemployed or for being pensioners. But the amount of penalty is in no way whatsoever commensurate with any income that can be gained with an extra $500 available as interest. It really says that you have to spend this money and then, later on, it will kick in once you have spent that amount of money. It is like a fine. You will get a fine of the weekly youth allowance until you have spent the money. When, in fact, the income from that amount in the bank does not in any way whatsoever equate to the amount of fine that is being imposed.

I understand the Greens (WA) amendment seeks to delete entirely the common youth allowance being subject to that waiting period, whereas mine are a series of ambit and fall-back claims. Is that acceptable to the chamber?",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-05,"—I would be happy to move my amendment No. 10 first if the rest of the chamber concurs. That, obviously, is our preferred position. The indications from the Australian Democrats are that removing that provision is their preferred position. If the chamber concurs, I would be happy to put Greens (WA) amendment before the Democrats' amendment.
—Just to clarify: are you moving No. 10 by itself or Nos 8 and 10?
—Sorry. Yes, I would be seeking leave to move Greens (WA) amendments Nos 8 and 10 together.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the house of Representatives be requested to make the following amendments: 

(8)	 Schedule 1, item 6, page 46 (lines 7 and 8), omit paragraph 549(b).
(10)	 Schedule 1, item 6, page 49 (line 10) to page 50 (line 18), omit sections 549D to 549F.
I thank Senator Stott Despoja for that suggestion. There will be another amendment coming up later, which will be Greens (WA) amendment No. 32.
As indicated, these amendments simply delete that area, thereby removing the newly arrived resident's waiting period for benefits. There are many other checks and balances within this legislation, so I think it is already built in. It does not mean that people will be getting unfair amounts of money;  it means that it is not fair to make things more difficult for the families who have young people that are in education.
We are saying that, although people can pay tax when they arrive in Australia and although people can have all the responsibilities as soon as they arrive in Australia, anybody young who happens to be in a migrant family and who arrives will be penalised. I do think that is unfortunate, considering that we have no problem about taking tax from newly arrived residents. This has been a consistent approach from both the Greens and the Democrats, and I would seek support from the chamber.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-03-05,"—The Democrat position on the original bill back in 1996 was quite clear. We found the introduction of the two-year waiting period for newly arrived residents quite abhorrent. At that time we moved a series of amendments which, originally, were successful with the support of Senator Harradine and the Independents.
We sought to delete a number of benefits and payments from being subject to that waiting period because we found it quite a regressive and a punitive measure. It hit hardest at some of the most traditionally disadvantaged, some of the most powerless in our community. We include in that those young people who may be newly arrived migrants who may be applying for the com 
 mon youth allowance. We still find this particular measure a distasteful one.
We know now of many examples of not only young people but newly arrived migrants who have become homeless, who have had difficulties in sheltering themselves and their families, who have had difficulties feeding themselves, who have been unable to attend the AMEP language classes they have paid for because they might not be able to afford travel, or who have accepted exploitative work out of desperation. These examples go on and on. They have been made available to a number of senators and members in this place from various community and welfare and advocacy groups. So the government's impact, although it has not been examined either before this legislation was introduced when the coalition came into office, or since, has been extraordinarily negative from the reports from people on the ground, the people who actually know and the people who care.
The Democrats do support the Greens (WA) position. That is our preferred position, and has been for almost two years now. We do have other amendments that we will seek to move in relation to not only the inclusion of the common youth allowance in relation to this waiting period, but also the retrospectivity. I recall, when we had this debate back in 1996, that one of the biggest issues with the introduction of the waiting period was, in fact, its retrospective elements.
So we will seek to get rid of, or at least alleviate as much as possible, the retrospective nature of this waiting period, in particular in this legislation. I would have thought it was something that a coalition government would find equally abhorrent because I remember when they were in opposition that they were quite keen to delete any references to, or instances of, retrospectivity in law. Of course, it is a different matter when they get into office.
So we support as a preferred position the Greens (WA) requests Nos 8 and 10. If that is not successful—and the measure of support that the introduction of the two-year waiting period initially got from both the old parties suggests that this one may not be successful—we will continue to oppose the retrospectivity.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1
"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-03-05,"—I must say this unprovoked attack—the remark on the `old parties'—coming from the Democrat down the other end is quite disturbing. If I was not looking forward to reaching a little bit more maturity, I might take offence at that. I think the Democrats have gone through a few experiences over the last 12 months that will mature them.
—They are going to mature you too; trust us!
—So you, too, can be an experienced and mature party in the not too distant future.
On these particular requests, Nos 8 and 10, obviously the waiting period for newly arrived residents has been an issue that has been debated at some length. I have to say it was not an easy decision for the opposition. That having been made, except for the family payment, we would support the government in relation to this issue. We do not intend to change our minds for one group of the community, and that is students.

"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-05,"—I think that is a misinterpretation or a misunderstanding, Senator. The consequential bill is amending the date to make it absolutely clear that the two-year migrant waiting period applies only to newly arrived residents arriving after 4 March 1997. That was always the case, but the original provision, apparently, was confusing in that it referred to the whole period for which migrant waiting periods have applied. As you know, the six-month waiting period was brought in in 1993.
An extra provision is also being added to ensure that young people who would have qualified for payments before 1 July 1998 can still qualify for youth allowance after that date. That is also necessary because there are some variations in waiting periods for the payments being incorporated and it is not the government's intention that young people be disadvantaged just because they are not receiving income support as at 1 July.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-05,"—I want to follow up the question that was asked by Senator Bartlett because I am intrigued. A person cannot apply for youth allowance if they are under the two-year waiting period; is that correct? If they had, for instance, $10,000 in their bank when they applied, they were of that age and they were otherwise eligible, would their bank account be taken from the time they applied for youth allowance?
—The answer is yes.
—Therefore, it would seem that the answer you gave to Senator Bartlett may not be correct in that there is a double-whammy for newly arrived residents—they would have the two-year waiting period plus an extra waiting period after that if they had, for instance, $10,000 in the bank.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-05,"—If I misled you, Senator Bartlett, I am sorry. I am advised that you serve one and then, if you do have the liquid assets, you wait until they are complying with the existing legislation. I am sorry if I did mislead you.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-03-05,"—That is fine. Thank you for that clarification, Minister. Speaking further to the amendments, as senators would probably be aware, there is a further amendment right at the very end of proceedings—if we ever get there; another five or six pages of amendments away—relating to the waiting period and seeking to exempt special benefit from it. I will try not to double up on the arguments in relation to that.
As Senator Stott Despoja has outlined, the Democrats have a very strong opposition to the whole concept of the waiting period and we have made that clear. Despite that, we also have a fairly reasonably strong liking for the idea of consistency across legislation, which I think is important to recognise. These amendments would mean that different groups of people are subject to different aspects. But there are special reasons why it is appropriate, even given that caveat, that young people should be exempt from the waiting period—assuming that we are going to have it.
Other senators no doubt have received some correspondence from agencies and youth agencies out in the field that deal with migrants who have asked the Senate to exempt the youth allowance from the newly arrived resident's waiting periods because of the specific circumstances of young people. It is less likely that younger people will have the financial resources to be able to support themselves during their first two years in Australia. Obviously, many of them would come out here with a family, but circumstances can change. Whilst there are elements 
 in the existing legislation that attempt to deal with change of circumstances, I am certainly far from convinced that they are flexible enough to be able to catch everybody who does find themselves in hardship.
A lot of this bill relates to encouraging young people to have the wherewithal to adequately participate in education. So we would think it more crucial for newly arrived migrants than for anybody else to be able to quickly get into the education system and to develop their skills and their ability to be productive members of Australian society. We are really putting an extra barrier in their way in this measure by subjecting young people to the newly arrived resident's waiting period. If we are serious about encouraging young people into education and young migrants in developing their skills and being productive in Australia, then it seems totally counterproductive to put the artificial barrier in their way.
I hasten to add that the government's waiting period policy, which the Democrats are highly non-supportive of, is yet one example of many examples of a bad government policy being built on a bad initiative initially brought in by the previous Labor government, which showed the way by introducing the initial six-month waiting period. To that extent I suppose it is not surprising that the coalition jumped on the opening that the previous Labor government provided in that regard.
But that not does excuse the inappropriateness of the policy and it does not negate the importance of the basic argument which the government itself often puts of the need to encourage young people and to encourage newly arrived migrants into our education system. For that reason, the Democrats are very strongly opposed to the waiting period, but believe that there are special reasons why, even if we do have to live with this waiting period on other social security payments, younger people through the youth allowance should be exempt from it.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1998-03-05,"—Minister, when this matter was last being discussed—I am not sure whether it was outside the chamber or within the cham 
 ber, but it was in general conversation—I understood that the application of special benefits would be appropriate to deal with situations which were distressing and where considerable difficulties were being experienced. Clearly, that is not the case. That has not occurred.
—It hasn't been to the extent that it should be.
—As Senator Stott Despoja says, it has not been. The latest, of course, was the court case. I was told that the situation would be covered and that there would not be families in distress. There is a very strong argument that has been put by Senator Bartlett. All right, there are migrant families here who want to improve their lot and thus improve Australia. Some of them are very brilliant people who may not be able to afford to get into studies when in fact their doing so would not only benefit them but also benefit the whole of Australia. There is example after example of this. I understand the attitude of the opposition that it cannot deal with this piecemeal, but I feel that the government does owe the chamber a thorough explanation of what has occurred in this particular area over the last few months.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-05,"—I point out that we are not actually debating the special benefit amendment, which is Senator Bartlett's at this stage. To answer Senator Harradine now, I want to say to you, Senator Harradine, that the system is working as was intended. From memory, there are something like 350 people on special benefits in these circumstances now. I think you adverted to a couple of court cases recently. I cannot comment on those in detail because I am still getting advice about them but, as I understand it, the decisions in each case went to whether their circumstances had changed substantially since they came to Australia. That is when the special benefit for the two-year migrant period cuts in.
Examples are if their sponsor has died, if their sponsor has become bankrupt, if they have come to a job where the business goes bung and there is not a job when they get here or if they end up in a family where there 
 is domestic violence. There is a long list—I cannot remember how many items—giving the sorts of examples and the guidelines where clearly somebody's circumstances have changed since they arrived in the country. Approximately 350 people—that is my memory—are on that special benefit now. So I do not think we can say that it is not working. That is exactly as it was debated in the Senate when we had that debate a year or so ago. We are really not in a different position from what the Senate understood then.

We are now dealing with my amendments in relation to what we consider the retrospective nature of the application of the two-year waiting period for newly arrived residents.

Minister, you mentioned the consequential bill changes which change the date to 4 March 1997, which of course is the intent of my second set of amendments which I acknowledge we are not debating now. May I check with the minister. Presumably you will accept our amendments based on your earlier comments? That of course does not stop me trying to press ahead with the amendments before us—Democrats amendments 1 and 2 on sheet 857—which seek to ensure that this measure takes effect from the commencement of this act.

They still applied the two-year waiting period for newly arrived residents. It did not get rid of that particular regressive policy; it just made sure that it did not apply to the common youth allowance until the commencement of this act. I did not think that that was a particularly scary thought. I am sorry that it was only supported by the Greens and the Democrats, but I do thank the minister for indicating the government's support for the amendments before us, Democrats amendments 3 and 4.

That the House of Representatives be requested to make the following amendment:
(11)	 Schedule 1, item 6, page 52 (lines 4), omit ""8 weeks"", substitute ""2 weeks"".
What we are seeking to do in this amendment is reduce the penalties for non-compliance of activity tests in schedule 1, item 6. We are seeking to reduce that penalty, as I will keep reminding the minister. She said this is a non-punitive act, but there are penalties galore within this non-punitive act.
The penalty was eight weeks, and that is a huge amount of money for people who have no other means of gaining income. The penalty was eight weeks and we are asking for it to be reduced to two weeks. I do not think that is out of the ordinary. If you were to have some sort of commensurate penalty for anything to do with industry which was realistic, you would have the entire Australian 
 industry beating down the doors of government, as you would expect. In this particular case, sometimes the activity tests themselves may be onerous or there may be some technical difficulty in compliance. There may be some faults on either side, but I do believe that two weeks is sufficient penalty in what is considered to be a non-punitive act.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1
"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-03-05,—I just want to get a bit of clarification from the minister and maybe a bit of information about breaches of the activity test. I  suppose I would like to get a feel for what sort of breaches there normally are. Do you have any of those figures? What category are they? Are they normally failures to provide information or not taking up jobs? I just want to get a feel for the seriousness of the types of breaches that are most usual.,SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-05,"—My officials will quickly get that together on a piece of paper as best they can for you. We are talking here, as I understand it, about people who have already had two breaches, that was a rate reduction. You will recall that we debated these measures in the Senate a year or so ago and I did not proceed with the breach arrangements immediately. I do not think Senator Neal was the spokesman at that stage, so she may not be aware of what happened.
I withdrew the proposals we had originally for breaching penalties. I think it was Senator Harradine who asked whether the parties could go away, have a look at it and see if we could come up with an agreed position, so that is what happened. We put proposals to each other and we came up with arrangements for penalty breaches. Essentially, they were that, for activity test breaches—and these are not administrative breaches, which are the lesser offences, if you like—you would be breached by a percentage. I think it was 18 per cent in the first instance for 26 weeks, and then on the second occasion you would be breached for something like 24 per cent for 26 weeks. Then and only then were people to come off payment altogether.
That compares with the arrangement before, which was that people could come off ben 
 efits altogether first go. To be more humane, to see that the law was enforced as it was meant to be and to encourage people to do the right thing voluntarily without the harshness of losing all payment immediately, that was the agreed position and we brought it back and it was endorsed by your party. I cannot remember whether everybody did or not, but certainly it was done by agreement.
I think by reducing the non-payment period to two weeks, which is part of that arrangement—it is currently eight weeks—the deterrent effect is weakened. After all, we are talking about the deterrent effect on somebody who has had two warnings already and the penalty does then become almost meaningless. I think the current arrangements are fair. They have obviously been seen to be fair by other parties in the Senate, and it is within the power of young people to avoid penalties altogether by meeting the conditions of the activity test. This is the basis on which the taxpayer agrees to fund them and I do not think that is unfair, because you have to balance fairness in both directions.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1998-03-05,"—by leave—As I understand the result of the division that Senator Calvert refers to, it was ayes 34 and noes 34.
—It should have been ayes 33.
—I am sorry, but you just said there was no difference to the result of the division. I beg to differ. I think you have made an inaccurate statement to the Senate. 
I was informed by the opposition whip that there was a proposal from the government to recommit this particular division, and that was one that I readily agreed to. I think you would know, Madam Chair, that the opposition has consistently taken the view that we need to have the will of the Senate accurately reflected in votes of the Senate. I believe, and the opposition believes, that that is a very important principle. It did not take place, in my view, in relation to this division.
I accept, as I am sure all senators would, that there were mistakes made in that division. There were mistakes made, and we understand that these things happen from time to time. We also accept, by the way, that mistakes are made on both sides, which was the case in that particular division.
When you have a situation like that, the best thing to occur is for the whips to try to sort it out while the division is actually being counted. That did not happen in that particular division. That is the weakness. In fact, the acting government whip received instructions from Senator Campbell in relation to what ought to occur because, as I understand it, we had a situation where Senator Colston's vote was counted, and that was germane to the division result.
The government's original proposal for a recommittal of the vote is far more sensible and more proper in terms of the processes and procedures in this place than to suggest at the end of the day that a couple of foul-ups occurred that might not have made any difference to the vote. That is a much less preferred course of action. The voting in the division would have been different. In other words, it would not have had equal voting between the ayes and the noes. At the end of the day, I do not believe there would have been any difference in relation to the opposition amendment that was negatived. The question before the chair would still have been negatived. However, the votes would have been different.
This is an important principle. I am disappointed to hear the contribution of the government whip on this because, as far as the opposition is concerned, we believe that the will of the Senate ought to be reflected in 
 votes on the floor, and I think recommittal would have been a much more sensible course of action in a circumstance where Senator Hill missed a division and these other knock-on effects took place.
I am sorry the government has changed its mind in that regard. I do not consider that good practice. I do not think that is a good precedent, and it certainly will not be treated as a precedent by the opposition. If mistakes occur, if they occur on both sides or on either side—in this case I think there were mistakes on both sides—we should do it again so the whips get an opportunity to sort it out. That way we do not have a situation where there is an attempt on the floor to sort these issues out between the government whip and the Manager of Government Business. That is not the way we ought to behave in this chamber.
I would ask the government to reflect seriously on what I have had to say about the good sense in this circumstance of a recommittal. It is not good enough for the government to say that the result would have been the same, even though voting might have been different. We want to accurately reflect the will of the Senate so that there is absolute integrity in the Senate's decision making processes.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1998-03-05,"—by leave—Senator Faulkner is absolutely right. If the government is going to show propriety in this matter, the vote should be recommitted. The government needs to think this over. If it does not, it will be clearly seen to be breaching a public commitment about the vote of Senator Colston, and it will be clearly seen to have breached that because it was a politically important matter—that is, the government's commitment not to count the vote of Senator Colston can be breached when the matter is important enough and when it is convenient enough for the government.
Senator Faulkner is really offering the government the opportunity to hold good to its word. The opposition is saying to the government, `Here's an opportunity to keep 
 faith with your public commitment not to count the vote of Senator Colston.' That is what it boils down to. We can debate it all day, but that is how it will be seen.
I think it is a generosity from the opposition that the offer has been made, and I think all components of the Senate should ensure, as Senator Faulkner has put it, that the vote be recorded as we—and that includes the government—all want it.
Senator Faulkner says the outcome in terms of the legislative impact of that vote will not differ. That is all the more reason why the opposition should be congratulated for giving the government and the Senate the opportunity to recommit this vote and make sure it is properly counted, and that the actual wish of all sides in terms of how that vote is registered in the Hansard for good is how it is registered. I think the government is spiting itself if it does not accept this offer to recommit the vote. That is up to it. Let that be, if that is what the government wants.
—They are accepting it. I am not. The government wants to have it recommitted.
—Then let me say the same applies to you, Senator Harradine. You are a stickler for form in the Senate. You have always shown generosity in correcting votes when they are wrong. One only has to say, `Well, why not, Senator Harradine?' If you make this exception, where does it end?
There is discontent in the Senate with the vote as it is recorded because a mistake has been made on both sides. You would be true to form, Senator Harradine, if you allowed the matter to be cleared up. It would go counter to your form—and indeed your asseverations and strictures to me on many occasions in this place to show goodwill—if you yourself were not to show that goodwill and allow this vote to be recommitted, and allow yourself to be free of any contention that you, for whatever reason, may see political advantage in not allowing the majority in this place to express their wish that there be a recommittal of that vote.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-03-05,"—The Democrats will be supporting the Criminal Code Amendment Bill 1997 [1998] . I note that on 2 February 1995, in considering the Crimes Amendment Bill 1994, the Australian Democrats' former Senator Sid Spindler set out the issue. He stated:
One particular provision I would like to address is the so-called Majewski issue . . . that evidence of self-induced intoxication cannot be considered in determining whether the conduct was voluntary. The Standing Committee of Attorneys-General decided to follow the UK decision in Majewski (1977) AC 480 that evidence of intoxication can be used to deny intention or recklessness in offences of specific intent, such as murder, but cannot be used as an excuse in relation to simple offences of basic intent, such as assault.
This section, which is now being passed in the bills before the Senate, would place the Commonwealth in line with the law in England, Canada, the United States, Queensland, WA, Tasmania, and the Northern Territory. However, it alters the common law in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and the ACT, where gross intoxication may be taken into account in relation to all offences as a result of the High Court's decision in O'Connor in 1980. This is one of the provisions of the bills which was very carefully examined by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. While we express some concern about the change in law, the Australian Democrats have decided to support it.
The Australian Democrats still support this legislation. We also support the introduction of these provisions around Australia. I understand that the effect of these provisions, or these kinds of provisions, may mean that the prosecution does not need to prove intention where it is alleged that the accused was intoxicated.
I accept that this is changing the requirement to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused intended the act and that it was voluntary. However, I think all of us here today have had to weigh up this aspect of the bill against the effects of violent crimes in our society related to self-induced intoxication. The meeting ground is Majewski, which preserves the requirement for the prosecution to prove intention in serious crimes where civil liberties are significantly at risk.
I find this distinction a difficult one, probably a bit tenuous at times; however, I am reassured that this is an exceptional defence plea. It cannot apply in negligence cases, and it is not part of the offence in strict liability cases. Further, the accused could be subjected to civil actions where it is not necessary to prove criminal intent.
I am advised that the recent decision in the Australian Capital Territory—we all know now about a case involving a footballer who was intoxicated and assaulted three women, including his wife—would have been different under the law in this bill because the footballer would have been unable to use the particular evidence of intoxication as was used. The Democrats think that it is appropriate that that cannot be used.
I welcome a law which seeks to address this situation and I dearly hope that the remaining states and territories will enact similar laws very soon. However, I am also concerned that excessive self-intoxication is a social problem. We need to recognise that we have a responsibility to address social problems through appropriate community actions, which are not always or necessarily addressed by criminalising that problem. This provision, and similar provisions, must not become the remedy that we apply to drug and alcohol abuses which are linked with violence.
I should note that domestic violence is a significant problem in our communities, and it is one we must address. We have a culture of physical conflict solving and it is usually, or very often, women who become the victims. Intoxication is a component of much of this violence even though it may not end up in the courts. I believe that this culture re 
 quires attention, and the need for these sorts of laws is a flagging for attention.
The Democrats support this bill and I ask the government to consider further the social needs that make this law necessary. I should add that domestic violence and violence against women are only partly addressed by today's law.",SENATE,<title>CRIMINAL CODE AMENDMENT BILL 1997 [1998]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1998-03-05,"—The opposition also supports this legislation. The legislation has become necessary through the defence at common law established by the High Court in O'Connor's case. The defence ensures that those who may be criminally liable have an excuse for the offence if the offence was committed whilst the person was in such a state of intoxication that they were incapable of forming the intention to commit the offence.
This issue has raised a number of different aspects of a range of issues. The starting point with respect to criminality requires, in most circumstances, if not the overwhelming number, a specific intention. To that extent the High Court established the O'Connor defence.
The trouble is that the High Court's judgment was one of concern that was addressed by the previous government. It was addressed in a manner that really appreciated particularly domestic violence situations and appreciated that the defence at common law was too wide in terms of protecting many innocent people.
During the term of the previous government, the Commonwealth Criminal Code was developed and that code developed a situation which ensured that the defence of intoxication would be removed. However, in the interests of uniformity, the Criminal Code Act 1995 provided that all these provisions would not commence until March 2000. This has been brought on by the Noa Nadruku case in the most recent instance where Noa was availed of the defence of intoxication with respect to the charges in the Supreme Court of the ACT. At that time, the Minister for the Status of Women and the Attorney-General both criticised the ACT and any other jurisdictions which were yet to remove the defence of intoxication. They should have appreciated 
 that that defence was to be removed in a uniform approach across the country as part of the model Criminal Code. This matter has brought it on at a faster rate.
The opposition sees this legislation as bringing forward by two years an act which would have taken effect in March 2000. As I said at the time in response to the Nadruku case, there is no reason at this particular stage of the development of the model Criminal Code for this defence to be allowed to continue any longer. In that context, the opposition supports this legislation and recommends that the  Criminal Code Amendment Bill 1997 [1998]  be supported.",SENATE,<title>CRIMINAL CODE AMENDMENT BILL 1997 [1998]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1998-03-05,"—The Criminal Code Amendment Bill 1997 [1998]  is supported around the Senate and is a bill where the sense of outrage overcomes the logic behind the criminal law. It is a central concept in criminal law that people should only be punished for what they intend. The logic behind O'Connor's case and behind the defence of drunkenness is that a person who is so drunk that he or she cannot form an intention should not be punished for what he or she does. This bill makes an exception to that very fundamental idea that underpins the criminal law.
It is interesting to note that the defence of drunkenness is very rarely successful and today we are impinging on the criminal law to cure a matter that is not all that frequently successful. The thing that worries me is that if this were the beginning of a trend to punish people irrespective of what they intended to do so that the nature of the act becomes the thing that draws the punishment, then we are changing the criminal law in a very dangerous way. I sound that note of warning on this occasion. In the light of a particular case—it might have been more than one case—or in the light of very few cases, we have become so outraged that we are changing the basis of the criminal law in a particular respect and it would be a very dangerous trend if that were to go any further. In fact, it is a very dangerous trend as it is and is one that ought to be kept in check.
In my view, if we go down the path of a law and order campaign and, as a result of 
 that, do injustice to people, then our moral sense as people in a society which respects the moral basis for wrongful acts is usurped. Let us hope in the hereafter that we do not go to places of punishment for things we do not intend. Let us hope while we are still on this earth that we do not go too often to gaol for things that we do not intend.",SENATE,<title>CRIMINAL CODE AMENDMENT BILL 1997 [1998]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-05,"—I thank honourable senators for their contribution. From memory, I think Senator Cooney and I shared the same law school. I well heed the warning in his contribution. Of course, I also identify very closely with the comment that was made by Senator Stott Despoja that women around Australia have been very concerned at the implications for them from people who have taken action as a result of drunkenness which has led to a lot of pain, anguish and worry for women.
There are a lot of straws in the wind in any good legislating and a lot of issues to be canvassed. The relevance of the Criminal Code Amendment Bill 1997 [1998]  is really that it has support across parties. It is something that the country recognises is needed and I thank you for your support.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1998-03-05,"—I want to make a very brief contribution to the debate on the Flags Amendment Bill 1996 . I think the Senate will be relieved that the government has finally got its act together and brought the legislation before the Senate. It was introduced in June 1996 and passed through the House of Representatives later that year. It is a piece of legislation that has been in the ether for 12 months or more.
I think it is proper to say that this legislation is the culmination of work undertaken by the then opposition who, over a period of in excess of a decade, brought forward quite a number of private members' bills with similar objectives to the legislation we have before us. Given that circumstance and if it is of such importance and priority to the government, I am surprised that it has taken so long to come before us. Nevertheless, we do have a capacity to deal with it now. I think senators will agree that it is an important piece of legislation.
This legislation amendments the Australian Flag Act 1953 to require a vote by the Australian electorate for the Australian national flag to be altered and to ensure that the existing flag is one of the options that must be put to the Australian people. I am not entirely convinced that this legislation is necessary. Like the national song referendum in 1977, any sensible government would put such an issue to the Australian people and give them a voice. That is important in relation to the choice of the national flag.
It has consistently been the position of the Labor Party that, whatever occurs, it is essential that we have a thorough debate about the alternatives and that public awareness and involvement be encouraged to the maximum 
 extent. That will be very important in determining any possible alternative to the current flag. It is worth saying that the recent contribution by Ausflag has been useful in this debate about the flag. Frankly, I think it is very unlikely that any government would propose to change the Australian flag without the participation of the Australian people.
That is unlike the approach our forefathers took when the issue of the current flag was being dealt with. As many would acknowledge, for some in the community the issue in the debate over the flag has been the prominence of the Union Jack as the feature of our flag. This has been significantly debated in the context of an increasing number of Australians who are embracing an aspiration for an Australian republic. Naturally, people in the community do look at the issue of the appropriateness of the current design or a new design of flag. Some believe that a new flag could symbolise the Commonwealth of Australia becoming a republic.
I consider the move to a republic as the priority issue. I, along with many in the Labor Party, have argued pretty consistently that the issue of the Australian people determining whether or not we become a republic certainly ought to be dealt with before the issue of the flag. If it is the community's view that that should also be debated then that should be done after referendums are held in relation to an Australian republic.
I recall that on Anzac Day 1996 the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) made a commitment to this particular legislation. He said at the time:
The new Federal Government is to take action, as promised, to protect our great national symbol, the Australian Flag.
Legislation will be introduced early in the life of the new Parliament . . . to ensure that the Australian Flag cannot be changed without the approval of all of the Australian people voting at a referendum or plebiscite.
This will mean that no politician, no political party and no special interest group will be able to tamper with the design of our flag.
I have indicated that it would be a very courageous government and a very courageous political party that would suggest that the Australian flag be changed in any way without full public debate, participation, 
 consultation and a vote of the Australian people.
It is interesting to note that the rules that governed the competition for the design of the current flag in 1901 stated:
The Flag should be based on the British ensign, as the flags of the countries added to its fold, signalling to the beholder that it is an imperial ensign of the British Empire.
When the final design was chosen, interestingly enough, it had to be to submitted to the British government and—I remind the Senate—the British admiralty for approval.
I am certain that all senators in this chamber would believe that our flag is a very important, very significant—if not the most significant—symbol of our nation and our history as a nation. The arguments are presented to us that the Union Jack symbolises the history of the union of Scotland, England and Ireland. I would also point out that at no time has the design of the great flag of Great Britain been taken to its people. Its new design and ours were adopted without a referendum or plebiscite.
I believe the principle of the Australian people determining these issues is one of fundamental importance. I have indicated that the opposition does question the necessity for the legislation. In these circumstances and because I have great faith in the good sense of the Australian people on these issues—in fact, I have enough faith in Australian governments and politicians to believe that no-one would propose a course of action without that level of consultation and participation and that decision being firmly in the hands of the Australian people—
—I don't think the Left had their heart in this one.
—You would not know. I am in a much better position than you to judge that, Senator Boswell, let's face it. That is why you will just have to take my word for it, if that is okay. I have adequate faith in politicians and government to believe that this course of action would be an absolute requirement in any case. With those few words—assuring the Senate that I do have my heart in this contribution—I indicate that the opposition will be supporting the legislation.",SENATE,<title>FLAGS AMENDMENT BILL 1996</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,9,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1998-03-05,"—I support the Flags Amendment Bill 1996 , but I do so as a means of clearing the decks for action. I, like everybody else here, move around the country a lot and the feedback I get is that there is enormous interest in the prospect of changing our flag to bring us into the 21st century and to give us a flag which more appropriately reflects Australia at the end of 20th century rather than at the start of the 20th century. The opinion polls are changing. It is not going to be long before they will be reflecting majority support for that course of action. I am sure they would have already had there been a clear consensus on what the alternative should be.
The next thing for the government to do is commit itself to giving Australians an opportunity to take part in the design of a new flag which Australians can be proud of as we enter the next millennium. I think many Australians would feel that, for example, the Olympics would be a great time to have a new flag symbolising this country and for people to feel that Australia is no longer part of the British empire and secondary to anybody else but a clear, proud, independent part of the community of nations.
The question is: where to next? There ought to be government moves to give the designing of the flag to the people. The popularity of the Constitutional Convention shows that the Australian people want to be involved. We should now devise the means of allowing them to be involved. Those people who do not feel that a change in the flag is warranted or wanted at this time have nothing to fear.
My reading of it is that there is enormous interest in a new flag. You only have to see the reaction there is to newspaper and other media competitions or polls to allow people to vote on new flag designs to see how keen that interest is. Let us get on with devising a new flag—whether it is taking the current flag and simply removing the Union Jack and raising the Federation Star to complement and balance the Southern Cross to a new design. Let Australians take part in that process. Let the parliament take Australians into its confidence and start the process of allowing people to be involved in a move towards a new 
 design which is going to give Australians the feeling of distinction which the Canadians get out of their new flag. It has been many decades since Canada dropped the Union Jack and the confusing symbolism of its old flag. It is time we did the same.
I am an enthusiast for this. Not all those people around me agree. Many people feel that flags are of no significance. I note that it was stated in the second reading speech that the Australian national flag is our oldest and most important national symbol. It is not. The country itself, the nature of its land forms, its wildlife, its flora and its indigenous people are much older and more enduring symbols than the flag that has been with us for 100 years. That is a point to dwell on. There is much more symbolism about a country than the pennant which is taken up a flag pole on ceremonial and other occasions. It is nevertheless part of how a country identifies itself. It is time for change in Australia. I am an enthusiast for that change. I would inveigle the government to next think about how it is going to put this across to the people.",SENATE,<title>FLAGS AMENDMENT BILL 1996</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,9,1
"Boswell, Sen Ronald",NP,1998-03-05,"—As the National Party leader in the Senate, I wish to express the wholehearted support of National Party members everywhere for the Flags Amendment Bill 1996 . Under this legislation, the only way our national flag can change is by the express and direct vote of the Australian electors. No government, no matter what their numbers or their political colour, will be able to change the flag for whatever reason without referring it to the Australian people.
This bill will be greatly welcomed by those sceptical of the recent claims by republicans that they are not interested in changing the flag. It will be greatly welcomed by those sceptical of the Labor Party's intention regarding the flag. Our national flag is an important symbol of our country. It should not be vulnerable to the whims of political factions. This bill removes the Australian flag from being the victim of factional trade-offs. It removes the flag from the clutches of the wealthy elite who would turn our system of 
 government upside down and change the flag at the first opportunity.
It was one of my proudest achievements in this place when I moved a motion in this place to have two flags placed in the Senate chamber either side of the President's chair. There was a Labor government in power and there was a marvellous new building for politicians, yet there was no flag in the Senate chamber to remind us of who we are here to represent. It was left to the National Party to move that motion. Those flags have been with us ever since. The National Party will always stand firm to protect that flag.
The bill is a safeguard mechanism for a national icon. It restores ownership to the people represented by the flag. The Australian flag is the highest part of Parliament House. As we owe our position to the people of Australia so too should the flag. This bill sends a message that the heritage and symbols of our nation are not up for political sale. It guards against the faddishness and trendiness by trusting in the stability and commonsense of the Australian people.
From now on the flag will not be able to be toyed with by the likes of the Malcolm Turnbulls and the Janet Holmes a Courts of this world. Make no mistake, the Australian flag is under a lot of pressure. There is great wealth and power lined up against it. Mr Turnbull's company sponsored an exhibition of alternative flags. Mrs Holmes a Court has opened exhibitions of alternative flags put on by Ausflag—the group that wants to change the flag. Sponsors of the exhibition include multinational corporations and overseas companies spending money to change the Australian flag.
What should we expect next—a flag section in the multilateral agreement on investment? These are people and organisations of power and influence nationally and internationally. What hope is there for an old digger who wants to keep the flag he fought for if he is up against the elite? This bill is the hope. This bill is the digger's flag insurance against the chardonnay set. This bill is the equaliser. It sends a signal that the ultimate power within our system of government rests with the people. Wherever the flag is raised—from 
 prestigious international sporting events to humble scout halls—it can now be raised with a greater sense of ownership than before.
There have been attempts to diminish, belittle and undermine important parts of our heritage and even to rewrite history. This leaves people feeling great unease as their past is taken away from them. Certainty and identity are lost in an already changeable world. But with this bill, Australians can at least say, with assurance of compliance, `Hands off our flag.'",SENATE,<title>FLAGS AMENDMENT BILL 1996</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,9,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-03-05,"—On behalf of the government, I thank all senators for their contributions to this important debate on the Flags Amendment Bill 1996 . It has taken a lot longer than the government would have preferred for this bill to rise to the top of the Notice Paper . We are very pleased that it has come on today. To have a bill debated on Thursday lunch time—and I know Senator Conroy wants to go and have some lunch—
—I do.
—and so too does the Deputy President—requires all senators to agree that it be treated non-controversially. I think that sends a special message—particularly to those most vocal supporters of this bill—that senators from all corners of the Senate have agreed that it be dealt with on an entirely non-controversial basis, meaning there will be no divisions called. I think that sends a strong message. It shows that the government has carried through its important commitment to ensure that any potential change to a flag in the future will be dealt with democratically by all Australians.
I am particularly proud to have been given carriage of this bill through the Senate, having represented Australia in international competitions under this flag and my grandfather having fought in wars under this flag and indeed having the Australian flag draped over his coffin when he was buried. I know many Australians feel very strongly about the Australian flag. I know this legislation will make those people very happy. Equally, as Senator Brown has said, it gets the support of 
 those who genuinely seek change to the flag. It ensures that those people seeking that change will have that change facilitated when they can agree on some alternative proposal to the most beautiful flag that is our national flag at the moment.
Senator Brown did make the point in summing up that the government should facilitate some sort of competition for the design of a potential alternative flag. I do not think that is necessary. There has been over the years, through Ausflag and other organisations, a range of competitions. I presume thousands of designs have been worked out by artists and other enthusiasts over the years. I do not think any government involvement needs to take place.
I suspect that at some stage in the next 100, 200 or 300 years someone may come up with some alternative to our flag. It would have to be very good to attract my vote and to see consensus formed for it. That is all part of a vigorous democracy. National symbols are very important to a nation, nation building and democracy. I thank all senators—not only those who have contributed to the debate—who have agreed to make this a non-controversial and non-partisan issue in the Senate.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,1998-03-05,"—I wish to move a censure motion against Senator Bolkus. I want to do it straight after question time, and I have the appropriate motions in front of me. I do not want to do that if there is another matter that you, Madam President, need to deal with first, but I do want to deal with it before taking note of answers.
—If you wish to move a suspension of standing orders, you may do so.
—Why didn't we get the call here then?
—I have not called on motions to take note of answers. The procedure is that, at this point, I call ministers who stand up, who usually are giving additional answers and information to questions. I called Senator Vanstone. She now says that she wishes to move a censure motion.
—I rise on a point of order, Madam President. Senator Vanstone is the only minister on her feet. Surely, before you accept that Senator Vanstone can bypass any minister who wishes to add to their answer, you should first ascertain whether any minister wishes to do so. There is a clear case that one minister, Senator Kemp, at least should do so after that despicable display a moment ago. Surely you should establish that fact first.
—Order! There is no point of order. No other minister stood up other than Senator Vanstone.
—I will raise another point of order. You yourself have said you called Senator Vanstone because you thought 
 she was going to add to an answer. That is the reason for her getting the call.
—True. Correct.
—Normally you would take the noting of answers and then, if a minister wished to move a suspension, you would recognise and call them then.
—Correct.
—Senator Vanstone has the priority over Senator O'Brien, who was on his feet to take note, on the basis that, in your own mind, she was going to add to an answer.
—On the point of order, Madam President: I sought the call and received it. I indicated at that point that I would immediately move the motion. You would have had no option but to accept that motion. I simply did you a courtesy in indicating that, if you had something you wanted to say in relation to question time or whatever, you could go first. But the facts are that I was on my feet, I had the call and I wish to proceed.
—If there is a contingent notice of motion that permits the minister to do so, she may proceed at any time.
—Pursuant to contingent notice of motion No. 1 standing in the name of the Leader of the Government in the Senate, I move:
That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Hill moving a motion to provide for the consideration of a matter, namely a motion to give precedence to a motion of censure of the shadow Attorney-General (Senator Bolkus) for his unauthorised disclosure of a confidential court document relating to proceedings concerning Mr C. Skase.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—I am happy for them to speak to it, but I am conscious that people, on the other side especially, say that they would like to run this place efficiently. I am giving them the opportunity to agree to suspend standing orders and move straight to the substantive motion. If they do not want to do that, I will debate it.
—There are 30 minutes in which to debate the motion for the suspen 
 sion of standing orders, during which senators may each speak for a period of five minutes.
—It appears that that offer has been rejected, so I will speak to the motion. This is a very serious matter. Mr Skase left Australia under the Labor administration owing millions of dollars to small investors all around Australia. Labor, I have no doubt, did its best to get Mr Skase back, but it failed and failed spectacularly. Now we are in government, and we have confirmed that we are also pursuing Mr Skase's assets.
We have a situation where a member of this place, the would-be alternative first law officer of the Commonwealth, who had the opportunity over the last few days to admit this, has quite clearly used improperly or illegally obtained court documents. That is the first charge against him.
Not only has he used them, he has not revealed inconsequential material from these documents. He has revealed material which was relevant to the proceedings, and it is quite clear from the material that has been led through the chamber this week that he did so knowing the damage he might cause. The affidavit from Mr Donnelly that was in the Federal Court from which Senator Bolkus read to the media quite clearly indicated that Mr Donnelly wanted these proceedings to go ahead without Mr Skase knowing, and the Commonwealth was backing Mr Donnelly and making every attempt for these matters to be dealt with without Mr Skase knowing.
Nobody can deny that there is always a Skase story in the paper. Someone just has to think of a few million dollars, attach it to Skase's name and it will get in the paper. The  reason for that is the Australian community are sick to death of people like him doing that sort of thing, and they are interested in it.
But I know of no journalist who ran a story—prior to Senator Bolkus releasing these details from illegally or improperly obtained material—with any of the detail that Senator Bolkus released. What the journalists have done has been responsible. Some have indicated—and Senator Bolkus has indicated—that journalists have had this document, but the difference between Senator Bolkus and the journalists is that he used the document, he 
 encouraged the details of it into the public arena, but the journalists did not.
In doing this, Madam President, he tipped off Skase's advisers in Australia, and not only that we were after his assets. Mr Skase knows we are always after his assets. He has a trustee in bankruptcy. Mr Donnelly has been quoted as saying something like he thinks he will be Mr Skase's trustee in bankruptcy until one or other of them dies.
—Order! Senator Vanstone, this part of the debate should be focused particularly on urgency.
—Madam President, what I am trying to do—and I will come to the point—is indicate to you, with the background material, why it is urgent. We have over the last four days set out this case for all to see. At no time has Senator Bolkus taken the opportunity to apologise to Mr Donnelly. At no time has he apologised to the Senate. He has just proceeded as though he was on a decent footing.
The urgency is, Madam President, that we have a senator who has behaved outside of this place in a way that nobody in this place would ever let him behave. And he purports to be the alternative first law officer. In a democratic system where you have two major parties and sometimes other key players—in the Senate there are always key players—the alternative first law officer holds a position of some significance. By behaving in the way he has, he has brought this place, himself and his party into disrepute.
It is appropriate for this chamber to indicate to the community at large that we do not accept this sort of behaviour. It is not the way that senators should behave. It is not the way that first law officers should behave. If we do not deal with this today, if we do not make it abundantly clear, after all that we have heard this week, which has not been refuted by Senator Bolkus, that these are not the standards that this place will accept—not Liberal-Labor but this place as a whole—then the Australian community takes it that we nod to Senator Bolkus and say, `Oh, it's okay.'
Madam President, the pursuit of Skase is a matter that the government has an interest in, 
 that all Australians have an interest in, and they do not think it is okay. They are looking to this chamber to make that abundantly clear to Senator Bolkus as soon as is practicable, and that is today.",SENATE,<title>SENATOR BOLKUS</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,11,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1998-03-05,"—Thank you very much, Madam President. I oppose the urgency motion that has been moved by Senator Vanstone.
Madam President, if we ever needed any evidence of the coalition's inability and incapacity to adapt to the responsibilities of governing Australia, then I believe this stunt is it. Most people are aware that, traditionally in the parliament, censure motions have been weapons for opposition. They are not weapons for government. You are making a habit of it.
What we are told time and time again is that this government has more important things to deal with—perhaps like getting on with governing the country. But that, of course, as we know, Madam President, is beyond the capacity of those opposite.
I have to say that probably the government has made a tactical decision—`We need a bit of a confidence builder for Senator Vanstone because she was sacked from the Howard cabinet.' I have to say, Madam President, there are many decisions that Mr Howard has made that I do not agree with, but that is one he got right. Senator Vanstone was a failed minister; she deserved to be sacked, and this is just a confidence builder for her.
—Could I take a point of order, Madam President? I respectfully urge you to remind Senator Faulkner that this is a debate where he should be arguing against urgency.
—We are dealing with the question of urgency at the present time, Senator.
—I am making the point, Madam President, that one of the reasons this is proposed by the government now is that it is a confidence builder for Senator Vanstone who has had such a miserable and pathetic ministerial career for the past two years.
This is the same government that carries on, day in and day out, about alleged Senate obstructionism. This is the same government that whinges about their incapacity and inability to get their legislation program through the Senate. But what do they do? They bring yet another time-wasting stunt. They decide to run this particular censure motion on a Thursday afternoon, deliberately to take away from the small amount of time in the Senate routine of business—that is, general business—for opposition and minor parties, non-government senators, to build a case around important issues of public policy. Perhaps it is because of the issue that was proposed for debate today. Perhaps that is another reason why Senator Vanstone decided to put forward this very cheap stunt.
I have to say to the Leader of the Government in the Senate and the Manager of Government Business in the Senate that, after this, there can be no more of their usual carping and whingeing about the government's legislation program in the Senate. No more can there be any suggestions at the end of the sittings program that we should be putting our efforts into longer sitting days and more sitting weeks for the Senate.
If you are willing to put the Senate's time into this sort of time-wasting stunt from a failed minister for employment, education and training, then, on behalf of the opposition, I say to you, `Well, let the consequences be on your head because this is a cheap, miserable, political stunt developed by a failed minister to try to retrieve a bit of ground after an abominable performance as an office holder, as a cabinet minister, for which eventually even the Prime Minister of Australia caught up with her.' This is a pathetic, time-wasting stunt. The opposition will not support this suspension of standing orders.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,1998-03-05,"—We have just witnessed a half-baked excuse by a half-baked Leader of the Opposition as to why this matter should not be brought on. What is the urgency in this matter? Very clearly, it is this: there is no more serious allegation that can be made against a senator, let alone the would-be Attorney-General of this country, than to accuse him of leaking 
 Federal Court documents for no apparent reason other than what he perversely sees as his own personal aggrandisement.
The allegations that have been made each question time this week against Senator Bolkus have never been denied by Senator Bolkus. He has now had all week to come clean or make a denial. Therefore, this Senate is confronted, I would suggest, with a very strong prima facie case that Senator Bolkus has behaved in a manner which is completely unacceptable to the standards of this Senate. Therefore, we should deal with this matter by way of a censure motion as soon as the case has been built up to the extent that it now has been built.
One of the telling points of the half-baked contribution by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Faulkner) was that he failed to comment on the integrity of Senator Bolkus—not a single word of defence in support of Senator Bolkus. I must commend him on this: this is a tactic learned from Senator Ray. When he refuses to support a colleague, he will bag the government and hope that we forget about the colleague who is under fire. Let me say this to Senator Faulkner: we saw through that little tactic because you do not quite do it as convincingly as the should-be Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Ray.
We on this side accuse Senator Bolkus of acting somewhat deceptively in this matter. Senator Faulkner, in trying to make out his case, has also misled the Senate, because he asserted that the tactic we are using today is a tactic that should only be allowed to be employed by the opposition—rules that ought to be applicable only to the Labor Party and not to the government.
But how short his memory is. Do you recall the censure motion against my colleague former Senator Michael Baume? Senator Faulkner, you voted for it. Was it that you just forgot—a convenient lapse of memory, like Dr Carmen Lawrence's—or were you deliberately misleading this Senate, which your colleague who sits behind you is so blatantly guilty of doing?
In the past, the then Labor government in the other place also censured the now Prime 
 Minister (Mr Howard) and the now Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge). That was in 1995. So the only part of Senator Faulkner's contribution that had some ring of confidence about it was this allegation that it should be used only by oppositions. That argument has fallen flat because of the facts that I have just laid before this place.
What are we confronted with? We are confronted with a very weak argument by Senator Faulkner. The one area that had the potential for substance has been utterly destroyed and, as a result, there is no support for the arguments being put by the Labor Party that this is not a matter of urgency.
We will undoubtedly hear from Senator Ray in this debate. It really is sad that somebody who had the esteem and the seniority is now only ever making contributions in this place when there is mud to be slung or when trying to sledge a minister.
As I said at the outset, there can be no more serious matter than an allegation that a senator in this place, let alone the would-be Attorney-General, deliberately leaked information from confidential Federal Court documents, against the rules of the Federal Court, which had the capacity to sabotage and prejudice the taxpayer-funded pursuit of Christopher Skase. Senator Faulkner and the Labor Party are only seeking to defend Skase's mate.",SENATE,<title>SENATOR BOLKUS</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,11,1
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,1998-03-05,"—Over the years, censure motions are supposed to have been a very serious matter in this chamber. But one would have to say that their effectiveness has been debased by those on both sides of politics in the last 15 years when they have been thrown around like confetti. I have always had a great regret in my political life: I have never been subjected to one. Every time I go to my preselection panel, I have to say, `I appear as a failure before you yet again. The Senate has failed to censure me.' If only you blokes opposite would get your act together, clean me up, slap me on the wrist and censure me, at least I could walk tall before my own preselectors.
—This isn't a joke, Senator.
—Of course it is not a serious matter by those opposite; otherwise their behaviour today would not have been so puerile. It has been absolutely political and puerile behaviour from the government. But, if it were a matter of urgency, why wasn't it raised when Senator Vanstone answered a question three days ago? I can tell you why: that was a government business day. When it was raised yesterday and we were given the same repetitive answer, why wasn't it urgent then? Of course, it wasn't urgent then.
I will tell you why it is urgent today: because today is the day there is little government business left. Today is the day we have general business which is the time allocated to us, the Democrats, the Greens and others in which to put forward our views. So, cynically, this government has thought, `Not only will we jump into a puerile, opportunist censure motion, but we will also make it at the expense of the opposition, using their time.'
Senator Vanstone, I think in a previous answer, said this matter was in the hands of the Federal Police. Senator, have you not said at some stage that the leaking of matters associated with Skase is in the hands of the Federal Police? If so, have they reported or have you jumped the gun into an operational matter and want to prejudice their investigations here in the Senate by making a cheap, opportunist censure motion? Is that the case, that you as a government refer something to the Federal Police for investigation, that they have not in fact reported, but once again you jumped the gun with a censure motion associated with this? I wonder. We might hear one of your later speakers respond to whether this is before the Federal Police and whether you are jumping the gun in the Senate, doing your own lynch-mob mentality job, not leaving it to the professionals to investigate properly and establish the facts.
This government never hesitates to put leaks in the hands of the Federal Police, be it a leak from PM&C, as occurred recently, or a supposed one in DoFA. But when a key 
 report goes missing, such as the Kennedy report, it is not put in the hands of the Federal Police; it is referred to the internal fraud people to cover up. When two crucial documents disappeared from the Prime Minister's office on 11 April 1997, was there a police investigation? Was there any investigation? No, there was not. So we can have a Prime Minister get up in the House of Representatives and talk about the perverters of the course of justice only on the basis that his own office has deleted two critical aide-memoires that would clear the people he accused. They are the people who should be censored in this place.
This exercise is about precisely what Senator Faulkner said. We have a justice minister here whose portfolio responsibilities, whose staffing and whose image in politics have been massively reduced—not by us. We did not demote Senator Vanstone. We did not say to Senator Vanstone that she was no good. Her Prime Minister did so. Her Prime Minister demoted her out of cabinet. Her Prime Minister cut the then duties of the Attorney-General in about half and gave half to Senator Vanstone. She is suffering from deprivation of publicity and role in politics because she has gone from the second biggest spending department in the country to doing nothing. She is bored and she is demoted. So she gets into what I assume is a South Australian thing, a little South Australian feud, so that she can get her kicks over this particular issue.
If you want to waste the time of this parliament, you will be repaid in kind. If you want to take up our general business time, we will start moving urgency motions and MPIs every day. We have been responsible in giving you time, but if you want to waste the time allocated to us, you will get it back in kind.",SENATE,<title>SENATOR BOLKUS</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,11,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-05,"—Madam President, the timing of this urgent censure motion is indeed cynical, but I believe that it is an important issue. It is about whether or not a senator of this chamber, in their conduct as a minister, deserves the censure of the Senate. So whilst the timing is cynical, I am prepared to support the suspension of standing orders to hear the 
 arguments. I hope we get more arguments than some of the politics back and forth that we have had so far. I hope it can be done in such a way that it does not impinge on any current police inquiries. I think that should be possible. I am prepared to listen to the arguments of this important censure—in my opinion it always has been important; the Labor Party has not always considered that censures are important, but I believe they are—to find out what the case is really about.",SENATE,<title>SENATOR BOLKUS</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,11,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1998-03-05,"—I am going to vote against the suspension of standing orders. How I vote will not make any difference, of course, but I believe that there has not been a case made out for the suspension of standing orders today. If it was to be made out today, why was it not made out two, three, four or five days ago when the details were known?
—We have had a Federal Court letter today.
—Well without getting the Federal Court's letter, you know precisely what the rules are. Other honourable senators who are interested would as well. I wanted to make that point. No doubt it is necessary now for me to listen to the arguments. I am reserving my view on the subject until I have heard the arguments. I am just disappointed that the matter is coming on today. I had heard around the traps that there was something going on, but I have been otherwise engaged in connection with legislation and thus I will be voting against the suspension.",SENATE,<title>SENATOR BOLKUS</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,11,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-03-05,"—The Australian Democrats will be supporting the suspension. We do so because we believe this is a serious matter and we are anxious to hear the arguments which we believe should have a hearing. We are not really interested in the political debate but we are interested in the legal debate. We are concerned though that, if the government does have a number of censure motions in future, they might give consideration as to when these take place—especially if it is a Thursday afternoon, which is of course our only opportunity to have general 
 business. That is our main reluctance to support the suspension. But we will do so, in order to give what we consider a serious matter a hearing, and we will be listening to the arguments and then deciding on the issue.",SENATE,<title>SENATOR BOLKUS</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,11,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1998-03-05,"—No case has been made out this afternoon for an urgency motion on this matter at all. The speeches that have been given by the government have been speeches attacking Senator Bolkus. They have not been speeches about why this matter is allegedly urgent. Nothing that has been put forward says, for example, that the nation is in peril. We are not talking about the Gulf War or something of that level of magnitude. Nothing that has been put suggests urgency. Nothing has been put to say that if we deal with it exactly now something that is about to happen will change or be stopped. There is no urgency in terms of time. This is not a question that, if we do not act immediately, something will change. No case whatsoever has been adduced that that is true. Indeed, what Senator Harradine said before ought to weigh heavily with the minor parties and the government. If it is urgent, why wasn't it done sooner? Why did you wait until now? There is no case before this chamber that, if we act now, we will stop something. We will not.
Of course it is idle to pretend that there is something urgent. There is nothing that is leading the news tonight, nothing on the front page of any newspaper, nothing out there that is publicly notorious, that indicates urgency or significant importance. It is a joke and a political fix. That is what it is. We ought to call it by its real name and not engage in humbug and pretence that there is something urgent. It fails on all of these dispassionate tests. Is the nation imperilled? No. Is there something we can do to stop something? No. Is there something that is publicly notorious? No. Can we act to change events? No. None of these things suggests urgency. Everyone in this chamber knows that.
What do we have? We have a series of dorothy dixers this week to Senator Vanstone, so that she can have an unguarded rave 
 against Senator Bolkus because Senator Bolkus annoys her. That is part of politics, Senator Vanstone. If you can't stand it, get out of the joint. That is what politics is about, in part.
And why is the government concerned about Senator Bolkus? Last week a High Court judge stepped down from hearing a major case, because Senator Bolkus put in the public domain information that the government knew about and would not make available. As a consequence of that, a High Court judge stepped down. And who is the proponent in this case? Who is taking it? The government. That is, of course, a major setback for the government in that case. That is why Senator Bolkus must be stopped now—not because of any other matter of public urgency, but because he has acted in the public interest to make information available to the judiciary that the government knew about and did not reveal.
So let us cut out all this cant, humbug and pretence of urgency or of a substantive issue here. There is no substantive issue here. The matter should be dealt with on the voices and dismissed, and this chamber should go about its business. What the Leader of the Opposition said is true: the most frequent refrain from the government is obstruction. Who is obstructing now? The government. The business of the Senate should proceed normally and not be obstructed. If we hear another peep out of you lot about obstruction, we will quote back to you, chapter and verse, the events of today, because that is exactly what you are doing. I know the vote is coming shortly. I think we are just about out of time. I ask those that have declared themselves to pause again and think: what is urgent; what cannot wait until next week; what cannot take its place in the normal batting order? Nothing here is in that category. Do not lend yourself to a slimy, grubby manipulation of the program.
—Order! The time for this debate has terminated.

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1998-03-05,"—by leave—Yesterday the Minister for Trade and Deputy Prime Minister of Australia, Mr Fischer, tabled his second outcomes and objectives statement for the trade portfolio. I have described this statement as a bland and visionless document. I will demonstrate why that is so in a moment.
But, first of all, can I say in reply to Mr Fischer's statement yesterday, the leader of the Labor Party in the House of Representatives, Kim Beazley, did say that he regarded Mr Fischer as being at least one of the people on the government's side who was trying his best to open markets for Australia and congratulated Mr Fischer for the work that he was doing. I would like to join with the Leader of the Opposition on those personal remarks about Mr Fischer.
The problem for this statement, however, is that, for the first time, it is an admission by the government that the Asian currency crisis will affect the level of economic activity in Australia. Page 25 of the statement says:
Lower export earnings will affect domestic activity through their impact on sectoral incomes (eg, lower corporate profitability and higher input costs). This will flow on to domestic spending. The consequent slowing in output growth will affect employment, though not until later in 1998-99, given the lags between output variations and employment. Any reduction in employment growth will adversely affect household incomes. In addition, both the direct impact of developments in Asia and the associated impact on sectoral incomes could affect business and consumer confidence, though these effects can be difficult to quantify.
So there we have the first official statement by the government about the types of effects the crisis will provoke in this economy. We do not have any detail about the timing except that it will be 1998-99. We have no detail about the depth of those effects on corporate profitability, on economic growth in 
 the nation and on household incomes and the contraction that this report foreshadows will occur there, making life more difficult for Australian families. We do not have any figures from the government about how many jobless will be created and added to the long queue of unemployed in this nation because of its inability to deal with the impact of this crisis.
We have asked the government to make that information available. They have not. It is important that they do move quickly in this area. We know from figures tabled by the Australian Bureau of Statistics just this week that, over the last 12 months, the current account deficit in this nation blew out by 23 per cent—23 per cent in the current account deficit in 12 months. We know from the same figures that the foreign debt this nation holds now is a record. We hold $222 billion in foreign debt, the highest level of foreign debt this nation has ever had.
We recall, though, that during the last election campaign the government ran the debt truck up hill and down dale and saw it break down in promising to the Australian community that they would rein in foreign debt. It is now at a record level. It has never been as high, and the forecasts are that it is expected to balloon further.
We know as well from the national account figures published yesterday that economic growth has undershot the forecasts that were anticipated. Already, before the Asian currency crisis hits this economy, the growth levels for Australia are much lower than anticipated, and the levels of economic growth for the nation for the two years thus far of Liberal government are below the average for the entire 13 years of Labor government.
So we have a situation in which the promise of growth, employment, higher profitability and the reining-in of foreign debt is not being kept by the government. That is why it is important that we get on the record what the impact of the Asian currency crisis will be so that Australia can form in its mind the right policies and apply an action, the appropriate measures, for dealing with the impact of that crisis. While this report admits it, it does not give the detail. It is important that 
 the government answers those questions and does so swiftly.
Let me turn to some of the things in this report that I have criticisms of. In the area of trade promotion, this report does not adequately report to the people of Australia, as the minister promised it would when he said that he would impartially and fairly present the facts. This report does not refer to the fact that the government has not done a number of things, which has undermined trade promotion in Australia.
Last year we saw the Howard government decide that it would not fund Australia's presence at the year 2000 World Trade Expo in Hanover, although that is the Olympic Games of world trade promotion. In the end it gave in. Sir Llew Edwards, who is promoting the Gold Coast for the venue for the year 2002, managed at last to persuade the government that, if we are to encourage Australian exporters to get into the international marketplace and display their wares, they should at least be at the premier world event and that Australia should be an active bidder to attract that event to Australia.
We saw as well just last month that Australia did not participate in Milia 1998, the multimedia expo held in France on 7 February. Over 50 countries were represented at the expo. Over 10,000 potential buyers did attend, and Australia was not present in any official way. We did not have a stand. This is in the area of IT—information technology.
It is not as though we are running a surplus in information technology exports. The deficit in IT&T for Australia currently stands at around $4 billion, and it is predicted to blow out to a level of $20 billion by the year 2000. This is the biggest industry for the future. Australia chose, however, not to be in the biggest event in which we could display our wares to the world marketplace and pick up important custom for our struggling IT&T sector in Australia. That is not referred to in the report either.
One of the other things that is not referred to in the report is the National Trade and Investment Outlook Conference. This was a stunning success. In 1995, the National Trade and Investment Outlook Conference succeed 
 ed by independent audit in attracting $1.04 billion in new investment for Australia and $2.02 billion in new export potential. In 1996, it succeeded by independent audit in attracting $592 million in new investment and $3.4 billion in new export potential. Why would you not hold that event, given that we know that we are losing markets in Asia because of the downturn in those economies? Why would you not strive to attract more industry to Australia and more investment and export opportunities for Australian companies?
The National Trade and Investment Outlook Conference was cut for budgetary reasons. We spent $1.3 million on it to attract $3.4 billion in exports, but the government made it as a budgetary cut and handed it over to the private sector. There will be an International Herald Tribune event run next month. We know from internally leaked documents from the Department of Industry, Science and Tourism that that event is proposing to charge the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism $125,000 for a speaking spot at that conference and participants up to $900 to attend. So much for the promotion of Australia. The report does not refer to that. These are opportunities forgone and chances to build our national income and trade profile.
In the area of exporter support the government in its slash and burn budget of 1996-97 cut the export market development grants back quite dramatically. It topped them up a little in its industry statement before Christmas, but still this nation will lose up to about $30 billion because of the amount of support cut out of industry in promoting Australian small business overseas. The export market development grants are the premier way in which that is done. These grants have been independently refereed by respected econometricians to see what the earning rate is. For every public dollar put on the barrel head, how many dollars do we win in the private sector in new markets? We know that this is the single most effective way of attracting small business into the international marketplace.
It is vitally important they be there to defend the markets that are going down on them in Asia. It is vitally important that they 
 be there to find new prospects. It is vitally important that they travel to places like South Africa, India, Russia, the Czech Republics, Latin America, Mexico and others where they need to find more markets. Is the money there to support them? No, the scheme is capped so that they cannot use that chance to win access.
There is a range of other matters that could be properly canvassed. The big gap is the vision for the future. Where do we want to take this nation in trade? The routine things are talked about. The big challenges are ignored. There is a lot more that could be done. It is a poor report in that respect.

"Brownhill, Sen David",NP,1998-03-05,"—by leave—I want to make a few comments regarding the statements made by Senator Cook in relation to the Trade Outcomes and Objectives Statement  tabled yesterday by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Tim Fischer. We have already acknowledged, Senator Cook, that there will be an impact from the Asian currency correction. Offsetting that currency correction is strong growth in our domestic economy, with private investment and consumption at healthy levels.
The reason for that is that we have corrected the $10½ billion hole in the budget that you gave us when we came into government. Had we not corrected that we would have actually been more vulnerable than we are now to the Asian currency crisis. If we had not tackled that deficit our exporters would not have the secure base now in which to operate. If we had not restored the economic fundamentals, our exporters would not have been as competitive as they are—a fact that exporters in Australia acknowledge.
It is not just on the domestic front that the government has been active and successful in improving Australia's trade effort. Indeed, 1996-97 was a record year for the export of Australian goods and services with exports totalling some $105 billion—an increase of 6.2 per cent on the previous year. It was not 2.5 per cent as stated by you, Senator Cook, 
 or the Leader of the Opposition in the last few days.
The reason the government has been so successful in leading Australia to record export success is that it has actively pursued trade strategies at the bilateral, regional and multilateral levels. Unlike your government, Senator Cook, this government has aggressively pursued bilateral trade strategies which have opened up new markets for Australian exports of rice, sugar, citrus and financial services. It is a fact that we have done it. It is on the record. The market development task force established by this government will continue to be a key element of our bilateral strategy in 1998.
On a regional level, Australia will continue to advocate economic reform and open trade policies which will be even more important in light of the economic developments in Asia. The government will continue to play a leading role in APEC in pushing hard to accelerate the early liberalisation of the 15 priority sectors in which we have vital trade interests. The government has also made substantial progress on the multilateral front. Next month, Australia will be hosting a major meeting of the Cairns group in Sydney to advance multilateral agricultural reforms and build momentum for a new comprehensive round of trade negotiations by the year 2000.
Contrary to your comments, Senator Cook, and the statements that you have made, the government and its agents have acted quickly and effectively to support Australian exports to the region. I will remind you of these measures, because you know we have done them; you know in your heart of hearts that we have done the right thing. We have had involvement in the IMF's support packages for Korea, Thailand and Indonesia. We did that very quickly. We are providing up to $300 million in short-term credit insurance for exporters to Korea and similar assistance on a case by case basis for Indonesia.
We are tightening the anti-dumping laws—something that you did not do anything about. We are doing something about labelling products so that the Australian people can buy, and know that they are buying, Australian made products. We are continuing to push 
 for further trade and investment liberalisation to open up new markets for Australian exporters. Through Austrade's branch of trade exporting facilities, we have helped Australian firms to hold their positions in the affected markets and increase penetration of new markets outside the region. We have established an Austrade Asia help line for Australian exporters. Just for your benefit, and for the benefit of any listeners, that phone number is 1300 368 225. That was done quickly, and it helps.
We have increased trade with Iran by about 71 per cent; with Egypt by 51 per cent; with South Africa by 31 per cent; and with Mexico by 24 per cent. They are not bad figures when you think about it; not bad figures at all. You said also in one of your media releases—and I think you might have said it in question time today—that we should be conducting seminars for Australian businesses to help them to understand the impact of the developments in Asia. That is exactly what the government is doing. We are holding Austrade seminars on the Asian situation in all major capitals. We are having trade round tables for exporters from rural and regional areas all around Australia. They have been very fruitful and very fulfilling, having regard to the feedback we have had from exporters on how they have seen the situation.
Another mistake that you made in your assertions here today concerned the National Trade and Investment Outlook Conference. You said that it does not exist. It does still exist. It has been renamed as an Australian summit. So it does continue to exist.
—It doesn't.
—I am afraid it does, Senator. I take you up again on another area where I thought that you would have given a little more thought to things. You said on 3 March, in your criteria for the second statement, that it must satisfy certain credentials to be credible. I am pleased to say that the statement meets the criteria for your standards of credibility. Look at your media release of 3 March and see what this statement says—it satisfies everything you asked for. 
In a press release on 4 March, Senator Cook, you said that the government should have reformed the EMDG scheme. You made mention of it again tonight. You said it should benefit small and first-time exporters. You know—you took part in putting through the legislation—that that is exactly what we have succeeded in doing. We have brought down the level of the criteria to get into the scheme to $20,000 instead of the higher level which you had implemented. That has been helpful. If you had read page 7 of the transcript of Mr Fischer's statement which was tabled yesterday, you would have realised that that was exactly what the government did when it amended the EMDG Act last year.
This government has been creating an environment for Australian exporters to be winners, not trying to pick winners, as you always tried to do. It is only through putting in place a competitive domestic economic framework that Australian exporters will be competitive and our exports will grow. We have low interest rates, low inflation and an economic climate which allows labour market reform and reform of the waterfront to occur. This means we can compete with others in the world who are competing against us.
If you read the Trade Outcomes and Objectives Statement put out yesterday by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, I think you will find that the right things are being done for the trading environment in Australia and for our exporters.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Trade Outcomes and Objectives Statement</title>,Ministerial Statements,14,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1998-03-05,"—With regard to the annual report of the Department of Industry, Science and Tourism, I note that, because of the way in which the estimates were conducted last week and, indeed, this week, very little of that department's business was able to be dealt with. One of the matters which took up the time of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee during the estimates hearings was the evidence of Mr Gillespie, who is an officer of the Department of Workplace Relations and Small Business.
As a result of that evidence, I have caused a letter to be sent to the Clerk and he has responded. In that letter I drew the attention of the Clerk to certain responses that were given to questions by Mr Gillespie and the Clerk has recommended a certain course of action. I have forwarded the correspondence to the secretary of the committee with a view to the committee reconvening, subject of course to its own decision, to allow matters of conflict between evidence previously given by Mr Gillespie and evidence which was given last week to be further tested. I understand I have agreement and I now seek leave to table the correspondence which I sent to the Clerk on 4 March and his response on the same day.

"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1998-03-05,"—The reports by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, namely Report for 1996-97 on the operation and effect of the Native Title Act  and Report for 1996-97 , were both signed off by Michael Dodson. It is a sad thing that he is no longer the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner. Indeed, it is a sad thing that his brother Patrick Dodson has also lost the position that he held at the time that these documents were prepared. The Dodson brothers have great genes within their bodies. They are both outstanding Australians. I want to talk about Michael Dodson and explain why it is sad for Australia that he is no longer in the position he held at the time of signing off these documents.
I remember at the bar there was a great advocate, Ted Laurie, who was a person with an incisive intellect and a great understanding of human nature. He knew the minds and souls of people and knew them well. In addition, as he told me one day, he had the ability to cry. What he meant by that was, not only did he have great learning, a great mind, a great intellect and insight but also he had the ability to feel compassion and empathy and had a deep sense of wanting to help others. He had a real hunger for justice, if I can use the language of the beatitudes.
Michael Dodson is a man like Ted Laurie was. He knew Ted Laurie. Michael was at the Victorian bar when I was there and when Ted Laurie was there, and he would understand the reference. Michael Dodson is a man who has connections with Victoria. He went to school there, played football there and was at the bar there. On this occasion, on the basis of the two reports which he signed off and have come before the Senate tonight, I want to acknowledge him and his great contribution to Australia.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,1998-03-05,"—I wish to speak on the report of the Senate Community Affairs References Committee on housing assistance. That report was tabled at the conclusion of the business of the Senate last December, and this is the first opportunity that honourable senators have had to address the content and recommendations of the report. I can say that it is a report of substance and certainly not from a group of bagatelles.
As I said in my tabling statement earlier this week, the committee took evidence and submissions on this topic right throughout 1997. At all stages of the committee's deliberations, there was extensive interest in the progress of the committee's work. The committee received over 300 submissions, re 
 ceived evidence from some 47 organisations and some 82 witnesses, and inspected a number of community organisations in Canberra. Many of those submissions were lengthy and of a high quality. Certainly they could not be described as being mere whiffle. I particularly refer to quality submissions from the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute, the Australian Institute of Family Studies, the National Community Housing Forum, the Australian Council of Social Service, the New South Wales Department of Urban Affairs and Planning, the New South Wales Department of Housing, National Shelter, the Community Housing Federation of Australia and, finally, the Department of Social Security.
The submissions and evidence from representatives of these organisations or agencies were notable for a range of different reasons. Some of those reasons in the reports were that they contained considerable intellectual rigour supported by useful economic analysis of a particular argument, the outlining of philosophical viewpoints, and the benefit to the community from part or whole adoption of a particular course of action. There was succinct evaluation of other submissions, often putting a contrary viewpoint to that of the majority of submissions received by the committee. The objectives of different states which have implemented responsibilities in the area of public housing and public housing assistance were outlined to the committee, particularly by New South Wales.
In total there were some 24 recommendations. Whilst all recommendations of committees are important, some do have more consequence than others. In this context, I identify recommendations 1, 5, 6, 11, 19, 21, 22, 23 and 24 as being of particular note. Those nine recommendations fit neatly into three subgroups: firstly, recommendations of current levels of public housing stock and adequate planning for the future, recommendations 1, 5, 6, 11 and 19; secondly, the importance of community housing and community based organisation, recommendations 21 and 23; and, thirdly, the role of finance and the private sector in the ongoing provision of low cost housing, after lengthy discussion, recom 
 mendations 22 and 24. I now wish to address briefly each of those subgroups and offer a few comments.
The first subgroup of recommendations goes to the issue of public housing itself. In the postwar years, the social role of public housing has been both essential and critical to the ongoing development of this nation. Paragraph 2.5 of the report outlines some of the historical developments that led to very high levels of home ownership in this nation, and the committee notes that those housing policies have served well the majority of the population of Australia. In this context, recommendations 1, 5, 6, 11 and 19 highlight the critical role of public housing and its maintenance at minimum of current levels, the need for ongoing research and the worth of proper planning and accountability measures.
The second subgroup of recommendations, recommendations 21 and 23, go to the role of the community housing sector. Community housing is defined in the report from one of the submissions as being `publicly subsidised non-profit housing which is not publicly managed'. The report goes on to state:
The two most common forms of community housing are housing cooperatives, in which new tenants take full responsibility for all of the management decisions related to the properties under their control: and secondly, housing associations, in which tenants are encouraged to participate on a board of management, which in turn takes responsibility for that housing decision making.
Chapter 6 of the report outlines the benefits of a continuing role for community housing. Those benefits may be summarised as it caters to niche markets, single parents with children, disabled persons and those in need of support services. Community housing develops, as its name suggests, a sense of community within the affected community. It offers choice for those of a low income with special needs. Considering the background, recommendations 21 and 23 are particularly appropriate.
The final subgroup of recommendations are those numbered 22 and 24, which address the role of the private sector and accessing of finance. In this country, as in most OECD countries, we will shortly enter a sustained period of oversupply of capital in worldwide 
 markets. In a recent edition of the Economist there was a table of future likely bond issues by national governments. The table demonstrated that a range of OECD national governments are, in an unprecedented fashion, reducing their issues of debt. Because of this, there will be significantly less demand for government bonds. As governments dramatically reduce future issues of debt, balance budgets and the like, the price of capital—that is, interest rates—will also decline as we have seen it do in this country in more recent years.
With less competition in capital markets, continuing increases in national savings pools and an overall decline in interest rates, there will exist an opportunity for other players to enter the market and secure long-term bonds at low interest rates to fund their particular cause, interest or whatever. In this context, recommendations 22 and 24 have particular immediate appeal as they, if given effect, will facilitate the entry of community organisations into capital markets.
Work obviously needs to be done with a range of financial institutions to work out the details of appropriate packages that will suit the varying needs of a range of financial institutions. Those institutions are obviously going to be looking for security for their investments and guarantees of returns over 10-, 15-, 25- and 30-year periods if they are going to be issuing bonds that are going to be utilised to fund the development of community housing. In this context the discussions at paragraphs 6.37 and 6.56 set out a number of signposts which might assist the entry of a range of players into this market.
In summary, as my earlier tabling statement this week says, the committee believes that all governments need to investigate ways of facilitating private sector involvement in low-cost housing and of increasing the capital available for all those housing projects. Current national government policies of massive debt reduction and likely reduced future bond issues do give an opportunity for new methods of low-cost housing development. In conclusion, I commend the report to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Community Affairs References Committee</title>,Committees,17,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-03-05,"—I would also like to speak to the Senate Community Affairs References Committee report on housing assistance, which was tabled in the break between sittings. It is a report of substance, as Senator Bishop, the chair of that committee said. It took over 300 submissions and had three fairly extensive days of public hearings in Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra. It is a pity it did not get up to Queensland and into the regions a bit, but I recognise that you cannot go everywhere.
Housing is obviously a fairly fundamental and crucial need. It is an issue that I think does not get as much attention from governments at all levels as it should. It is something that impacts fundamentally on every Australian at the most basic level. There are lots of issues in the housing area around Australia that need addressing and this report has identified a good number of them. In the short time available to me I will not be able to go into full depth in relation to all that is contained in the report, but I would like to highlight a few issues that come from it.
One of the issues, which was touched on earlier on today as part of the motion that was debated during general business, relates to the Commonwealth-state housing agreement. In recent weeks before the Senate resumed sitting I spent a bit of time travelling around regional parts of Queensland and meeting with groups involved in the housing area, the people involved at the coalface who are having to work with the real issues that are facing people.
It is very clear that there is a lot of concern in the non-government housing sector in relation to even just the direction of housing policy in Australia. At one level there can be criticism about the content of the policy, but when it is not even clear what direction it is going in, then that is a great cause of concern for those people who put so much time and effort and so much of their lives into trying to assist people in the area of housing.
The lack of clarity about the direction of the Commonwealth-state housing agreement is something that is of great concern. That spills over into things such as funding—reliability of funding, the scope of funding for 
 various organisations and the adequacy of funding, whether it meets the needs that are out there in the community. I think all those issues are of great concern to people working in the non-government sector in the housing area. I am sure that a lot of those concerns were raised during the committee hearings that were held. They were certainly raised with me in parts of Northern Queensland.
In Cairns, for example, I was fortunate enough to attend a meeting of the local Cairns housing network. A lot of those sorts of issues were raised—not just the adequacy of funding but the adequacy of assistance from levels of government and the inability of government to understand the needs of the community and the needs of the community sector in working with people in the housing area. Whilst things can never be perfect, I think there is a long way to go in terms of recognising and giving the community more flexibility to address the needs that are there. I think the committee's report identifies some of those issues and goes some way towards addressing them.
I would like to draw attention to the minority report of my colleague Senator Lyn Allison, who was the Democrats' representative on this inquiry. The Democrats initiated this inquiry into housing assistance at the end of 1996. We believed that the model of housing reform proposed at the time by the Howard government would not address the growing housing crisis within the community.
I hope this report does go some way towards developing a greater recognition about the need to change directions. Certainly there has been a lot of changes since that time at state and Commonwealth levels in terms of the direction of housing policy, partly in terms of deciding not to go down a particular path but not necessarily being much clearer about what other paths we will go down instead.
The issues highlighted in the Democrats minority report relate to the area of Commonwealth-state responsibilities and, again, the Commonwealth-state housing agreement. It is an essential framework for a national housing policy. The Democrats strongly believe that, for that policy to operate 
 at its maximum effectiveness, we really need a more clearly defined nationally agreed housing strategy that has clearly defined proposals and specific outcomes. This would help the Commonwealth government not only in terms of its responsibilities at the housing level but also in terms of having more consistency and clarity of the focus of housing policy across the states.
The majority report incorporates what the Democrats regard as the central features of such a strategy, which would include the continuation of the Commonwealth-state housing agreement and recognising that both levels of government have an important role to play in that. However, we are concerned that there is no specific framework which unites all the various factors into a single, comprehensive and cohesive national housing strategy. It is still somewhat disparate and fractured. The Democrats believe that that can be a hindrance to a housing strategy and a housing policy that has maximum effectiveness.
One of the recommendations in our minority report is the establishment of a housing task force to assist with the development of a national housing strategy, particularly recognising the important role that local government can play, as well as the community sector, in both policy development and implementation of a housing strategy. Whilst it may not be appropriate for local government or local government associations to be a formal partner in the Commonwealth-state housing agreement—and its involvement is by no means uniform across the country and its input in the housing area varies enormously—we certainly believe that, if local government did have a strong involvement in the development of a national housing strategy, this would be a great contribution to a clearer national housing strategy.
As part of that, there is always a need for consultation with the community. As I mentioned just before, one of the strong issues that kept coming up at a meeting with housing groups recently in northern Queensland was the disconnection that the community and people working on the ground in the community feel with not only the development of 
 housing policy but also the implementation of housing policy and the sometimes inflexible and unhelpful implementation that occurs through the state government housing departments.
Certainly, there is disquiet in terms of the changes in Queensland with the Queensland government in relation to the operation of public housing in that state—changes which will affect people in terms of having not only to pay higher rents but also reduced security of tenure. Obviously, security of tenure is very much a crucial issue for people. There is nothing much more important than feeling secure about your own home, and it is something that the Democrats believe needs much greater attention.
Similarly, residential tenancy laws in the private rental sector vary enormously from state to state and across the territories. Again, the Democrats believe that we should be setting a national set of benchmarks. I believe the report also touches on this area in terms of agreed standards of tenant protection across the states and of having not necessarily uniform legislation but uniform bottom line protection which all legislation has to embrace.
I would like to mention briefly another issue concerning private tenancy which also came up at the consultations I had in Rockhampton as well as Cairns—the issue of privacy and the development of tenant databases. I believe it is something that is going to be a growing problem. As the Senate would know, the coalition came into government with a commitment to extend privacy legislation to the private sector. It has decided not to go down that path now. Some of the problems with not doing so are arising and this is one area where I think problems will arise more quickly than most.
Basically, privately operated tenancy databases that record so-called bad tenants exist now—a tenant black list, if you like. People can be put on these lists without their knowledge, sometimes completely unjustifiably. They can then have major problems in accessing rental accommodation, often not even knowing why they may be having a problem. They have no legal right to access their 
 information, even if they are aware that they are on those databases. They have no right to demand the correction of incorrect information. That is something the Democrats are greatly concerned about and something which we believe needs more attention at both the state and federal level. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,1998-03-05,"—I wish to speak on the report of the Senate Community Affairs References Committee on housing assistance. That report was tabled at the conclusion of the business of the Senate last December, and this is the first opportunity that honourable senators have had to address the content and recommendations of the report. I can say that it is a report of substance and certainly not from a group of bagatelles.
As I said in my tabling statement earlier this week, the committee took evidence and submissions on this topic right throughout 1997. At all stages of the committee's deliberations, there was extensive interest in the progress of the committee's work. The committee received over 300 submissions, re 
 ceived evidence from some 47 organisations and some 82 witnesses, and inspected a number of community organisations in Canberra. Many of those submissions were lengthy and of a high quality. Certainly they could not be described as being mere whiffle. I particularly refer to quality submissions from the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute, the Australian Institute of Family Studies, the National Community Housing Forum, the Australian Council of Social Service, the New South Wales Department of Urban Affairs and Planning, the New South Wales Department of Housing, National Shelter, the Community Housing Federation of Australia and, finally, the Department of Social Security.

"Watson, Sen John",LP,1998-03-05,"—Tonight I wish to take a few moments of the Senate's time to discuss the question of airline passenger security—a matter very close to the hearts of honourable senators because we spend a lot of our time in the air. Australia is a signatory to the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation. The convention agrees on world international airline legislation in order that international civil aviation may be developed in a safe and orderly manner and that international air transport services may be established on the basis of equality of opportunity and operated soundly and economically.
Australia is not obliged to put any of the legislation in place for domestic air transport. Countries make their own judgments on what legislation is to apply domestically. Over time, Australia has chosen to implement some legislation domestically, particularly in relation to large aircraft. On a cost versus risk basis, it has been a decision of successive governments not to take security measures down to small aircraft. Whilst most senators would applaud airline passenger screening as an anti-hijack measure and passenger baggage reconciliation as a standard anti-sabotage measure, few senators would be aware of the passenger numbers to which these regulations actually apply.
The Air Navigation Act 1920 as amended determines that on domestic flights passenger screening only applies if a regular public transport aircraft is fitted to carry 100 passengers or more. The security systems for screening and clearing passengers and airline personnel travelling from major Australian airports have been in place since the mid-1980s. The last hijack occurred in 1986 and the official viewpoint is that screening has had a significant deterrent effect since that time. Travelling from regional Australian airports, some operators have chosen to implement the screening of passengers and their possessions but others have not. In these instances, up to 100 passenger could be technically at risk.
Similarly, the Air Navigation Act 1920 as amended determines that carriage of baggage regulations apply to an aircraft fitted to carry 38 passengers or more. Under section 22C(8) of the act, if a person whose baggage has been accepted by an aircraft operator to be carried on board an aircraft has disembarked from the aircraft or has not boarded the aircraft, the operator of the aircraft must remove the baggage from the aircraft before the aircraft starts its flight. This section therefore applies only to aircraft fitted to carry 38 passengers or more and prompts the observation that legislators believe it is all right to blow up fewer than 38 people but more than that number is not on.
Sabotage is presently unknown in this country. With greater risk from exposure as 
 a result of world events, Australia must consciously work to ensure that this perfect record remains intact. The Sydney 2000 Olympic Games are almost upon us. It would indeed be prudent to review the regulations applying to airline passenger screening and passenger baggage reconciliation before the massive influx of people expected for this event of international significance where terrorist activity has, unfortunately, carved a path into its history.
I take this opportunity to welcome a re-evaluation of the floors pertaining to passenger numbers under sections 20 and 22 of Air Navigation Act 1920 and recommend that they be reviewed downward, especially in the light of the strengthening international focus on Australia and Australia's increasing significance on the world stage.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Airline Passenger Security</title>,Adjournment,18,1
