"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2003-09-09,"—The Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002 contains a series of five schedules of various amendments to communications legislation. I propose to deal with the schedules in turn. Schedule 1 adds a new section 54A of the Australian Communications Authority Act 1997 to allow a definitions determinations made under subsection 54(1) of the ACA Act to apply, adopt or incorporate materials contained in other instruments. While the government and Labor see this as a minor technical amendment, especially as the provision already exists under the Radiocommunications Act 1992 and the Telecommunications Act 1997, some concerns have been raised by others about this particular bill. 
For example, the proposed amendment would override the Acts Interpretation Act and has the potential to introduce uncertainty insofar as it could permit the incorporation of any material that may change or does not exist at the time of making. Examples of non-legislation instruments cited in the proposed amendments include international technical standards or performance indicators and written agreements or writing made unilaterally. The Bills Digest, for example, refers to an observation by Professor Dennis Pearce that the Victorian Acts Interpretation Act 1994 does not permit the time-to-time reference to other instruments unless they are expressly permitted by the empowering provision. In other words, amendments to the incorporated instruments must be notified, tabled and available for inspection at the department administering the regulation. Pearce argues that this is essential for community consultation. 
In the past, this government has utilised an alternative process to that proposed by Professor Pearce. In the case of the provisions in the Radiocommunications Act, the minister gave an assurance of an extensive consultation process with industry. I would certainly ask the minister in this particular case to provide a similar assurance in respect of the amendments to the Australian Communications Authority Act.
Schedule 2 of the bill contains provisions exempting the Australian Broadcasting Authority, the Classification Board, the Classification Review Board and the Office of Film and Literature Classification from the operation of the Freedom of Information Act in relation to specific documents that are likely to contain either offensive content which is the subject of a complaint to the ABA, or information which would enable or would be likely to enable a person to gain access to that offensive content on the Internet. The Democrats, on balance, do not support this schedule.  
The Democrats have a long history of supporting freedom of information. Senator Murray, for example, introduced the Freedom of Information Amendment (Open Government) Bill 2000 [2002] as a private senator's bill in 2000 and then introduced an updated version in 2003. Senator Murray's bill attempts to give effect to the changes recommended to the Freedom of Information Act by the Australian Law Reform Commission and the Administrative Review Council in their joint report of 1996. The bill proposes to establish an independent Freedom of Information Commissioner to oversee and monitor the act; alter provisions to promote a pro-disclosure approach; broaden the scope of information that can be accessed under the act; create a fairer, more reasonable fee structure, abolishing many existing fees altogether; reduce the time limit for processing FOI requests to 21 days; and require that education strategies be developed and implemented to inform government agencies of their FOI responsibilities.
The Democrats would certainly urge all parties to support the major provisions of Senator Murray's bill when it again comes before us and to uphold the principles underpinning the importance of freedom of information. We believe that freedom of information is a democratic imperative. Unless citizens have the power to access and independently scrutinise government information, there is little prospect of having a genuinely deliberative and participatory democracy. Freedom of information opens government up to the people. It allows people to participate in policy, accountability and decision-making processes. It opens the government's activities to scrutiny, discussion, comment and review. It is a public right and is in the public interest.
Schedule 2 of the Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002 goes against the very reasons why we have freedom of information. I must admit that this is an on-balance decision, but there does appear to be very little evidence of a problem and, therefore, the need to exempt these agencies from freedom of information. In our view, every agency should be subject to FOI unless there is a clear overriding public interest. My understanding is that from the 1999-2000 financial year, when the online content regime was introduced, to the 2001-02 financial year, only two FOI requests had been received. It is more appropriate for the agencies listed under this schedule and the tribunal to undertake to determine the appropriateness of disclosing information on a case-by-case basis, as occurred in the Electronic Frontiers Australia Inc. v. ABA case, rather than grant a blanket exemption from FOI, as is being sought here. Let us do it case by case and appropriately, rather than simply determine that we will start frittering away the FOI net. 
Schedule 3 of the bill makes a number of amendments to the Radiocommunications Act to allow the Commonwealth, state and territory law enforcement and anticorruption bodies to use licensed radio communications devices for covert surveillance to gather evidence in serious criminal and anticorruption investigations. Whilst we are always somewhat concerned about any extensions to these sorts of powers, the Democrats believe that on balance these particular provisions are supportable. 
Schedule 4 of the bill seeks to abolish the specially constituted Australian Communications Authority, which was set up to consider carrier applications for facilities installations permits. Given that in the four years of its operation no such applications have been made, and the government has indicated that any residual responsibilities will be undertaken by the ACA, the Democrats will be supporting this particular schedule. 
However, the Democrats have concerns about the current regulatory environment for the installation of mobile phone towers, a matter on which we have campaigned for some seven years, particularly in relation to health effects and environmental issues. Controversy has arisen over the basis of the standards because these rely on placing a safety factor on the least amount of radiation which increases body temperature. There is a long-running dispute in Australia and elsewhere over the adequacy of existing radiofrequency standards. Objectors claim that radio-frequency radiation can disrupt biological systems in ways other than by raising the temperature. Various experts have agreed that at least it is still not possible to say that exposure to radiofrequency radiation, even at levels below international guidelines, is totally without potential adverse health effects. Concerns have been raised that, given the possible risks, mobile phone towers should not be situated adjacent to community sensitive areas such as kindergartens, day care centres and schools. In 2000 the United Kingdom produced an expert report called the Stewart report, which recommended, in relation to macrocell base stations—or mobile phone towers—sited within school grounds, that the beam of greatest intensity should not fall on any part of the school grounds or buildings without the agreement of the school and parents.
While local government planning procedures involving community consultations appear to be strengthening their hold on mobile phone tower siting, there do not appear to be firm policies or regulations for exclusion zones on health grounds around sensitive sites, particularly ones that reflect the current level of community concern. Instead, reliance is mainly placed on international and national radiofrequency standards, which aim to set a safe minimum exposure for members of the community. As I have already emphasised, these standards are still being debated, and many acknowledge that health risks are still present. As a result, many communities in Australia are not happy with mobile phone towers being built in their neighbourhoods, especially when they are next to sensitive sites.
While the recent ACIF code in Australia requires carriers to have regard to community sensitive sites for smaller, low-impact installations, it does not go far enough in terms of requiring carriers to consider alternatives to minimise radiation risk to the public. And, as recent cases in NSW and Victoria highlight, the courts are taking an increasingly restrictive view of what carriers are allowed to do in terms of their exemptions under the Telecommunications Act. The NSW Court of Appeal, for example, upheld the right of the Hurstville Council to prevent the construction of a mobile facility at Oatley Park which the carriers had claimed would be a low-impact facility. However, it should not take three court cases and a loophole in the Telecommunications Act for a local authority to be able to defend the right of a community to prevent a mobile phone tower being built in a community park.
More recently, in the last two weeks, we have seen the Victorian State Director of Public Housing win a major case for the siting of a mobile phone tower facility—again claimed to be low-impact—in a public housing complex. In that particular case the court again found that the exemptions granted under the Telecommunications Act should be read as narrowly as possible. We will see these matters tested again shortly in Queensland, where the Noosa Council has rejected a mobile phone siting adjacent to the Federal State School, a decision currently being appealed by Vodafone.
Obviously there is, coming out of those court decisions, an increasing awareness that the community has a sensitivity about mobile phone sitings and that the provisions of the Telecommunications Act which allow normal community planning processes to be overridden should be read as narrowly as possible. The Democrats will be submitting amendments that will give the ACA, upon application from a carrier for a permit, the power to reject absolutely the siting of mobile phone towers adjacent to community sensitive sites without community approval. Our wording will follow broadly the wording of the ACIF code for low-impact facilities and will apply it, essentially, to facilities of national significance. It is a small start. It closes one further loop within the act which, as has been said, has not been used to date, and it will ensure at least that we are getting the message out that this parliament takes seriously the siting of mobile phone towers near community sensitive sites. I would hope that, should this provision pass the Senate, we would then be able to start putting pressure on state governments to reflect a similar provision in the final part of the loop, which would be the high-impact facilities which are currently subject to state planning approvals. 
Schedule 5 of the bill amends the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act, and seeks to allow the minister to vary the way contributions are made to the national relay service, vary the terms on which payments are calculated by approving a changed calculation formula and grant general exemptions for certain kinds of persons. The Democrats will be supporting this as a fairly non-contentious schedule.
In summary, this bill contains three schedules which are largely non-controversial, one that goes too far and one that does not go far enough. From that point of view, we will be supporting its second reading and proceeding with some amendments during the committee stage.",SENATE,<title>COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2003-09-09,"—I was interested to hear Senator Cherry, a Democrat senator, say that this was a matter of consideration, in other words, that it was an `on balance' decision that they have made in respect of the schedule of the Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002 relating to FOI, and that there would have to be an overwhelming public interest issue to have the Democrats vote for it.
One of the greatest public interests and public issues is protection of children. We have just come from outside Parliament House, where we were demonstrating for National Child Protection Week. What is of great concern to many people is that, besides being physically abused, children are being abused by child pornographers and others. I do not excuse a number of the ISPs in that regard. This is a vital issue, where children are being exposed to pornographic and other types of abusive material.
It was only in March, I think, of this year that the Australia Institute reported, in a paper called Youth and pornography in Australia, that 84 per cent of boys and 60 per cent of girls in the 16- to 17-year-old age group have had accidental exposure to Internet sex sites. That is a grave reflection on us all, and we have to do something about it immediately. I asked Senator Alston at the time what was proposed to be done about this. Senator Alston responded, quite correctly, that the ISPs have some responsibility. It may well be, if they do not accept their own responsibility, that there will need to be legislation requiring ISPs to have an effective filtering technique which will empower the parents or other carers to make sure that children are not exposed to this material. In fact, the report of the Australia Institute indicated that there should be such a requirement on ISPs. The report also highlighted the degradation of women in Internet pornography. It stated: 
... one can easily find portrayals in Internet pornography that embody forms of violence and themes of subordination and degradation. Perhaps the most pervasive form of degradation of women is the common use of derogatory language to describe the women pictured and the sexual acts done to them.
I listened to what the Labor Party spokesperson said last night just before the adjournment. I now have the printed copy of what Senator Lundy said and, going through it, I can only describe her contribution in one word: carping. It seems that all the alternative government of Australia is going to do is just have carping criticism without giving any real alternative to what is being proposed. The Australia Institute recommended that action be taken to require ISPs to have effective filtering—not some of the technology that they have now. Frankly, some of the ISPs are not really interested in doing anything about this problem, because the more that people get into the abusive pornography that is around—accidentally or otherwise—the more money they get in their pockets. We have to have a very good look at that.
I have been critical of the Australian Broadcasting Authority. I have asked questions of them on almost every occasion that we have met in estimates and their responses are very revealing. But on this particular occasion the ABA are clearly concerned that, in order to protect children and others, they need to have the power that is being proposed in this legislation. I too have frequently defended the rights of the Australian public to freedom of information. I have gone out on a limb on a couple of occasions in respect of the matter, but here I believe there is an overwhelming public interest matter involved.
Senator Lundy in her speech referred to Electronic Frontiers Australia. Of course, what Senator Lundy did not say is that Electronic Frontiers Australia are the spokespeople of the porn industry. If Senator Lundy wants to take a leaf out of their book, she should go for it, but the shadow minister has to come up with alternatives; otherwise she is failing in her duty not only to her colleagues in the Labor Party but also to the people of Australia. Let us hear from the Labor Party before the day is out: what is the Labor Party proposing to do about this?
In her speech, Senator Lundy said that there is still a need for public investment in educating and empowering Internet users. That will go down pretty well with a single mother of two teenage kids who has to work late and knock off at six o'clock at night! Something that will empower people includes this recommendation for legislation requiring ISPs to have an effective filter; that is the way to go. In the meantime, the Australian Broadcasting Authority needs to do far more monitoring of Internet content than it does at present. I recommend that, together with the undertakings that were given by the minister at the time, immediate action be taken.
People are very concerned about their children. This material is a type of abuse against children. As we were told at the gathering outside Parliament House today, in the last 12 months there have been 138,000 reported incidents of child abuse. Child abuse has many forms, of course, and one that is least recognised but talked about quite frequently is this type of child abuse—letting the pornographers and the ISPs make their money through this sort of abusive activity. We all must now direct our attention to the problem and make it a priority. We ought to commit to that this week, which is Child Protection Week.",SENATE,<title>COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2003-09-09,"—I too want to speak to the Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002, particularly with regard to the aspect of it that relates to the prospect of freedom of information applications being prohibited—that there will be an exemption within the scope of this bill for aspects of investigation and scrutiny. I take particular issue with some of the things that Senator Harradine has said, and I would like to comment on those. Firstly, it is patently untrue, it is false and it is wrong to say that Electronic Frontiers is the voice or a front group for the porn industry. That is blatantly untrue. 
—That is the Lions Found-ation.
—The Lions Foun--dation?
—No, you set up a silly body in opposition to the Lyons body.
 (Senator Watson)—Order! Senator Greig address the chair.
—The minister wrongly interrupts. `Front group' is the wrong term. The spokespeople for the porn industry, if that is the term you want to use, are the Eros Foundation. They are the legitimate, recognised body and that is their role and function. I am sure Senator Lundy has met with them, as I have, to hear their issues and their concerns. I do not agree with them on everything, but they do speak for the legitimate aspects of the adult industry. 
Electronic Frontiers are in part a civil liberties group. Their role and function through their literature and their web site are to monitor, scrutinise and keep the public aware of movements and opportunities that governments take to impose increased and unnecessary censorship in areas, most particularly in information technology. That is at the core of what we are dealing with in relation to the freedom of information aspect of this legislation.
On the plane coming over from Perth for this sitting fortnight, I was reading a new book called Snatched: sex and censorship in Australia by Helen Vnuk, which has recently been published and was launched in Sydney just a matter of days ago. It is a very interesting read, giving a snapshot of the way in which censorship has increased significantly under this government over the last few years and the way in which that censorship is creeping into Internet technology, web sites and online access generally. On page 43, Ms Vnuk states—and I recall the debate:
On 1 January, 2000, legislation came into     effect—
that is, Commonwealth legislation—
that was aimed at banning sites with the X or RC (refused classification) material and restricting sites with R material to adults only. It was widely seen at the time as an attempt by the government to get the support of conservative Tasmanian independent Senator Brian Harradine.
Whether you agree with that or not is not the point. The point is that the legislation came into effect and the idea behind the legislation was that people would make complaints about sites to the Australian Broadcasting Authority, the ABA, and the ABA would then hand them on to the Office of Film and Literature Classification, the OFLC, to pass judgment. If a site, which was hosted in Australia, were judged to be X or RC, the ABA would issue a take-down notice. If a site were hosted overseas, the ABA would tell the makers of Internet filtering products about the site. Internet service providers are supposed to offer these filters to their users. Ms Vnuk goes on:
The legislation had two major effects. First, it encouraged Australians hosting adult sites on local servers to shift to overseas servers, diverting Australian money into America's information technology industry. Secondly, Australia was branded worldwide as the global village idiot. Beyond that the legislation may have made some computer illiterate politicians feel good about themselves and given some parents the false impression that their children would be safe to use the Net without supervision. 
I agree with that entirely. I argue what is really happening here is that the scrutiny by Electronic Frontiers, and perhaps some other groups, to try to find out how effective that legislation has been is what really unnerves the government because the legislation has been monumentally unsuccessful. It was fatally flawed to begin with, and the Democrats said so at the time. I remember arguing not to the effect that the Internet ought not be censored but that it technically could not be censored or have censorship imposed upon it because it would then simply move offshore. I have yet to see any evidence to suggest that there were local Australian ISPs hosting such sites.
I brought my laptop into the chamber with me but I have not had the opportunity to demonstrate this. It is a simple fact that, if you were to go into any search engine—and Google happens to be my favourite—and type in, for example, `Free sex sites' or `Free porn sites' or, for that matter, `Paid porn sites' or whatever terminology you wanted to use, hundreds of thousands of links and references would come up within a matter of seconds. The notion that Australian based legislation could prohibit this, deter this or prevent this is absolutely absurd. The fact is that the Internet, whether or not people want to believe it, is a boundless—or boundaryless—medium. Sure, we can in theory legislate to prohibit local ISPs from producing or hosting these sites but to the extent that they exist—and, as I say, I see no evidence of that—that may be effective only in some miniscule way. Overwhelmingly, most of the material some people find objectionable is hosted and accessible overseas, and with the click of a mouse you can go from one site to another.
I share Senator Harradine's concern about the protection of children. I think child sexual abuse is the most horrendous crime anyone can commit. But drawing the link, as Senator Harradine is keen to do, between sexually explicit material and child sexual abuse is not supported by any credible evidence. Why is it the case that countries such as Denmark and Norway, which have the most liberalised laws and attitudes towards sexuality and sexually explicit material, have lower levels of rape and child abuse? Why is that?
—Are you saying that children should watch X material?
—Child abuse is horrendous, Senator, but as you well know it occurs overwhelmingly in families and the abuser is most often the father or another close male relative.
—You've just said that children should watch X-rated material.
—No, that is a lie.
—That is what you said.
—No.
 (Senator Watson)—Order! Address your remarks through the chair and ignore interjections, please.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President.
—You have a look at what you said.
—I know what I said. What I said is that child abuse, whether it be physical or sexual, is appalling. It is disgraceful, and the full force of the law must apply. I have seen no evidence—and I have spoken to many clinical psychologists about this—to suggest that there is an intrinsic link between sexually explicit materials and child sexual abuse. I condemn thoroughly and without question the notion that sexually explicit material involving children should be available on the Net or anywhere else. That is disgraceful because it simply perpetuates the production of the materials. You have no argument from me there, Senator. But the notion that blocking freedom of information access on take-down notices within Australia from the Australian Broadcasting Authority is somehow related to child sex abuse is quite literally beyond my comprehension. I do not understand your argument in that area. 
I fundamentally believe that, while the government and the minister promoted very strongly the argument that the online services act would be a strong and effective way of censoring pornography from the Internet, it has been no such thing—nor could it be, and I said so at the time. Those free speech advocates, civil libertarians and others who are concerned with the fallacious argument that this rhetoric about child sexual abuse is somehow an effective way of increasing censorship in other areas of the Internet should know it is nonsense. I believe the government is nervous about the fact that its legislation has fundamentally failed. Its legislation is fundamentally flawed. I think it is annoyed and irritated by the fact that there are groups out there that are doggedly determined to uncover the government's failure in this area.
This is another illustration of tokenistic legislation. I think the government is preying largely on the ignorance of the general community—particularly in the areas of Internet technology—and promoting myths about being able to do things with respect to the Internet, like being able to ban gambling. There is that perception, and the Senate passed legislation to that effect. I argued against it. I believe I have been proven right in that anybody who wants to engage in online gambling can still do so. Once again, you can go into any search engine—be it Google or any other—type in `Online gambling' or some such words and literally dozens of sites that you can access will come up. The legislation that the Senate and parliament passed on online gambling has been a fundamental failure. Equally, the legislation the government in effect said would ban pornography from the Internet has failed.
I believe strongly that the key reason behind what is happening here is censorship. The aim is to censor the scrutineers and protect those watchdogs of government foolishness and government idiocy in its approach to Internet technology. It is to prevent them from being the rightful irritants that they are. Let us have a sensible approach to Internet technology. Let us have a sensible community debate about what is on the Internet, what can be found there and how parents can best respond to that. The best way for parents and guardians to respond to that is with education. We must not frighten people, particularly children, about the Internet. It is a wonderful medium. I think we are just at the beginning of trying to understand what it can do for us and our community. We are a little like Copernicus in the early days of discovering the stars and exploring the universe. We should not be afraid of what the future may hold for us in terms of accessibility and mechanisms for facilitating what we do in society. Yes, there is nasty stuff on the Internet. I am frankly much more concerned about some of the more violent materials than I am about sexually explicit materials. But can we in any real way ban that? In attempting to do so, are we not just drawing attention to it by some other means?
There is material that some people find offensive available through other mediums. The printed form would be, I guess, the other key version, and that is available and accessible. It may not have the immediacy of Internet accessibility, but it is still there. If we are serious about protecting children, then we need a sensible discussion about that, not hollow rhetoric, fearmongering and these spurious links between sexually explicit materials and child sexual abuse. There is no credible evidence that I have seen to that effect. There is no credible investigation or reporting from clinical psychologists I have spoken to or read about that I am aware of. Senator Harradine made reference to the recent report from the Australia Institute. I strongly criticised that report at the time and I stand by that. I found that a very shallow report which drew very spurious links. 
—Because it didn't agree with you, that's why.
—Quite the reverse. In fact, I remember writing an opinion piece that was published I think the following day in which I talked briefly about some of the research which showed that, in some cases, pornographic materials had a therapeutic effect and not the reverse.
—Ha, ha!
—The minister may chortle, but that was serious research. I would be happy to provide it to his office or he can dig into his own search engine. It does concern me that, whenever we try to have a serious debate about the Internet and security, privacy and censorship, pornography and child sex abuse is thrown in like this great bogey—you cannot have any serious attempt at meaningful engagement as it is blurred with this smokescreen about child abuse. Suddenly, if you support free speech then you are facilitating child abuse. It is patently untrue, it is a cheap shot and a shallow shot and there is no credible evidence to sustain it. 
I strongly endorse the arguments which Electronic Frontiers and others have advanced in opposing this legislation. Whilst looking through their web site earlier today, I came across their at-length discussion on this particular bill. They do make one key point, which is that there is a strong argument—and I have heard it here, perhaps not in the chamber but in debate more broadly in recent days—that one of the reasons the government has advanced this as one of the reasons for prohibiting or allowing for the exemption for FOI applications is that some of the sites which may have been taken down or issued with take-down notices may involve child pornography and, therefore, the government is trying to prevent people accessing information about those sites, the hyperlinks or whatever. That is simply untrue, because child pornography is, quite rightly, unlawful. It is not lawfully accessible by any means, so that argument itself is utterly spurious. It illustrates again the red herrings that are thrown into this debate. 
Fundamentally, I believe strongly that we are dealing here with a government embarrassed by its hollow rhetoric around the legislation of censorship and sexually explicit materials being exposed. This manoeuvre is to try to prevent those who are doing the exposing, who are engaging in the scrutiny and who are, through their best efforts, trying to bring about a sensible approach to the way in which we address this medium—not knee-jerk reactions and hysterical language about child sexual abuse and pornography. That is not the way forward if we want to be the clever country. We were rightly described internationally as the global village idiot. My encouragement to the minister is: let us have a more responsible, more intelligent debate about these issues; let us have an approach that says to Australians that education and awareness are the key and that we will be cooperative global citizens when it comes to trying to best manage the way we deal with information technology laws on an international and global basis.

"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2003-09-09,"—I think the starting point for this whole debate on the Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002 would be why it was that we sought to restrict access to offensive Internet content. If you listen to Senator Lundy—and I did not but I have read her outpourings since—and if you listen to the likes of Senator Greig, you would think that we had been out there from the very beginning saying that we were promising faithfully to ensure that there would be no offensive Internet content once our bill was passed. We did nothing of the sort. We are as aware as anyone of the technological difficulties and challenges involved in trying to limit access to the proliferation of offensive web sites. It is a complete and utter furphy—in fact, it is a travesty of the whole debate—to suggest that somehow that was our explicit objective. You say there are perceptions out there. You fostered them. You are the ones who say that. In fact, we do not say any legislation is 100 per cent foolproof. There are laws against murder; it does not stop murders being committed. There are laws against drink driving; it does not stop those offences being committed. Who on earth would ever get up there and promise that this legislation would be 100 per cent effective? We did not, we have not and we will not in the future. But this does not stop Senator Lundy pretending that Labor's concern is:
The obvious glaring issue is that there is nothing the government can do about content hosted overseas that is not subject to Australian law.
Of course, that is a much greater challenge, but the fact is that Labor opposed this root and branch, tooth and nail, right from the outset. They did not say, `You cannot fix up offshore so let's see what we can do about domestic.' No, they were implacably opposed to doing anything about domestic—as is, of course, Senator Greig. It was not clear why he was not prepared to explain to the chamber that he and Senator Allison were actually members of an outfit which I think was called the `Lion club' or the `Lion forum', which was set up as a parody of the Lyons Forum. It was explicitly endorsed and sponsored by the Eros Foundation. I think there was a Democrat staffer dressed up in a silly suit to try to ensure that it got a run—which it did in the Canberra Times. From all the weasel words that we have heard from Senator Greig, I do not think that he in any shape or form accepts that there is a valid concept of pornography.
He uses all sorts of other excuses when we need sensible discussion—and we certainly do. But to suggest that, because you issue take-down notices against domestic sites, which forces it offshore, that somehow undermines the legislation or it is putting money into the pockets of Americans instead of pockets of Australians is the usual line that was always run if a book was offensive in the old days. If there were some other act that was obscene, they would say, `Thanks very much, you've given great publicity to it; that is terrific.' That is utterly counterproductive, very cute, very silly, very superficial and a fundamentally dishonest line. I have not heard a word that indicates that the Labor Party or Senator Greig, at least, have any concern at all about dealing with these issues of child pornography. Senator Greig's whole line is that you cannot link it with child abuse. So that is code for saying, `Don't bother doing anything about it.' He said that nearly all the take-down notices that have been issued have been ineffective, I think. 
The overwhelming body of those take-down notices which relate to Australian content sites have dealt with child pornography. This is a very insidious offence. Because Senator Greig says, `That's criminal,' the argument is that you do not do anything about it, even though you can under our legislation order the taking down of a criminal web site that has been put up there by someone within the jurisdiction. Senator Greig's argument is that, because it is a criminal offence to do that, you should not order a take-down notice. There are web sites containing highly offensive material—I do not know what the latest number is but I think it is well over 100—the great bulk of which is child pornography, paedophile lists and the like, which have been ordered to be taken down; yet all we ever get is this ridicule about the global village idiot which, as I recall, was a term used by someone who wandered out here from the American Civil Liberties Union as a guest, I think, of Electronic Frontiers in complete defiance of any merits of the argument. It was just the usual sort of abuse as you are going to the airport. The fact is that our regime has now been endorsed by bodies such as the Internet Industry Association, which originally had very serious concerns back in the old days when people said, `You can't regulate the Internet, just get over it; don't even bother,' which is basically Senator Lundy's line.  
But, of course, the Internet Industry Association are now on NetAlert, which is our community watchdog, and they say that is a very important step in trying to protect the community. No-one is guaranteeing that you will protect everyone from anything, but it is a very important step forward. As I understand it from them, our regime is now seen as an international model. I recall Bertelsmann had a forum a couple of years ago in which they explicitly used our legislation as the benchmark. I know it suits your purposes, Senator Greig, because you do not believe for a moment in any restrictions on the Internet and you are not interested, except in finding excuses, about things such as child pornography and paedophile lists—even bomb recipes.
Let us be clear about this. Organisations such as the EFA are the ultimate doctrinaire libertarians. They do not believe in any form of censorship. They do not believe in trying to find a sensible way of dealing with offensive material on the Internet. They are in the `Just Say No' party, to which Senator Lundy belongs. Of course, that is totally unhelpful if you are trying to address community concerns and if you are trying to find out if there are ways in which you can at least limit mainstream access to some of the more offensive sites. That is why it has always struck me as quite bizarre that Senator Lundy finds herself in the laissez faire camp of saying, `All you can do is educate and empower.' Labor have never for a moment come up with any alternative regime. They have ridiculed us from the outset. They are not interested in finding a way in which you can limit access to domestic sites, yet the implication from Senator Lundy's speech last night is that Labor's concern is that you cannot control offshore sites. We know that is very difficult, but you can do your best to set an example and work with others. Indeed, if that regime extends itself globally, then you may be quite effective, and that is what we think is likely to happen with spam. That is why we hope that, by going down the path of trying to restrict access to yet more mindless gaming opportunities, we can do something about it. But, once again, the Senator Greigs of this world say, `No, it's technology; don't even touch it.' He is not interested in community standards and not interested in whether there are some sensible ways in which you might be able to protect children. I understand that when it comes from the `Lion forum'—the chief lion—but I do not understand it when it comes from the Labor Party. It seems extraordinary to me that they can run these lines such as, `We're really opposed to this, because the government attempted to deceive Australians by tricking them into believing the problem was solved.' We have never said that. You will never find anything anywhere that says that. That is a figment of Senator Lundy's fervid imagination to try to justify this absolute ideological opposition to a sensible community proposal. Senator Lundy said:  
The idea that FOI could allow people to access and then peddle sites ... is completely absurd. 
I do not know why it is completely absurd. That is precisely what this EFA outfit wanted to do.
—Rubbish!
—No. They wanted access to the sites that have been subject to take-down orders. Why would you want to see all that material? They want the URLs and the content. That is what we wanted to stop. There is no blanket restriction, as Senator Lundy suggested. Senator Lundy says that there is an `implausible assumption that people would willingly identify themselves to government agencies as seeking, for improper purposes, access to material'. She has never looked at the FOI Act. The FOI Act explicitly does not deal with motives. They are not interested in what the applicant is going to use the material for. I would not believe a word the EFA said, even if they said, `We're just going to keep it to ourselves for “research purposes”,' but they have not said that. They just wanted access to it, as any applicant is entitled to have, and they get a judgment on the merits of whether they should have the ability to access it and then make it available to all the world. Of course, what would you do? You would simply load it onto an offshore web site and you would stand there thumbing your nose at the authorities and saying, `There, there, we've put it beyond your reach.'
That of course is yet another way in which Senator Lundy fails to understand the whole concept of this legislation. The fact is that we are doing what we can to restrict access. There is no blanket exemption. If you look at the bill itself, you will see that it is designed only to deal with offensive Internet content. That is the subject matter of these highly offensive web sites and the URLs, which are the addresses that get you to those sites. It does not stop you exploring the merits of the regime or finding out about a whole bunch of other things under FOI that relate to the administration of the regime. You can get those. Senator Lundy seems to think that none of that will happen anymore. The fact is that it will, and it has in the past.
I just want to make one other point. Australia, through the ABA, is a member of the European complaints hotline called INHOPE, which the ABA uses to exchange information about illegal content, mostly involving child pornography. These referrals are then passed on to the police authorities in the relevant jurisdictions. This is a key element of the complaints process and assists in the prosecution of child abusers worldwide. INHOPE is a highly respected organisation that requires members to maintain confidentiality about illegal or prohibited content. While it operates out of Europe, its membership has grown significantly to include a number of other countries including the US and Australia. It provides an invaluable service to help international law enforcement agencies track down the sickest of deviants peddling child pornography. INHOPE has stated clearly that it will not continue to both refer and receive referrals from the ABA if the ABA is unable to guarantee that information identifying prohibited content will not be unconditionally released to the public, as it is once it is subject to and made available under FOI. There are no restrictions placed on it; the act does not allow it. 
The Labor Party, as Senator Harradine precisely identifies, are policy lazy—it is `just say no'—and not the slightest bit interested in trying to protect children, their parents or anyone else. They simply fall back on this pathetic line about the need for education. No-one denies there is a limited value to education—in fact, for responsible parents it may be a very important way of ensuring they can regulate what occurs in the household—but to suggest that that is all you do is just throwing in the towel. We see that as an adjunct, just as the requirement to make available information about various online filters and software packages is a very important ingredient in this whole legislation.
Some people have to take responsibility for their own actions, but that does not mean the government can simply say: `We don't care what you do out there; that is all a matter for you. If you are a good parent, so be it; if you are not, we really don't care.' That is the Labor Party approach. I have never, ever heard Senator Lundy say one constructive word about how she would deal with this issue. It is all: `Isn't the government hopeless? Why does it ever bother to go down this path?' That goes back five or six years. I can recall there were EFA equivalents in the US and elsewhere who said: `This is a new paradigm. The online world is amazing stuff. You can't control the Internet. The technology is completely beyond you.' Senator Greig still thinks that is the case. He is incorrigible—but at least he doesn't hide it.
You would have thought the Labor Party would have more sensitivity to community values and would be prepared to at least explore ways in which you might limit access, but they do not. They don't ever say, `We will go this far but no further,' or, `You are trying to do things that aren't achievable.' They simply oppose it root and branch. Why would you oppose legislation that has resulted in the taking down of, I think, well over 100 offensive sites, the great majority of which have contained child pornography? I would like to hear Senator Lundy say whether she thinks that has been desirable and in the community interest or whether she would rather those take-down notices were never issued—in other words, that she is perfectly happy for people to access Australian sites within our jurisdiction (people committing criminal offences, on one view of it) and that, in the interests of believing in education and empowerment, they will do nothing at all about it. That is the line. I could not believe it when I read her remarks to see how she has not moved on these issues. She says:
... a bill that effectively excludes key government agencies from any public scrutiny ... I think that is dishonest.
What is dishonest is suggesting that that is what this bill does. It does not effectively exclude key government agencies from any public scrutiny at all. What it does is to prohibit people getting access to URLs, which are the Internet addresses, and the content itself. It does not stop you getting a description of that product. It probably does not stop you getting a description of the regime or any other way you may want to comment. The Labor Party simply say: `We do not believe in any of this. We are philosophically opposed.' They take what in some other circumstances might be regarded as an extreme right-wing view: `All we believe in is educating and empowering, and the government have no role to play.' I think that is very sad, but in a political context it is manna from heaven for us because there is only one party in this parliament that is serious about trying to do something about these very important issues and the other side are just saying no.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2003-09-09,"—My question is directed to Senator Hill in his capacity as Minister for Defence. Is the minister aware that the United Kingdom is sending 1,200 more troops to Iraq, and has signalled that even more troops may be sent, in response to the deteriorating security situation? Hasn't the US also recognised that more troops are needed to help bring stability to the country, despite 140,000 of its personnel already being in the region? Hasn't President Bush now asked for an additional $134 billion for the task of rebuilding Iraq? Does the government share the assessment of the UK and US governments that the situation in Iraq requires more security forces? Given that the Prime Minister has ruled out any more Australian troops being committed to Iraq, and given the government's responsibilities as the third occupying power, what additional contribution does the government envisage making to assist in the stabilisation and rebuilding of Iraq? ",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Questions Without Notice,2,1,question
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2003-09-09,"—Mr President, I thank the minister for his answer. I wish to ask a supplementary question, which goes to the question of niche capabilities. The minister said on a number of occasions that Australia would be prepared to provide further niche capabilities, as determined, from time to time. But the Prime Minister has ruled out sending any more peacekeepers. The Prime Minister specifically uses the word `peacekeepers'. I would like the minister to explain to the Senate whether that means we have ruled out sending further military forces to Iraq who could be described as meeting niche capabilities, rather than specifically in the role of peacemakers, or whether the Prime Minister has ruled out sending any more Australian Defence Force members in any capacity. I am not clear from his answer which is the case. Are we refusing to send any more troops at all, or have we only ruled out the role of peacekeepers? ",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Questions Without Notice,2,1,question
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-09-09,"—Australia is making a significant contribution towards the stabilisation and rebuilding of Iraq. As I think I said during the last sitting week in answer to a question from the opposition, we currently have about 840 troops operating in the Middle East area of operations. Most of those are concerned with Iraq directly or indirectly. They include air traffic controllers who are keeping open Baghdad International Airport for military and humanitarian flights. They include C130 crews which are flying personnel and goods and equipment, both for the purposes of the coalition and for humanitarian reasons, into Iraq and around Iraq. They include a frigate which is operating in the northern end of the Persian Gulf, helping to provide maritime security. They include forces that are part of the component still ascertaining issues relating to weapons of mass destruction to ensure that there is no ongoing threat in that regard. They include forces that are primarily securing Australian diplomats or other civilians who are working for the benefit of Australia and Iraq in Baghdad or its surrounds. They include some others who are helping to rebuild the new Iraq army, some who are working within the joint headquarters in Baghdad, others who are working with the CPA, and one who is working with the United Nations—and who behaved heroically on the occasion of the bombing, I might say in passing. They add up to a significant contribution in personnel and, we believe, a contribution which is measured against the size of our forces and our capacity to share the contribution to the task that I have mentioned.  
In addition to that, Australia has offered civilians, who are helping across a range of the ministries. The most high profile has been in the area of agriculture, but also in relation to petroleum and other areas. We have provided considerable aid as well, particularly aid that has been related to wheat. In all, we think the contribution we are making is appropriate and we intend to remain on that course. We do not see a need for Australia to make any substantial increase. We have always said that we will keep an open mind and if other areas of niche need become apparent where we can play a worthwhile role we would look at such a circumstance. But basically we think that the financial contribution and the manpower contribution we are making are appropriate in the circumstances.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-09-09,"—By `peacekeepers' I mean a significant infantry component that would be working on the ground to maintain the peace. Many of the some 130,000 Americans and the 15,000 British—I think that is the number—could be described as part of that. In relation to that broad scale peacekeeping function, we have said from the outset that that is not a role we intend to fill in this instance. But if there is a niche need where we have a particular capability that could be useful, we would be prepared to look at that in the circumstances at the time.

"Lightfoot, Sen Ross",LP,2003-09-09,"—My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, Senator the Hon. Nick Minchin. Will the minister advise the Senate of the benefits for Western Australia and Australia generally of the $11 billion Gorgon gas project which has now been given approval to commence? How will this major project help build on this government's strong economic management and—and this is the rhetorical aspect of my question—is the minister aware of any alternative policies?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Resources: Gorgon Gas Project</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,question
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2003-09-09,"—I thank Senator Lightfoot for that astute question and acknowledge his very strong support for the development of Western Australia's great resource base. Yesterday's announcement of an in principle agreement for the development of the Gorgon gas field is really just the latest in a very long string of milestones in the great Australian liquefied natural gas industry's history. It really is a vote of confidence in the strength of both the economy and our resources sector.
This Greater Gorgon area, off Western Australia's Pilbara coast, is Australia's largest known gas reserve. It represents some 25 per cent of Australia's known gas resources and contains in excess of 40 trillion cubic feet of gas. There is enough gas there to generate all of Australia's electricity for the next 55 years, and it is enough to fill Sydney Harbour 2½ thousand times over. So our government warmly congratulates the Western Australian Labor government on its in principle approval for Gorgon to use Barrow Island—subject, of course, to strict environmental safeguards—and, of course, the use of Barrow Island is critical to the development of this very key resource.
The joint venture partners are going to be spending some $11 billion to develop Gorgon, and it has the potential to generate huge benefits not only for Western Australia but for Australia as a whole. There will be a construction work force of 3,000, a permanent work force of 400, another 6,000 indirect jobs across the nation with about 1,700 of those in WA, annual exports of from about $2½ billion up to $11½ billion in revenue for the Commonwealth government to the year 2030, so this is a huge and very important project. It will open development to very big new exports, as I said, on top of the $25 billion contract that we engineered last year for the export of LNG to China.
You would think, with this being such a good news story for Australia, that there would be bipartisan support for this at a federal level. I have to say I was pretty stunned to read in the Weekend Australian on 9 August that someone called Joel Fitzgibbon, who apparently is the shadow resources minister for the Labor Party—
—Order, minister. It is Mr Joel Fitzgibbon. He is a member in the other place.
—Mr Joel Fitzgibbon, MP! Well, he actually said that the export of gas from Barrow Island is not in Australia's national interest. While I commend Premier Gallop on ignoring his party colleague and allowing this very important project to proceed, it is again evidence that the federal Labor Party simply does not understand Australia's resources sector. Indeed, the executive director of APPEA, the key industry group, said that the statements by Mr Fitzgibbon had real potential to damage investor confidence in Australia's projects. And of course Mr Fitzgibbon's outburst comes on top of the ALP proposal, just recently announced, to slug our mining industry to the tune of $400 million a year by reducing diesel fuel rebates to pump up its higher education package. That comes on top of their insistence that they are going to rush in and sign the Kyoto protocol, which would be extraordinarily damaging to the competitiveness of our resources sector—and then, of course, condemning the Gorgon project. All of this confirms there is only one side of politics that really understands just how important Australia's resources sector is to the future of this country and is going to get behind it and support it. It is about time the federal Labor Party understood the importance of resources to this great country.

Yesterday Senator Faulkner asked whether ASIO was aware of a stabbing at the Sydney Police Centre and why the attack was not captured by surveillance cameras at ASIO's Sydney office. I am advised that a NSWPol special constable was attacked at the Sydney Police Centre on 10 March 2003. The attacker fled the scene and was apprehended by police outside the ASIO Sydney office. The actual attack occurred outside the range of the surveillance cameras, but the apprehension of the attacker did occur within range of the cameras. The apprehension was not recorded, as the ASIO security cameras are used only for visual monitoring. Consequently ASIO was not able to provide the New South Wales Police with video footage. The suggestion that the cameras were broken or were out of order is without foundation.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2003-09-09,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked today.
I would like to turn my comments to those answers provided by Senator Kemp. Firstly, I will take him to task on his pitiful attempt to misrepresent Labor's position with respect to the Gungahlin Drive extension. I stand by my challenge to this government that it has been Minister Kemp and Minister Tuckey, the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, who have sought to politicise the institutions of the National Capital Authority and the Australian Institute of Sport. That charge lays level at their feet, and it is their responsibility to try to work in a way that upholds the credit and the reputation of these institutions. Has that stopped this government from deliberately setting out to tarnish these institutions by politicising them? Absolutely not. Senator Kemp took on the task of politicising the AIS and the Sports Commission with great relish in a Senate estimates committee, where he first asked questions about the Gungahlin Drive extension and the impact on the AIS. The fact of the matter is that the proposed Gungahlin Drive extension did not go through the AIS, as Senator Kemp waxes lyrical in this chamber; it went around the AIS. The route that has now been approved goes around the AIS in a different direction on a different side. Both routes go around the AIS. When Senator Kemp stands up here and talks about the Gungahlin Drive extension going through the AIS and impacting on the AIS in a negative way, we know he is talking about his own political campaign. We know that because the ACT Labor government addressed all of the concerns raised by the AIS, and I say that the AIS was not allowed to say yes to the Labor government in the ACT. The AIS was politicised through the intervention of the minister. That is the situation, and it does not matter how much Senator Kemp or Minister Tuckey try to defend their roles. I think it is patently clear to every citizen of the ACT—to everyone in Canberra—that the coalition government likes to play games with the ACT, and it is absolutely unacceptable.
I will turn now to Senator Kemp's response on drugs in sport. It is worth having a very brief history lesson. Since the Liberal government began to oversee ASDA in 1996 when they were elected, the level of support offered to ASDA has declined in real terms. In 1995-96, 71 per cent of ASDA drug tests were government funded. In the last financial year, this number dropped to 57 per cent. This shows that user-pays testing has increased from 29 per cent in 1995-96 to 43 per cent in 2002-03. Whilst this is a commendable increase in itself, because it could have represented a significant increase in the number of tests, it has been accompanied by a decline in the number of publicly funded tests and is hardly a cause for celebration on those grounds. Despite the cutbacks, ASDA, to its credit—through its innovation and its good administration—has managed to keep pace with increasing world testing requirements by increasing the total number of tests conducted. It is very hard to give this government too much credit for the good work that is occurring at ASDA. 
There is another illustration of the decline in support. Between 1995-96 and 2002-03, the total number of tests conducted by ASDA increased by 52 per cent, from 3,296 to 6,263, which is a terrific increase, but over the same period the percentage of government funds dedicated to testing decreased by 14 per cent. This indicates clearly that there is a question about the level of commitment to ASDA and the fight against drugs in sport. I have no doubt that greater pressure on ASDA to keep up with the challenge will continue. I urge the government to pay more attention to this. ASDA needs more resourcing to keep up the fight against drugs, and it does not seem to be forthcoming to the extent that is necessary for that fight to be real and meaningful.
Senator Kemp waxes lyrical about the WADA code, and I do recognise the government's efforts where they are deserved, but today Senator Kemp had the opportunity to explain exactly what was happening with the implementation of the WADA code and he chose to again say, `We are working with national sporting organisations, state governments and so forth.' We have heard that now for months. We want specifics. We want to know exactly what the government are doing. It is a question of government accountability. This is a very important issue. The statistics are showing a disappointing and concerning picture. Senator Kemp relinquished the opportunity today to restate his government's credentials on these matters. I am now seriously worried that they do not have those credentials, because Senator Kemp is incapable of articulating the simple steps that I asked him about in question time today.

"Watson, Sen John",LP,2003-09-09,"—Following a historic agreement between Senator John Cherry of the Australian Democrats and the Minister for Revenue, Senator Coonan, Australian superannuation fund members are going to get very significant benefits. The first is called the co-contribution for low-income earners. That will provide benefits whereby a contribution by a worker of $1,000 into a superannuation account, where that worker has an income under $27,500, will receive a co-contribution of $1,000 from the Australian government. For incomes between $27,500 and $40,000, the benefit tapers off. This is a huge benefit to lots of low-income families.
If I could quote from the Senate select committee that looked into this issue, there was widespread support for the co-contribution initiative in submissions received by the committee. Overall there was recognition of the need to introduce measures to increase the benefits of superannuation for low-income earners and an acknowledgment that the measures proposed in the bill would assist in boosting overall retirement savings. One of the interesting submitters was the Industry Funds Forum, which stated:
... measures to increase the benefits of superannuation for low income earners are essential. 
Again, the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia welcomed the co-contribution initiative, advising the committee:
The initiative, we feel, has real merit as a means to improve the adequacy of retirement savings.
Mercer Human Resource Consulting similarly welcomed the co-contribution, indicating:
We are pleased that the Government has seen fit to encourage the use of superannuation. Therefore we offer general support ...
We even had representatives from the West Tamar Council and a number of outworkers there who said:
I understand that the intention of the legislation is to provide a mechanism to support the Federal Government's initiatives to encourage superannuation contributions and ultimately, greater financial self-sufficiency.
Even the Australian Council of Social Service supported the principle of co-contributions for low-income earners. So it is a historic occasion.
Seldom do taxpayers get such significant benefits from a government. To receive $1,000 in return for an investment of $1,000, providing the income is under $27,500, is perhaps one of the most generous benefits ever given by any Australian government. It is not surprising that, since this matter was first mooted, the telephone has rung hot on a regular basis with people asking for progress. The sticking point, unfortunately, has been the Australian Labor Party, who have been reluctant to move on any superannuation measures—a dog in the manger attitude. It was this government's initiative in this area.
The other significant change as a result of this historic agreement has been a reduction in the superannuation surcharge whereby the surcharge over a three-year period will reduce from the current 15 per cent to 12.5 per cent. This is significant because it shows a commitment to get rid of the surcharge over time. It is often said that the surcharge benefits only high-income earners. I was speaking last night with representatives of the Australian Federal Police and they queried me on the surcharge issue. They were concerned that so many of their officers who had been affected by trauma as a result of accident investigations et cetera had to go off early and that, while they were not high-income earners, because of the benefits that were provided through the association in the form of redundancy type payments—you would not call it a golden handshake—they came into the surcharge bracket. These were not high-income earners, and it was affecting the amount of money that they were taking away.
So it is a good measure, it is a historic agreement and I think it shows the progressive nature of the federal government in its attitude towards increasing the level of savings. After all, we were recently told there is a $600 billion gap between the level of savings and people's expectations. We must do more to increase savings, and this is a measure to improve that.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2003-09-09,"—We have just heard from Senator Watson, and we heard from Senator Coonan during question time. They have outlined what they consider to be a fair and balanced terrific new superannuation package from a deal that they have negotiated with Senator Cherry from the Australian Democrats. This is a bit like the GST, I suppose. There is just one big problem with the package that I want to debate today—that is, the government cannot pay for it. There is a $250 million shortfall in revenue that is being put aside for this package. The government cannot pay for the package deal it has done with the Australian Democrats.
The Liberal government's election promises prior to the last election, which outlined the package that this deal has modified, referred to a new tax revenue raiser which was to pay for a large part of the cost. It was a new tax on nonresidents who permanently depart Australia and transfer their superannuation out. The Howard government, in its pre-election manifesto, indicated that this new tax would raise $325 million over four years. It is dependent on temporary residents who have left Australia—and there are well over a million of those—and temporary residents who are in Australia transferring voluntarily their superannuation out of Australia when they leave so the government can collect the new tax, the $325 million. I asked Senator Coonan quite specifically today whether it is correct, as I am informed by industry sources, that only $15 million of the $325 million has been raised to date. Fourteen months into the operation of this new tax, only $15 million has been raised. 
Treasury and the Liberal government assumed that 80 per cent of temporary residents would transfer their money and the government would collect the new tax; however, industry sources tell me that only 10 to 20 per cent, at best, of temporary residents have transferred their money. This means that there will be a $250 million shortfall over the four years of the costings of these important revenue measures. That is not a surprise to me, frankly, because we have the tax office of Australia trying to contact overseas well over one million former temporary residents—and those one million people include backpackers, holiday-makers, students and other temporary residents who were in Australia working—but they do not have their addresses. They cannot contact the one million people who have already left the country to ask them to voluntarily transfer their superannuation so the tax office can collect the new tax.
This is an absolute farce. We have the Australian Taxation Office on a worldwide search for over one million former temporary residents, including backpackers, to collect the tax and they do not have the addresses. How on earth can the tax office collect the $325 million? They cannot. They will not collect anywhere near the $325 million that is necessary to fund the Liberal-Democrat superannuation package that has been announced. And rather than take four years to collect the $325 million, with the current rate of progress—or lack of progress—it will take 22 years. We have a massive revenue hole in the government-Democrat superannuation tax package of some $250 million. The minister refused to give the Senate today the accurate figure. She knows the figure, but she is embarrassed and refuses to give the figure. In fact, at last Senate estimates, Treasury confirmed that the revenue estimate from this new tax—the chase for backpackers around the world—will not raise anywhere near $325 million.

"Chapman, Sen Grant",LP,2003-09-09,"—As Senator Watson has already indicated, the government has a number of positive initiatives in regard to superannuation but all we hear from the Labor opposition is misrepresentation, carping and unjustified criticism. Senator Sherry has just exemplified that in his remarks of a few moments ago. Senator Sherry not only misrepresents the government's position on superannuation policy and superannuation initiatives; he also misrepresents the position of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation of which he, I and Senator Watson, who spoke earlier on behalf of the government, are members.
—And Senator Buckland.
—Senator Buckland is also a member of that committee. But I have not at this stage heard Senator Buckland—and if Senator Buckland is going to speak, I will have to listen carefully to what he says—misrepresent the position in the way that Senator Sherry does. 
I want to draw attention to the fact that the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation in its most recent report recommended that over an extended period the government should examine means of encouraging people to take income streams rather than lump sum capital on retirement. Senator Sherry is engaged in conducting a scare campaign on this issue, although he is a member of the very committee that has made this recommendation. He is suggesting that this decision is imminent and that people who wish to access lump sum superannuation for retirement in the immediate future will be required to take income streams rather than lump sums. Of course, that is not the case. That is not what the committee has recommended and that is certainly not what the government is likely to initiate. This is an issue that needs to be examined over an extended period of time, maybe over a generation.
That just exemplifies the way Senator Sherry seeks to gain political advantage out of misrepresenting the position not only of the government but of the very committee of which he is a member. Of course he has done that in relation to temporary residents in questions to Senator Coonan and his comments today. Contrary to what Senator Sherry has said, temporary residents who are seeking the prompt return of superannuation have been flocking—at the rate of some 13,000 a week—to the new tax office web site that has been provided for them. This represents a sharp jump in demand from the 1,300 a week who were using the site in April and this is directly attributable to the launch of the online application system for this measure in mid-April. Since the launch of the online application system, some 1,593 electronic applications have been received.
The ATO has written to recent departees where address information is available to advise them of their capacity to apply online for the return of their superannuation. Of course, that in turn will result in the tax due to the tax office also being retained. There is also a tax office initiated advertising campaign under way to raise awareness of this issue. So it is important to understand that eligible temporary residents have, from 1 July last year, been able to obtain access to superannuation benefits upon their permanent departure from Australia, subject to the 30 per cent withholding tax that is due to the tax office. This will be of great benefit to temporary residents, including those who have already permanently departed Australia and those who may depart in the future.
The measure is not designed for permanent residents of Australia or residents of New Zealand, because those individuals may leave the country but return later to retire. Of course, under that situation they have the option of retiring in Australia and obtaining the age pension. The measure will benefit superannuation funds by reducing the number of low-balance inactive accounts that attract administration costs for their maintenance. Under this measure, access to superannuation benefits will be subject to the 30 per cent withholding tax arrangement that I mentioned to claw back the concessions originally provided for the benefits on the basis that their initial intention was for retirement income purposes. That will no longer be the case for temporary residents departing so it is reasonable that that withholding tax be levied. But of course departing residents do have the option of leaving their money in the fund until they reach retiring age. Those are the facts in relation to departing temporary residents. Senator Sherry should not misrepresent the government's situation.

"Buckland, Sen Geoffrey",ALP,2003-09-09,"—I rise to take note of answers given earlier today by Senator Coonan in relation to superannuation questions asked by Senator Sherry. In particular, I would like to address the answers given in relation to children's superannuation accounts. One of the centrepieces of the Liberal Party's superannuation policy was children's superannuation accounts. The Prime Minister said the package `trail blazes', particularly in the area of superannuation for children, and `teaches children the wonders of compound interest'. It seems that children were not listening, nor were their parents. The wonders of compound interest fell flat with them. In fact, they had no interest at all. 
Along with so many other things, the government's election promise to allow the establishment of children's superannuation accounts has been exposed as a weak and wimpy stunt and a disingenuous attempt to deal with a particularly serious issue—the issue of adequacy of retirement income. Senator Sherry asked the minister, Senator Coonan, if, after 14 months of the children's superannuation accounts scheme commencing operation, only about 500 such accounts had been opened. This was out of the 450,000 such accounts that the Prime Minister suggested would be opened over four years. The minister, when confronted with that, in a very weak attempt to answer the question said, `We can argue: we can't agree or disagree on the 450,000. It is not definitive.' Then she tried to fob it off by saying, `This is not a compulsory scheme; it's optional. The government doesn't direct how people should save.' We are not saying the government should direct how people should save. What we are saying is that, when they make something the centrepiece of their policy, they should deliver. Then the minister, in her usual way when stuck for the real answer, said, `It's sour grapes on the part of the Labor Party. This government cares about working people.' We do not see very much caring for working people coming from Minister Coonan, nor do we see very much caring coming from this government. 
I was pleased that Senator Sherry, in his question, mentioned that it would take 910 years on the current figures to get 470,000 children's superannuation accounts opened because I did that equation also and came to the same answer. So this trail blazing centrepiece of Liberal Party superannuation policy is a dud. The government will not be getting 470,000 children's superannuation accounts opened in four years. It will take 910 years to get that figure. 
In discussions I have had with the industry, the children's superannuation accounts scheme has been described as a flop, a non-event, the reflection of a minister not really interested in the future needs of retirees. In February this year, Minister Coonan said: `There is obviously a very good underlying policy rationale for it.' Well, let's hear it! `It's a good policy', she said, `and I will be doing everything I can to talk about it.' What has the minister been saying? Nothing seems to be reported about this trail blazing scheme. (Time expired)

I believe, on advice, that this is a minor and technical amendment. As a matter of courtesy, I am not sure whether we told the shadow minister that Senator Alston was not available. He asked me, having served three years in this portfolio and actually having responsibility for the facilities area, if I would substitute for him. I am not sure whether he informed Senator Lundy, but I hope she and Senator Cherry are happy with me substituting for Senator Alston for 28 minutes.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2003-09-09,"—I do have a few comments on this government amendment. This amendment relates to the commencement date of schedule 4 which abolishes the specially constituted ACA, or SCACA. The commencement date of 1 April 2003 is now well and truly behind us. This reminds me that the government introduced the bill on 27 June 2002. Now, more than 14 months later, we finally get to debate the bill in the Senate. Due to the minister's usual quite lackadaisical manner in managing the legislative program, we can only assume that the committee has continued past its previous expiry date of 1 April 2003. But I am not actually sure, so while we support this amendment to wipe the dust off an otherwise acceptable schedule, I would be interested in asking the minister a few questions. Were committee members reappointed after 1 April 2003 and, if so, was there any salary, commission or administrative costs for these members and how much? What was the total cost of running this committee prior to 1 April 2003?
The reason I ask these questions is that I think it goes to the broader and more significant pattern of behaviour from the communications minister. He has put into this bill four very reasonable and acceptable schedules that update and improve the communications law and, if these schedules stood alone, this bill would have sailed through the Main Committee and the Senate, I am sure, last year. It is worth commenting now that the seemingly useless specially constituted ACA would have been abolished and some consumer protection arrangements would have been improved, surveillance capabilities for serious criminal and corruption investigations would have been improved and the ACA would have had an improved ability to make written determinations. But, because the minister decided to throw in his highly contentious FOI exemption schedule—schedule 2—which Labor has opposed, these worthwhile amendments have languished for well over a year. This is another example of the minister's inept handling of his portfolio, and I draw it to the committee's attention. Nevertheless, Labor will support this amendment, and I look forward to getting the answers to those questions.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2003-09-09,"—Firstly, the minister is not responsible for the legislative program; the Manager of Government Business in the Senate is—and that is me, so it is my fault. The minister has been hounding me almost daily since last year, trying to get this bill moved up the program, and it is entirely my fault that it has not been moved higher up the program. So he is entirely innocent of the charge and I take full responsibility.
Secondly, I do not think it makes sense to say that it is his fault to delay the legislation on the one hand and then on the other hand say that, if it had not contained a particular schedule you did not like, it would have sailed through the place—it would have been passed. In a way, you are accepting blame on behalf of the Labor Party. What you are saying is that, if all of our bills have everything in them that you like, they will pass and if they do not, they won't. It is, of course, the right of any senator and the majority of senators to oppose government legislation, and that obviously happens fairly regularly. But you cannot then blame us for being tardy in bringing legislation into the Senate when you are accepting responsibility for not letting it through. The Premier of New South Wales, Bob Carr, said in about 1998 that for the Australian Labor Party federally to seek to govern the country from the opposition benches in the Senate would not be a successful road to follow. We were elected to government, we seek to bring measures to the Senate and we seek to get them through the Senate. The opposition can seek to get a majority here to knock off measures and they obviously bear the political consequences of those decisions—that is entirely appropriate and democratic. But you cannot blame us for not progressing our legislative program when you are constantly trying to obstruct it, slow it down and, when it suits your ideological purposes, defeat it.
In answer to the specific questions that you raise, the minister did make some reappointments to the committee after April. There are no further expenses relating to those members. In terms of the total cost of maintaining the eligible associate members, I have got a figure in front of me of $143,000, which includes salaries, travel and incidentals. No office space was allocated to the former eligible associate members and, in the absence of a regulation made under the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973, section 7, Dr Horton and Mr Horsley are not entitled to be paid any remuneration in respect of their appointment as part-time eligible associate members in addition to their remuneration as full-time members of the ACA.

"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2003-09-09,"—I move Democrat amendment (R1) on sheet 3036:
(R1)	Schedule 4, page 10 (after line 3), before item 1, insert:
2  At the end of subclause 27(1) of Schedule 3
Add:
	; and (g)	where the facility is proposed to be located near a community sensitive site, including residential areas, childcare centres, schools, aged care centres, hospitals, playgrounds and regional icons:
	(i)	the community has been fully consulted, and wherever possible, has agreed to the facility; and
	(ii)	alternative less sensitive sites have been considered; and
	(iii)	the beam of greatest intensity does not fall on any part of an area frequented by the public without agreement of the usual users of that area; and 
	(iv)	efforts have been made to minimise electromagnetic radi-ation exposure to the public.
This particular amendment is a modification of section 27(1) of schedule 3 of the Telecommunications Act. It deals with the circumstances in which the Australian Communications Authority can approve a facilities installation permit. I do not think this provision in the act has actually been used to date, but it is very important, because this is the provision under which the ACA can essentially override state law to approve a mobile phone tower or another telecommunications infrastructure facility.
The Democrats think that it is very important that the law keeps up to date with changing community expectations about what happens with mobile phone towers and the whole general issue of electromagnetic radiation. In the most recent couple of months, we have seen the courts take an increasingly restrictive view of the notion of the exemptions and the protections that telecommunications carriers should have under federal law for the provision of mobile phone towers.
In July we had a major case in the New South Wales Court of Appeal involving Hurstville council at Oatley Park. That particular decision found that an attempt by Hutchison Telecommunications to define an extended low-impact facility as a continuing low-impact facility was inappropriate. The key reasoning for that was their view that exemptions of this particular sort—exemptions from common law, from the tort of trespass and from the whole general planning regime—should be read as narrowly as possible and also to ensure that the community had input on those sorts of decisions. They found against Hutchison in that particular case, and Hurstville council now gets to approve whether that particular mobile phone tower should be stuck in the middle of a community park.
Only last week, the Victorian Supreme Court came down with a similar decision involving the director of public housing in that state. Again it was a question of whether an attempt by Hutchison Telecommunications to expand an existing low-impact facility still stayed within the exemption provided in the act for a low-impact facility. In that case, the Victorian Supreme Court found again that the protections to telcos in the Telecommunications Act should be read narrowly: any overriding of state planning law or common law or the rights of the community should be read as narrowly as possible.
The third development I wanted to refer to concerns how the federal government now treats low-impact facilities, which are essentially towers less than five metres high. For seven years, the Democrats have been campaigning to try to ensure that the government gives the community more say on the siting of mobile phone towers and telecommunications facilities. Finally, last year, the Australian Communications Industry Forum, ACIF, agreed to a new code of practice in relation to the siting of low-impact mobile phone towers. For the first time the new code of practice actually includes an obligation on telecommunications carriers to have regard to the siting of facilities near what are called `community sensitive areas'. Those community sensitive areas are defined as being residential areas, child-care centres, schools, aged care centres, hospitals, playgrounds and regional icons, whatever that means. It is a very important provision because for the first time telecommunications carriers for low-impact facilities—they are the ones which are exempted from state planning laws—now must have regard to the issue of community sensitive facilities. They are required to ensure the community is consulted, that alternative sites are considered and that efforts are made to minimise electromagnetic radiation. The Democrats welcome that. We think that code of practice should have gone much further, but we commend the forum for, after seven years of work, finally coming around to this particular point of view. 
What we have are essentially three ways a facility can be approved in this country. The first way is that they can go through as a low-impact facility in which case they are exempted from state planning law. A second way is that they can go through state planning laws and local government authorities, which is a matter for state law, and the third way is that they can apply to the ACA for a facilities installation permit under schedule 3 of the Telecommunications Act. Whilst that third route has not been used, my concern is that that third route may be used, particularly if the increasing recognition at state level and at local government level that communities have rights is enforced by the courts. I would not be surprised to see the telecommunications carriers turning around and seeking to move towards the ACA to override the difficulty of dealing with communities.
That is why it is essential that we update schedule 3 of the Telecommunications Act to ensure that it reflects that changing of community expectations, which is now reflected not just in decisions supporting councils under state law but also in the new code of practice under low-impact facilities. This particular amendment broadly picks up the wording of the ACIF code for low-impact facilities and inserts it into the provisions of the Telecommunications Act to deal with the facilities installation permits for facilities of national significance. As I have said, it is a provision which has not been used to date but it is a provision which sits there, it is an important power that the ACA has and it is essential that when the ACA exercises that power it is up to date with the most modern view of community expectations. The most modern view is that reflected in the ACIF code in respect of low-impact facilities and in the court decisions that we have seen in respect of high-impact facilities. I commend the amendment to the committee.",SENATE,<title>COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2003-09-09,"—I move opposition amendment (R3) on sheet 2954, which is an amendment to the Democrat amendment which has been moved by Senator Cherry:
Omit subparagraph (iii).
Labor's amendment to the Democrat amendment removes part (g)(iii) of that amendment. The Democrat amendment relates to the regulation of mobile phone towers, as we have heard from Senator Cherry. Senators who read their correspondence will be aware that the placement of mobile phone towers causes a great deal of angst in our communities. While the level of radiation emitted by these towers is tiny compared with the levels emitted by mobile phones themselves and there is no evidence as yet that these towers pose any health risk, it is wise to adopt a precautionary approach.
The regulation of mobile phone towers is a difficult balancing act for legislators. While some residents do not want mobile phone towers near their residences, many Australians do want and demand the decent mobile phone services that these towers provide. Labor is looking to further develop our own policy in this area and will, before the next election, seek to properly balance the need to roll out state-of-the-art telecommunications infrastructure with, for instance, the need to minimise mobile phone tower duplication where possible by encouraging co-location and the need for carriers to consider alternative sites when facing opposition from communities protesting about planned towers in areas that the community views as sensitive. 
The Democrat amendment largely draws from a code recently implemented by the Australian Communications Authority and ACIF that provides for greater community consultation regarding the deployment of mobile phone towers. Labor supports those parts of the amendment that simply seek to legislate the provisions of that moderate code or make them more enforceable. Given the level of community angst at present over mobile phone towers, it is not unreasonable to legislate a code developed by the industry over a long period of consultation. If industry genuinely supports their code, which they have been happily promoting, then they should have no issue with giving parts of that code some legislative teeth.
The part of the amendment Labor opposes, part (g)(iii), is not in the industry code. Labor is unsure of the term used by the Democrats, `beam of greatest intensity', and its scientific and legal application. We would prefer a proper consultation process, like that undertaken by AMTA and the MCF in developing their code and for that to be adopted before this provision becomes law. Labor therefore supports the Democrat amendment as amended by what Labor is proposing. We commend it to the committee.",SENATE,<title>COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2003-09-09,"—We believe that the amendment is unnecessary and that it will not be effective. As Senator Cherry pointed out in his own intervention in the debate, this provision, which relates only to the installation of facilities of national significance, has never been used. It does not particularly affect the low-impact facilities and other facilities that he referred to in his speech. I think Senator Cherry would accept that, by quoting those court cases, he has really shown that the low-impact facility exemption and its application are working. These councils are going to the courts and saying, `Hang on, that's not a low-impact facility; you can't use that exemption.' I found when I was in the portfolio that if you look closely at it, which I am sure Senator Lundy and Senator Cherry have done, the low-impact facility exemption is very well defined and, although carriers and the engineering firms that work for them come up with ingenious ways of trying to stretch the boundaries, it is pretty clear that where there is a problem, councils will take on the carriers. Generally, because of the adverse publicity that would be caused to a carrier that was trying to stretch the boundaries, they tended to concede before they got to court. Obviously, there have been a couple of cases recently where that has not happened.
The regime, which includes the code of conduct, the excellent work done by the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency and the ACIF code that has been developed with community, consumer and telecommunications company input, is a very good one. I am pleased to hear Senator Lundy's approach to this issue; it is certainly a more informed, practical and sensible approach than that taken by the former shadow minister, Stephen Smith, who wanted to play cheap politics with this issue. There is a need for a balancing act. There are very good communications reasons for having high-quality networks so that people do not suffer from call dropout. I think Senator Lundy would understand better than most people that, if you are trying to build wireless networks and develop Internet access over mobile phone networks, you need good quality networks that do not have shadows and holes in them. That does require comprehensive networks of mobile phone towers. But you do have to, as Senator Lundy said, balance that against community concerns and, particularly near schools, hospitals and high density areas, you need to find whatever possible practical solution you can to locate these facilities in a way that does not upset the community, create health concerns or upset the aesthetics of the community. 
Generally the regime has performed well in that regard but the government has shown that it is keen to keep ensuring it is matching community expectations against those balancing acts. Our position is that we will support the Labor amendment to Senator Cherry's amendment and then oppose it overall. But I understand from my quick headcount that what will happen is that the amended amendment will probably get the support of the majority if not the support of the government.",SENATE,<title>COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2003-09-09,"—I would like to note for the record that I will accept the Labor amendment. I wanted to note where that particular paragraph comes from. The issue of the beam of greatest intensity not going over a sensitive area is an issue raised in the Stewart report in the UK, particularly in relation to schools. I think the report came out in 2001. It is a matter that we need to look at in this country, possibly in a further revision of the ACIF code itself. Given the need to ensure that this provision is at least consistent with the ACIF code, I am prepared to concede that that is probably a bit ahead of where people are up to in the chamber at the moment. I certainly hope that we catch up to that position in the near future.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2003-09-09,"—The Health Legislation Amendment (Private Health Insurance Reform) Bill 2003 amends the National Health Act 1953 and the Private Health Insurance Incentives Act 1998. The amendments are designed to streamline the regulation of the private health insurance industry and provide consumers with better value for money. Labor supports these measures in the interests of good management of the private health insurance sector and fair treatment of Australian consumers and because the bill establishes better mechanisms for investigating and acting on any problems in the industry.
At present, registered health benefit organisations are required to submit all rule changes, no matter how insignificant, to the government for approval. This bill replaces this process with a more efficient system of monitoring and compliance. It contains the framework for a set of indicators to be established to ensure that the government retains the ability to effectively monitor the performance of registered health benefit organisations, including any breaches of the National Health Act. It gives the minister a broader range of investigative powers and administrative sanctions which may be used when a registered health benefit organisation, or RHBO, is found to be in breach of the NHA or is failing to meet government objectives—for example, breaching community rating obligations.
Importantly, the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman will be given increased powers to protect consumers by investigating complaints and resolving disputes. For instance, the bill provides that the RHBOs will be required to respond to requests for information or recommendations from the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman within a specified time frame, and the ombudsman will have the power to report the outcomes of an investigation to the minister and make recommendations on ways of dealing with specific  issues arising from an investigation. The ombudsman will be required to produce an annual `state of the health funds' report providing important information for government and consumers on how RHBOs are performing and how well they are serving their members. I think senators will agree that some of the work done by the ombudsman in the past has been very helpful to the Senate in its deliberations.
Lastly, the bill makes a number of minor improvements to the Lifetime Health Cover regulations. It establishes a notional annual birth date of 1 July, giving people some leeway before accruing Lifetime Health Cover loadings on their premiums. It provides that the gold card for veterans counts towards hospital cover for the purpose of calculating a Lifetime Health Cover loading, which ensures that our veterans are not unfairly hit with extra charges. New migrants over the age of 30, as well as Australians who are overseas on their notional 31st birthday, will have a fair 12 months to take up hospital cover without being subjected to a Lifetime Health Cover loading. And Australian citizens who have hospital cover and go overseas for longer than 12 months will not be penalised for their time away with a higher loading. These are all sensible measures that improve the regulation of the private health industry and give consumers better value for money and greater transparency. They will, I think, help build a better private health insurance system. For this reason, Labor will be supporting the bill.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2003-09-09,"—The Health Legislation Amendment (Private Health Insurance Reform) Bill 2003 amends the National Health Act 1953 and the Private Health Insurance Incentives Act 1998. Part 1 of schedule 1 of the bill will decrease the regulatory burden surrounding health fund product design. Currently health funds are required to seek approval from the Department of Health and Ageing for all changes to rules and/or products, no matter how insignificant. The bill will replace that process with a system of monitoring and enforcement through the establishment of a series of performance indicators designed to ensure that changes are consistent with government policy objectives and maintain the principle of community rating. Part 2 of schedule 1 of the bill provides the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman with increased powers to investigate complaints and resolve disputes. Lastly, part 4 of schedule 1 of the bill will make a number of minor changes to the Lifetime Health Cover regulations.
It is important to have a health system that is responsive to community needs, provides incentives to doctors to excel and innovate and, above all, has some ability to take the overflow from the public system. Therefore it is important to recognise that a mixed system of health can be useful and enhance quality. However, we should recognise that health is not, as Mr Graeme Samuel suggested in a paper to the National Competition Council, a free market. The public good of having healthy neighbours, healthy fellow travellers and healthy workers is immense, but as important is the sense of our values as a community. Do we, in our fairly wealthy nation, believe that all of us, irrespective of our income, should have access to good quality health care? The Australian community has made it clear that this is indeed a core value and that Prime Minister Howard should have made Medicare and public health a core promise that he would keep. Instead, we are expected to believe, as Mr Howard and the Minister for Health and Ageing, Senator Kay Patterson, dismantle our public health system in favour of a market-driven private system, that somehow this equates to the Australian value of egalitarianism in health care. 
Obviously it is important to have a good functioning private system as long as the purpose of that private health system is clear and the policy is coherent. In fact, we do not have clear goals for the private system, merely a confused morass of policies where sometimes the aim is to produce competition; hence we get the rhetoric of choice. And sometimes the aim is to take some overflow from the public system; hence the rhetoric of relieving pressure on the public system. At the same time that the government is trying to introduce more market signals through price in the public system it is also bending over backwards to control and regulate price and access in the private sector. Since the government has a 30 per cent investment in private health insurance, insurers have effectively become agents of Commonwealth health policies and insurers have been forced by government to limit the blatantly junk benefits in their ancillary products. Their premium increases are effectively controlled by cabinet and the minister has made it clear that management expenses are an issue that she is going to monitor.
In this regard it is interesting to note that in this year's health budget one of the most significant increases in spending is in Public Service administration. It increased from an estimated $778 million in 2002-03 to $884 million in 2003-04. That is a massive 13 per cent increase in administration. This is an increase of $106 million—and that is about half of the program budget for Aboriginal health, for instance, or more than the necessary budget for the childhood vaccinations, which have not been funded this year. This is an enormous increase and it would be absolutely hypocritical if the government were to criticise insurers for their seven per cent increase in premiums, two-thirds of which will be redistributed as benefits. I think this also demonstrates the value of the Senate: the ability to scrutinise government and its workings to ensure that power is used sensibly and that at all times taxpayer money is used for the good of the Australian community rather than wasted on a bureaucracy that is more and more being used to prop up the government in effectively a very inefficient public relations institution. I mean in no way to cast aspersions on the thousands of very professional and hardworking public servants but rather to criticise the purpose for which many of them are being used.  
Inefficiency is something that the minister has expressed concern about. Her press release of 2 April last year signalled her concern about the efficiency of the private health insurance sector. She said:
The review will consider ways of ensuring that health funds are as efficient and as competitive as possible to continue to deliver affordable premiums to members ... I have announced my review to ensure that health fund members continue to get maximum value for money from their 30 per cent discount on health fund premiums.
On 11 September she announced reforms to the private health insurance regime that would `make private health funds efficient and competitive, with the aim to deliver better value for money to fund members'. I think we can ask why, in the explanatory memorandum of the bill that we have before us, it is said that there are no significant financial implications for the Commonwealth. It appears that this is a result of six months work by a high-level task force—according to the first press release—but there are absolutely no financial implications. We might ask: what exactly is the importance of this legislation? What was the cost of this high-level task force and why did we have to have it? Does this mean that there are no efficiencies to be made or that the government decided that it was all just a bit too hard? Is it just another example of the government being unable or unwilling to take on business rather than consumers as a source of savings? I think this is symptomatic of the government's progress to date in all areas of health. 
Cost shifting to consumers has become an art form—one that is not shared by the Democrats—as a legitimate means of saving money. A more sensible and popular form of saving would be to remove the Lifetime Health Cover and to means test the private health insurance rebate. It is likely that immediately this would free up $500 million when the so-called `grudge purchasers'—who have been frightened into funding a system they would really prefer not to use—drop out of private health insurance. This would work wonders in freeing up taxpayers' money to be utilised for providing access to primary health care or dental services, to name two. The Democrats have found widespread support for reform of the primary health care system. The ideas that we floated with regard to the Commonwealth's providing walk-in, walk-out infrastructure to rural GPs, multidisciplinary health centres and different funding mechanisms have all been warmly received by many health policy and economic policy experts.
In contrast, in the public hearings of the Senate inquiry into Medicare there have been extremely few supporters of either the Medicare package or the private health insurance rebate in terms of the provisions of equitable access to health care. If we accept that this bill does not produce any savings to the Commonwealth—and that means no reductions in outlays for the 30 per cent rebate in out years—what does this bill provide for consumers, insurers or hospitals? It appears that the government has decided that the principle of community rating should be retained, despite its erosion through the implementation of Lifetime Health Cover. Let us remember that the principle of community rating predates Medicare. It was introduced in the 1950s, I understand, to ensure a flat rate of payment to health insurance as a means of ensuring access to health care for the poorer members of our society. However, Medicare went one step further by funding a public system through the income tax system. It is more progressive and ensures that the wealthy pay a higher proportion of income for their own care as well as subsidising the poor. 
This is what makes a mockery of the government's claims behind closed doors that Medicare is middle-class welfare. In fact, the middle-class are the group who pay for it. They typically fund not only their own care but that of the elderly and the poor as well. There is less reason to retain community rating as a principle when Medicare has replaced private health insurance as the core and fundamental funding mechanism for access to health services. Already we see that the principle of community rating is outdated. There is no reason to strengthen it in our view unless, of course, what this government intends to do is dismantle Medicare and return to private health insurance as the main funding mechanism for health services. This is a very real scenario and one that the Democrats are not prepared to countenance.
The Democrats did not support the passage of the 30 per cent rebate bill in 1998 and we do not support it now. We have heard in this place about the politicisation of the Public Service. In the case of private health insurance, the regulator of the insurers is also the policy adviser to the minister, which I think blurs the boundaries considerably, leaving the industry at the mercy of unpredictable political decisions. Now we have direct involvement by the minister in the administration of operational issues that affect the industry. In this bill, the minister is granted considerable discretion in determining whether insurers should be disciplined, as well as the powers to refuse loyalty benefits dependent on management expenses. There are no guidelines provided as to what the parameters are for the minister's discretion.
This government seems to have real problems deciding whether it wants a free market or a nationalised industry. Irrespective of that, I believe that greater transparency is important in this $2.3 billion investment by taxpayers. Taxpayers and industry should be able to see where the intervention of the minister and the Public Service occur and for what reasons. Perusal of the private health insurance web site and the Department of Health and Ageing's circulars reveals an extraordinary lack of guidance by the department in terms of how they interpret in operational terms the regulations for private health insurance. In stark contrast to other agencies with regulatory powers, such as the Australian Taxation Office, there is absolutely no information on how the department interpret the law. I do not believe this should be allowed to continue, given the size of the government investment and the lack of certainty this provides to insurers, hospitals and manufacturers. At best there appears to be a conspiracy of silence.
I will therefore be moving amendments to make more transparent the operation of the Department of Health and Ageing and the minister with regard to the operation of private health insurance. If indeed the insurance industry is effectively an instrument of government policies then the Democrats want the interventions of the minister and her department available for scrutiny. I will also be moving a second reading amendment which calls on the government to study the replacement of the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate with a capped and means tested rebate in line with the Private Health Insurance Incentives Scheme previously in place and the removal of the Lifetime Health Cover age loading on premiums. I move: 
At the end of the motion, add:
“but the Senate accepts that while private health insurance will continue to be important in people's health choices should they wish to pay for it, it calls on the Government to limit the use of taxpayer subsidies of private health insurance by:
(a)	replacing the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate with a capped and means-tested rebate in line with the private health insurance incentive scheme previously in place; and
(b)	removing Lifetime Health Cover age loadings on premiums”.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE REFORM) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2003-09-09,"—The next decade in Australia's health system will probably be as challenging as the last decade. We have an ageing population, medical technology is advancing in a rapid and costly fashion and we have a significant undersupply of health professionals. The health system in this country, and the public health system particularly, is feeling the weight of these changes. Undoubtedly that weight will make the quality of health care significantly lower for Australians unless changes are made. The government has recognised this factor and has formulated affordable solutions that I think will shore up the future of public health in this country. A number of those changes, despite being held up or blocked in this place, are extremely important in ensuring that Australians can continue to look forward to a high quality, and indeed world-class, health system.
In speaking in favour of the Health Legislation Amendment (Private Health Insurance Reform) Bill 2003, a certain degree of weariness attaches to one's remarks. This chamber has already blocked necessary changes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and is likely to reject the government's Medicare reform package, if comments today are anything to go by. The only bright sign in this debate is that state and territory Labor governments have accepted the government's offer in the Australian health care agreements and have returned to their respective states sobbing and wringing their hands, but with the $10 billion extra for the public health system very firmly in their pockets and the 17 per cent increase factored into their forward estimates.
At the heart of this government's private health insurance agenda is a determination to provide Australian families with choice and, by doing so, to ease the burden on Australia's public hospitals. The coalition government has already taken significant steps in achieving this through a range of measures including the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate, Lifetime Health Cover and the no gap, known gap scheme. This bill is a continuation of this and I think provides practical, sensible changes that reflect the realities of Australia's private health insurance industry. These changes will benefit all stakeholders whether public or private in the nature of their requirements and, most importantly, consumers will benefit in a range of fields and those consumers will be able to take advantage of these changes with negligible impact on their own pockets. If we look at what the bill proposes we can see very sensible changes to the present regime.
One weakness in the private health insurance market, and this applies across all Western societies, is that product differentiation and information is heavily weighted in favour of the health funds themselves. Subsequently, members of those funds generally switch funds fairly infrequently and the main objective of competition in this market is to sign up new members rather than to take members from one fund to another. This bill attempts to address that lack of competition in a crucial field by establishing a state of the health funds report that will allow consumers to easily compare the prices, products and performance of the various health funds available in this country. The bill will establish also a notional birthday for the purposes of Lifetime Health Cover. This is a simple but effective measure that will provide an arena for competition in the signing up of new members. 
It is worth reflecting for a moment on the benefits of having a state of the health funds report. At the present time the consumer is forced to wade through a veritable jungle of literature and statistics provided by the health funds themselves and occasionally by other parties that often do not compare apples with apples. By having easy to read comparative information at the disposal of consumers, competition in the private health insurance industry is likely, I believe, to increase significantly. Furthermore, the administrative burden to provide this information should prove negligible as the funds already have this information within their own databases. The only difference will be that in future they will have to compile it in a readable form. I stress, however, that it is important that this information be presented in a way that does not put an overemphasis on price, keeping in mind that there have been recent unfortunate experiences when looking purely at the price of premiums charged by health funds. I note that in the last few years the Australian Consumers Association, through its magazine Choice, did a survey of health funds and recommended a couple of, I think, Victorian based funds as their best buys with respect to private health insurance. Unfortunately, not very long after those recommendations were made both funds folded and presumably occasioned some inconvenience and perhaps loss to the people who had paid premiums to them. I am sure this chamber has not forgotten the fate of OneTel and Impulse Airlines, both of whom used a similar strategy. It is important not to look merely at price. But understanding what issues face consumers on questions other than price is difficult. What this bill proposes, with a state of the health funds report, gives consumers the opportunity to judge those things on a reasonable and rational basis.
In order that private health funds can compete effectively there must be an absence of onerous, outdated and overly bureaucratic regulations. This is true in any industry. At present, health funds have to submit every change, no matter how insignificant, to the Department of Health and Ageing for approval. Under this bill, funds will have the flexibility to respond to consumer needs without unnecessary paperwork while being monitored by a strengthened private health insurance ombudsman who will penalise health funds if they do not adhere to performance indicators.
Whether or not this bill is passed, the private health insurance industry in Australia will remain one of the most heavily regulated in the Western world. For example, the Department of Health and Ageing will continue to ultimately determine the extent of premium rises and the community rating regime will be retained. Compliance with the latter contributes a large part to the funds' administrative burden but it does retain bipartisan support. On the question of community rating, it is worth reminding this place that the aim of community rating is to keep private health insurance and cover affordable for high-risk consumers. By not allowing premiums to rise or fall based on individual circumstances, low-risk customers, particularly the young and the healthy, subsidise in effect high-risk customers—the old and the sick most particularly. However, the health funds have circumvented this somewhat in recent years by the offering of low-coverage low-price plans that are aimed in advertising packages very particularly at young people. Although this has undermined to some extent the cross-subsidisation objective of community rating, I think there are other ways of addressing the problem that that presents. For example, by taking steps to reduce the amount of red tape associated with the administration of those funds—an issue which this bill very directly addresses—some pressure is placed on those premiums to come down. This proportionately benefits the sick and the old. 
I think that the figures available to us indicate very clearly that the government's approach to private health insurance is working. Under the Howard government the total growth in public hospital admissions has been around six per cent. The last five years of Labor produced a growth in public hospital admissions of a total of 22 per cent. An increase of that kind of course is entirely unsustainable and that is why this government took the decision to act and to change those parameters. Between 1996 and 2000—although there is some difference in these figures depending on where they come from—there was a 10 per cent increase in the number of people with private hospital cover. Under the Hawke and Keating governments it decreased in total by something in the order of 30 per cent. Some may see that as ideologically appropriate, but whatever one's view there is no doubt that it was having a significant effect on hospital waiting lists and the quality of services being provided in Australia's public hospitals.
There is no doubt that the changes that have been effected by this government have had a significant effect on public hospital waiting lists—not that one would understand that from the rhetoric of state Labor governments. They have crowed consistently about good results in public hospital waiting lists without giving adequate credit to what is at least part of the source of that improvement, the shift in the number of people in this country who are moving to have operations conducted in private hospitals and privately generally. Separations in private hospitals have increased by more than 450,000 over the last two years alone. I ask members of this place to imagine what would happen if those 450,000 operations had been shifted into the public hospitals of this country. Clearly some of them would not have been shifted because they would have been elective in nature, but many were not; and, undoubtedly, without those incentives the pressure on public hospitals would have been absolutely enormous.
Today, private hospitals are providing 60 per cent of major joint replacements, 50 per cent of chemotherapy in Australia, 53 per cent of procedures for malignant breast conditions and 70 per cent of major eye lens procedures. These are not marginal or cosmetic in nature. They are not optional in the case of many people. These are important and central to the health and wellbeing of many people, and they are being provided for in Australia's private hospitals.
Senator Allison in this debate made the point that she felt that very few of the submissions to the Senate Select Committee on Medicare supported the government's reforms to private health insurance. I will concede that a number of organisations made that point, although they were organisations from whom I would have expected no other point of view to be forthcoming. However, there are two important points to make about that. One is that support for private health insurance measures did come from doctors' organisations. I think all of them, with the exception of bodies like the Doctors Reform Society, put on record their support for the measures the government has taken to encourage the level of private health insurance. Bear in mind that doctors themselves do not benefit in the same way from measures that encourage people to use private hospitals. There is a different level of support or benefit that flows to doctors from that kind of measure. 
The other point is that it became clear from evidence that the committee received that there was a major problem in glibly promising to abolish the government's private health insurance rebate of 30 per cent, that doing so was not simply a matter—as some organisations purported it was—of taking the $2.3 billion or $2.4 billion that it costs the taxpayer each year to provide that rebate and transferring it to, say, the public hospital sector. In fact, the cost of abolishing the rebate could be of an order much greater than the $2.3 billion or $2.4 billion. On the estimates of the private health industry itself, it could be between $4 billion and $5.5 billion.
—They would say that, though, wouldn't they?
—Well, they would say that. But the critical question, Senator, is what you will say about it when you have the chance to say something about it. We are yet to see whether you and your party will decide to bite the bullet and agree to abolish the federal government's private health insurance rebate.
—You will be the first to know.
—I would like to be sure that I and other consumers of health services in this country know before the next election comes around and that we understand very clearly what you propose to do about that rebate. In my electorate, the ACT, there is a very high take-up rate of that rebate. The cost of abolishing the rebate to each family in this country with private health insurance would be somewhere between $800 and $1,000. If you want to promise to abolish the rebate in the ACT, I look forward to being able to go out into the ACT community to tell them what effect that is going to have on both the pockets of families and the hospital waiting lists of the ACT. I very much look forward to seeing what those opposite have to say in due course about private health insurance.
The passing of this bill will increase competition among health funds, will encourage consumer protection and will significantly reduce the administrative burden on health funds in this country. In that sense, improving the delivery of those services to the community will be enhanced. Most importantly, it will aid in the maintenance of a viable private health industry, which has done so much to ease the burden on public hospitals in this country. I think that kind of change can only be for the better, and I hope that this bill receives the support it deserves to improve the quality of those health services in both the public and private sectors in this country.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE REFORM) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2003-09-09,"—The Health Legislation Amendment (Private Health Insurance Reform) Bill 2003 reduces government scrutiny of private health insurance funds under the guise of easing their administrative burden. The government tells us that this will cut costs for funds, allowing them to become more competitive, thereby benefiting consumers. Where health funds now are required to submit details of their insurance products to the government for assessment, they will under this legislation face strategic monitoring and possible sanctions. The government has already distanced itself from responsibility for premium increases by automatically allowing annual rises. Now the government wants to further weaken public scrutiny. The details of the strategic monitoring, and the performance indicators that will be the benchmark for it, are to be dealt with by regulations which are not before the Senate, so our consideration of the legislation is hampered from the outset. 
The Private Health Insurance Ombudsman, John Powlay, admitted on Radio National last month that the claimed improvements in his powers under this legislation were simply a clarification of existing provisions. Substituting strategic monitoring for direct oversight is doubly troubling when so much public money is being thrown at propping up the private health industry through the private health insurance rebate. The rebate costs almost $2.3 billion per year, but the full cost of the measure is higher. The Australia Institute has estimated that around $1.1 billion is lost in government taxation forgone if high-income earners take out private cover to avoid the Medicare levy surcharge. There are additional costs to Medicare and for pharmaceutical expenses associated with higher private hospital use and, of course, there is all the money that is being spent on the government's advertising campaign for the rebate and lifetime health cover.
The private health insurance rebate is a scandalous waste of public money in an area where government spending, we are told, is so often stretched for resources. That is why the Greens will be moving an amendment in the committee stage of this bill to abolish the private health insurance rebate. The government claims that we cannot afford the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme without increasing the copayment for patients by 28 per cent, imposing hardship on low-income earners and people with chronic medical conditions, but it is happy to spend billions each year to underwrite private health insurance under the ideology of maximising choice. The private health insurance rebate provides a 30 per cent subsidy of premiums for hospitals and some ancillary health insurance products. It does not purchase a single health service; it buys insurance. Because there is no cap on the rebate, it constitutes an open-ended industry subsidy at a time when our public health system urgently needs funds.
The private health insurance industry lost members in the 1980s and 1990s after the introduction of Medicare and because of premium increases of more than 10 per cent a year. The industry claimed that, by increasing membership levels, it could stabilise premiums. But a rise in membership to 45.7 per cent of Australians of September 2000 did not prevent the funds from seeking and being granted hefty premium increases last year. Nor has the government's policy of a rebate coupled with financial penalties through the Medicare levy surcharge and the lifetime community rating stabilised membership. The latest figures released by the Private Health Insurance Administration Council last month showed another fall in membership, to 43.4 per cent in June this year.
Canberra University academic Ian McAuley has recently calculated that from September 2000, when the aged based premium penalties commenced, to March this year the funds lost 317,000 members under the age of 54 while they gained 225,000 older members. This trend is clearly unsustainable. Yet we are now being told that fiddling at the margins will help the industry. The fact of the matter is that Australians are voting with their feet: they are dropping their private health insurance cover. Australians want the government to strengthen—not weaken—Medicare and our public health system. 
The current government policy is clearly inequitable. Most of the funds spent on the rebate benefit high-income earners. A report by Julie Smith for the Australia Institute in October 2001 found that approximately half of the private health insurance rebate goes to the top 20 per cent of taxpayers and nearly three-quarters of the rebate goes to the top 40 per cent of taxpayers. They receive this money regardless of their health needs because the rebate is used to buy insurance, not to pay directly for health services. 
The Greens acknowledge that some people on low and middle incomes struggle to pay for private health insurance. They do it for peace of mind, because they fear that the public system will not be able to provide the care that they need when they need it. They take out private insurance so that they can jump the queue of public patients. This fear undermines the collective agreement to provide for each other on the basis of need and not ability to pay. It is an indictment of government spending priorities, in federal and state spheres, that people should have so little confidence in the ability of their public health system to provide quality care. The more that the Howard government tells people that the public system is overburdened, under strain and cannot cope, the more it undermines the collective commitment to public health care. The more money it throws at private health insurance and the more often it tells people to pay their own way, the more it erodes the value to all Australians of our national health insurance scheme, Medicare. This is part of laying the groundwork for Australians to accept the end of Medicare. That is what the government's Medicare package does: it turns Medicare into a safety net. 
Now we have the Private Health Insurance Association mounting a campaign to retain the rebate. It has sent letters to millions of policyholders, telling them that the rebate is under threat and that they need to campaign to keep it. Last month the industry's peak body, the Australian Health Insurance Association, made the patently ridiculous claim that the rebate had `saved Australia's hospital system from collapsing'. In fact, the rebate is endangering our public health care system. In a paper to the Australian health care summit in Canberra in August, Australian health professor Stephen Leeder said that the government's Medicare package disproportionately favours those who can afford private health insurance. He pointed to research that shows that private spending in health care drags public money with it, further eroding the principle of equity which should be the foundation of our health care system. As he observed, the private health insurance rebate has increased government spending on health but it has not improved equity because public funds go inequitably to those with private cover, mostly high-income earners. The rebate now accounts for around 17 per cent of total funding to the private hospital sector—a sector that is dominated by for-profit entities, which account for 56 per cent of the sector by ownership and are mostly publicly listed groups. These companies exist to make a profit; that is their business. And the federal government is pumping an uncapped amount of public money to fund 30 per cent of the private insurance premiums that directly provide benefit to these companies.
The government argues that the rebate has reduced pressure on the public hospital system, but it makes this claim without foundation. La Trobe University Professor of Health Policy, Stephen Duckett, told the Senate Medicare inquiry that the rebate constituted a government payment of more than $10,000 per additional patient treated through private hospitals, more than three times the average cost per patient treated in a public hospital. He said: 
Direct support for public hospitals is clearly a more efficient way of assisting public hospitals than an indirect policy such as the rebate.
Monash University health economist Jeff Richardson told the health care summit that Australians have been deceived for 15 years. We have been told that a fall in private health insurance has put pressure on the public system and so the response should be to reverse the slide. But he said that the real reason for the pressure on our public system and waiting lists for treatment was government spending cuts. State and territory governments must share the blame for this, but it also suits the Howard government's agenda to cut health funds to the states and territories. We saw this with the government's slicing of almost $1 billion from the forward estimates for the Australian health care agreements on the basis that higher private hospital admissions reduce pressure on public hospitals, which of course we know to be untrue. Private hospital admissions have increased dramatically but public hospital admissions have hardly shifted.
The Greens are not surprised by the Commonwealth government's agenda to retain the rebate regardless of the damage it is doing, but we are surprised that the federal Labor Party cannot decide where it stands on the matter. This is despite the view of the majority of state and territory Labor governments conveyed to the Senate Medicare inquiry that the private health insurance rebate is a failure. Leader of the Opposition, Simon Crean, when asked in July about the future of the rebate under a Labor government, said:
... what we should be doing is looking for better ways to spend that money.
All the evidence shows that the private health insurance rebate is a waste of scarce health dollars and that the funds would be better spent on public health services for all Australians.
Shadow Treasurer Mark Latham has previously spoken against the rebate, saying that there is no crisis in private health insurance and that the rebate is unnecessary. ACTU President Sharan Burrow told the ACTU congress last month that the rebate `deprives our public hospitals of critical resources, undermines a universal public health system and is paid for from the taxes of too many working people who can't afford private health cover', yet Simon Crean refuses to commit Labor to abolish the rebate.
There are suggestions that Labor may propose a means test, but what good is that? I note the second reading amendment from the Australian Democrats in relation to means testing the rebate. Means testing of the rebate may reduce the total cost to the Commonwealth budget, but the very people who are likely to be eligible under a means-tested rebate—that is, low- to middle-income earners—are the people who need public health care the most. It is time for Labor to commit to abolishing the rebate and redirecting the funds to public health to defend and extend Medicare. This is what the Australian Greens are committed to doing. We want to redirect the rebate to where it is needed and to where it provides the best value for money. We have proposed using the savings to increase the GP rebate, to encourage bulk-billing for GPs, to extend Medicare to dental health and more mental health services, and to improve public hospital services.
Under the rebate, every Australian is subsidising the cost of private dental cover. In 1998, it cost the public $300 million, but only a portion of Australians benefit from this subsidy for dental cover—that is, those with private health insurance. Yet we know that for less than half of the current cost of the rebate—that is, around $1.13 billion a year—Australia could provide dental treatment for all. This is just one example of the unfair distribution of health care under the rebate. We should be funding services to redress the disparity in health outcomes for people who live outside of major cities or who are marginalised—Indigenous Australians, whose health outcomes are appalling; people with disabilities; people who suffer from mental illness; unemployed people; and low-income earners. 
A report by the New South Wales Cancer Council last month concluded that people in poorer socioeconomic areas are more likely to die once they are diagnosed with cancer and that delays in diagnosis were considered to be one of the factors in the difference. This is unacceptable in a nation as affluent as Australia. There is no question that $2.3 billion a year of taxpayers' money could buy a great deal for public health, but the government prefers to spend public funds propping up an industry that gambles on whether people are sick. Let us make no mistake about the government's agenda nor fail to understand the consequences of it. Our public hospitals are stretched and in some parts of Australia there are no GPs who bulk-bill. We can expect more of this under Prime Minister Howard. The government claims to be concerned with cost, but squeezing public health spending and forcing more people to spend directly on their health care will not reduce overall spending. In fact, it is more likely to increase the total cost of health care at the same time as it reduces the purchasing power of each dollar spent.
The United States spends around 14 per cent of its gross domestic product on health, yet almost 42 million of its people have no cover. In Australia, we spend around nine per cent of GDP and, while we have many problems, our system is much better than that of the United States. The cost of ensuring that all Australians have access to quality health care no matter where they live is not cheap, but money spent on public health is an investment in the health of the nation and of its people.
The Greens recognise the importance of being economically responsible, but a focus on finances alone will lead neither to good social outcomes nor to good economic outcomes. Australians, unlike our Prime Minister, understand that health care is not like any other product that might be purchased in the marketplace. They believe in the social good that a strong, well-funded public health care system delivers. Australians deserve better than this government intends to give them by turning Medicare into a safety net and forcing everyone else into private health cover. The private health insurance rebate is integral to the government's strategy. It undermines Medicare and it must be abolished. The Australian Greens will continue to campaign for an end to the rebate, to resist the Howard government's drive to privatise our health system and to make Medicare stronger for all Australians.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE REFORM) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Lees, Sen Meg",APA,2003-09-09,"—It seems that today there is general support by all sections of the chamber for the Health Legislation Amendment (Private Health Insurance Reform) Bill 2003. I will not speak for very long, but I want to make a couple of points. It is yet another example of what is almost an obsession of this government with private health insurance. Again we are tinkering with the rules to try and somehow make it more efficient and effective. The fact that the most efficient and effective system is our Medicare system seems to escape those who are drawing up our health policy and health legislation.
This bill effectively changes the way in which community rating will be assessed and monitored. Community rating is basically the system that makes sure that funds provide support for, and accept as members, those Australians who are the sickest. Obviously, they are the most expensive members of our community, and the funds would much prefer to have as members of their insured community people who are fit and well and who therefore rarely call on their finances for support. 
I think the legislation will go through without any dissent. After listening to the previous speakers, I think there is a range of issues, but it will all come back to the health system itself and its structure—which is what the three-day health summit was about—rather than just funding. It will come back to looking at how the system is actually structured. This government seems to be locked into a silo-by-silo model where it is a matter of private versus public and states versus the Commonwealth, where there are a lot of opportunities to pass the buck, to pass the blame to somebody else when something goes wrong, to shift costs if possible. Indeed, in various Senate inquiries we have found people actually employed out there to do nothing but shift costs from one level of government to the other. This all makes for an enormous amount of waste, for considerable inefficiency. We can still all confidently say that our health system is a good one, but some major problems are emerging and some major cracks are appearing. Perhaps the most obvious is that now we rank only 17th in the world when it comes to equity of access.
It would be a really pleasant change for us in this chamber to spend some time debating those health issues that are really critical. If we as a nation, as a community, actually want to begin with our highest priority, I would argue that we should begin with those Australians who are the sickest—look at where the system is failing them and look at how we as a nation should begin to do something for those amongst us that are faced with chronic illness.
There is no group in our community as badly off for basic services as Indigenous Australians. Yet we know what works. It is not a matter of saying that we need another trial or saying that we should go out and have another committee inquiry. We know that what works are community Aboriginal-controlled health services where Indigenous peoples have a say in the level of services in various areas and set their priorities. We know this works. Looking at the funds pooling model in the Territory, we know what works, we know where there are really good and positive results. I congratulate this government for increasing the amount of money that has gone to Indigenous health, but these new funding models, these pool funding systems, can only operate in 10 out of the 21 Northern Territory zones, because we only have about half the funding we need to make sure that all the Indigenous communities out there have access just to the same level of services, the same amount of money, as the rest of us.
I say this to the government: while this piece of legislation will obviously get through today, how about bringing before us some ideas, some extra funding packages? Let us really concentrate on the areas of our health system that are in need, not have yet another example of tinkering with private health insurance and somehow hoping that we will get a model that is sustainable without the billions of dollars of subsidy that the government is pouring into it at the moment.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE REFORM) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2003-09-09,"—As has been already stated, the opposition supports the Health Legislation Amendment (Private Health Insurance Reform) Bill 2003. The bill is fairly non-controversial. It makes a number of technical changes in respect of the operation of private health insurance. From the second reading speech tabled on behalf of the Minister for Health and Ageing, I note particularly that it is intended to `drive increased value for money in private health insurance'. That is a noble objective. Anyone who takes out private health insurance in this country at the moment, and has done so for some years, knows that it does not give the best value for money. Many people who have been paying into private health insurance for years recognise that they have been paying substantial premiums, in many cases for very little return. Often the level of the refund provided by a fund for expenses—particularly in the ancillary areas such as physiotherapy, dental, orthodontics and optometry—is less than 50 per cent of the total price that is charged. Furthermore, in a number of cases you will find that there are annual caps in respect of the refunds that are paid. 
So, while private health insurance is clearly recognised, and has always been recognised, as an inherent part of the health system, it is not and has not been for many years the best value for money. That is why of course at various periods in our history many people have dropped out of health insurance, particularly following substantial and regular premium increases. It is a sad fact too that under this government, despite the massive subsidy provided to the private health insurance industry—a 30 per cent rebate—premiums have continued to increase at substantial levels well above CPI increases. The funds have taken other steps to put more limitations on some of the refunds or payments that they would make by introducing additional excesses in respect of claims. There has also been an explosion in the take-up of private health insurance as a means of getting around having to pay the government's tax penalty if you happen to be in an income bracket where, if you do not have private health insurance, you have to pay an additional tax.
Evidence presented to the Senate Select Committee on Medicare, of which I am a member, has demonstrated that there is a lot of concern out there in the community about how private health insurance is operating in this country. There are concerns about premiums, concerns about the quality of the product, concerns about the massive amount going into the rebate and concerns about the fact that it has not achieved what it set out to achieve—a substantial increase in private health insurance cover. Furthermore, as the states have pointed out, under the federal government's attacks on Medicare, more and more people are utilising public hospitals, whether it be the emergency and accident service or other public services, even though they have private health insurance and might be able to have those procedures undertaken in a private hospital. There is a lot of concern in the community about the current state of the private health insurance sector.
However, I have to say—and it is the purpose I have risen to speak briefly in this debate—that it is not appropriate to use this legislation, in the way that the Greens have, to propose that we just abolish the 30 per cent rebate. That is the effect of their amendment, and no doubt we will come to that in the committee stage. I acknowledge that would be a very blunt instrument that would have a substantial impact upon a lot of people in this country who have taken out insurance or who are contemplating doing so. 
Moreover, what is missing from the proposal in the Greens amendment is what should then happen to the $2½ billion to $3 billion—and it is growing—and where should it be redirected to in the health sector. There is no indication in the Greens amendment about what should be done with that money. Again, in the Senate select committee hearings—and the committee is due to report in a few weeks time—a lot of proposals have been put forward about how the rebate might be treated in the future. We have heard all the arguments, from those who solidly support it and want it maintained to those who want it abolished, and in between that there is an infinite range of proposals about means testing, capping, reducing the rebate and utilising the savings in other areas. For instance, more money could be utilised for public hospitals or put into related health services such as dental care. 
This amendment is untimely. Indeed, I think I have to be more blunt than that and say that this is just a stunt. I think it would be of great value to the Senate to have before it the findings of the select committee looking at this issue in the total context of Medicare and the health system. We should await the outcome of the report of the Senate select committee before we even move to consider such a proposal that the Greens have advanced today. I do not disagree with a number of the arguments that Senator Nettle has put forward about the problems. I have already highlighted some of those myself. But I wanted to rise on this occasion to make it absolutely clear that we will not support that amendment. It is not appropriate that it be moved in this legislation and, moreover, this is too serious an issue to just put up an all-or-nothing proposal to abolish the rebate without having any alternative, any plan or any strategy for how that money might otherwise be better utilised.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE REFORM) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2003-09-09,"—I would like to thank senators for their input—I am not sure that I agree with their input but I thank them for their input—to the debate on the Health Legislation Amendment (Private Health Insurance Reform) Bill 2003. I cannot not respond to Senator Forshaw talking about our attack on Medicare. That is outrageous. It is $917 million to strengthen Medicare—$917 million to increase the number of doctors. It is amazing that the Labor Party has taken up a significant part of our package: increasing the number of medical students by 234, increasing the number of GP registrars by 150 and increasing the number of practices that will have practice nurses assisting them. There will be 800 new practices in outer metropolitan areas. They have accepted those as part of strengthening Medicare.
The other issue that has concerned me, but does not seem to have concerned the Labor Party, is that there are people in Australia who never get to see a bulk-billing doctor who are on incomes significantly lower than many people who can get to see a bulk-billing doctor. I have bulk-billing doctors within walking distance of my home, but there are people on very low incomes—on pensions—who cannot get access to a bulk-billing doctor. But the Labor Party does not care about that; it cares about headline bulk-billing rates and not about access and affordability—particularly affordability for people on low incomes. So for Senator Forshaw to stand up here and say that we are attacking Medicare is outrageous.
The Labor Party also refuses to accept that the bill will provide a safety net for the 30,000 people on health care cards with expenses of over $500. The bill will test the Labor Party. The 30,000 people with $500 out-of-pocket, out-of-hospital expenses will receive assistance in the form of the government paying 80 per cent of their out-of-pocket expenses. There will also be help for people who are not on a health care card and who cannot insure now against out-of-pocket, out-of-hospital expenses. There are 50,000 people who have expenses over $1,000. For some young families with mortgages, a bill of $3,000 in out-of-pocket expenses can hit you like a tsunami. 
—Do something about it. Do something about bulk-billing.
—Senator Forshaw ought to interject on things he knows something about. The gaps are usually for non-GP services. Since we have come into government and since we have introduced changes to private health insurance, we have now seen four out of five in-patient episodes in hospitals with no gap. Guess what it was under Labor? Zero. So do not talk to me about gaps. Labor had zero visits to hospitals without a gap; we have now achieved four out of five visits to private hospitals by those with private health insurance without the gap. So those people who pay more than $1,000 on out-of-hospital services—chemotherapy, radiotherapy or other areas—will be able to insure against it. That is the package. It is strengthening Medicare, not destroying it.
Senators may recall that I announced on 2 April that we would reform the regulation of the private health insurance industry. A review was established to consider if the current rules and regulations delivered the best outcomes for fund members. In September 2003 I announced a series of government decisions arising from stage 1 of the review. The amendments to health legislation required to implement a range of these recommendations are set out in this bill.
A key finding of the review was that the current legislative framework for the consideration of changes to health fund rules: limited the ability of health funds to respond expeditiously to changes in the market; added a level of uncertainty in health funds' planning processes and risk management; was administratively cumbersome for both the health funds and the department; had the potential to stifle innovation in product design; and tended to hinder the efficiency of the private health insurance industry.
As a result, the government decided to amend the rules approval process to reduce the regulatory burden on funds. However, it was considered important that any deregulation be offset by the introduction of measures to ensure health fund compliance with obligations such as not to discriminate on the grounds of a person's age, sex or health status. Deregulation is also balanced with the introduction of a new enforcement and sanctions regime. Previously, the powers under the act in relation to monitoring and enforcement did not enable a range of actions proportionate to the issue of concern. The amendments, including those increasing the minister's discretion, will allow timely, flexible and proportional responses to possible breaches of the act.
Many of the items in this bill relocate existing provisions to provide a cohesive and transparent framework that will make the new system more readily understandable to the industry. The only new powers provided to the minister are: requesting a health fund to enter into enforceable undertakings; the ability to remove the 30 per cent rebate as a premium reduction; and the ability to apply to the Federal Court for an order to redress a breach of the National Health Act.
The option to revoke a fund's capacity to claim the 30 per cent rebate is limited to cases where a fund is in breach of the principles of community rating. While this would never be used lightly, the power of revocation is a very important deterrent to health funds. If a health fund were ever to lose its right to offer the 30 per cent rebate as a premium reduction, contributors could still access the 30 per cent rebate either by receiving a direct payment through their local Medicare office or by claiming it back via their tax return. Members would get their rebate, but some of the benefits of the fund being able to give it back to their members in a timely and easy way would be taken away. 
Health fund members can also vote with their feet and join another health fund without any loss of rights. I remind people that it was the coalition government that brought in the amendment so that people could move from one health fund to another without having to complete a new waiting period. It means increased competition, making funds more responsive. It means that people can move from one fund to another if a fund is not giving them the sort of service or product that they want.
The bill proposes amendments to Lifetime Health Cover. When I was looking at the issue of private health insurance, I was cognisant that we had had a very significant advertising campaign for Lifetime Health Cover when it came in. The cohort of young people were very aware through the campaign using the umbrella that they needed to join a private health insurance fund early if they were to benefit from lower premiums as they moved through the age groups. Having been a member of a fund since my student days, I thought it was important, as I would object at 60 or 70 to find someone coming into a fund and being a member for only a year getting exactly the same benefit as someone who had been a member all their life.
Lifetime Health Cover was introduced to share the membership across a lifetime and, for those who joined early, to have some benefit from having joined early. We wanted to make sure that they knew about it. I suggested to the funds that we should have a `horse's birthday'—that we would assume that everyone turned a certain age on the same day—which would mean that the funds could advertise in a concerted way the fact that it was important for young people to understand the potential impact of Lifetime Health Cover and would assist them in recruiting members to private health insurance. This would help maintain a balanced age profile across the industry and contribute to the ongoing viability of the sector. This is a minor but important amendment in that one message can go out rather than having to repeat it all year round as young people have their birthdays.
Other amendments proposed in the bill address minor anomalies that only became apparent after the introduction and implementation of Lifetime Health Cover. These anomalies primarily relate to the grace period allowed by the LHC for veterans, new migrants and Australians living overseas. Finally, I would emphasise that the bill does not alter the community rating obligations of funds. It consolidates and clarifies existing provisions of the act and, as such, it is not expected to have any fiscal implications for the funds or the government. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Murphy, Sen Shayne",IND,2003-09-09,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
The annual report of the Office of the Renewable Energy Regulator contains some interesting reading. With regard to renewable energy per se and this report of the regulator, there are some interesting statistics contained in the report. What is important is that the report does in part show that in respect of renewable energy generation there has been a significant focus on cogeneration by the companies involved with renewable energy. Page 6 of the report sets out summary statistics for accreditation by 31 December 2001 and by 31 December 2002. Bagasse cogeneration went from seven to 25. That is different from, say, wind, which went from 10 to 14.
This is one of the important things about the renewable energy accreditation process. It is important that the level was set at two per cent of energy to be renewable energy by 2010. Even in this report, it is clearly evident that that target is way below what we ought to be seeking to achieve. I hope that at some point in time when we get to the review process the parliament will see fit to increase the renewable energy credits system. Rather than being two per cent, it should be increased by an additional 10 per cent. If we are to really drive renewable energy in this country, that is what is going to be important. 
The target has been surpassed, so it is even more important that we take the approach of increasing the target to a level that will drive investment in real renewable energy. That is critically important. In this country, renewable energy is very important from a long-term economic point of view. In the northern part of the country, we have a significant amount of sunshine, but we are not seeing a greater requirement in the use of energy from the sun. Likewise, in my state, Tasmania, we have established one reasonable-size wind farm, but we are not seeking to increase the amount of wind farms to generate much more electricity from what is probably one of the better renewable energy sources. In Tasmania, of course, we have a hydro power system which is water generated and which is very good, but it is subject to rain. Sometimes it can also have a significant impact on the environment when we do not get rain. The dams that provide that source of energy can get very low, and that has significant impacts in other areas.
The report is welcome, but I hope that at some point in time we will see a parliament that is prepared to actually set some targets for renewable energy that will be more representative of a country that really has a commitment to renewable energy per se.

"Ferris, Sen Jeannie",LP,2003-09-09,"—I want to speak about one of the greatest abuses of corporate power that I have seen since the collapse of the South Australian State Bank in 1991 and the corporate excesses at that time of Tim Marcus-Clarke. The Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee inquiry into Australian Wool Innovation and the expenditure of funds under AWI's Statutory Funding Agreement has exposed evidence of the most serious misuse of power by the former Managing Director, Mr Colin Dorber. 
Two weeks ago the President of WoolProducers, the peak representative body for wool growers in Australia, Mr Simon Campbell, came to Canberra to give evidence to the Senate inquiry. The evidence of the corporate excesses that Mr Campbell heard that day led him to say:
I have found today's extraordinary evidence disturbing—as will growers. Growers and my members are going to find things that are either not best practice, illegal or morally repugnant.
`Morally repugnant' is an appropriate way to sum up what transpired under the former management of AWI. At times during the evidence I felt nauseated as I learned the full extent of the abuse and disgraceful waste of wool growers' money by the former management. When Mr Campbell was asked for his view on a number of other allegations made, he said:
It takes rather a lot to set me back on my heels. Given that so many of our constituents are in drought, have debt and are still obliged to meet their compulsory two per cent levy payments, I am absolutely horrified.
His comments here are particularly significant because it is very important to set the context within which these disgraceful activities took place. 
Australian wool growers are just emerging from the worst drought in 100 years. Over the last two years, roughly half of Australia's wool growers have been on welfare, receiving exceptional circumstances drought relief payments. In fact, according to ABARE's latest Profile of Australian Wool Producers, farm cash income for specialist wool producers was around $58,000 per farm. Current specialist wool growers' average incomes have been amongst the lowest recorded for the last 50 years and well below the high levels recorded in the late 1980s. They have also gone through great turmoil at an organisational level, lurching from one set of corporate arrangements to another. In fact, AWI was born out of the fires of disaster following the meeting of hundreds of angry wool growers at Goulburn in 1999 when they voted to sack the entire board of AWI's predecessor, AWRAP.
AWI was created by federal government legislation in January 2001, but it was not long at all before the rumblings began which indicated discontent with the operation of some of the individuals in the new body. Most notable at that time was the announcement by Mr Dorber of a donation from AWI of half a million dollars to the Farmhand appeal in October 2002. It was of real concern to wool growers as to how that money was being spent given that, at that time, it was an untied gift.
My attention was first brought to the seriousness of the problems within AWI when last year I received a brown envelope that contained numerous deeply disturbing claims about how AWI was being administered. The source of that document is still unknown to me, but I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate and thank that very courageous person, who obviously made a brave decision on behalf of Australia's wool growers.
The document included the following revelations. There were 50 research and marketing projects worth approximately $20 million that had been funded under the former management without formal contracts. Mr Dorber had employed and then sacked his two children, Luke and Holly Dorber, from AWI after the new board had been elected and they each received large termination payments. Luke Dorber had received a substantial pay rise, from approximately $40,000 to $80,000, just before his termination. Ten days before the termination of his employment he had also received a cash bonus of some thousands of dollars. 
There was an allegation that Mr Dorber had received fees for his position as the chair of the ShearExpress board—some of which he had prepaid to himself—despite telling press and industry that his position as chair of ShearExpress did not entitle him to directors fees. He donated, on behalf of AWI, $100,000 to a collection at Charles Sturt University with another in-kind donation of $150,000. Mr Dorber paid a freelance journalist to attend a Rural Press Club lunch in Victoria and to ask aggressive questions of the now Chair of AWI. All that information turned out to be just the tip of the iceberg in the misuse of wool growers' precious compulsory levy funds.
In December 2002, following the election by shareholders of a new board, AWI formed a finance and audit committee which commissioned an independent auditor to conduct a midyear review of AWI's financial affairs. The audit report has been released by the committee and it not only confirms those allegations that I have just raised but also contains the most damning series of revelations about the practices of Mr Dorber as well as the former Chair of AWI, Ms Maree McCaskill.
These include that Mr Everist, a Melbourne freelance journalist, was paid $638 by AWI to ask questions of the now Chair of AWI at the Press Club. As an aside to this issue, I would like to point out that when I questioned Mr Dorber's engagement of Mr Everist at the Senate committee, he said:
I vividly recall the instructions.
I asked, `Were they written instructions?' and he said:
No. I sought advice from the communications manager about who should do the job and subsequently had a conversation with Mr Everist and I said, `I understand that you journalists basically write what you want and I am not telling you what you have to do or say but we want a journalist present who will ask some of the questions ...
The evidence now reveals that Mr Dorber substantially misled the Senate committee. Tab 5 of AWI's submission to the inquiry includes an email to Mr Everist from Mr Dorber which says:
Please accept this email as confirmation that AWI will retain your services as a freelance journalist ... The fee is $500 plus expenses.
He then wrote the questions he wanted to be asked of the guest speaker. So much for saying he had nothing to do with it. Mr Dorber also received $24,062.50 worth of directors fees for his role as Chair of ShearExpress, despite having said in the minutes that he would not take them. When I questioned him during the committee hearing—and I might say this evidence was sworn evidence—as to whether he had received any fees, the following exchange took place:
Mr Dorber—There was a resolution that I put to AWI that I not be paid for being a director of ShearExpress and, until Monday night, I was under the understanding that that was the situation. I sought some advice yesterday and I am advised by my lawyers that, if a payment was made, that payment would have been dealt with by the deed of release negotiated between my lawyers and AWI.
Senator FERRIS—Are you able to confirm that you received fees as a director of ShearExpress?
Mr Dorber—No.
Senator FERRIS—You are not able to confirm it?
Mr Dorber—No. I have no records that tell me that.
Senator FERRIS—If they had paid you, surely you would know it?
Mr Dorber—I did not check my salary every fortnight.
In fact, the committee has received evidence that two letters had already been written by Minter Ellison on behalf of AWI to ShearExpress requesting that they recover the payments from Mr Dorber. 
Luke Dorber, Mr Dorber's son, began employment with AWI on 27 August 2001 on an annual salary of $47,500. On 3 May 2002 it was increased to $86,000—he must have been a pretty good employee. On 17 June 2002 he was paid a performance bonus of $5,000 and on 15 November another performance bonus of $10,000. Ten days later his employment was terminated and he received a pre-tax termination payment of $94,649.18. Holly Dorber originally commenced employment with AWI on 11 March 2002 as a part-time employee. Her salary was then increased to $35,000 and she subsequently got a termination payment of $37,989.17. Mr Dorber signed off on his daughter's termination payment. However, when Mr Dorber was asked during this public hearing whether he could state what the value of the redundancy packages were, he said, `I never saw the paperwork.'
I could go on all night about these and other outrageous instances of the abuse of wool growers' money and of misleading evidence given by this man to our committee. These are just a couple of examples of this sickening opportunist. Not only did this man grossly misappropriate wool growers' funds, he consistently used tactics of verbal intimidation and bullying to try to influence the course of events. In a letter made public today there is evidence of that bullying.
In view of the seriousness of this issue and with the concurrence of the opposition, I now seek to incorporate the remainder of the speech which outlines very important abuses of corporate power made by this man.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
In a letter made public by the Committee today from the Chair of WoolProducers Simon Campbell to the Chair of the Committee, Mr Campbell states that he believes that Mr Alix Turner, a wool grower and member of WoolProducers Executive, was subject to verbal intimidation and threats designed to influence the private evidence provided by Mr Turner to the Committee in a written submission to the Inquiry into AWI.
The letter reveals that Mr Dorber made a phone call to Mr Turner at 8:30pm on Saturday 28th June at his home. Mr Turner has provided details of the conversation:
“At approximately 8:30pm on Saturday night Col rang our home....to advise that he had studied the relevant Senate proceedings and to invite me to repeat the appropriate part of my submission outside parliamentary privilege ... Elsewhere in the conversation he confided that had I made such a statement outside parliamentary privilege he would have expected me to be paying the resulting fine `for the rest of my life'.”
“Col then suggested that I may be called before the Senate Committee and that perhaps I might consider withdrawing this part of my submission on the grounds of inability to substantiate my alleged allegations ...
He then referred to all the trauma that the current situation was causing his family and I agreed that this was unfortunate. He also suggested the possibility that if things went badly for him he may even finish up doing some time in jail.
Finally he pointed out that although `your crowd are now in control of the trough' he was going to make it his business to see that growers elected to terminate the payment of any levies to support AWI.”
The trough indeed!
Another letter made public by the Committee shows clearly Mr Dorber's complete disregard for woolgrowers' money and proper corporate governance practices. A letter to the current Chair of AWI from a former Program Manager of Communications for AWI, who was employed by AWI from May 2001 to November 2002, describes a meeting with Mr Dorber and I quote:
“Upon taking my seat Mr Dorber said to me `I would like you to go back to your office and write a letter of resignation'.”
On asking on what grounds his resignation was being sought, Mr Dorber was unable to point to any specific reasons behind his request. He stated that whilst he trusted the manager, he did not have the trust of senior management. Mr Dorber could not provide any further clarification, despite the fact that just two months prior to this time Mr Dorber had provided the Manager with a cash bonus for work he had indicated was of an exceptional standard. 
Mr Dorber then made an offer of six months salary tax free for this man to resign. When this offer was rejected Mr Dorber replied that his options were simple - he could accept payment and resign or take the matter to the courts.
The letter then states that Mr Dorber asked the Manager what it would take for him to resign. The Manager then replied, no doubt under great pressure, that he wanted a total of $100,000 tax free, and for AWI to sign over possession of his mobile phone, palm pilot and computer. Mr Dorber agreed to this request. The Manager was then escorted by AWI's Operations Manager to the accounts department where a cheque was written for the agreed amount. The Manager was refused the opportunity to speak to his two staff, he was escorted back to his office, where he packed up his belongings, typed his letter of resignation, and was escorted from the building.
So much for management responsibility.
So after all of this, how was Mr Dorber rewarded for his time at AWI?
Unfortunately for the woolgrowers of Australia the news doesn't get much better. Today the Committee has made public the Deed of Release executed by AWI and Mr Dorber, releasing him from the second contract of employment signed with AWI. Importantly, this deed was executed after he had lost the confidence of the Board but before the audit report was undertaken. Woolgrowers will again be sickened when they learn of the circumstances under which Mr Dorber left the company.
Mr Dorber received a grossed out termination payment of $1,081,555.02. This included $98,000 in sick leave.
This amount does not include the transfer of ownership of Mr Dorber's company car at no cost to Mr Dorber for a notional transfer value of $50,000 and with the company ensuring that any tax liability arising in relation to that transfer is met by AWI.
It is now important for the Committee to consider what can be done to ensure that such an abuse of power and such a horrendously corrupt and wasteful misappropriation of woolgrowers' funds can never occur again. The Senate Committee is now considering this question.
Woolgrowers have been badly let down by Mr Dorber. The power he enjoyed as Managing Director of AWI was severely abused. The extent of the misuse of woolgrower's money is a disgrace.
Mr Dorber has stated that he intends to run for the Board of AWI in its upcoming elections. I urge all of Australia's woolgrowers in Australia to reject this man.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Australian Wool Innovation</title>,Adjournment,25,1,speech
