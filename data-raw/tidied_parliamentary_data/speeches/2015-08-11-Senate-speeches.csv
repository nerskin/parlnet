Senator McLUCAS
 (Queensland) (12:32):  I rise to speak to the provisions of the Medical Research Future Fund Bill 2015 and the Medical Research Future Fund (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2015 on behalf of the opposition. These bills finally give effect to the government's stated intention to establish the Medical Research Future Fund, having announced its intention in the 2014-15 budget some 18 months ago. It is true to say that these bills have had a very long gestation period and now, it would seem, a fairly quick birth. I will leave that to others to explain. 


The Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee only held a hearing on 4 August 2015, just last week, and the report of the committee was only tabled yesterday afternoon. I certainly am hopeful that the speed that we are now proceeding with does not result in any errors, oversights or omissions. The haste with which this process is occurring does warrant an explanation, and I have to say it puts the crossbench in a somewhat difficult position to deal with the bills in the way that we are. However, I do wish to thank the secretariat of the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee, including staff who were co-opted for their work in conducting the hearing and also for the preparation of the report. I also thank those who wrote submissions to the inquiry and the witnesses who appeared. 


I now move to the substance of the bills. As I said, these bills finally give effect to the government's intention to set up a Medical Research Future Fund, but they fail to meet the policy objectives the government itself set in announcing this fund. When it was first announced the government promised:


Fund earnings will be directed to medical research, primarily by boosting funding for the National Health and Medical Research Council …


But now it is clear that, instead, there is no formal role for the NHMRC in administering MRFF disbursements. The government has refused to work with Labor to consider how the NHMRC, an 80-year-old institution that has universal respect, could have a role in assessing applications and administering MRFF disbursements. The government has failed to do this, despite significant support from the sector for a formal process of expert review to be reflected in the bills and consistent support for some formal recognition of the role of the NHMRC. I intend to explore that support in some detail. 


Labor agrees with some of the principles established in the bills and that a new health and medical research innovation strategy should be developed to set the agenda for the MRFF funding. But these bills allow for the minister of the day to make decisions that are not subject to the same sort of peer review that is followed by the NHMRC. Indeed, former NHMRC CEO Professor Warwick Anderson, now the secretary general of the international Human Frontier Science Program organisation, provided answers to questions on notice specifically supporting a greater role for the NHMRC and a process of peer review to identify what is value for money and what is not. Specifically, Professor Anderson said:


I support the concept of the MRFF advisory committee setting the strategy for the MRFF through consultation, and the NHMRC administering the majority of the funding. When judging how to use public money for research only peer review can identify what is favourable and what is not. NHMRC's almost 80 years of effective, ethical and efficient service to the Australian community means that public trust in the MRFF will be maintained if NHMRC plays the major role in administering the earnings of the fund in accord with the advisory board strategy.


He goes on:


NHMRC's current act allows simple and recently established ways to proceed, if the MRFF funds are provided to NHMRC outside the NHMRC's Medical Research Endowment Account (as is the case with the current government dementia research initiative).


He concludes:


Coordination between the MRFF and NHMRC will be essential if the greatest good is be gained from the MRFF for the benefit of Australia.


The government itself promised that fund earnings would be directed to medical research, primarily by boosting funding for the National Health and Medical Research Council. So it is deeply concerning that, having spent more than a year talking about this fund, the government has not done the work to establish a fund that meets those principles the government first announced.


I acknowledge, through the consequential amendments, that the CEO of the NHMRC is to have a role on the Australian Medical Research Advisory Board, but there is not enough clarity to this point about how that will operate. The Senate is being asked a lot, in dealing with these bills, to take the government at its word. Despite not properly consulting and not establishing a bill that is based on comprehensive consultation and a robust funding mechanism, the Senate is being asked to trust that the government will sort these details out later. But, frankly, this government has proven itself to be comprehensively untrustworthy and to be capable of politicising almost any issue. Particularly in this department, this government has politicised almost every issue that has come in front of us.


So, what reassurances are there that this fund could not be used to support research into the health impact of wind farms or research into chemtrails. The minister of the day gets to make final funding decisions, based on no process of peer review to identify what is valuable and what is not. It seems that the Greens are happy to support this position—to support the minister making funding decisions not based on any independent peer review process, which leaves wide open the possibility of this government directing funding to its own pet projects to fund research into, as I said, the health impact of wind farms, and to fund its own election promises.


The risk in the way the government is seeking to set up this fund is not just that the best research—that is, the most meritorious research—misses out on funding but that the loudest voice at the table catches the minister's ear and is ultimately awarded funding for this reason alone. Dr Phoebe Phillips, the President of the Australian Society for Medical Research and a researcher into pancreatic cancer at the Lowy Cancer Research Centre, told the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee's inquiry:


We do a lot of work with the community and I think that taxpayers really want to know that their money is going towards funding the best possible high-quality research that delivers health outcomes. All the evidence based on peer review in this country—and we have done a lot of this work in this space with independent commissioned reports—suggests that NHMRC peer review has actually been very successful in delivering better outcomes.


Again, I think what we do not want to happen is the loudest speaker being able to approach the Minister for Health and say, 'I have this problem, let's get some money here.' It needs to be peer reviewed so that rigorous questions are asked to actually determine whether it is a feasible study, whether it is a clinical trial or whether it is basic research leading to a discovery trial. As pointed out, how is an individual, group or a team going to measure the outcomes and have an accurate time line which can be judged? I think that is the expectation of taxpayers.


In regard to NHMRC's integrity, they have been around for 75 years in this space and that peer review system has improved greatly over time.


We know that investment into health and medical research through the peer review has really put Australia as one of the leaders in health and medical research.


As I said earlier, it is not just Labor senators who have called for greater transparency, for a process of peer or expert review, and for a formal role for the NHMRC in administering disbursements. There were many witnesses at the inquiry who concurred with that view. I point senators to the Australian Clinical Trials Alliance, who told this to the committee, and also the Group of Eight Universities and the innovative university sector.


Returning to the specifics of the bills, and the way the government wants to make disbursements from the MRFF, the bills also allow for the Minister for Finance to direct credits to the MRFF Health Special Account for the purpose of making grants of financial assistance to medical research institutes, non-profit organisations, universities and corporations. This remains very concerning for Labor. Again, this means that without any oversight from an independent advisory panel, without a peer review process, without consulting the NHMRC, or even distributing funding at arm's length through the NHMRC, the government can for all intents and purposes direct credits from the MRFF to any pet project it wants.


We know that the idea for this fund came about just weeks before the last budget, which is something the government has been embarrassed about ever since. So you would have thought the Treasurer and Minister for Health would have actually done some policy work to properly develop this fund, but they have not. What is most concerning about the way the government is seeking to establish this fund is the lack of proper governance surrounding the way its disbursements will be made.


Labor, of course, are the biggest supporters of health and medical research in this place. We demonstrated this in government through a commitment of more than $3.5 billion in health and medical research funding. This included more than $700 million to build and upgrade health and medical research facilities right across the country. We also commissioned the landmark McKeon Strategic Review of Health and Medical Research, to provide a long-term vision for governments and for the sector. The review made it clear that a levy like the Abbott government's GP tax was not the ideal nor preferred method for funding medical research in Australia, and we continue to agree with this. That is also why we do not believe that the government should continue its freeze on Medicare rebates. The inevitable outcome of this will be a GP tax worse than that proposed in last year's budget and a collapse in bulk-billing rates.


The McKeon review provides a 10-year road map as to how health and medical research can be supported for the benefit of all Australians, but these bills in no way reflect that vision. From Labor's perspective it is especially disappointing that the government has not used this legislation as an opportunity to pursue the recommendations in the McKeon review. Specifically, the government has missed the opportunity, firstly, to embed research into the health system and, secondly, to implement the review recommendations to establish integrated health research centres, accelerate clinical trial reforms and support health and medical research workforce retention—the training and support recommendations. It has completely missed the opportunity to support co-investment from philanthropic and other sources, and missed any opportunity to identify new funding sources. Mr McKeon recommended identifying 'other possible funding sources such as alternative debt finance, R&D tax incentives and levies, and schemes such as research prizes'. The government completely ignored those recommendations in establishing this fund.


The fund was meant to be operational on 1 January 2015. It is a reflection of the chaotic and dysfunctional two years we have had with this government that it has only now finally got around to introducing another one of its so-called signature policies. It really does beggar belief that, having not done the policy work in announcing this fund, delaying its introduction by more than six months, the government still has not done the work on setting up a fund with proper governance structures.    It is emblematic, though, of how this government politicises every issue and of its chaotic and dysfunctional mismanagement of the health portfolio.


It is worth putting on record the cuts that have been made to support this fund. This is where the money is ostensibly coming from. Billions of dollars have been cut from public hospital funding; more than half a billion dollars cut from public dental programs; $400 million cut from preventive health programs; and hundreds of millions of dollars cut from the health flexible funds that support vital drug and alcohol rehabilitation services and important work undertaken by organisations like the Heart Foundation, the Cancer Council, the Consumer Health Forum and the Public Health Association. There have been cuts to veterans' dental and allied health programs, cuts to the Healthy Kids Check, cuts to the electronic health records program, cuts to the Partners in Recovery mental health program—and the list goes on. So Labor are right to be sceptical about this government's intentions. We have long said that we always support sensible measures to grow and support health and medical research, but not at the expense of sick Australians today.


While all this has been happening, Labor has been undertaking its own policy development process, consulting with health and medical research leaders and researchers across the country to develop the best system we can. We will move amendments to these bills that reflect those principles. Labor's amendments will add integrity to the bills and reflect in many ways how grants are administered by the NHMRC through its act. It beggars belief that, despite first promising that funds from the MRFF would principally be distributed through the NHMRC, the government has included no formal role for the NHMRC. I want to make it clear that while Labor will not oppose this legislation, because we do support health and medical research—indeed we are the strongest supporters of health and medical research in this place—we do not support a discretionary funding mechanism that leaves open the possibility that the health minister of the day can just fund the projects of their choosing. In government, Labor would seek to amend the NHMRC Act to ensure that similar processes are followed for MRFF disbursements as we follow for disbursements from the Medical Research Endowment Account.


Labor agree that research different from what the NHMRC has traditionally funded should be funded through the MRFF, so we do support the development of a new Australian Medical Research and Innovation Strategy as the basis on which these priorities can be identified and projects that have a stronger focus on translational research, clinical trials, and commercialisation can be awarded funding. We also agree that this additional investment should be quarantined from the existing allocation through the Medical Research Endowment Account, and we would make sure this is reflected. I will refer during the committee stage to the intention of our amendments.


Labor has always supported, in word and in deed, health and medical research. Our health and medical researchers do amazing work. For a country of our population size, we as Australians can be proud of the research outcomes from our tax dollars. We can also be proud of the results that our dedicated research community achieve. Labor supports building on this success by growing the translational research that many in the community also support. But the way the government has gone about getting to this point has been less than ideal. The time between inquiry and tabling and now dealing with the legislation has been truncated, which has been problematic for many, including some on the crossbench. The funding sources have been divisive in the community, pitting the desirability of increased funding for health and medical research against access to health services for people who are currently sick and need support now. For one of this government's so-called signature policies, this has been a messy process. The Australian research community will watch this government closely. The policy intent must be achieved both now and into the future.

"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2015-08-11,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (12:51):  The Medical Research Future Fund Bill 2015 and the Medical Research Future Fund (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2015 establish the Medical Research Future Fund, which involves the crediting and debiting of funds and the governance and administration of the fund itself. The Greens are strong supporters of health and medical research and we support the intention of the Medical Research Future Fund—that is, strategies that will prioritise and foster innovation and translational research. Health and medical research represents some of the very best of what Australia can offer and some of the very best of the economic opportunities for the generation ahead. It is with some pleasure that I can say that in my hometown of Melbourne we have some of the greatest medical research minds in the country. We have people like Professor Brendan Crabb from the Burnet Institute and Professor Doug Hilton from the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, all of whom have been not only incredibly important contributors to the medical research effort in the Australian nation but also very strong advocates and supporters for the establishment of a medical research future fund.


It is the Greens' view that a 21st century economy needs to be built on our minds, not simply on minds. We have the clinical research capacity that exists in very few countries across the world that allows us to be able to conduct the sort of groundbreaking research that is not just simply elemental research but carries right through the spectrum to translational research and commercialisation. The Greens spoke in the election of a science package that would commit three per cent of GDP to research by the year 2020. It is a package that consists of a combined $750 million boost to the Australian Research Council and to national cooperative research centres, funding for indirect costs associated with health and medical research—and that is a huge drag on medical research in that the research is funded but the indirect administrative costs are not—moving towards default five-year grants in ARC and NHMRC through those grant processes and ensuring that we recognise people with a proven track record, $342 million to reverse the cuts that the government implemented to the Sustainable Research Excellence program and another several hundred million dollars in the area of a national research infrastructure facilities council. I could go on. There would be opportunities for international collaboration, ongoing future fellowships schemes, open access publishing of government funded research and more targeted support for commercialisation. That leads on to one of the great advantages of something like the Medical Research Future Fund, which has a very strong focus not just on primary elemental research driven research but on identified strategic areas where we can move to bridge the huge gap that exists between those primary areas of research and translation and commercialisation.


I do understand that people have expressed some concerns around the proposed legislation that is before us. Certainly the Greens raised very serious questions about what the primary driver of the genesis of this legislation was. It was implemented at a time where we had a government that was very keen to introduce a GP co-payment and it is very hard to escape the conclusion that this was drafted after that decision in order to sweeten what was a very poor area of public policy. However, the Greens, like many people within the medical research community, were keen to ensure that one of the very few good ideas that has come from this government was not jettisoned simply because it was associated with one area of poor policy. We understand that some other issues have been addressed around the bills—issues of governance, how we define translational research and the role of the NHMRC in the process—and I will talk to those in a moment.


It has to be said, though, that this fund is a fund that sits amongst some other areas of government policy where this government has been prepared to go in precisely the opposite direction to the direction that we appear to be going in here when it comes to medical research. Look at climate change, for example, and the backward steps that we are taking in investing in the sort of research that needs to be done in order to ensure that we are able to mitigate and adapt to catastrophic global warming. Look at the lack of investment in our university sector, cuts to the CSIRO and to R&D budgets and so on and you will see a government that is underinvesting in the sort of transformation that is necessary in order to drive a modern 21st century economy.


Going to the details of the fund, which is one small, shining light in a long tunnel of darkness, we have a fund where we will see $400 million available over the four years until June 2019, and of course we want to ensure that good governance and review processes accompany this package. In fact, our amendments have sought to ensure that what we do get is an improved governance process as well as a return on some of the serious commercial gains that might be made as a result of public investment. As I said, I think it is important to ensure that, given there is a debate about the role of the NHMRC in this process, it is understood that the Medical Research Future Fund does have a different focus to the NHMRC. As somebody who has been a long-time supporter of the NHMRC, an organisation that has a very long history of safeguarding and supporting health and medical research and giving advice to the community and government on drafting guidelines on so many important areas in health, I think it is important that we establish governance processes that are robust. To that end, it must be said that there are concerns around the degree to which the governance processes will leave this fund open to political interference, and I think we need to address that issue head on.


The first thing to say is that the NHMRC itself is not immune to government interference, despite its very impressive track record and despite its being an organisation that has shown itself to be an exemplar in many areas of scientific research. The NHMRC is now committed to investing several hundreds of thousands of dollars into research on the impact of wind turbines on people's health. The point here is that it is impossible to protect any organisation from political interference, and we know that the history of that decision was a decision that was very directly influenced by political considerations. However, we are assured that one of the changes to the legislation is that the bills require the advisory board—and let us be clear that there is an independent advisory board—will be established to administer these funds. That board will be made up of medical and scientific experts, all of whom are very protective of their professional reputations and would take very dimly to the suggestion that their decisions will be influenced based on political considerations, but the legislation does require the advisory board to take into account the NHMRC's national strategy for medical research and public health research—that is, it will be directed by those priorities that have already been identified by the NHMRC. 


We now know that Professor Kelso, the CEO of the NHMRC, will be given the opportunity to contribute to the development of the strategy that will guide the decisions of the advisory board—that is, the Medical Research and Innovation Strategy. The NHMRC will play a key role in drafting that strategy through Professor Kelso, who will be part of that advisory board. In her role as the CEO of the NHMRC she will ensure that the Medical Research Future Fund and the NHMRC strategies are aligned and complimentary. Professor Kelso has also reassured us that she will be able to draw on the NHMRC's wealth of experience and advice from its council and principal committees, and it will be critical to have her involvement on the advisory board.


The next thing that needs to be said is that Professor Kelso has also said that, if any Medical Research Future Fund funds are directed to the NHMRC for disbursement, the NHMRC will adapt those processes and draw on whatever expertise is necessary to make particular recommendations to government. I urge the minister to ensure that that suggestion is taken up, with an undertaking to exercise that as a principle across the board. Having the NHMRC's CEO on the decision-making panel is critical, and we are satisfied that that will make a significant difference to the decisions and the complementarity between the NHMRC and the Medical Research Future Fund.


We think there is a role, though, for some government discretion. We take Senator McLucas' points about the concerns, but we have been reassured that those concerns have been addressed through the advisory panel and the role of NHMRC on that advisory board. There are times when governments do need to determine the research priorities very quickly. In fact, we heard from the Association of Australian Medical Research Institutes, which described the example of a global pandemic where there is an imperative to direct our research priorities, for example, towards the development of a vaccination or other time critical research priorities. There it is necessary that there should be some flexibility for governments to be able to intervene in extraordinary circumstances, and there is a consensus that any involvement from government should be on the basis of an extraordinary circumstance like that rather than being the default position. Again I reiterate that the reputations of very distinguished medical researchers and scientists as well as the CEO of the NHMRC are at stake should political imperatives influence the decisions of the Medical Research Future Fund.


I think that it is also important to note that the investment that is contained within the Medical Research Future  Fund will be determined by a similar investment mandate to that determined by the Future Fund. It will differ around return and so on, but one of the things that the Greens have been very keen to ensure is that the Future Fund's policy—something that was achieved through the advocacy and work of the Greens—of not investing in tobacco products would be something that would apply to the Medical Research Future Fund. In fact, we have been assured that, while the Medical Research Future Fund can invest in any financial instrument, it would also act consistently with the Future Fund's policy around excluding investments in tobacco companies and cluster munitions. The Medical Research Future Fund will maintain a list of entities that are excluded under the board's ownership rights and the ESG risk management policy that applies within the Future Fund—that is, an exclusion on tobacco companies and cluster munition companies. We are pleased that that change has been made.


Let me conclude by saying that we absolutely understand the concerns that have been expressed by the Labor Party in terms of the risk of political interference. We have worked to ensure through our amendments that that risk is minimised. We have also worked to ensure through our amendments that there may be some potential for Australians to get a return on any successful project—by the word 'successful' I mean a commercially successful project. There should be some capacity for the Australian community to get a return on that investment. We have also—through amendments suggested to the government that we will discuss again later in the committee stage—sought to ensure that NHMRC funding is protected and that this Medical Research Future Fund is not used as a vehicle through which to shift investment dollars away from entities like the NHMRC to direct them towards another fund. 


In summary, we support the concept of a medical research future fund. We think that it is important to prioritise investment in translational funding and the commercialisation of projects. It is one of the very few good ideas that this government has come up with over its brief and chaotic period in government. It stands in direct contrast to the agenda it has to cut investment in funding science, research and innovation. But, where there are good ideas, the Greens are prepared to support them and we look forward to continuing this debate during the committee stage of the bills.

"Smith, Sen Dean",LP,2015-08-11,"



Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia) (13:07):  It was the last bit of Senator Di Natale's contribution that I think was the most important. He committed the Australian Greens to looking carefully at, and even supporting, good ideas when they come before the Senate. Certainly, I and other government senators look forward to encouraging the Australian Greens to support those good ideas that come from the government and that are brought to this place.


It is my pleasure also to rise this afternoon to speak on the Medical Research Future Fund Bill 2015 and related bill. This legislation will give effect to what I believe will come to be viewed as one of the government's landmark achievements: the establishment of a $20 billion Medical Research Future Fund. This represents a massive investment in Australia's medical research community, which has always punched well above its weight in global terms when you consider the size of our population.


This is an important initiative for a couple of reasons. The first of these relates to the future needs of our own nation. This is very much a piece of economic legislation. As the fourth Intergenerational report confirmed earlier this year, healthcare costs in Australia will continue growing significantly in the years to come as our population ages. It is very much in our own interests to promote the type of research that will help to cure or, at least, lessen the impact of chronic illnesses that afflict members of our community. We know that Australians are going to be living longer. Our challenge is to make certain that they are living quality, healthy lives, as well as living longer ones.


By investing in medical research we can determine the effectiveness of a drug or form of treatment so that taxpayers' money is not being unnecessarily spent on things that do not work. But, more than that, this is the sort of investment that will allow Australia's medical research professionals to shine in a global context. Australian ingenuity has been a critical part of internationally significant developments in the field of medical research. For instance, think of Howard Florey, who carried out the first clinical trials of penicillin in 1941, an act for which he later shared in the Nobel Prize for medicine. Today, we can take it for granted that our injuries can be bandaged and our wounds will heal, with little risk of infection. But that was not always the case of course. Death from wound infection was a significant issue prior to the mid-1940s.


Establishing this fund is about helping to unlock the potential of medical research in Australia. I am utterly confident that there is another Howard Florey out there and that the intelligence and work ethic that abounds in Australia's medical research community will play a big role in the eventual cure of diseases such as cancer, diabetes, HIV and the like. That is why this legislation is important. It will be transformational, not just for the 23,000 Australians who work directly as medical research professionals but also for the medicines industry that supports those people and that itself employs nearly twice as many Australians.


The structure of the Medical Research Future Fund will also specifically address some of the concerns identified in the Strategic review of health and medical research, published in February 2013. That review, led by Mr Simon McKeon AO, clearly set out the need for Australia to have a more strategic model to get the best health results from its research efforts. The McKeon review identified a particular need to create greater linkage between healthcare providers and research organisations by 'fundamentally embedding research within healthcare delivery'.


The review set out a case for placing far greater emphasis on priority-driven research, to help bridge some of the gaps between research excellence and translation of research into applied technologies and practices. This requires additional investment in translating research findings into bedside applications. It requires more commercialisation and stronger partnerships between researchers and health practitioners, including hospitals and GPs. Importantly, it will support investment across the research spectrum, from laboratory research to clinical trials, the commercialisation of new drugs or devices, the translation of new techniques or protocols into clinical practice and public health improvements.


All told, the Medical Research Future Fund will provide some $400 million for distribution over the next four years. And it is worth noting, I think, that this investment is additional to existing government support for direct medical research activities. However, the MRFF will be structured in such a way that it will meet specific purposes, consistent with the coalition government's overall investment approach in medical research and innovation.


Importantly, the MRFF will be governed by an especially rigorous set of accountability measures. This government believes that taxpayers' funds are a precious resource and that they should be allocated wisely, based on expert advice and strong governance arrangements. The government underscored its commitment by making a series of amendments to the bill when it passed through the House of Representatives, all designed to strengthen accountability and transparency.


Under the terms of this bill, the Medical Research Future Fund will be managed by the Future Fund Board of Guardians. This will mean the fund is in the hands of a body that has a strong, proven track record when it comes to managing investment portfolios on behalf of the government or, more accurately, on behalf of the Australian taxpayer. For instance, under the board of guardians' stewardship, the Future Fund has grown from approximately $64 billion, at its inception in 2006, to around $117 billion as of March this year, an annualised rate of return of around 8.2 per cent. I think it would take a very brave politician to dispute the success of the Future Fund. The board of guardians will be required to adhere to the same accountability frameworks that this government has in place for all Commonwealth bodies. This includes the publication of annual reports, audited financial statements and quarterly portfolio updates reporting on the fund's performance. Projects funded by the MRFF will be publicly disclosed online, consistent with the government's reporting frameworks for grants.


On the issue of parliamentary accountability, the Minister for Health will be required to prepare a report every two years, that will set out all funding provided by the government for medical research and innovation from the MRFF, and to explain how the funding is consistent with the strategic objectives set out by the fund's advisory board. That strategy is subject to a review every five years and will take account of national health policy needs, gaps in current investment and the timing needed to make certain the nation is obtaining best possible value from our spending on health, medical research and medical innovation.


In terms of ministerial oversight, the finance minister will be responsible for ensuring funds disbursed by the MRFF are done so in a manner that is consistent with the government's overall policy objectives. In this regard, the finance minister will work closely with both the Treasurer and the Minister for Health, who will oversee the flow of funds through the two accounts applicable to the MRFF—the COAG Reform Fund and the Health Portfolio Special Account.


Of course, there is always a need to maintain independence in research activities, and nothing contained within the provisions of this legislation will threaten the independence of research activities. The coalition government is committed to all investment activities undertaken by the Future Fund board, remaining independent of government. Ministers will not be involved in investment decisions. The Future Fund board will apply the same principles to the investments of the MRFF as it does to other government investment funds for which it is responsible, including the Future Fund. Of course, the Future Fund board will be required to actively manage risks and not take decisions that are likely to jeopardise the investment taxpayers are making in the MRFF. Once the MRFF is established, the board of guardians will advise the Minister for Finance each year of net earnings which can be withdrawn from the fund to invest in medical research and innovation projects. As per usual, long-established practice, the government will then decide, though the annual budget process, how best to use these funds to support priority areas.


The establishment of the Medical Research Future Fund is something of which this coalition government is very proud. Indeed, I suspect that every Australian will find themselves very proud of this particular initiative as time passes. By making this long-term commitment to ensuring excellence in medical research, we are taking an important step not only in the advance of medical science in this country but also in putting Australia's health system on a more sustainable footing. I am sure all of us in this Senate chamber look forward to the day when, as a result of investments made though this fund, an Australian researcher contributes to curing a dreaded disease, helping people both here and internationally lead longer, healthier and more productive lives.


It is estimated that for every dollar invested in medical research, the community derives a benefit worth $2.17. By establishing this fund, we are going a long way to locking in enormous health and research benefits for the generations of Australians both now and into the future. With those remarks, I commend the bills to the Senate.

Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (13:17):  I too rise to speak today on the Medical Research Future Fund Bill 2015 and related bill. These bills finally give effect to the government's intention to set up a Medical Research Future Fund, the MRFF. And I say 'finally' because this fund was supposed to be operational by 1 January, some eight months ago.


It is a sad reflection on the chaotic and dysfunctional two years we have had with this government that it has only now managed to introduce another one of its signature policies. Yet they have time to create knights and dames and to protect hate speech—and how many attempts have they had to introduce a GP tax? This government is so inept that it has no control over its own legislative timetable. This government is setting new lows in getting legislation through this place. A recent report by TheSydney Morning Herald demonstrated that this government has been the least effective government in almost five decades—less effective than even the McMahon government. No wonder it has taken so long for these bills to come before us today. 


It is deeply concerning that, having spent more than one year talking about this fund, the government has not done the work needed to establish a fund that meets the principles the government itself outlined. Unfortunately, what the bills before us today fail to do is fulfil the government's promise when the fund was announced: 'fund earnings will be directed to medical research, primarily by boosting funding for the National Health and Medical Research Council, the NHMRC'. And it is here that it is important that we acknowledge just how well the NHMRC has served our nation.


The NHMRC has established internationally respected and transparent processes over more than 80 years, and Labor believes the existing mechanisms establish the best process through which the highest quality health and medical research can be funded through MRFF disbursements. The bills before us today only reference that the health minister 'could' ask for the NHMRC to manage distributions from the Medical Research Future Fund. It is no guarantee that the health minister will ask the NHMRC to manage distributions. And, given the government's track record of wanting to control such funding, there is the potential that the MRFF will become a slush fund for the health minister, just like Minister Brandis's arts slush fund.


Labor senators do not agree that decisions regarding the projects and programs awarded funding should sit wholly with the minister of the day. It is obvious that such a practice would be inconsistent with the way existing grants are awarded by the NHMRC, and inconsistent with international best practice in awarding grants to the highest quality projects based on a process of peer review.


Furthermore, the bills also provide that the finance minister can credit funds to the COAG Reform Fund for making payments to the states and territories for expenditure on medical research and medical innovation, including application and commercialisation activities that translate discoveries to new treatments and practice; and corporate Commonwealth entities outside the general government sector, such as the CSIRO. In addition, while the health minister can delegate responsibility for providing funding to institutions such as universities or medical research institutes, the health minister does not have to use this delegation.


Finally, the Minister for Finance can also direct credits to the MRFF Health Special Account for the purpose of making grants of financial assistance to medical research institutes, non-profit organisations, universities and corporations. Given the flexibility the government is allowing itself as to how funds can be allocated, it leaves open the question as to just what exactly this fund will support. Without any oversight from an independent advisory panel, without a peer review process, without consulting the NHMRC or even distributing funding at arm's length through the NHMRC, the government can, for all intents and purposes, direct credits from the MRFF to any pet project it wants. This all sounds very similar to concerns with Minister Brandis's arts funding changes. We know that the changes to arts funding are destroying the sector because of an ill-thought-out process which has vague guidelines and fails to provide appropriate criteria for assessment and basically becomes a private arts fund for the minister.


Back to the MRFF. In short, the government can send the funding to pretty much anywhere they choose with no independent advisory panel to oversee. It is very concerning—in fact, it is quite alarming to us on this side—that a large part of future medical research in this country can be at the sole discretion of the government to use for political purposes. It is a pretty ironic move from a government that is ideologically opposed to picking winners. The government is seeking to establish this fund without proper governance surrounding the way its disbursements will be made. So, how is this good for government?


Maybe those opposite can remind this place when good government is meant to begin again. I think it was six months ago that I heard that quote for the second time. 'Good governance starts today,' was, I think, the quote, but of course we are still waiting. Labor, of course, is the biggest supporter of health and medical research in this place. We demonstrated this when in government through a commitment of more than $3.5 billion in health and medical research funding. This included more than $700 million to build and upgrade health and medical research facilities across the country. Also, when in government, Labor commissioned the landmark McKeon Strategic Review of Health and Medical Research to provide a long-term vision for governments and the sector because Labor believes that medical research should be guided by a long-term vision, by guidance from experts, and be overseen by good governance. Those were our policies.


The McKeon review provides a 10-year roadmap as to how health and medical research can be supported for the benefit of all Australians. The review also made it clear that a levy, such as the Abbott government's GP tax, is not the ideal or preferred method for funding medical research in Australia and we agree. This is also why we oppose the government's freeze on Medicare rebates and call for it to be abandoned. The inevitable outcome of this freeze will be a GP tax worse than that proposed in last year's budget and a collapse in bulk-billing rates. 


It is really saddening to see just how dysfunctional the government's mismanagement of the health portfolio has been. It is clear that this government does not believe in the principles of universal health care. It opposed universal health care when Whitlam introduced Medibank, which it overturned when Malcolm Fraser became Prime Minister. And this government does everything it can to strip funding away from health programs.


I would like to put on record some of the cuts that have been made to health to support this fund. They include more than half a billion dollars cut from public dental programs; billions of dollars cut from public hospital funding; almost $400 million cut from preventive health programs; hundreds of millions of dollars cut from the Health Flexible Funds, which support vital drug and alcohol rehabilitation services and important work undertaken by organisations like the Heart Foundation, the Cancer Council, the Consumer Health Forum, the Public Health Association and others; cuts to veterans' dental and allied health programs; cuts to the electronic health record; cuts to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, including the proposal that is still before the Senate to increase the cost of medicines by $5 for all general patients and 80c for concessional patients, as well as unfair changes to the PBS safety nets; cuts to a number of important health workforce programs; cuts to optometry programs—not to mention cuts to the Healthy Kids Check.


Now, let us just look at the impact of one of those issues. Having worked in early childhood education I am appalled at the axing of the Healthy Kids Check. This is a comprehensive health check for children aged three to five, which has been scrapped by the federal government to save about $144 million over four years, angering GPs and speech pathologists, as well as parents of young children. The Abbott government axed Medicare funding for the Healthy Kids Check, which is a consultation with a nurse or a GP to assess a child's health and development before they start school. The scheme includes assessments of a child's height and weight, hearing, eye sight, oral health, toilet habits and known or suspected allergies. Also, it helps parents to understand the risk of anaphylaxis and how to prevent it. In 2014, 154,000 children used the program. Medicare pays between $58 for a Healthy Kids Check consultation with a nurse and $269 for an hour with a GP, depending on the child's needs. According to a study published in the Medical Journal of Australia in 2014, the check was detecting problems in about one in five children. The most common problems identified related to speech and language, followed by toilet habits, hearing, vision and behavioural issues.


Other organisations concerned include the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, which stated it was disappointed by the federal government's decision, which was made without consulting GPs—what a familiar record they have on that side about that. Also Speech Pathology Australia has stated that scrapping a check that facilitated early intervention services for children with problems before school made no sense at all. In fact, I would say, having previously spent 12 years as an early childhood educator, that it is likely to lead to worse educational outcomes for children who go to school with undetected health problems. Economically, you have to think about the costs involved and about how much money could be saved through early detection. Obviously there could be a cost saving through early detection.


None of this makes any sense—it does not make any sense at all to me but that is like so much of what this government does.  These are important programs which should be supported and should not have been axed, but, unfortunately, this government just wants to cut health whenever it can.


The bills we are debating today—the Medical Research Future Fund Bill and the Medical Research Future Fund (Consequential Amendments) Bill—were inquired into by the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee. Labor senators made additional comments in the final report, and I would just like to mention some of these today. Labor senators commented:


Labor Senators support the establishment of the Medical Research Future Fund as an opportunity to expand Australia's health and medical research sector, especially in that it provides an opportunity to implement some of the recommendations of the McKeon Review … 


Importantly:


Labor Senators however see the MRFF as a missed opportunity to pursue many of these recommendations due to the rushed and poorly developed proposal the Government has developed—


yet again—


giving no consideration to McKeon's recommendations to attract philanthropy and new funding sources, or indeed define the recommendations in the original Bill.


…   …   …


Labor Senators agree that the types of research that should be funded through MRFF disbursements is different from what the NHMRC has traditionally funded, especially when it comes to commercialisation and translational research. Labor Senators also recognise that through the NHMRC's existing committee structures this capacity is lacking which is why Labor Senators support the development of the Australian Medical Research and Innovation Strategy and the Australian Medical Research and Innovation Priorities.


However:


Labor Senators do not support the transfer of existing funds within the Health and Hospitals Fund transferring to the MRFF…


The Health and Hospitals Fund was 'established for different purposes' and should not be raided to fund the MRFF. Labor will:


… seek to make a number of amendments to the Bills to establish a more robust assessment process. Labor's amendments establish the inclusion of a process of expert review to ensure that the highest quality research is rewarded, rather than—potentially politically motivated and influenced by the 'loudest voices'—decisions being made by the Minister of the day and subject to no independent oversight and with little transparency.


A Labor Government would seek to amend the NHMRC Act to ensure that, whilst the MRFF Special Account were to remain independent, the role of any MRFF advisory committee would be reflected in the NHMRC Council structure with the same sort of rigour applied to funding assessment as the NHMRC does through its existing grants streams.


This government could have done, and should have done, a whole lot better with these bills, especially given the delay in bringing them before the parliament today. I encourage senators to carefully consider Labor's amendments and to support Labor's amendments to the bills.

Senator GALLAGHER
 (Australian Capital Territory) (13:32):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important legislation, the Medical Research Future Fund Bill 2015 and related bill. I would like to start by making some comments on this government's attitude to science since coming to power. I have listened to others who have participated in this debate and one could take from the comments from government members that this government is the biggest supporter of science and evidence based research informing policy decisions that the country has ever seen. But, if you go back and look at what has happened in terms of attacks on science, attacks on scientists and cuts to science and research across Australia since 2013, the record tells a much different story.


Certainly some very well documented analysis has been done around this. In my home town of Canberra we have seen the attacks that have been waged against CSIRO, with the loss of 600 jobs and over $111 million cut out of their budget. We have seen $75 million cut from the Australian Research Council. The CRCs have taken enormous cuts. The Institute of Marine Science has taken a cut. The Defence Science and Technology Organisation took a $120 million cut, the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation took a cut of over $27 million, and Geoscience Australia took a cut of $36 million. Of course, that is in addition to some of the attacks that we have seen on the university sector from this government. So, whilst we certainly welcome the government's attention to providing a revenue stream for medical research, we need to see that in the context of the government's broader attitude to science, the role of scientists and how evidence based science is then translated into public policy decisions.


Having been a health minister for some eight years, I understand very much the important role that research takes in informing the health services that are delivered across our community. I recall very starkly a piece of research that was done into radiation therapy for people having treatment for breast cancer and how research actually informed and underpinned a change to the way radiation therapy was provided to those breast cancer patients. It changed the type of treatment they had and the duration of that treatment. That not only provided a better experience for the women undergoing that treatment but also cleared the waiting list for radiotherapy breast cancer patients in a very short time. That was because the radiotherapy was truncated to a much shorter, targeted program. So it had benefits not only for the patients but also for the efficiency of the health system. That is just one example. I am sure all of us in here could talk at length about all the other research that has gone into the contemporary delivery of health services.


The CSIRO, in their submission on this legislation, said that Australia's health and medical system is a major part of the economy. Expenditure on health in Australia was estimated to be $130.3 billion in 2010, dramatically up from $77.5 billion in 2000. This expenditure trajectory has continued to grow between five and eight per cent per year in the last couple of years. This is due partly to an aging population but is also due to the increasing burden of chronic disease that has been experienced across Australia. The CSIRO went on to say:


Australia's health system must become more efficient to provide the health services that Australians expect and more innovative in using new technologies to improve health outcomes and dealing with emerging health issues and trends.


I think all of us standing here in support of this legislation today would accept that analysis.


As previous Labor members have said, the Labor Party will support the establishment of this fund and the improvements that will be made through Labor's amendments. It is very important that we embed research as a part of the health system and not have it seen as a sweetener to some of the other cuts. Looking at the origin of this fund, it came as the centrepiece, essentially, of a savage budget that sought to make a whole range of cuts to families across Australia not only through the social welfare system but also through the health system. It was this budget where the Medical Research Future Fund emerged. That was, of course, the first budget that looked at a GP co-payment mark 1, and we have seen various versions of it over the past 18 months but now it is in place with the indexation freeze on Medicare rebates. So, yes, research needs to be part of any modern, efficient and innovative health system, but it cannot be used to play off one side against another—which was the role of this initiative when it emerged. 


There is no doubt that we need to be investing in research. But can we invest in research whilst we are cutting hospital funding, dental funding, preventative health programs, the flexible fund, e-health—which will actually help to deliver an efficient and innovative health system—and the health workforce? There have been those attacks on primary care that have been underway over the past 18 months. You can feed your research arm as much as you like, but it will not help if you do not have a system that is actually able to deliver health services to the community. 


In some of the submissions and comments on the bills, other stakeholders have identified the importance of having a consistent and stable funding source going into medical research. The submission from the Association of Australian Medical Research Institutes talks of needing this fund but ensuring that it is not hijacked by anybody—government or future governments—to pork-barrel nor hijacked by special interest groups or state governments wanting to backfill clinical care. These are all important points that need to be acknowledged. I think that has flowed through the inquiry, which has looked at the need for very strong governance arrangements to be in place and independence from the arms of executive government. This is certainly a position that the AMA endorses. Others have also cited concerns that the medical research community is already organising how it will get money from this fund. With the amount of money involved and the ability for the private sector, the community sector and other health providers to be interested, there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that this fund and calls on it will be heavily oversubscribed. Again, this points to the reason to have really strong governance in place and a very strong, independent process that is tried and tested and will withstand some of the pressures that will come from this amount of money being available for research. 


The process for allocating grants under the proposal, as outlined, although I acknowledge that there have been some amendments made in the House, is a broad process in terms of the definitions, but there is also the concern I raised as to how decisions around the grants process are taken and managed. There is without doubt, and others have spoken of it, a legitimate role here for the NHMRC, which is a tried and tested model. Since its establishment in 1926, it has had a pre-eminent reputation as to how it manages and allocates the existing funds. It is hard to understand why it could not be used in a more permanent way. 


Having the chair of the NHMRC sit on an advisory council probably acts as a way to say, 'You have addressed that concern,' but anyone with an understanding of strong governance processes and how the NHMRC works would see it for what it was: a tokenistic acknowledgement of the chair and the chair's role rather than having it come under the formal structures of the NHMRC. 


There is no doubt it is business that the NHMRC understands: it focuses on current and future public health issues. It already has relationships well established across Australia for delivering health grants. When you look back at the mid-year economic update, or it might have been the budget, a whole range of committees and structures were abolished. In fact, it was part of a key agenda from the finance minister to cut red tape, abolish all these bodies, streamline processes and make doing business easier. The government uses that argument and, at the same time, for this important body that is to be established, it would go around the body that has the skills and expertise to actually administer this fund, albeit under a different way with the special purpose fund, and look to establish another group which has an advisory role to the minister, but the minister, ultimately, takes the decisions. Then it goes to a cabinet process where, no doubt, it could be fiddled with again and perhaps put a whole lot of focus on wind farms, for example. The health impact of wind farms probably needs at least another 15 studies done into it, for argument's sake. So it could be said by government that this is the avenue that this money could go to instead of focusing on what it needs to be doing: allowing those with the expertise and skill in the area to go through their established grants allocation process, which is peer reviewed and the best model to deliver the research that aligns with Australia's current and future health needs.


I might leave my comments there. I look forward to listening to the debate and, hopefully, to seeing the Labor amendments supported, which will strengthen the governance and independence of this fund and make sure that it can be used for what it needs to be used for. The government needs to apply focus rather than a scattergun approach to research. Use the NHMRC—it is there. At the same time we must also continue to argue for the effective and full funding of the health system. There is absolutely no point in having a well-resourced research sector if you are savaging the delivery arm of the health system at the same time and making sure that it is not in a position to deal with the continually growing need for health care. That need is not just in hospitals. It is right through—in community health, primary care, palliative care and outpatient services—and the demand is growing every year. Technology is supporting that growth, but we have to make sure that we are not savaging one part of the system to sweeten up the other.

Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (13:46):  I rise very, very proudly to support the Medical Research Future Fund Bill 2015 and the Medical Research Future Fund (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2015. As a person who once had a kindred relationship with medical research I hope that this initiative of the Australian government will be strongly supported by everybody in this chamber, that we will see it pass through this chamber and that, in so doing, it will come into law. Senator Cameron was somewhat amused by my veterinary reference, but he may well know that 75 per cent of all infectious diseases in human beings have their origin in animals. Again I am very proud to say as an aside—and I hope that, in fact, the future fund might pick up on this issue—that Australia has moved and is moving to a One Health approach.


I want to commence by reflecting on the excellence of the history of medical research by Australians, because it sets the scene for this visionary move by the government, led by the Treasurer, in establishing this future fund. I commence in 1945 with Professor Baron Howard Walter Florey who, with his collaborators, won a Nobel prize for the discovery of penicillin and its curative effect in various infectious diseases. In 1960 Sir Frank Macfarlane Burnet won his Nobel prize for acquired immunological tolerance. In the world of immunology one can only think of Professor Gustav Nossal, who has demonstrated an enormous capacity for Australians in the field of research—indeed, he is internationally acclaimed and has brought great credit to his country. I go on: the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1970 was awarded to Sir Bernard Katz, again in that particular area for transmission in nerve terminals and inactivation. In 1996, I am very proud to say, a fellow veterinarian, Professor Peter Charles Doherty, received his Nobel prize, relating to the specificity of cell-mediated immune deficiencies.


We go forward to 2005 when—again I am very proud to say this as a fellow Western Australian—Professors Barry Marshall and Robin Warren received the Nobel prize for their work in determining and confirming the fact that the bacterium Heliobacter pylori is responsible for gastritis and peptic ulcers. In fact, so committed was Professor Marshall to proving this theory that he ingested a serum of the bacterium Heliobacter pylori, contracted severe acute gastritis and peptic ulcers and then treated them. Indeed, that led to the Nobel prize they won. Then we go even further to 2009 with Professor Elizabeth Blackburn and her collaborators, Professor Carol Greider and Jack Szostak, for their work with chromosomal anatomy and functionality. 


Australia has a very proud history of medical research, and the future fund builds on that proud tradition. We have always punched well above our weight, and the establishment of the future fund is going to allow further opportunity in this area.


We know that with an ageing population that is much more active into older life—indeed, younger people are far more physically active recreationally—there are increasing demands on health. I remember it being said to me four or five years ago that, the way the Queensland public health budget was going, by 2025—if no changes were made—the entire state revenue would be required just in the health sector. But the future fund, though not on its own, will significantly contribute to the containment of costs. 


What are we going to see in this particular circumstance? We are going to see Australia continue to advance world-leading medical research projects to attract and retain first-class researchers and to deliver improved health and medical outcomes—not just for all Australians but for all those within our region. Going back to the question of One Health, I think of the Hendra virus which has killed veterinarians and a couple of racehorse trainers and horses, and is very closely related to the Nipah virus, which has killed children in Malaysia, Bangladesh and India. So it will not just be to the benefit for Australians—it will be a benefit for all, especially those within our region.


The second point to be made is that we often hear about the 'brain drain' of our top young researchers leaving Australia to go and work elsewhere because they do not have the opportunities; the future fund is going to give us the opportunity to attract the best young brains to come into this country because they will want to work with it. The fund will support the sustainability of our health system well into the future. All Australians will benefit from ongoing investments in medical research and medical innovation through the fund, both directly through improved health and indirectly through improved productivity and economic growth. This brings to my mind CSL—the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, as they were once known, a company that is now international, with its world-leading researchers and commercial developers of vaccines in both the human space and the animal and animal production space. 


This gives me the opportunity to say that the future fund is going to generate a whole stack of new business opportunities, and we know that one of the new growth centres announced by the Minister for Industry and Science, Mr Macfarlane, is directly related to medical innovations and research and commercial opportunities. This is all coming together so well in this particular space. 


I again compliment the executive on the way in which they have established the concept of the fund which will allow the capital to be invested by the Future Fund Board of Guardians—and what an outstanding group they have been and continue to be. I saw some figures on the weekend on the investment success of the Future Fund against all other superannuation funds in this country. If my figures are correct, the Future Fund has been performing at an average of in excess of 8.8 per cent return on funds invested; whereas the average of all superannuation funds has been only a shade over five per cent. So what better hands in which to place the fund than those of an already proven organisation, with a set of circumstances and a model already in place so that we do not need to generate a new wave of bureaucracy to have responsibility for the capital component of the new future fund.


We know that there will be a special account which will allow for earnings to be distributed from the future fund to the health portfolio special account, to corporate Commonwealth entities or to the COAG reform process to address medical research and innovation priorities. What are we going to see in this instance? We are going to see the build-up of capital into the future fund. It will eventually get to some $20 billion, and that $20 billion of capital will be protected. Only the interest accruing from that capital will eventually flow into medical research. So why is it important for us in this place today to be debating this issue and, I hope, to unanimously give agreement to the future fund? It is because it was due to start on 1 August 2015, and it will, indeed, subject to the passage of the legislation through this place, commence soon after the legislation is passed. Therefore, I say to my colleagues on all sides that delays in the commencement of the future fund will impact the level of investment earnings of the fund and will reduce the amount of funding available for distribution to medical research and innovations into next year. So it is critically important. 


How will the earnings be determined? As I have said, the fund is a capital-preserved fund. The net earnings of the fund will be distributed annually to support ongoing health and medical research. The net earnings from the fund will serve as a secure revenue stream well into the future. I know that the Assistant Minister for Health, Senator Nash, and, of course, the Minister for Health, Ms Ley, will be reassured that we will know well into the future that we can program research that is so desperately needed and that we can actually schedule it. It has been disappointing to hear some of the flippant comments by others as to where they believe some of that research money may go. 


How will the funding be distributed? Who will make recommendations to the minister in terms of the distribution of that funding? The funding will be distributed to address Australian medical research and innovation priorities and will be determined—it is critically important that people understand this—by the independent advisory board based on the Australian Medical Research and Innovation Strategy, and funding will be taken from the fund only following a decision of government through the usual budget processes. Payments other than those made through the COAG Reform Fund or as appropriated to Commonwealth entities will be distributed as grants—not as loans but as grants—which will be, for example, through the National Health and Medical Research Council. The NHMRC will have a critical role in this advisory component as, indeed, it should from the commencement.


Contributions to the fund will come initially from some $1 billion in uncommitted funds in the Health and Hospitals Fund—and it is a good thing the finance minister has turned up, because he has got accountability to this place and to the parliament more generally in terms of that disbursement. We will see $1 billion in uncommitted funds in the existing Health and Hospitals Fund, and the estimated value of savings from the health portfolio for 2014, as announced by Minister Ley, will allow the fund to get to its capital level of some $20 billion by, it is hoped, 2019-20. This year's budget, which has been so well accepted and received by the Australian community, contained a range of health savings measures, so not all of the capital from health savings expected by 2019-20 will be required to achieve that $20 billion target, but more of it will be invested as we go forward into the future. What we need to know is: how do the crediting arrangements from this fund differ from those of nation-building funds? It is of some significance, as Senator Macdonald would know, that the crediting arrangements for the fund and the nation-building funds are similar, but there are differences in terms of the initial credits to the fund itself. The total amount of the initial credits for the nation-building funds were specified in legislation.

Senator McLUCAS
 (Queensland) (12:32):  I rise to speak to the provisions of the Medical Research Future Fund Bill 2015 and the Medical Research Future Fund (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2015 on behalf of the opposition. These bills finally give effect to the government's stated intention to establish the Medical Research Future Fund, having announced its intention in the 2014-15 budget some 18 months ago. It is true to say that these bills have had a very long gestation period and now, it would seem, a fairly quick birth. I will leave that to others to explain. 


The Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee only held a hearing on 4 August 2015, just last week, and the report of the committee was only tabled yesterday afternoon. I certainly am hopeful that the speed that we are now proceeding with does not result in any errors, oversights or omissions. The haste with which this process is occurring does warrant an explanation, and I have to say it puts the crossbench in a somewhat difficult position to deal with the bills in the way that we are. However, I do wish to thank the secretariat of the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee, including staff who were co-opted for their work in conducting the hearing and also for the preparation of the report. I also thank those who wrote submissions to the inquiry and the witnesses who appeared. 


I now move to the substance of the bills. As I said, these bills finally give effect to the government's intention to set up a Medical Research Future Fund, but they fail to meet the policy objectives the government itself set in announcing this fund. When it was first announced the government promised:


Fund earnings will be directed to medical research, primarily by boosting funding for the National Health and Medical Research Council …


But now it is clear that, instead, there is no formal role for the NHMRC in administering MRFF disbursements. The government has refused to work with Labor to consider how the NHMRC, an 80-year-old institution that has universal respect, could have a role in assessing applications and administering MRFF disbursements. The government has failed to do this, despite significant support from the sector for a formal process of expert review to be reflected in the bills and consistent support for some formal recognition of the role of the NHMRC. I intend to explore that support in some detail. 


Labor agrees with some of the principles established in the bills and that a new health and medical research innovation strategy should be developed to set the agenda for the MRFF funding. But these bills allow for the minister of the day to make decisions that are not subject to the same sort of peer review that is followed by the NHMRC. Indeed, former NHMRC CEO Professor Warwick Anderson, now the secretary general of the international Human Frontier Science Program organisation, provided answers to questions on notice specifically supporting a greater role for the NHMRC and a process of peer review to identify what is value for money and what is not. Specifically, Professor Anderson said:


I support the concept of the MRFF advisory committee setting the strategy for the MRFF through consultation, and the NHMRC administering the majority of the funding. When judging how to use public money for research only peer review can identify what is favourable and what is not. NHMRC's almost 80 years of effective, ethical and efficient service to the Australian community means that public trust in the MRFF will be maintained if NHMRC plays the major role in administering the earnings of the fund in accord with the advisory board strategy.


He goes on:


NHMRC's current act allows simple and recently established ways to proceed, if the MRFF funds are provided to NHMRC outside the NHMRC's Medical Research Endowment Account (as is the case with the current government dementia research initiative).


He concludes:


Coordination between the MRFF and NHMRC will be essential if the greatest good is be gained from the MRFF for the benefit of Australia.


The government itself promised that fund earnings would be directed to medical research, primarily by boosting funding for the National Health and Medical Research Council. So it is deeply concerning that, having spent more than a year talking about this fund, the government has not done the work to establish a fund that meets those principles the government first announced.


I acknowledge, through the consequential amendments, that the CEO of the NHMRC is to have a role on the Australian Medical Research Advisory Board, but there is not enough clarity to this point about how that will operate. The Senate is being asked a lot, in dealing with these bills, to take the government at its word. Despite not properly consulting and not establishing a bill that is based on comprehensive consultation and a robust funding mechanism, the Senate is being asked to trust that the government will sort these details out later. But, frankly, this government has proven itself to be comprehensively untrustworthy and to be capable of politicising almost any issue. Particularly in this department, this government has politicised almost every issue that has come in front of us.


So, what reassurances are there that this fund could not be used to support research into the health impact of wind farms or research into chemtrails. The minister of the day gets to make final funding decisions, based on no process of peer review to identify what is valuable and what is not. It seems that the Greens are happy to support this position—to support the minister making funding decisions not based on any independent peer review process, which leaves wide open the possibility of this government directing funding to its own pet projects to fund research into, as I said, the health impact of wind farms, and to fund its own election promises.


The risk in the way the government is seeking to set up this fund is not just that the best research—that is, the most meritorious research—misses out on funding but that the loudest voice at the table catches the minister's ear and is ultimately awarded funding for this reason alone. Dr Phoebe Phillips, the President of the Australian Society for Medical Research and a researcher into pancreatic cancer at the Lowy Cancer Research Centre, told the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee's inquiry:


We do a lot of work with the community and I think that taxpayers really want to know that their money is going towards funding the best possible high-quality research that delivers health outcomes. All the evidence based on peer review in this country—and we have done a lot of this work in this space with independent commissioned reports—suggests that NHMRC peer review has actually been very successful in delivering better outcomes.


Again, I think what we do not want to happen is the loudest speaker being able to approach the Minister for Health and say, 'I have this problem, let's get some money here.' It needs to be peer reviewed so that rigorous questions are asked to actually determine whether it is a feasible study, whether it is a clinical trial or whether it is basic research leading to a discovery trial. As pointed out, how is an individual, group or a team going to measure the outcomes and have an accurate time line which can be judged? I think that is the expectation of taxpayers.


In regard to NHMRC's integrity, they have been around for 75 years in this space and that peer review system has improved greatly over time.


We know that investment into health and medical research through the peer review has really put Australia as one of the leaders in health and medical research.


As I said earlier, it is not just Labor senators who have called for greater transparency, for a process of peer or expert review, and for a formal role for the NHMRC in administering disbursements. There were many witnesses at the inquiry who concurred with that view. I point senators to the Australian Clinical Trials Alliance, who told this to the committee, and also the Group of Eight Universities and the innovative university sector.


Returning to the specifics of the bills, and the way the government wants to make disbursements from the MRFF, the bills also allow for the Minister for Finance to direct credits to the MRFF Health Special Account for the purpose of making grants of financial assistance to medical research institutes, non-profit organisations, universities and corporations. This remains very concerning for Labor. Again, this means that without any oversight from an independent advisory panel, without a peer review process, without consulting the NHMRC, or even distributing funding at arm's length through the NHMRC, the government can for all intents and purposes direct credits from the MRFF to any pet project it wants.


We know that the idea for this fund came about just weeks before the last budget, which is something the government has been embarrassed about ever since. So you would have thought the Treasurer and Minister for Health would have actually done some policy work to properly develop this fund, but they have not. What is most concerning about the way the government is seeking to establish this fund is the lack of proper governance surrounding the way its disbursements will be made.


Labor, of course, are the biggest supporters of health and medical research in this place. We demonstrated this in government through a commitment of more than $3.5 billion in health and medical research funding. This included more than $700 million to build and upgrade health and medical research facilities right across the country. We also commissioned the landmark McKeon Strategic Review of Health and Medical Research, to provide a long-term vision for governments and for the sector. The review made it clear that a levy like the Abbott government's GP tax was not the ideal nor preferred method for funding medical research in Australia, and we continue to agree with this. That is also why we do not believe that the government should continue its freeze on Medicare rebates. The inevitable outcome of this will be a GP tax worse than that proposed in last year's budget and a collapse in bulk-billing rates.


The McKeon review provides a 10-year road map as to how health and medical research can be supported for the benefit of all Australians, but these bills in no way reflect that vision. From Labor's perspective it is especially disappointing that the government has not used this legislation as an opportunity to pursue the recommendations in the McKeon review. Specifically, the government has missed the opportunity, firstly, to embed research into the health system and, secondly, to implement the review recommendations to establish integrated health research centres, accelerate clinical trial reforms and support health and medical research workforce retention—the training and support recommendations. It has completely missed the opportunity to support co-investment from philanthropic and other sources, and missed any opportunity to identify new funding sources. Mr McKeon recommended identifying 'other possible funding sources such as alternative debt finance, R&D tax incentives and levies, and schemes such as research prizes'. The government completely ignored those recommendations in establishing this fund.


The fund was meant to be operational on 1 January 2015. It is a reflection of the chaotic and dysfunctional two years we have had with this government that it has only now finally got around to introducing another one of its so-called signature policies. It really does beggar belief that, having not done the policy work in announcing this fund, delaying its introduction by more than six months, the government still has not done the work on setting up a fund with proper governance structures.    It is emblematic, though, of how this government politicises every issue and of its chaotic and dysfunctional mismanagement of the health portfolio.


It is worth putting on record the cuts that have been made to support this fund. This is where the money is ostensibly coming from. Billions of dollars have been cut from public hospital funding; more than half a billion dollars cut from public dental programs; $400 million cut from preventive health programs; and hundreds of millions of dollars cut from the health flexible funds that support vital drug and alcohol rehabilitation services and important work undertaken by organisations like the Heart Foundation, the Cancer Council, the Consumer Health Forum and the Public Health Association. There have been cuts to veterans' dental and allied health programs, cuts to the Healthy Kids Check, cuts to the electronic health records program, cuts to the Partners in Recovery mental health program—and the list goes on. So Labor are right to be sceptical about this government's intentions. We have long said that we always support sensible measures to grow and support health and medical research, but not at the expense of sick Australians today.


While all this has been happening, Labor has been undertaking its own policy development process, consulting with health and medical research leaders and researchers across the country to develop the best system we can. We will move amendments to these bills that reflect those principles. Labor's amendments will add integrity to the bills and reflect in many ways how grants are administered by the NHMRC through its act. It beggars belief that, despite first promising that funds from the MRFF would principally be distributed through the NHMRC, the government has included no formal role for the NHMRC. I want to make it clear that while Labor will not oppose this legislation, because we do support health and medical research—indeed we are the strongest supporters of health and medical research in this place—we do not support a discretionary funding mechanism that leaves open the possibility that the health minister of the day can just fund the projects of their choosing. In government, Labor would seek to amend the NHMRC Act to ensure that similar processes are followed for MRFF disbursements as we follow for disbursements from the Medical Research Endowment Account.


Labor agree that research different from what the NHMRC has traditionally funded should be funded through the MRFF, so we do support the development of a new Australian Medical Research and Innovation Strategy as the basis on which these priorities can be identified and projects that have a stronger focus on translational research, clinical trials, and commercialisation can be awarded funding. We also agree that this additional investment should be quarantined from the existing allocation through the Medical Research Endowment Account, and we would make sure this is reflected. I will refer during the committee stage to the intention of our amendments.


Labor has always supported, in word and in deed, health and medical research. Our health and medical researchers do amazing work. For a country of our population size, we as Australians can be proud of the research outcomes from our tax dollars. We can also be proud of the results that our dedicated research community achieve. Labor supports building on this success by growing the translational research that many in the community also support. But the way the government has gone about getting to this point has been less than ideal. The time between inquiry and tabling and now dealing with the legislation has been truncated, which has been problematic for many, including some on the crossbench. The funding sources have been divisive in the community, pitting the desirability of increased funding for health and medical research against access to health services for people who are currently sick and need support now. For one of this government's so-called signature policies, this has been a messy process. The Australian research community will watch this government closely. The policy intent must be achieved both now and into the future.

"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2015-08-11,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (12:51):  The Medical Research Future Fund Bill 2015 and the Medical Research Future Fund (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2015 establish the Medical Research Future Fund, which involves the crediting and debiting of funds and the governance and administration of the fund itself. The Greens are strong supporters of health and medical research and we support the intention of the Medical Research Future Fund—that is, strategies that will prioritise and foster innovation and translational research. Health and medical research represents some of the very best of what Australia can offer and some of the very best of the economic opportunities for the generation ahead. It is with some pleasure that I can say that in my hometown of Melbourne we have some of the greatest medical research minds in the country. We have people like Professor Brendan Crabb from the Burnet Institute and Professor Doug Hilton from the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, all of whom have been not only incredibly important contributors to the medical research effort in the Australian nation but also very strong advocates and supporters for the establishment of a medical research future fund.


It is the Greens' view that a 21st century economy needs to be built on our minds, not simply on minds. We have the clinical research capacity that exists in very few countries across the world that allows us to be able to conduct the sort of groundbreaking research that is not just simply elemental research but carries right through the spectrum to translational research and commercialisation. The Greens spoke in the election of a science package that would commit three per cent of GDP to research by the year 2020. It is a package that consists of a combined $750 million boost to the Australian Research Council and to national cooperative research centres, funding for indirect costs associated with health and medical research—and that is a huge drag on medical research in that the research is funded but the indirect administrative costs are not—moving towards default five-year grants in ARC and NHMRC through those grant processes and ensuring that we recognise people with a proven track record, $342 million to reverse the cuts that the government implemented to the Sustainable Research Excellence program and another several hundred million dollars in the area of a national research infrastructure facilities council. I could go on. There would be opportunities for international collaboration, ongoing future fellowships schemes, open access publishing of government funded research and more targeted support for commercialisation. That leads on to one of the great advantages of something like the Medical Research Future Fund, which has a very strong focus not just on primary elemental research driven research but on identified strategic areas where we can move to bridge the huge gap that exists between those primary areas of research and translation and commercialisation.


I do understand that people have expressed some concerns around the proposed legislation that is before us. Certainly the Greens raised very serious questions about what the primary driver of the genesis of this legislation was. It was implemented at a time where we had a government that was very keen to introduce a GP co-payment and it is very hard to escape the conclusion that this was drafted after that decision in order to sweeten what was a very poor area of public policy. However, the Greens, like many people within the medical research community, were keen to ensure that one of the very few good ideas that has come from this government was not jettisoned simply because it was associated with one area of poor policy. We understand that some other issues have been addressed around the bills—issues of governance, how we define translational research and the role of the NHMRC in the process—and I will talk to those in a moment.


It has to be said, though, that this fund is a fund that sits amongst some other areas of government policy where this government has been prepared to go in precisely the opposite direction to the direction that we appear to be going in here when it comes to medical research. Look at climate change, for example, and the backward steps that we are taking in investing in the sort of research that needs to be done in order to ensure that we are able to mitigate and adapt to catastrophic global warming. Look at the lack of investment in our university sector, cuts to the CSIRO and to R&D budgets and so on and you will see a government that is underinvesting in the sort of transformation that is necessary in order to drive a modern 21st century economy.


Going to the details of the fund, which is one small, shining light in a long tunnel of darkness, we have a fund where we will see $400 million available over the four years until June 2019, and of course we want to ensure that good governance and review processes accompany this package. In fact, our amendments have sought to ensure that what we do get is an improved governance process as well as a return on some of the serious commercial gains that might be made as a result of public investment. As I said, I think it is important to ensure that, given there is a debate about the role of the NHMRC in this process, it is understood that the Medical Research Future Fund does have a different focus to the NHMRC. As somebody who has been a long-time supporter of the NHMRC, an organisation that has a very long history of safeguarding and supporting health and medical research and giving advice to the community and government on drafting guidelines on so many important areas in health, I think it is important that we establish governance processes that are robust. To that end, it must be said that there are concerns around the degree to which the governance processes will leave this fund open to political interference, and I think we need to address that issue head on.


The first thing to say is that the NHMRC itself is not immune to government interference, despite its very impressive track record and despite its being an organisation that has shown itself to be an exemplar in many areas of scientific research. The NHMRC is now committed to investing several hundreds of thousands of dollars into research on the impact of wind turbines on people's health. The point here is that it is impossible to protect any organisation from political interference, and we know that the history of that decision was a decision that was very directly influenced by political considerations. However, we are assured that one of the changes to the legislation is that the bills require the advisory board—and let us be clear that there is an independent advisory board—will be established to administer these funds. That board will be made up of medical and scientific experts, all of whom are very protective of their professional reputations and would take very dimly to the suggestion that their decisions will be influenced based on political considerations, but the legislation does require the advisory board to take into account the NHMRC's national strategy for medical research and public health research—that is, it will be directed by those priorities that have already been identified by the NHMRC. 


We now know that Professor Kelso, the CEO of the NHMRC, will be given the opportunity to contribute to the development of the strategy that will guide the decisions of the advisory board—that is, the Medical Research and Innovation Strategy. The NHMRC will play a key role in drafting that strategy through Professor Kelso, who will be part of that advisory board. In her role as the CEO of the NHMRC she will ensure that the Medical Research Future Fund and the NHMRC strategies are aligned and complimentary. Professor Kelso has also reassured us that she will be able to draw on the NHMRC's wealth of experience and advice from its council and principal committees, and it will be critical to have her involvement on the advisory board.


The next thing that needs to be said is that Professor Kelso has also said that, if any Medical Research Future Fund funds are directed to the NHMRC for disbursement, the NHMRC will adapt those processes and draw on whatever expertise is necessary to make particular recommendations to government. I urge the minister to ensure that that suggestion is taken up, with an undertaking to exercise that as a principle across the board. Having the NHMRC's CEO on the decision-making panel is critical, and we are satisfied that that will make a significant difference to the decisions and the complementarity between the NHMRC and the Medical Research Future Fund.


We think there is a role, though, for some government discretion. We take Senator McLucas' points about the concerns, but we have been reassured that those concerns have been addressed through the advisory panel and the role of NHMRC on that advisory board. There are times when governments do need to determine the research priorities very quickly. In fact, we heard from the Association of Australian Medical Research Institutes, which described the example of a global pandemic where there is an imperative to direct our research priorities, for example, towards the development of a vaccination or other time critical research priorities. There it is necessary that there should be some flexibility for governments to be able to intervene in extraordinary circumstances, and there is a consensus that any involvement from government should be on the basis of an extraordinary circumstance like that rather than being the default position. Again I reiterate that the reputations of very distinguished medical researchers and scientists as well as the CEO of the NHMRC are at stake should political imperatives influence the decisions of the Medical Research Future Fund.


I think that it is also important to note that the investment that is contained within the Medical Research Future  Fund will be determined by a similar investment mandate to that determined by the Future Fund. It will differ around return and so on, but one of the things that the Greens have been very keen to ensure is that the Future Fund's policy—something that was achieved through the advocacy and work of the Greens—of not investing in tobacco products would be something that would apply to the Medical Research Future Fund. In fact, we have been assured that, while the Medical Research Future Fund can invest in any financial instrument, it would also act consistently with the Future Fund's policy around excluding investments in tobacco companies and cluster munitions. The Medical Research Future Fund will maintain a list of entities that are excluded under the board's ownership rights and the ESG risk management policy that applies within the Future Fund—that is, an exclusion on tobacco companies and cluster munition companies. We are pleased that that change has been made.


Let me conclude by saying that we absolutely understand the concerns that have been expressed by the Labor Party in terms of the risk of political interference. We have worked to ensure through our amendments that that risk is minimised. We have also worked to ensure through our amendments that there may be some potential for Australians to get a return on any successful project—by the word 'successful' I mean a commercially successful project. There should be some capacity for the Australian community to get a return on that investment. We have also—through amendments suggested to the government that we will discuss again later in the committee stage—sought to ensure that NHMRC funding is protected and that this Medical Research Future Fund is not used as a vehicle through which to shift investment dollars away from entities like the NHMRC to direct them towards another fund. 


In summary, we support the concept of a medical research future fund. We think that it is important to prioritise investment in translational funding and the commercialisation of projects. It is one of the very few good ideas that this government has come up with over its brief and chaotic period in government. It stands in direct contrast to the agenda it has to cut investment in funding science, research and innovation. But, where there are good ideas, the Greens are prepared to support them and we look forward to continuing this debate during the committee stage of the bills.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Smith, Sen Dean",LP,2015-08-11,"



Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia) (13:07):  It was the last bit of Senator Di Natale's contribution that I think was the most important. He committed the Australian Greens to looking carefully at, and even supporting, good ideas when they come before the Senate. Certainly, I and other government senators look forward to encouraging the Australian Greens to support those good ideas that come from the government and that are brought to this place.


It is my pleasure also to rise this afternoon to speak on the Medical Research Future Fund Bill 2015 and related bill. This legislation will give effect to what I believe will come to be viewed as one of the government's landmark achievements: the establishment of a $20 billion Medical Research Future Fund. This represents a massive investment in Australia's medical research community, which has always punched well above its weight in global terms when you consider the size of our population.


This is an important initiative for a couple of reasons. The first of these relates to the future needs of our own nation. This is very much a piece of economic legislation. As the fourth Intergenerational report confirmed earlier this year, healthcare costs in Australia will continue growing significantly in the years to come as our population ages. It is very much in our own interests to promote the type of research that will help to cure or, at least, lessen the impact of chronic illnesses that afflict members of our community. We know that Australians are going to be living longer. Our challenge is to make certain that they are living quality, healthy lives, as well as living longer ones.


By investing in medical research we can determine the effectiveness of a drug or form of treatment so that taxpayers' money is not being unnecessarily spent on things that do not work. But, more than that, this is the sort of investment that will allow Australia's medical research professionals to shine in a global context. Australian ingenuity has been a critical part of internationally significant developments in the field of medical research. For instance, think of Howard Florey, who carried out the first clinical trials of penicillin in 1941, an act for which he later shared in the Nobel Prize for medicine. Today, we can take it for granted that our injuries can be bandaged and our wounds will heal, with little risk of infection. But that was not always the case of course. Death from wound infection was a significant issue prior to the mid-1940s.


Establishing this fund is about helping to unlock the potential of medical research in Australia. I am utterly confident that there is another Howard Florey out there and that the intelligence and work ethic that abounds in Australia's medical research community will play a big role in the eventual cure of diseases such as cancer, diabetes, HIV and the like. That is why this legislation is important. It will be transformational, not just for the 23,000 Australians who work directly as medical research professionals but also for the medicines industry that supports those people and that itself employs nearly twice as many Australians.


The structure of the Medical Research Future Fund will also specifically address some of the concerns identified in the Strategic review of health and medical research, published in February 2013. That review, led by Mr Simon McKeon AO, clearly set out the need for Australia to have a more strategic model to get the best health results from its research efforts. The McKeon review identified a particular need to create greater linkage between healthcare providers and research organisations by 'fundamentally embedding research within healthcare delivery'.


The review set out a case for placing far greater emphasis on priority-driven research, to help bridge some of the gaps between research excellence and translation of research into applied technologies and practices. This requires additional investment in translating research findings into bedside applications. It requires more commercialisation and stronger partnerships between researchers and health practitioners, including hospitals and GPs. Importantly, it will support investment across the research spectrum, from laboratory research to clinical trials, the commercialisation of new drugs or devices, the translation of new techniques or protocols into clinical practice and public health improvements.


All told, the Medical Research Future Fund will provide some $400 million for distribution over the next four years. And it is worth noting, I think, that this investment is additional to existing government support for direct medical research activities. However, the MRFF will be structured in such a way that it will meet specific purposes, consistent with the coalition government's overall investment approach in medical research and innovation.


Importantly, the MRFF will be governed by an especially rigorous set of accountability measures. This government believes that taxpayers' funds are a precious resource and that they should be allocated wisely, based on expert advice and strong governance arrangements. The government underscored its commitment by making a series of amendments to the bill when it passed through the House of Representatives, all designed to strengthen accountability and transparency.


Under the terms of this bill, the Medical Research Future Fund will be managed by the Future Fund Board of Guardians. This will mean the fund is in the hands of a body that has a strong, proven track record when it comes to managing investment portfolios on behalf of the government or, more accurately, on behalf of the Australian taxpayer. For instance, under the board of guardians' stewardship, the Future Fund has grown from approximately $64 billion, at its inception in 2006, to around $117 billion as of March this year, an annualised rate of return of around 8.2 per cent. I think it would take a very brave politician to dispute the success of the Future Fund. The board of guardians will be required to adhere to the same accountability frameworks that this government has in place for all Commonwealth bodies. This includes the publication of annual reports, audited financial statements and quarterly portfolio updates reporting on the fund's performance. Projects funded by the MRFF will be publicly disclosed online, consistent with the government's reporting frameworks for grants.


On the issue of parliamentary accountability, the Minister for Health will be required to prepare a report every two years, that will set out all funding provided by the government for medical research and innovation from the MRFF, and to explain how the funding is consistent with the strategic objectives set out by the fund's advisory board. That strategy is subject to a review every five years and will take account of national health policy needs, gaps in current investment and the timing needed to make certain the nation is obtaining best possible value from our spending on health, medical research and medical innovation.


In terms of ministerial oversight, the finance minister will be responsible for ensuring funds disbursed by the MRFF are done so in a manner that is consistent with the government's overall policy objectives. In this regard, the finance minister will work closely with both the Treasurer and the Minister for Health, who will oversee the flow of funds through the two accounts applicable to the MRFF—the COAG Reform Fund and the Health Portfolio Special Account.


Of course, there is always a need to maintain independence in research activities, and nothing contained within the provisions of this legislation will threaten the independence of research activities. The coalition government is committed to all investment activities undertaken by the Future Fund board, remaining independent of government. Ministers will not be involved in investment decisions. The Future Fund board will apply the same principles to the investments of the MRFF as it does to other government investment funds for which it is responsible, including the Future Fund. Of course, the Future Fund board will be required to actively manage risks and not take decisions that are likely to jeopardise the investment taxpayers are making in the MRFF. Once the MRFF is established, the board of guardians will advise the Minister for Finance each year of net earnings which can be withdrawn from the fund to invest in medical research and innovation projects. As per usual, long-established practice, the government will then decide, though the annual budget process, how best to use these funds to support priority areas.


The establishment of the Medical Research Future Fund is something of which this coalition government is very proud. Indeed, I suspect that every Australian will find themselves very proud of this particular initiative as time passes. By making this long-term commitment to ensuring excellence in medical research, we are taking an important step not only in the advance of medical science in this country but also in putting Australia's health system on a more sustainable footing. I am sure all of us in this Senate chamber look forward to the day when, as a result of investments made though this fund, an Australian researcher contributes to curing a dreaded disease, helping people both here and internationally lead longer, healthier and more productive lives.


It is estimated that for every dollar invested in medical research, the community derives a benefit worth $2.17. By establishing this fund, we are going a long way to locking in enormous health and research benefits for the generations of Australians both now and into the future. With those remarks, I commend the bills to the Senate.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2015-08-11,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (13:17):  I too rise to speak today on the Medical Research Future Fund Bill 2015 and related bill. These bills finally give effect to the government's intention to set up a Medical Research Future Fund, the MRFF. And I say 'finally' because this fund was supposed to be operational by 1 January, some eight months ago.


It is a sad reflection on the chaotic and dysfunctional two years we have had with this government that it has only now managed to introduce another one of its signature policies. Yet they have time to create knights and dames and to protect hate speech—and how many attempts have they had to introduce a GP tax? This government is so inept that it has no control over its own legislative timetable. This government is setting new lows in getting legislation through this place. A recent report by TheSydney Morning Herald demonstrated that this government has been the least effective government in almost five decades—less effective than even the McMahon government. No wonder it has taken so long for these bills to come before us today. 


It is deeply concerning that, having spent more than one year talking about this fund, the government has not done the work needed to establish a fund that meets the principles the government itself outlined. Unfortunately, what the bills before us today fail to do is fulfil the government's promise when the fund was announced: 'fund earnings will be directed to medical research, primarily by boosting funding for the National Health and Medical Research Council, the NHMRC'. And it is here that it is important that we acknowledge just how well the NHMRC has served our nation.


The NHMRC has established internationally respected and transparent processes over more than 80 years, and Labor believes the existing mechanisms establish the best process through which the highest quality health and medical research can be funded through MRFF disbursements. The bills before us today only reference that the health minister 'could' ask for the NHMRC to manage distributions from the Medical Research Future Fund. It is no guarantee that the health minister will ask the NHMRC to manage distributions. And, given the government's track record of wanting to control such funding, there is the potential that the MRFF will become a slush fund for the health minister, just like Minister Brandis's arts slush fund.


Labor senators do not agree that decisions regarding the projects and programs awarded funding should sit wholly with the minister of the day. It is obvious that such a practice would be inconsistent with the way existing grants are awarded by the NHMRC, and inconsistent with international best practice in awarding grants to the highest quality projects based on a process of peer review.


Furthermore, the bills also provide that the finance minister can credit funds to the COAG Reform Fund for making payments to the states and territories for expenditure on medical research and medical innovation, including application and commercialisation activities that translate discoveries to new treatments and practice; and corporate Commonwealth entities outside the general government sector, such as the CSIRO. In addition, while the health minister can delegate responsibility for providing funding to institutions such as universities or medical research institutes, the health minister does not have to use this delegation.


Finally, the Minister for Finance can also direct credits to the MRFF Health Special Account for the purpose of making grants of financial assistance to medical research institutes, non-profit organisations, universities and corporations. Given the flexibility the government is allowing itself as to how funds can be allocated, it leaves open the question as to just what exactly this fund will support. Without any oversight from an independent advisory panel, without a peer review process, without consulting the NHMRC or even distributing funding at arm's length through the NHMRC, the government can, for all intents and purposes, direct credits from the MRFF to any pet project it wants. This all sounds very similar to concerns with Minister Brandis's arts funding changes. We know that the changes to arts funding are destroying the sector because of an ill-thought-out process which has vague guidelines and fails to provide appropriate criteria for assessment and basically becomes a private arts fund for the minister.


Back to the MRFF. In short, the government can send the funding to pretty much anywhere they choose with no independent advisory panel to oversee. It is very concerning—in fact, it is quite alarming to us on this side—that a large part of future medical research in this country can be at the sole discretion of the government to use for political purposes. It is a pretty ironic move from a government that is ideologically opposed to picking winners. The government is seeking to establish this fund without proper governance surrounding the way its disbursements will be made. So, how is this good for government?


Maybe those opposite can remind this place when good government is meant to begin again. I think it was six months ago that I heard that quote for the second time. 'Good governance starts today,' was, I think, the quote, but of course we are still waiting. Labor, of course, is the biggest supporter of health and medical research in this place. We demonstrated this when in government through a commitment of more than $3.5 billion in health and medical research funding. This included more than $700 million to build and upgrade health and medical research facilities across the country. Also, when in government, Labor commissioned the landmark McKeon Strategic Review of Health and Medical Research to provide a long-term vision for governments and the sector because Labor believes that medical research should be guided by a long-term vision, by guidance from experts, and be overseen by good governance. Those were our policies.


The McKeon review provides a 10-year roadmap as to how health and medical research can be supported for the benefit of all Australians. The review also made it clear that a levy, such as the Abbott government's GP tax, is not the ideal or preferred method for funding medical research in Australia and we agree. This is also why we oppose the government's freeze on Medicare rebates and call for it to be abandoned. The inevitable outcome of this freeze will be a GP tax worse than that proposed in last year's budget and a collapse in bulk-billing rates. 


It is really saddening to see just how dysfunctional the government's mismanagement of the health portfolio has been. It is clear that this government does not believe in the principles of universal health care. It opposed universal health care when Whitlam introduced Medibank, which it overturned when Malcolm Fraser became Prime Minister. And this government does everything it can to strip funding away from health programs.


I would like to put on record some of the cuts that have been made to health to support this fund. They include more than half a billion dollars cut from public dental programs; billions of dollars cut from public hospital funding; almost $400 million cut from preventive health programs; hundreds of millions of dollars cut from the Health Flexible Funds, which support vital drug and alcohol rehabilitation services and important work undertaken by organisations like the Heart Foundation, the Cancer Council, the Consumer Health Forum, the Public Health Association and others; cuts to veterans' dental and allied health programs; cuts to the electronic health record; cuts to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, including the proposal that is still before the Senate to increase the cost of medicines by $5 for all general patients and 80c for concessional patients, as well as unfair changes to the PBS safety nets; cuts to a number of important health workforce programs; cuts to optometry programs—not to mention cuts to the Healthy Kids Check.


Now, let us just look at the impact of one of those issues. Having worked in early childhood education I am appalled at the axing of the Healthy Kids Check. This is a comprehensive health check for children aged three to five, which has been scrapped by the federal government to save about $144 million over four years, angering GPs and speech pathologists, as well as parents of young children. The Abbott government axed Medicare funding for the Healthy Kids Check, which is a consultation with a nurse or a GP to assess a child's health and development before they start school. The scheme includes assessments of a child's height and weight, hearing, eye sight, oral health, toilet habits and known or suspected allergies. Also, it helps parents to understand the risk of anaphylaxis and how to prevent it. In 2014, 154,000 children used the program. Medicare pays between $58 for a Healthy Kids Check consultation with a nurse and $269 for an hour with a GP, depending on the child's needs. According to a study published in the Medical Journal of Australia in 2014, the check was detecting problems in about one in five children. The most common problems identified related to speech and language, followed by toilet habits, hearing, vision and behavioural issues.


Other organisations concerned include the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, which stated it was disappointed by the federal government's decision, which was made without consulting GPs—what a familiar record they have on that side about that. Also Speech Pathology Australia has stated that scrapping a check that facilitated early intervention services for children with problems before school made no sense at all. In fact, I would say, having previously spent 12 years as an early childhood educator, that it is likely to lead to worse educational outcomes for children who go to school with undetected health problems. Economically, you have to think about the costs involved and about how much money could be saved through early detection. Obviously there could be a cost saving through early detection.


None of this makes any sense—it does not make any sense at all to me but that is like so much of what this government does.  These are important programs which should be supported and should not have been axed, but, unfortunately, this government just wants to cut health whenever it can.


The bills we are debating today—the Medical Research Future Fund Bill and the Medical Research Future Fund (Consequential Amendments) Bill—were inquired into by the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee. Labor senators made additional comments in the final report, and I would just like to mention some of these today. Labor senators commented:


Labor Senators support the establishment of the Medical Research Future Fund as an opportunity to expand Australia's health and medical research sector, especially in that it provides an opportunity to implement some of the recommendations of the McKeon Review … 


Importantly:


Labor Senators however see the MRFF as a missed opportunity to pursue many of these recommendations due to the rushed and poorly developed proposal the Government has developed—


yet again—


giving no consideration to McKeon's recommendations to attract philanthropy and new funding sources, or indeed define the recommendations in the original Bill.


…   …   …


Labor Senators agree that the types of research that should be funded through MRFF disbursements is different from what the NHMRC has traditionally funded, especially when it comes to commercialisation and translational research. Labor Senators also recognise that through the NHMRC's existing committee structures this capacity is lacking which is why Labor Senators support the development of the Australian Medical Research and Innovation Strategy and the Australian Medical Research and Innovation Priorities.


However:


Labor Senators do not support the transfer of existing funds within the Health and Hospitals Fund transferring to the MRFF…


The Health and Hospitals Fund was 'established for different purposes' and should not be raided to fund the MRFF. Labor will:


… seek to make a number of amendments to the Bills to establish a more robust assessment process. Labor's amendments establish the inclusion of a process of expert review to ensure that the highest quality research is rewarded, rather than—potentially politically motivated and influenced by the 'loudest voices'—decisions being made by the Minister of the day and subject to no independent oversight and with little transparency.


A Labor Government would seek to amend the NHMRC Act to ensure that, whilst the MRFF Special Account were to remain independent, the role of any MRFF advisory committee would be reflected in the NHMRC Council structure with the same sort of rigour applied to funding assessment as the NHMRC does through its existing grants streams.


This government could have done, and should have done, a whole lot better with these bills, especially given the delay in bringing them before the parliament today. I encourage senators to carefully consider Labor's amendments and to support Labor's amendments to the bills.

"Gallagher, Sen Katy",ALP,2015-08-11,"



Senator GALLAGHER
 (Australian Capital Territory) (13:32):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important legislation, the Medical Research Future Fund Bill 2015 and related bill. I would like to start by making some comments on this government's attitude to science since coming to power. I have listened to others who have participated in this debate and one could take from the comments from government members that this government is the biggest supporter of science and evidence based research informing policy decisions that the country has ever seen. But, if you go back and look at what has happened in terms of attacks on science, attacks on scientists and cuts to science and research across Australia since 2013, the record tells a much different story.


Certainly some very well documented analysis has been done around this. In my home town of Canberra we have seen the attacks that have been waged against CSIRO, with the loss of 600 jobs and over $111 million cut out of their budget. We have seen $75 million cut from the Australian Research Council. The CRCs have taken enormous cuts. The Institute of Marine Science has taken a cut. The Defence Science and Technology Organisation took a $120 million cut, the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation took a cut of over $27 million, and Geoscience Australia took a cut of $36 million. Of course, that is in addition to some of the attacks that we have seen on the university sector from this government. So, whilst we certainly welcome the government's attention to providing a revenue stream for medical research, we need to see that in the context of the government's broader attitude to science, the role of scientists and how evidence based science is then translated into public policy decisions.


Having been a health minister for some eight years, I understand very much the important role that research takes in informing the health services that are delivered across our community. I recall very starkly a piece of research that was done into radiation therapy for people having treatment for breast cancer and how research actually informed and underpinned a change to the way radiation therapy was provided to those breast cancer patients. It changed the type of treatment they had and the duration of that treatment. That not only provided a better experience for the women undergoing that treatment but also cleared the waiting list for radiotherapy breast cancer patients in a very short time. That was because the radiotherapy was truncated to a much shorter, targeted program. So it had benefits not only for the patients but also for the efficiency of the health system. That is just one example. I am sure all of us in here could talk at length about all the other research that has gone into the contemporary delivery of health services.


The CSIRO, in their submission on this legislation, said that Australia's health and medical system is a major part of the economy. Expenditure on health in Australia was estimated to be $130.3 billion in 2010, dramatically up from $77.5 billion in 2000. This expenditure trajectory has continued to grow between five and eight per cent per year in the last couple of years. This is due partly to an aging population but is also due to the increasing burden of chronic disease that has been experienced across Australia. The CSIRO went on to say:


Australia's health system must become more efficient to provide the health services that Australians expect and more innovative in using new technologies to improve health outcomes and dealing with emerging health issues and trends.


I think all of us standing here in support of this legislation today would accept that analysis.


As previous Labor members have said, the Labor Party will support the establishment of this fund and the improvements that will be made through Labor's amendments. It is very important that we embed research as a part of the health system and not have it seen as a sweetener to some of the other cuts. Looking at the origin of this fund, it came as the centrepiece, essentially, of a savage budget that sought to make a whole range of cuts to families across Australia not only through the social welfare system but also through the health system. It was this budget where the Medical Research Future Fund emerged. That was, of course, the first budget that looked at a GP co-payment mark 1, and we have seen various versions of it over the past 18 months but now it is in place with the indexation freeze on Medicare rebates. So, yes, research needs to be part of any modern, efficient and innovative health system, but it cannot be used to play off one side against another—which was the role of this initiative when it emerged. 


There is no doubt that we need to be investing in research. But can we invest in research whilst we are cutting hospital funding, dental funding, preventative health programs, the flexible fund, e-health—which will actually help to deliver an efficient and innovative health system—and the health workforce? There have been those attacks on primary care that have been underway over the past 18 months. You can feed your research arm as much as you like, but it will not help if you do not have a system that is actually able to deliver health services to the community. 


In some of the submissions and comments on the bills, other stakeholders have identified the importance of having a consistent and stable funding source going into medical research. The submission from the Association of Australian Medical Research Institutes talks of needing this fund but ensuring that it is not hijacked by anybody—government or future governments—to pork-barrel nor hijacked by special interest groups or state governments wanting to backfill clinical care. These are all important points that need to be acknowledged. I think that has flowed through the inquiry, which has looked at the need for very strong governance arrangements to be in place and independence from the arms of executive government. This is certainly a position that the AMA endorses. Others have also cited concerns that the medical research community is already organising how it will get money from this fund. With the amount of money involved and the ability for the private sector, the community sector and other health providers to be interested, there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that this fund and calls on it will be heavily oversubscribed. Again, this points to the reason to have really strong governance in place and a very strong, independent process that is tried and tested and will withstand some of the pressures that will come from this amount of money being available for research. 


The process for allocating grants under the proposal, as outlined, although I acknowledge that there have been some amendments made in the House, is a broad process in terms of the definitions, but there is also the concern I raised as to how decisions around the grants process are taken and managed. There is without doubt, and others have spoken of it, a legitimate role here for the NHMRC, which is a tried and tested model. Since its establishment in 1926, it has had a pre-eminent reputation as to how it manages and allocates the existing funds. It is hard to understand why it could not be used in a more permanent way. 


Having the chair of the NHMRC sit on an advisory council probably acts as a way to say, 'You have addressed that concern,' but anyone with an understanding of strong governance processes and how the NHMRC works would see it for what it was: a tokenistic acknowledgement of the chair and the chair's role rather than having it come under the formal structures of the NHMRC. 


There is no doubt it is business that the NHMRC understands: it focuses on current and future public health issues. It already has relationships well established across Australia for delivering health grants. When you look back at the mid-year economic update, or it might have been the budget, a whole range of committees and structures were abolished. In fact, it was part of a key agenda from the finance minister to cut red tape, abolish all these bodies, streamline processes and make doing business easier. The government uses that argument and, at the same time, for this important body that is to be established, it would go around the body that has the skills and expertise to actually administer this fund, albeit under a different way with the special purpose fund, and look to establish another group which has an advisory role to the minister, but the minister, ultimately, takes the decisions. Then it goes to a cabinet process where, no doubt, it could be fiddled with again and perhaps put a whole lot of focus on wind farms, for example. The health impact of wind farms probably needs at least another 15 studies done into it, for argument's sake. So it could be said by government that this is the avenue that this money could go to instead of focusing on what it needs to be doing: allowing those with the expertise and skill in the area to go through their established grants allocation process, which is peer reviewed and the best model to deliver the research that aligns with Australia's current and future health needs.


I might leave my comments there. I look forward to listening to the debate and, hopefully, to seeing the Labor amendments supported, which will strengthen the governance and independence of this fund and make sure that it can be used for what it needs to be used for. The government needs to apply focus rather than a scattergun approach to research. Use the NHMRC—it is there. At the same time we must also continue to argue for the effective and full funding of the health system. There is absolutely no point in having a well-resourced research sector if you are savaging the delivery arm of the health system at the same time and making sure that it is not in a position to deal with the continually growing need for health care. That need is not just in hospitals. It is right through—in community health, primary care, palliative care and outpatient services—and the demand is growing every year. Technology is supporting that growth, but we have to make sure that we are not savaging one part of the system to sweeten up the other.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2015-08-11,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (13:46):  I rise very, very proudly to support the Medical Research Future Fund Bill 2015 and the Medical Research Future Fund (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2015. As a person who once had a kindred relationship with medical research I hope that this initiative of the Australian government will be strongly supported by everybody in this chamber, that we will see it pass through this chamber and that, in so doing, it will come into law. Senator Cameron was somewhat amused by my veterinary reference, but he may well know that 75 per cent of all infectious diseases in human beings have their origin in animals. Again I am very proud to say as an aside—and I hope that, in fact, the future fund might pick up on this issue—that Australia has moved and is moving to a One Health approach.


I want to commence by reflecting on the excellence of the history of medical research by Australians, because it sets the scene for this visionary move by the government, led by the Treasurer, in establishing this future fund. I commence in 1945 with Professor Baron Howard Walter Florey who, with his collaborators, won a Nobel prize for the discovery of penicillin and its curative effect in various infectious diseases. In 1960 Sir Frank Macfarlane Burnet won his Nobel prize for acquired immunological tolerance. In the world of immunology one can only think of Professor Gustav Nossal, who has demonstrated an enormous capacity for Australians in the field of research—indeed, he is internationally acclaimed and has brought great credit to his country. I go on: the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1970 was awarded to Sir Bernard Katz, again in that particular area for transmission in nerve terminals and inactivation. In 1996, I am very proud to say, a fellow veterinarian, Professor Peter Charles Doherty, received his Nobel prize, relating to the specificity of cell-mediated immune deficiencies.


We go forward to 2005 when—again I am very proud to say this as a fellow Western Australian—Professors Barry Marshall and Robin Warren received the Nobel prize for their work in determining and confirming the fact that the bacterium Heliobacter pylori is responsible for gastritis and peptic ulcers. In fact, so committed was Professor Marshall to proving this theory that he ingested a serum of the bacterium Heliobacter pylori, contracted severe acute gastritis and peptic ulcers and then treated them. Indeed, that led to the Nobel prize they won. Then we go even further to 2009 with Professor Elizabeth Blackburn and her collaborators, Professor Carol Greider and Jack Szostak, for their work with chromosomal anatomy and functionality. 


Australia has a very proud history of medical research, and the future fund builds on that proud tradition. We have always punched well above our weight, and the establishment of the future fund is going to allow further opportunity in this area.


We know that with an ageing population that is much more active into older life—indeed, younger people are far more physically active recreationally—there are increasing demands on health. I remember it being said to me four or five years ago that, the way the Queensland public health budget was going, by 2025—if no changes were made—the entire state revenue would be required just in the health sector. But the future fund, though not on its own, will significantly contribute to the containment of costs. 


What are we going to see in this particular circumstance? We are going to see Australia continue to advance world-leading medical research projects to attract and retain first-class researchers and to deliver improved health and medical outcomes—not just for all Australians but for all those within our region. Going back to the question of One Health, I think of the Hendra virus which has killed veterinarians and a couple of racehorse trainers and horses, and is very closely related to the Nipah virus, which has killed children in Malaysia, Bangladesh and India. So it will not just be to the benefit for Australians—it will be a benefit for all, especially those within our region.


The second point to be made is that we often hear about the 'brain drain' of our top young researchers leaving Australia to go and work elsewhere because they do not have the opportunities; the future fund is going to give us the opportunity to attract the best young brains to come into this country because they will want to work with it. The fund will support the sustainability of our health system well into the future. All Australians will benefit from ongoing investments in medical research and medical innovation through the fund, both directly through improved health and indirectly through improved productivity and economic growth. This brings to my mind CSL—the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, as they were once known, a company that is now international, with its world-leading researchers and commercial developers of vaccines in both the human space and the animal and animal production space. 


This gives me the opportunity to say that the future fund is going to generate a whole stack of new business opportunities, and we know that one of the new growth centres announced by the Minister for Industry and Science, Mr Macfarlane, is directly related to medical innovations and research and commercial opportunities. This is all coming together so well in this particular space. 


I again compliment the executive on the way in which they have established the concept of the fund which will allow the capital to be invested by the Future Fund Board of Guardians—and what an outstanding group they have been and continue to be. I saw some figures on the weekend on the investment success of the Future Fund against all other superannuation funds in this country. If my figures are correct, the Future Fund has been performing at an average of in excess of 8.8 per cent return on funds invested; whereas the average of all superannuation funds has been only a shade over five per cent. So what better hands in which to place the fund than those of an already proven organisation, with a set of circumstances and a model already in place so that we do not need to generate a new wave of bureaucracy to have responsibility for the capital component of the new future fund.


We know that there will be a special account which will allow for earnings to be distributed from the future fund to the health portfolio special account, to corporate Commonwealth entities or to the COAG reform process to address medical research and innovation priorities. What are we going to see in this instance? We are going to see the build-up of capital into the future fund. It will eventually get to some $20 billion, and that $20 billion of capital will be protected. Only the interest accruing from that capital will eventually flow into medical research. So why is it important for us in this place today to be debating this issue and, I hope, to unanimously give agreement to the future fund? It is because it was due to start on 1 August 2015, and it will, indeed, subject to the passage of the legislation through this place, commence soon after the legislation is passed. Therefore, I say to my colleagues on all sides that delays in the commencement of the future fund will impact the level of investment earnings of the fund and will reduce the amount of funding available for distribution to medical research and innovations into next year. So it is critically important. 


How will the earnings be determined? As I have said, the fund is a capital-preserved fund. The net earnings of the fund will be distributed annually to support ongoing health and medical research. The net earnings from the fund will serve as a secure revenue stream well into the future. I know that the Assistant Minister for Health, Senator Nash, and, of course, the Minister for Health, Ms Ley, will be reassured that we will know well into the future that we can program research that is so desperately needed and that we can actually schedule it. It has been disappointing to hear some of the flippant comments by others as to where they believe some of that research money may go. 


How will the funding be distributed? Who will make recommendations to the minister in terms of the distribution of that funding? The funding will be distributed to address Australian medical research and innovation priorities and will be determined—it is critically important that people understand this—by the independent advisory board based on the Australian Medical Research and Innovation Strategy, and funding will be taken from the fund only following a decision of government through the usual budget processes. Payments other than those made through the COAG Reform Fund or as appropriated to Commonwealth entities will be distributed as grants—not as loans but as grants—which will be, for example, through the National Health and Medical Research Council. The NHMRC will have a critical role in this advisory component as, indeed, it should from the commencement.


Contributions to the fund will come initially from some $1 billion in uncommitted funds in the Health and Hospitals Fund—and it is a good thing the finance minister has turned up, because he has got accountability to this place and to the parliament more generally in terms of that disbursement. We will see $1 billion in uncommitted funds in the existing Health and Hospitals Fund, and the estimated value of savings from the health portfolio for 2014, as announced by Minister Ley, will allow the fund to get to its capital level of some $20 billion by, it is hoped, 2019-20. This year's budget, which has been so well accepted and received by the Australian community, contained a range of health savings measures, so not all of the capital from health savings expected by 2019-20 will be required to achieve that $20 billion target, but more of it will be invested as we go forward into the future. What we need to know is: how do the crediting arrangements from this fund differ from those of nation-building funds? It is of some significance, as Senator Macdonald would know, that the crediting arrangements for the fund and the nation-building funds are similar, but there are differences in terms of the initial credits to the fund itself. The total amount of the initial credits for the nation-building funds were specified in legislation.

Senator LINES
 (Western Australia) (15:03):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Employment (Senator Abetz) to questions without notice asked by Senator Lines, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Wong) and Senator Cameron today relating to the unemployment rate and to penalty rates.


I think Senator Abetz had a slip of the tongue today when, in answer to a question from me about the government's record on jobs growth, he talked about the government's record on employment. I think what he really meant to say was the government's record on unemployment. We have in this country the highest unemployment record for decades, at 6.4 per cent, and those opposite—who live on some parallel universe—think they have some record on employment. The facts and figures are there—800,000 Australians out of work and people becoming unemployed every day of the week—yet this government tries to pretend that it has some record on employment. History will show, and the statistics show, that the only record it has is one of unemployment, the highest employment records in history—the highest for many, many years. What a shameful, disgraceful record that is for the Abbott government to have. To try to pretend that it is somehow about growth and employment is just a fabrication.


Again today, for the second day in a row, we asked the Minister for Employment to rule out or rule in what the government's intention is on penalty rates. We know this government's record when it shifts around and avoids the questions, because we have seen it before. That means it will do what it has wanted to do from day one, and that is reduce penalty rates. This fabrication where the Prime Minister is on the public record as saying that reducing penalty rates creates more jobs is an absolute myth. No economist would suggest that. I do not know how you make people poorer by taking their penalty rates off them and you create more low-paid jobs.


But I want to focus again on the seat of Canning and the town of Mandurah. The government's record in that area is an absolute disgrace. Perth, we know, has higher than average rates, but Mandurah, in the seat of Canning, consistently falls behind. The latest ABS stats show that Mandurah has an unemployment rate three per cent higher than the Perth metro area, and the youth unemployment rate is four per cent higher.


How can the government say it is committed to jobs and growth when, in an electorate it has held—and with due regard to the passing of Don Randall—the unemployment record is higher than anywhere else in Perth, and youth unemployment is higher than the national average and quite a disgrace at 14.3 per cent? What we know about Mandurah is that, unfortunately, the unemployment rate has consistently increased since the Abbott government came to office. In fact, since the coalition came to office, a 1,000 more people in Mandurah are unemployed. That is not a record of employment; it is a record of unemployment. Labor reduced unemployment rates in Mandurah when we were in power, but this government has let that slip. 


The Abbott government will not give a straight yes or no answer on penalty rates. In Mandurah, we know that 25 per cent of the population rely on penalty rates—penalty rates that the Abbott government want to cut. There are 63 per cent more people on Newstart under the Abbott government. That is not a record of employment; that is a record of unemployment in the seat of Canning. That is disgraceful and it stands well and truly on the Abbott government's record—a record where the people in Mandurah are relying on penalties that the government want to take off them and where there are a 1,000 more people out of work since the Abbott government came into power in Mandurah. That is not any kind of record to be proud of and the government need to be held to account. (Time expired)

"Fawcett, Sen David",LP,2015-08-11,"



Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (15:08):  It is quite Orwellian to rewrite history in the way that the Labor Party seek to do at the moment. They think that if they repeat it often enough or loud enough or in a shrill enough voice that somehow that will make it fact. Well, the facts speak very clearly for themselves. Let's go to this issue of employment and the unemployment rate and the figures that have come out. I will repeat what I said last night in this place, because clearly Senator Lines and members on the other side did not listen. 


Michael Janda, business reporter for the ABC—and the ABC is no great friend of the coalition—stated in his article published yesterday, 'The reason unemployment jumped, despite the much better than expected growth in employment, was that the participation rate soared.' That means that because there are more people now who have the confidence to put their hands up and say, 'You know what, I'll give it a go; I'll see if I can get a job,' the participation rate is higher. In fact, there was an increase of some 78,600 people who decided that conditions looked good enough that they thought they had a chance of getting a job, so they put their hand up and said, 'We'll give it a go.' 


All the economists were saying, 'Yes, we were expecting some jobs growth but 38,500 in the quarter to July was beyond our expectations.' That is why this government can say, looking at the number of jobs that have been created—336,000 jobs to date—that we are well and truly on track to achieving the creation of one million jobs in the first five years of this government. The important part, though, that the ALP just do not seem to get their heads around is that you need to create the right conditions for employment, for employers to have the confidence to invest and to employ people and to create jobs. 


Let's go to things like the Productivity Commission—yet another scare campaign from members opposite and another scare campaign from the unions. Look at the serious people within the ALP, like their shadow employment minister; what does he say? He says, 'Those arguments about things like penalty rates, I believe those arguments should be put and submitted to the independent umpire'—the independent umpire, what a good idea. That is the same approach that the coalition has. That is why it was established. Rather than have a scare campaign about things like penalty rates, the independent umpire is there to deal with it. Mr O'Connor, in fact, has said that all these things should be looked at. He says, 'I'm not suggesting for a moment that there aren't provisions, including penalty rates, that should not be looked at.'


Rather than running a scare campaign against the coalition, the facts say that we are increasing business confidence. The rate of jobs growth is four times under this government's watch than what it was under Labor when we came to power in 2013. The actual number of jobs is increasing. We are well on our way to a million. The important part is that we are changing the conditions: things like the carbon tax. People ask: why didn't BHP go ahead with their development at Olympic Dam, which would have created thousands of jobs in South Australia? Well, in 2012 when they decided to pull their plans, that was when the carbon tax came into effect. BHP is the largest user of electricity in South Australia. Why? The second highest cost in running a copper mine is electricity. So at the very time when they would have been hoping to start recouping their investments from the expansion of Olympic Dam, under Labor's plan the carbon cost was going to be $350 per tonne. At $23 a tonne, that contributed to South Australia's electricity being the most expensive in the country. 


Labor have not learnt from that. They are still looking at reintroducing pricing on carbon that, according to their own modelling, will push the price back to $209 per tonne. Is it any wonder that they do not understand that the way to create jobs is to set the conditions so that people have the confidence to invest? The coalition is doing that. We have abolished the carbon tax and we have introduced small business tax cuts. We are creating the opportunities for jobs and we are seeing those results. (Time expired)

 (Western Australia) (15:14):  I rise to take note of answers, particularly with respect to the issue of penalty rates and, if time permits, the rising tide of unemployment, which is bringing misery to households across the nation, especially in my state of Western Australia, and I will trash some of the patently optimistic assumptions underpinning the Treasurer's deceptive budget. 


I do not know what it is in the water at the Productivity Commission that gives rise to the hatred of shop assistants. Prior to last week's release of the draft report of their inquiry into the workplace relations framework, their most recent assault on the working conditions of shop assistants was effected through their inquiry into the low-value threshold relevant to the application of the GST to goods purchased online. The Productivity Commission largely left this issue unaddressed and focused on recommending that retailers open their doors 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, and that employees' penalty rates be slashed. Here was an ideologically-driven body that was prepared to sidestep real issues of concern to the retail industry in order to pursue its own agenda of attacking workers' conditions.


I ran for the Senate to defend workers and their families from the attacks that I felt the election of a Liberal government would rain down upon them. I believed that the public repudiation of the Work Choices regime would ensure that the government would seek to act moderately during its first term while developing the grounds to claim a mandate for radical industrial relations changes, should they achieve a second term. I did not know how the government would develop industrial relations as an issue, but when the workplace relations framework was referred to the Productivity Commission, I knew. When interviewed after the Western Australian re-run Senate election I focused on the role of the Productivity Commission and predicted its findings. I said, amongst other things, that they would attack penalty rates in the retail industry. Penalty rates are a critical component of the matrix of working conditions applicable to Australian workers and a meaningful component of the take-home pay upon which they and their families depend.


Every Australian benefits from the dedication of workers who provide services to the community seven days a week—whether those workers be police and nurses, emergency service workers, shop assistants or hospitality industry staff. These workers give up their family and leisure time to provide services for us all. The bargain has always been that, in recognition of this sacrifice and the penalties endured by these workers, work at socially unacceptable times attracts a special compensating rate—a penalty rate. 


In 2009 every award was reviewed as part of the process of modernising the award system. Every condition was examined to ensure it was consistent with current community standards. The new, modern award system which came into effect from 1 January 2010 reflected the outcome of that review—the most comprehensive award review ever undertaken. The penalty rates were determined as a result of that process. Penalties compensating workers for work at unsociable hours are the recent product of this comprehensive review by an independent umpire. 


It is these penalties that the Productivity Commission proposes to substantially undermine. But it is not for all workers—because it understands the community backlash that this would provoke—but for the industrially weak and low paid; for the shop assistants and hospitality workers; workers they apparently believe have little choice but to meekly accept a pay cut, and whom they are prepared to regard as workers second class. I do not regard shop assistants as second-class citizens. I have never regarded shop assistants as second-class citizens and I will fight, as I have always done, to ensure they receive a fair go in employment.


I will not be accused of being hypocritical. My union has negotiated reductions in penalty rates over the years, but these reductions have always been accompanied not only by wage increases reflecting at least the full value of the penalties forgone but also by rostering provisions requiring employers to have regard for employees' family commitments and personal circumstances; sporting, religious and study commitments; notice for roster changes and dispute settling procedures for rostering problems. Rosters, like pay rates, are important to our members and are relevant to work at penalty times. In short, where penalty rates have been varied, monetary and non-monetary benefits have been achieved, which more than offset any loss. 


This is not what the Productivity Commission proposes. They propose that the independently-assessed penalty rates be stolen from workers with no offset being given to them in return. It is this shabby, mean-spirited ideological approach to the working conditions of hundreds of thousands of Australian families that the government proposes to hide behind in taking its reform agenda to the Australian people in 2016. This has always been their plan, and it will be their undoing.

"Bushby, Sen David",LP,2015-08-11,"



Senator BUSHBY
 (Tasmania—Chief Government Whip in the Senate) (15:19):  What we see here again today is the opposition coming up with this fantastic tactic of opposition-attacks-government. It is all that they have got in this place. They have no policies or ideas, despite 2015 being declared by the Leader of the Opposition as 'the year of ideas'. Here we are in August, and what ideas have we seen? Nothing. Nothing but that tried-and-true tactic of Labor opposition attacking the government—'Attack, attack!' 


Australians are not fooled by taking words out of context and trying to turn them into something that they are not. Australians know that that is just another trick by Labor whereby they are trying to be too clever by half. Telling Australians that A is B so, therefore, B must be A just does not cut it. Australians are not going to be fooled. They are too clever and they are not going to let that one go through and convince them of anything that is not the truth.


The real issue in this place is good governance, not the overly clever extrapolation of a few words into something that means something quite different. But those few ideas that Labor do have, or have demonstrated, are things that Australians should be scared of. Most recently, at the Australian Labor Party's federal council, they announced their new carbon tax policy. This new formally-adopted policy is nothing other than a supercharged version of their carbon tax, and Labor's own modelling confirms this. Treasury's modelling shows that Labor's carbon tax will need to rise to $209 a tonne by 2030—that is almost 10 times the level that it stood at under Julia Gillard, who pledged that there would be no carbon tax under a government that she led. 


Further, Australia's GDP would be $633 billion lower, cumulatively, between 2015 and 2030 on the basis of Labor's supercharged carbon tax, according to Treasury analysis. Wholesale power prices would go up a whopping 78 per cent—that is a 78 per cent increase in wholesale power prices. We all know, and Australians know, that the cost of energy—the cost of their electricity bills, the cost of their gas bills—is a major cost to Australia's household budgets. The increases in electricity and energy costs are a major concern to many, many households right across Australia. 


The Leader of the Opposition's carbon tax will see tens of thousands of jobs lost if it is implemented. Power bills will skyrocket, wages will be—again, according to Treasury—six per cent lower in real terms and cumulative economic output will be well over half a trillion dollars weaker. This is coming from the opposition who, during question time today, sought to attack us over jobs. 


Senator Lines made some comments earlier when she took note of answers by ministers, and, may I say, her comments did nothing other than to underline the 'economic illiteracy'—to quote Senator Cameron—of the Labor Party. Her comments demonstrated that the Labor Party fail to have any knowledge whatsoever about how an economy works or about the use of economic statistics. She was talking about the number of people receiving unemployment benefits having gone up. What that shows is the number of people who are out there actively seeking work. As we all know, in order to receive unemployment benefits there are requirements to be actively seeking work. But at any given time there are people out there who could be working who are not actively seeking jobs. There are a range of reasons for that, one of which is that they do not think they are going to get one and so they think there is no point in going to the effort of actively seeking jobs. Just in the last month there has been a massive increase in the participation rate, which means that a lot of those people who were not looking for jobs have now decided that they have enough confidence in the economy to get out of their houses and go out and start looking for a job. That adds to the number of people who are on unemployment benefits, but it is also a reflection of increasing confidence in the economy. This is demonstrated by the fact that if you removed from the equation the increase in the participation rate of the last month and looked at the participation rate of a month ago, the unemployment rate today would be 5.9 per cent. That is an absolute, simple fact. If the participation rate were the same as last month, when there were fewer people looking for jobs, there would be fewer unemploymentbenefit  recipients, and that would mean the unemployment rate would be lower. It is a simple economic fact.

"Urquhart, Sen Anne",ALP,2015-08-11,"



Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:24):  By any objective measure, the Abbott government has completely, totally and fundamentally failed on its mantra of 'jobs, jobs, jobs'. It has failed on the economy, it has failed on jobs and it has shamefully betrayed Australian workers. Unemployment is now higher than it ever was during the global financial crisis. In fact, it is higher than it was at any time under the former Labor government. The sad truth is that this government's botched management of the economy has meant that Australia now has the highest number of unemployed people since 1994. Not only that, but those opposite have a track record of meekly sitting by and watching while Australian jobs walk out the door. 


Take the case of the 280 workers in Burnie on the north-west coast of Tasmania, who were dealt a savage blow in April when Caterpillar announced that their jobs were going overseas. This is a massive hit for a small town and it could result in the loss of up to 1,000 jobs from the region. Federally, the government hoisted the white flag on Caterpillar jobs right from the very beginning. Local member Brett Whiteley rejected out of hand opposition leader Bill Shorten's suggestion that the Prime Minister should pick up the phone and try to convince the company's US headquarters to intervene in the decision that was made by the Asia-Pacific arm of the company.


Just a few months later we saw the Abbott government sit meekly by while the crew of the Alexander Spirit lost their jobs. This Caltex oil tanker was docked in Devonport for three weeks after the crew were told there would be no more work for them upon their return to Singapore—despite the fact that they were told previously that their jobs were safe until 2019. Yet again the government was missing in action and the workers were hung out to dry. In fact, there are seven state and federal Liberal members of parliament who live on the north-west coast of Tasmania, and not one of them had the basic decency to head down to the ship and meet these workers—let alone to attempt to fight for their jobs.


Again this week we see history repeating, with almost 100 workers at Hutchison ports being cruelly told, by text, after dark, that they did not need to come in to work in the morning. Unsurprisingly, we have yet to see anything from this government to say that they are going to stand up for these workers. It is also telling that senior Liberal Senator Abetz sees absolutely no problem with sacking by text. It is shameful. Clearly the senator sees workers as an expendable resource who do not deserve the basic respect and consideration that I am sure the senator himself would expect from others. 




Senator Bushby:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I think Senator Abetz was asked a direct question about that yesterday and made his position quite clear. I believe that Senator Urquhart is misrepresenting his position on that matter.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Bushby. Misrepresentation is not in fact a point of order, so there is no point of order.




Senator URQUHART:
  It gets worse. Not only does this government raise the white flag when Aussie jobs are being sent offshore; it actually develops policy to hasten this outcome. Take the renewable industry, for example, which has suffered a massive 88 per cent drop in investment since this government set out to sabotage every policy that Australia has to respond to climate change and transition to a low-carbon economy—or the wind industry specifically, where the Prime Minister did a dirty deal with certain crossbench members to add extra layers of bureaucracy in his coal-addled determination to bring this multi-billion-dollar industry to its knees. Not only that, but he directed the Clean Energy Finance Corporation to stop investing in this cheap and clean energy source that promises many hundreds of jobs in regional Australia. Or we could look at Australia's vital strategic shipbuilding industry, which saw the Abbott government blatantly ignore its own advice that Australian submarines should be built in Australia and its own pre-election promise to build 12 submarines in South Australia. Let us not forget that. It was a pre-election promise that there would be 12 submarines built in South Australia under the Abbott government. Astoundingly, the Abbott government actually excluded Australian shipbuilding companies from the tender process for the construction of two new naval supply ships. Or how about the appalling coastal shipping legislation which plans to sell out Australian jobs by removing the preference for Australian-flagged and cruise ships operating on our coastlines?


Let's be clear: the Abbott government has absolutely and totally failed to create the conditions for growth. It is clear that this government has no plan for Australian jobs. This is a government stuck in a permanent, fatal opposition-mode loop. (Time expired)

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Social Services) (15:36):  by leave—I move:


That the Senate records its deep regret at the death, on 29 July 2015, of John Peter Sim, CBE, former senator for Western Australia, places on record its appreciation of his long and highly distinguished service to the nation and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.


John Peter Sim, always known as Peter, was born on 21 January 1917 in Colac, Victoria, into a farming family. He was educated at St Peter's Anglican parish school in Murrumbeena, the local state primary school, and then went on to attend Scotch College in Melbourne from 1927 to 1930. After leaving school, he worked on family properties and, at the outbreak of World War II, he served first in the militia and then enlisted in the AIF in 1941. He was commissioned as a lieutenant, posted first to Geelong and then to the Northern Territory until 1943. He spent much of the rest of the war on active service in New Guinea, interrupted with training in intelligence and photo interpretation in Queensland. At the close of hostilities in 1945, Peter Sim was made commander of the Rabaul compound for suspected war criminals and was made a temporary captain. In 1946 he returned to civilian life.


Attracted by opportunities to buy rural land in Western Australia, Peter and his twin brother, Hugh, moved to that state in 1946, each acquiring farms and embarking on wool growing. Their parents later joined them in the west. His family had a tradition of involvement with the United Australia Party in Victoria, so, on his arrival in Western Australia in 1946, Peter Sim joined the newly formed Liberal Party and was active in branch affairs. In 1958 he was selected for the third position on the Senate ticket but was unsuccessful. In 1960 he was elected vice-president of the Liberal and Country League and chaired the rural committee. In 1964 Senator Seddon Vincent died and the party looked for a replacement who might speak for rural and regional Western Australia. It is worth noting that Peter Sim beat Reg Withers in that preselection ballot and was appointed to the Senate at the end of 1964. He was subsequently returned at many an election—in 1966, 1967, 1974 and 1975.


Peter Sim concentrated his attention in the Senate on agriculture, foreign policy and Papua New Guinea. He was regarded as a courteous senator who was always well prepared in debate. Peter Sim was supportive of the gradualist approach to independence for Papua New Guinea and showed his own independent streak in frequently questioning accepted wisdom on a range of foreign policy areas, especially the place of Taiwan and Russian expansionism. He was a longstanding member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, later to become the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, and was chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence from 1971 to 1973 and again from 1976 until 1981. He worked very hard to secure bipartisanship in its reports. 


Although unafraid to sometimes step on the toes of the government of which he was a part, his integrity and approach to his parliamentary duties were well regarded and were recognised in the New Year's honours of 1983, when Peter Sim was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for parliamentary service. In his valedictory speech, Senator Sim drew on the old quote 'curse my enemies and bless my friends' and said that he wanted to leave the chamber 'without having to curse anyone and only to bless my friends on both sides of the chamber'. He singled out a number of senators from the other side of the chamber, some of whom he said had become his friends. He was certainly a parliamentarian of the old school. He was a senator for Western Australia from 1964 to 1981.


After leaving the Senate, Mr Sim continued to be involved in public life. He served on the Senate of Murdoch University and as a board member of the Asia Research Centre. He was President of the Western Australian branch of the Australian Institute of International Affairs, and the annual AIIA Peter Sim Prize for the best undergraduate student in international relations at the University of Western Australia is named in his honour. His long contribution to Australian-Japanese relations was recognised in 2006, when that country awarded him the Order of the Rising Sun.


In 1968 Peter Sim married Paula Clarkson, and it is to her, to their daughter, Elizabeth, to their son-in-law, Ross, and to their grandchildren, Erin and Katelyn, that we express our sincere sympathies today. Dying in his 99th year, Peter Sim served his country in war and his state in the Australian Senate, through the Liberal Party, for some 17 years, and he made a substantial contribution to public discourse and international understanding. We honour him today.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:42):  I rise to speak on this motion of condolence on the passing of John Peter Sim CBE, a senator for Western Australia from 1964 to 1981, on behalf of the opposition. At the outset, I convey our sympathy to Mr Sim's relatives and friends. 


Peter Sim came to the Senate in 1964 to fill a casual vacancy and was subsequently re-elected to complete the remainder of the term in 1966. He was re-elected in 1967, 1974 and 1975. As with many of his generation, his early adult years were dominated by World War II. He served from 1941 to 1946, remaining in Papua New Guinea following the end of hostilities, the 70th anniversary of which we mark this week. In light of this history, it is conspicuous that in 2006 he was bestowed with the second-highest award given by the Japanese Emperor, in recognition of his actions in parliament and afterwards to foster friendly and constructive relations between Australia and Japan. This included heading what was described as an 'influential inquiry' in 1972 that resulted in closer economic and cultural ties with Japan. In addition, following his departure from the Australian Senate, he helped to establish Japanese language courses and promote academic exchanges between the two countries as a member of another senate, that of Murdoch University, and later of the board of its Asia Research Centre.


Having worked on his family's rural properties in Victoria prior to the outbreak of war, following his return to Australia Mr Sim moved to Western Australia with his brother, keen to take advantage of cheap farmland in the Great Southern region. At the same time, he joined the Liberal Party and, after being unsuccessful in a bid for election from the third place on the Senate ticket in 1958, was selected over future Liberal Senate leader Reg Withers to fill the casual vacancy I referenced, in 1964. As the party was seeking a candidate who could speak for rural and regional Western Australia—The Biographical Dictionary of the Australian Senate records—Sim was preferred over Withers 'by a wide margin'.


The decision to join the Liberal Party and not the Country Party is a significant one because it provides a frame through which to understand Peter Sim's approach to issues of concern to rural constituents. Like others from both sides of politics with a farming background, such as Liberal Bert Kelly from South Australia and Labor's Peter Walsh, also from Western Australia and whom we farewelled earlier this year, Peter Sim recognised the damage that the Country Party's inward-looking policies and reliance on protection and subsidies were doing to agricultural industry in Australia. Mr Sim disliked the system of high tariff protection that was virtually unchallenged in Australia until the 1970s and supported attempts to liberalise trade. He praised the Whitlam government's efforts in this area.


Mr Sim served on a number of parliamentary committees at a time before the current system of standing committees was put into place, and his committee work was well regarded. I particularly note his work on the Select Committee on Medical and Hospital Costs. This committee recommended increases to Commonwealth payments to hospitals for beds occupied by uninsured patients, which led to Labor moving an amendment to the National Health Bill 1970. Peter Sim crossed the floor with two of his colleagues to support the successful Labor amendment.


Peter Sim's interest in foreign affairs and defence has been well documented, and he chaired the Senate standing committee from 1971 to 1973 and again from 1976 until his retirement. Building on his war experience in Papua New Guinea, Mr Sim expanded his horizons and took a particular interest in policy in Asia and the Pacific. He worked assiduously to ensure the reports presented were bipartisan and, on at least one occasion, joined with Labor members to deliver a minority report. He was not afraid to speak against the policies of his own government in the areas of foreign affairs and defence.


Delivering remarks on the valedictory in 1981, Labor's Senate leader, John Button, noted:


Senator Sim will be remembered particularly for his thoughtful and courageous contributions over some period to foreign affairs debates and the committees concerned with foreign affairs.


In a lighter moment, Senator Button also apologised for continually referring to Sim as 'Senator Slim' one night during debate.


In his own valedictory remarks, then Senator Sim was generous enough to state:


I have enjoyed the friendship of many people from all walks of life, but, above all, I mention my political opponents. I will not name them all, but I look across and see perhaps some of my closest friends sitting on the opposite side of the chamber.


Peter Sim died on 29 July 2015 at the age of 98.


Again we extend our deepest sympathies to his family, friends and former colleagues at this time, and we honour his service.

Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (15:48):  I also rise to associate The Nationals with this condolence motion for Mr John Peter Sim CBE, former senator for Western Australia. I would like to take the opportunity to first acknowledge that it has been a pretty difficult week for parliament. Yesterday we remembered Alby Schultz and Don Randall, who sat in the other place. Today we remember John Peter Sim, senator for Western Australia from 1964 to 1981. While it has been some time since Mr Sim has been in this place, it is just as important that we reflect on his service and great contribution to the state of Western Australia and the nation.


Peter was a country boy. He was raised on a farm in Victoria. He worked on his family farms, mainly farming cattle and lamb. After the outbreak of the Second World War, he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force and was first posted to Geelong before spending time in my electorate, the Northern Territory, for over two years. Mr Sim then served for two years in Papua New Guinea, and at the close of hostilities in 1945 he was responsible for the compound for suspected war criminals. Like all service men and women, his service to this country should not be forgotten, and I would like to pay my respects particularly for his service.


After the Second World War, Mr Sim relocated to Western Australia, where he went into partnership with his twin brother, Hugh, and bought farms across the state. Farming has been a cornerstone of Australia's development, and we in The Nationals recognise how challenging it can be to start up your own agricultural business. It must have been especially rewarding to go into partnership and share this work with your own twin brother.


Mr Sim was chosen by the parliament to represent the state of Western Australia in the Senate after the passing of Senator Seddon Vincent in 1964. Like many of my colleagues in The Nationals, he was selected because he was a voice for regional and rural areas of his state. Then, as a Liberal, Mr Sim was re-elected by the people of Western Australia in 1967 and represented his state for nearly 17 years. Mr Sim made a great contribution throughout this long service, particularly on issues of foreign affairs and defence policy, as well as matters affecting the agricultural sector, given his strong experience in this area. He was well known for being keen to get firsthand experience to inform his views on foreign policy and made multiple visits to Indonesia, Japan and Taiwan. His expertise in this area was recognised, as he was a member of the Senate standing committee on foreign affairs and defence for 10 years, as well as being chairman of the committee.


Mr Sim was not afraid to speak his mind. He made independent decisions, even if it meant crossing the floor, including when he did not agree with the policies of his own party. He made close friends, not only his party members but also those who sat opposite in the chamber. In Mr Sim's valedictory speech he said:


… Curse my enemies and bless my friends. I hope I leave this place without having to curse anyone and only to bless my friends on both sides of the chamber.


In 1982, Mr Sim was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire, and in 2006, significantly, Japan recognised his long contribution to Australia-Japan relations and assistance particularly to Japanese officers accused of war crimes in obtaining justice by awarding him the highest civilian honour, the Order of the Rising Sun, Gold and Silver Star.


Mr Sim's contribution had a great influence on this place and on the lives of people across Australia. On behalf of The Nationals, I offer our condolences to Mr Sim's family and friends. They should be very proud of his achievements.

  I am greatly concerned that the government has chosen to deny me a chance to put this important motion to expedite the ratification of OPCAT, the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture. This OPCAT was voluntarily signed up to by an Australian government in 2009, and since then both Labor and coalition governments have inexplicably dragged their feet in its ratification. OPCAT would ensure independent monitoring and reporting on places of detention in Australia, all those places where some of the most overlooked marginalised and powerless people are kept detained: prisoners in jails and police lockups, patients in psychiatric facilities, young people in juvenile detention, and asylum seekers. With very recent examples of deaths in custody and cruel and inhumane treatment of people detained, it is very disappointing that I have been prevented from putting this motion today. It is crucial to fully ratify the protocol and set clear time frames to implement. Australia's own good standing is at stake.

Senator LAZARUS:
  The people of Australia desperately need to see the government and community leaders get behind Australian jobs for Australian workers. While I appreciate that the Hutchison Port issue is complex and currently unfolding, it is the role of the government and the parliament to show leadership and to restore competence in our own abilities and capabilities as a nation. We need to stop pandering to everyone else and start putting the interests of Australians first. The Hutchison Port sackings are atrocious, but sackings like this are happening all over Australia. This is not the business practice we should tolerate nor is it behaviour we should accept. This motion is about sending a strong message to the community that we care about Australian jobs for Australian workers.

  While the government agrees with the broad sentiment expressed in the motion moved by Senator Lazarus, this matter is currently before the Fair Work Commission with both the employer and the union referring this matter to the independent umpire. The commission is in the middle of dealing with the issue. This motion invites the Senate to express a concluded view on matters which are live before the independent Fair Work Commission. The commission is the appropriate independent body to deal with this dispute and it will make whatever decisions it will. This government is concerned to ensure that we continue to build the economy to provide jobs growth and make existing jobs sustainable.

Senator FIFIELD:
  The Prime Minister announced on 4 August that the government would commit to an historic continuous build of surface naval vessels in Australia. As part of this, the future frigates and our new offshore patrol vessels will be built in Australia. Both these programs have been brought forward, which will preserve up to 1,000 jobs that would otherwise have been lost as a result of the former government's inaction on shipbuilding.


I would like to clarify to Senator Lazarus that the announcement last week stipulated that the future frigates would be built in South Australia. It also said that the offshore patrol vessels will be built in Australia with a specific location to be determined following a competitive evaluation process. The construction of the Pacific patrol boats is a separate program to both of these and was not part of the announcement made last week. The tender for the Pacific patrol boats has closed and the responses are currently being assessed by the Department of Defence, with a government decision due following the completion of that process.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (16:17):  I, and also on behalf of Senator Wright and Senator Lazarus, move:




That the Family Law (Fees) Amendment (2015 Measures No. 1) Regulation 2015, as contained in Select Legislative Instrument 2015 No. 114 and made under the 
Family Law Act 1975
 and the 
Federal Circuit Court of Australia Act 1999
, be disallowed.



I move this motion because substantially the same regulation was made by the Attorney-General and disallowed by this Senate on 25 June this year. The Senate disallowed the Attorney's previous unfair fee hike, and he should be ashamed of his contempt of this chamber with his action. The Attorney-General has had the opportunity to use the winter recess to think about a fairer outcome and he has not used this time wisely. Instead, he has lazily registered substantially the same unfair package and he should be admonished for his laziness.


The fee hikes are nothing more than attacks on families in the midst of one of the most difficult decisions any family can make. For many, there is no alternative to paying a court fee if you come to the difficult point in your life where a divorce is necessary. This extra fee is simply a revenue-raising exercise on families at their most vulnerable stage. Last year, 30,579 people paid the full divorce tax. The revenue the government expected to raise in the first year just from the increase in divorce applications was $10.8 million and much of the revenue raised from these increased fees will go to consolidated revenue, not to resourcing the courts, as has been suggested.


The Attorney-General seems to think that there is somewhat of a crisis about access to justice in this country and there are certainly problems, but that crisis is thanks to the cruel cuts by Senator Cormann and the Attorney-General to legal aid and to community legal centres and the consequences of a belated backflip. The increases to family law fees which the Attorney introduced a second time will only compound that problem. People who are going through the painful process of divorce are the last people the Attorney-General and the Senator Cormann should be targeting for revenue. 


The Family Court services the most complex of family law applications including those involving child abuse and family violence—not places in which to play. Senator Brandis would be collecting $70.3 million via the increased court fees and only about 20 per cent of those fees would contribute to better funding the courts. The fee increases would include a 40 per cent increase to apply for a divorce. The cost of filing a subpoena would increase by 125 per cent and $125 would be the fee to amend an application where there is currently no charge. 


In the Labor Party, we take the will of the Senate seriously and that has clearly been indicated. We also expect that any Attorney-General, as the highest law officer in the land, would set an example to the legal fraternity of appropriate standards for a legal practitioner. The Attorney should be a beacon of propriety. But what do we have instead? We have an Attorney-General who has made a regulation that is substantively the same as a regulation that was disallowed in just the autumn sittings. The Attorney-General has shown outrageous disregard to all senators in this place, including government senators, because this is a matter of standards.  I wonder how he even got this through the standard machinery of government.


His regulations are made, almost certainly, inconsistent with the Legislative Instruments Act 2013. What kind of Attorney-General ignores the will of the Senate and, in the process, breaks the law the Governor-General has asked him to administer? This is why Labor launched proceedings in the Federal Court to declare that this regulation is to have no effect. These proceedings were brought by my colleague the Manager of Opposition Business, Senator Moore, and the parliamentary secretary to the shadow Attorney-General, Graham Perrett MP. The case involves the consideration of a simple set of facts. A regulation proposing to raise family law fees was disallowed in the Senate 25 June. A mere 14 days later, the Attorney made substantially the same regulation, raising family law fees but with an additional increase of $5. Outrageous! And the Legislative Instruments Act 2013 prohibits the re-introduction of a regulation similar in substance within six months of a regulation being disallowed.


If these proceedings are successful, it will mean that the second regulation, even prior to its possible disallowance today, never did have any effect. The judge has reserved his decision in those proceedings but has assured the parties that a judgement will be delivered this week. In the meantime, each and every day people suffering family breakdown are paying fee increases that the Senate has already rejected. I think it is incumbent on us to uphold the dignity of the Senate and, at this our very first opportunity, to demonstrate our will clearly again.


The Family Law (Fees) Amendment (2015 Measures No. 1) Regulation 2015 was made on 9 July, registered on 12 July and commenced on 13 July—a very smooth passage through the machinery of government, this supposed group of adults who, Tony Abbott assures us, is governing well. I see questions in that which the government need to address. The second regulation is in identical terms to the first disallowed regulation except for adding $5 to most of the fees. The explanatory statement that accompanies the second regulation says:


Family law fee increases that were intended to commence on 1 July 2015 under Schedule 2 of the Federal Courts Legislation Amendment (Fees) Regulation 2015 were disallowed by the Senate on 25 June 2015. The Government will reintroduce those family law fee increases under the Regulation with an additional $5 increase.


Outrageous! I look forward to seeing the court's interpretation of that action. As well as thumbing his nose at the will of parliament, the Attorney has included a veiled threat to the judiciary in the explanatory statement. He says:


Given the structural deficits currently facing the family courts, the only alternatives would be to cut frontline court services, close registries and not replace judges, which would severely undermine access to justice.


This is a veiled threat to the judiciary. But, as I said, the Attorney-General's ultimatum does not take into account the fact that only a small portion of the revenue he intends to raise will go to the courts. The second regulation was made and the increased fees were implemented after parliament recessed for the winter break. There has been no opportunity for this parliament to disallow this regulation before the fees were implemented—again, contemptuous of this parliament. From 13 July and each day the court registry has been open since, the Attorney-General has been collecting, on average, about $67,000 in revenue through these increased fees—$67,000 each day, in contempt of this Senate.


This divorce tax is bad for the community. We have disallowed it once. We should not have to do so twice, but it has been re-made by an arrogant Attorney-General, who is not fit for purpose. He is already known for interfering in police investigations. He is the same man described by the national president of the Australian Lawyers Alliance as someone who 'lacks judgement'. We have seen that. He has spent more than $20,000 on bookshelves for his poetry. Let us not talk about helicopters; let us look at bookshelves—$20,000! And, yes, he has tried to ban books from schools that do not agree with his philosophy.


 He has politicised his own department, dispatching his departmental secretary to offer an inducement to the Human Rights Commissioner, we will all recall. And the Attorney was rightfully censured by this Senate over that sorry affair. He is no beacon of propriety and Australia deserves better from its first law officer. In fact, I might describe him as the member of the Liberal Party whose sense of entitlement is only second to the former Speaker in the other chamber. Such is his sense of entitlement that when he inherited a fully functioning arts funding model from the previous Labor government, he turned that model on its head. As he outlined in the Weekend Australian, the Attorney-General and arts minister felt that he had nothing to do. How entitled can you be? 'His Excellence'—as that article was entitled—has stripped funding from the Australia Council to establish his own grand private arts fiefdom and to fund his own pet projects—outrageous again! He has no respect for good process, no respect for independent thinking and has evidenced this by the implementation of this unfair divorce tax with no respect for the Senate. 


Earlier this year, the Prime Minister promised us 'good government starts today'. If the Attorney-General's disregard for the Senate and his unfair divorce tax are an example of Mr Abbott's 'good government' it is little wonder the Abbott government is so toxic within the community.

Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (16:30):  I rise to speak on this disallowance motion of the government's court fees, which I have co-sponsored with Senator Collins and the Labor Party today. As everyone in this place would be aware, on 24 June this year I moved a successful disallowance motion, as the legal affairs spokesperson, on behalf of the Australian Greens that should have put an end to this government's blatant attempt to raise revenue at the expense of Family Court users, including women and families at risk of violence. It should have knocked out once and for all this government's greedy and cruel divorce tax—their way of slugging people going through family breakdown a further $350 to obtain a divorce. But, sadly, in an almost unbelievable act of—and I will not use swear words, but people might know what I mean—legal trickery and cynical politics, this government and the Attorney-General tabled almost exactly the same regulation that was voted down by the Senate, which would increase the same range of Family Court fees to the same extent but with the addition of a further $5 in some cases. So, at best, this is a flagrant disregard of the decision of this Senate and, at worst, it is an illegitimate attempt to reintroduce a regulation that is the same in substance as that which was disallowed on 24 June 2015.


The Labor Party is currently testing the legality of the government's actions in the Federal Court. I predict that the court will find that the regulation that was reintroduced by the government will be substantially similar to the regulation that was previously disallowed and I predict that it will be struck down by the court. In the meantime, however, this move by the government has created confusion, chaos, and countless families in breakdown have been paying hundreds of dollars more at registries across Australia to access legal services that they and their children desperately need. What a way to do business! What a way for the Attorney-General, the principal legal officer in this country, to act!


Family court registries are suffering under the serious and confusing uncertainty this government's legal trickery has brought about. In fact, the day that the regulation was introduced, there was chaos in the registries as people turned up expecting to be paying one thing because of being aware of the decision by the Senate to disallow the previous regulation and were then informed by hapless court staff that the cost had indeed gone up again. So the fees went up, went back down again, went back up and now, if this disallowance is passed, they will go down again. How is this fair? How is this clear? How is this an appropriate way to run the country? What does this achieve? How long will this go on? Surely now is the time to act decisively on this issue. It is time to offer clarity to families using the Family Court who are already often in a state of distress because of the circumstances that are bringing them to the necessity to rely on the court. How will it bring clarity to families? It is important that they understand that the fees will not go up by 40 per cent and bounce around again while the government works out another way to sidestep the law and the clear will of the Senate.


But perhaps I should remind everyone in this place why the issue at the base of this, the cost of access to justice, is so important. We know that the cost of legal proceedings, the cost of access to the law, is the most common barrier for people in Australia now seeking legal help. Court fees are already too high. When it comes to accessing justice, which is a fundamental aspect of having a country where the rule of law is respected and that people can get equal access irrespective of the size of their wallet and only based on the merit of their claim—the people being failed by this government's policies and funding decisions are not just those who are suspected of or charged with some kind of wrongdoing or an offence. These people who are now having trouble accessing basic justice include the most vulnerable and innocent among us, such as children who are experiencing poverty and family violence or women experiencing domestic or sexual violence, for instance, in remote communities. They also include the most ordinary people among us—families who want to clarify guardianship arrangements for their elderly parents, divorcing couples wanting to finalise property settlements or arrangements for the care of their children, or neighbourhoods who are seeking to protect their local environment from harm or degradation.


Over and over again under this government we have seen cruel and counterproductive funding cuts that slice away at the fabric of access to justice in Australia, totalling well over $40 million since the election of this government. We have seen community legal centres and legal assistance services forced to turn away more and more people who are in need. Courts and tribunals have felt the squeeze of so-called efficiency strategies. It beggars my understand what is efficient about forcing people into a situation where they have to be self-represented or are not able to access justice at all with the flow-on costs that come from unmet legal need. There is nothing efficient about that at all. We are seeing mandatory sentencing policies and other legislative changes designed to remove lawyers and limit judicial discretion. This is the form that this particular government has. This is the form that this Attorney-General has. The result is, at best, a cruel and confusing system that fails to take into account individual experiences and leaves people in Australia without the help they need to understand what the law is and how the system works and, at worst, we are left with a system that leads to unfair outcomes, particularly for those who are not privileged enough to obtain private legal advice—leaving young people institutionalised, families torn apart and children at risk.


Let us cast our minds back.    In 2013, the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee, which I chaired at the time, commenced an inquiry, initiated by the Australian Greens, into the impact under the previous Labor government of higher Federal Court fees on access to justice. There was a great deal of interest in the inquiry from the legal community and a large number of submissions were received. The overwhelming consensus for participants in the inquiry was that the fee increases, at that time, were largely unreasonable and inhibited access to justice. 


Indeed, it is very interesting to note that the then shadow Attorney-General, Senator George Brandis, went out and decried the Labor government court fee increases and, in fact, was talking about the then Labor government's disguised divorce tax. So he was very, very loud and vociferous at the time about using the courts as a revenue-raising measure. However, interestingly enough too, as a result of the inquiry, the submissions and the evidence before the committee, the Australian Greens made a primary recommendation in our report from that inquiry that the 2013 fee increases should be wound back to the level which prevailed prior to 1 January 2013. Despite the shadow Attorney-General George Brandis's grandstanding at the time, in fact, the opposition at the time would not sign up to those recommendations. Do not look at what they do, look at what they say—that is what they would have us believe; in fact, look at what they do. 


Despite widespread acknowledgement that rising court fees were hindering access to justice, not one of the recommendations from the 2013 Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee inquiry into court fees have been implemented. This includes a recommendation that relevant stakeholders from the courts and the legal profession should be consulted before any future changes to Federal Court fees. 


In the 2013 inquiry, we also discovered that some Federal Court filing fees have tripled over recent years. This is nothing but a revenue-raising measure and an unfair tax on people who are unlucky enough to have to use the court system. Yet, here we are with this government now proposing further increases to court fees—up to 40 per cent in some cases.


The Australian Greens were particularly concerned about the $350 increase to divorce applications and the potential impact of that on women trying to leave domestic violence and family violence situations. People will understand there is a lot of discussion about family violence and there is a lot of rhetoric from the current government about the need to act. When we look at the actual practical implications of an increase like this, which will impede some women who need the closure of a divorce to end a violent relationship, when it will impede their ability to get that, you have to again say, 'Listen not to what they say, look at what they do.'


With the government fee increases, we have seen the cost of divorce applications rise from $845 to $1,195 in the first tranche of regulations and, of course, that will be even slightly higher under this second regulation that the government has now tabled. This will cause excessive and unfair delays to victims of domestic violence who will be seeking a divorce. In fact, the 2013 Senate inquiry into court fee increases found that higher court costs were indeed dissuading women who were trying to leave abusive marriages. There is evidence in that committee report for anyone who is interested in looking at it.


At a time when family violence is clearly on the national agenda, and rightly so, we must be making every effort, as a community and as a parliament, to protect victims of domestic violence and ensure that they have access to legal advice and to the courts. We have to put an end to the scourge of family violence in this country. Increasing divorce applications by $350 or more will make it even more difficult for women in abusive marriages to leave.


The changes to these Family Court fees, particularly the divorce application fee, are cynical when you realise there is no option for divorcing parties to avoid the courts. It is not as if they can be encouraged to somehow settle their legal differences or their legal claim in any other way. The only way to get a divorce in Australia is to go to the Family Court, make an application and pay for it. So even when they reach an agreement, even when there are consent orders, there is a fee imposed, and there is an increased fee now under these government regulations.


The Australian Greens say that it is completely inappropriate for the government to use family breakdown as a cash cow. While the government has tried to justify these huge fee hikes by suggesting that the money will go to improving court facilities, looking at the truth of the situation only a minor proportion of the $87 million that was predicted to be raised will actually be re-invested in the courts. Only $30 million will be spent on improvements to holding cells and to the safety of child dispute conference areas. 


Many legal stakeholders have opposed the fee increases on the grounds that they will significantly impact on low- to middle-income Australians and small- to medium-sized businesses that do not qualify for legal aid or any fee exemption or waiver. They also say these increases are unreasonably large and not justified by any rational policy objective, because really it is just about raising revenue. They are not supported by evidence that changes to fees will advance the government's policy objectives. Legal stakeholders say that these fees will impose an unreasonable barrier to accessing justice by making access to the Federal Court contingent upon the capacity of litigants of various means to meet the substantial additional cost of litigating. The impact on litigants will be inequitable and they will establish a regime which disproportionately impacts on those who have more limited financial means. So we will move, increasingly, to an Australia where justice is as good as you can buy, as good as you can afford, irrespective of the merits of your case.


On that basis, I want to conclude by saying that I urge everyone in this place to support this disallowance and to remain resolute in their commitment not to let this arrogant and unprincipled government take us and the users of the Family Court for granted.

"Lazarus, Sen Glenn",Ind.,2015-08-11,"



Senator LAZARUS
 (Queensland) (16:43):  I rise to contribute to the discussion on this disallowance motion. I am supporting the disallowance of the Family Law (Fees) Amendment (2015 Measures No. 1) Regulation 2015 for a number of reasons. Firstly, the Abbott government has no mandate to increase the cost of Family Court fees. Unless I am mistaken, the Abbott government made no mention of these proposed increases in their 2013 suite of federal election campaign policies. If they were there, while Bronnie was flying around in her taxpayer funded helicopter, perhaps a set of campaign policy manuals relating to Family Court fees was misplaced during flight. Or perhaps the Family Law Court fee increase policy was also included in the GP co-payment and higher education deregulation folder, and the whole lot went missing during the flight. Regardless, the Family Law Court fee increases were never presented to the people of Australia for consideration as part of the election and so, therefore, the Abbott government has no mandate to increase these fees.


Secondly, the Abbott government has no parliamentary support to increase the Family Law Court fees. In fact, the Abbott government is effectively going against the wishes of the Australian parliament and the people of Australia by increasing the court fees through regulation—again. As we know, the government has already tried to increase Family Law Court fees and had this regulation disallowed by the Senate. Now, despite this, the Abbott government has ignored the will of the Senate by introducing new regulations which are effectively a complete copy of the original regulations. Perhaps the government is going for a trifecta; who knows? But again it is up to the crossbench, the Labor Party and the Greens to keep the government to account. Through our disallowance motion today we will be able to ensure the government does not implement another nasty budget measure which will only hurt disadvantaged and vulnerable Australians.


Thirdly, and finally, the Abbott government has no right nor need to increase Family Law Court fees. If anything, our court system needs support—not fee increase hikes. The court system should be a place where the people can resolve issues in a fair, accessible and transparent manner. Increasing Family Law Court fees will only hinder access to fair and reasonable issue resolution outcomes for Australians.


It is for all of these reasons that I am co-sponsoring this motion. I call on all of my Senate colleagues to assist me in rolling back these Family Law Court fee increases.

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales—Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Services) (16:46):  I rise to oppose the disallowance motion relating to the Family Law (Fees) Amendment (2015 Measures No. 1) Regulation 2015. In June the Senate voted to disallow family law fee changes which were intended to commence on 1 July. In doing so, those senators who supported the disallowance acted with gross irresponsibility, and if they do so again today they will be compounding their irresponsibility. The Family Court and the Federal Circuit Court are projecting substantial losses over the forward estimates. The package of measures is necessary to ensure the courts are sustainable by the fourth year of the forward estimates.


The government's budget measure was part of a package to ensure that the courts are in a strong financial position to carry out their fundamental role as the judicial arm of the Commonwealth while ensuring the efficient and effective delivery of their services. The government has considered in their totality all the issues related to court funding. The budget includes measures critical to ensuring that the courts are placed on a sustainable funding footing and meet the streamlining savings election commitment, Senator Lazarus. This includes injecting into the courts an additional $22.5 million over four years to enhance their capacity to provide services in areas such as family law, with $16.6 million to be injected into the Family Court and Federal Circuit Court and $5.9 million into the Federal Court. Injection into each court will remain as per the budget papers for 2015-16, but in the following years it will be adjusted as necessary when the courts become a single administrative body from 1 July 2016. 


It also includes $30 million in funding for critical maintenance works for court buildings. This is very important. It also includes merging the back office functions of the Federal Court, the Family Court and the Federal Circuit Court to ensure the efficient and effective delivery of shared services. Implementation will commence early in 2015-16 to facilitate formal commencement of the merged entity on 1 July 2016, and it will also include changes to court fees to commence in July 2014.


It is the last of these that Labor, the Greens and the crossbench are seeking to disallow. Of course, without the fee changes there will be almost nothing left for injection back into the courts. This action threatens to undermine the revenue base that is critical to putting the federal courts on a sustainable funding footing. The hypocrisy on the Labor side is amazing. When last in government, those opposite used substantial court fee increases to generate funds for the civil justice system, but with a much lower proportion—



Honourable senators interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order, senators.




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  But with a much lower portion of the additional revenue being returned to the courts. Can I repeat that, Senator Collins, just in case you did not quite hear it the first time. That is: when you were last in government, you used substantial court fee increases—



Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Collins, the senator has the right to be heard in silence.




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  I did sit there and listen to you in silence, Senator Collins, much against my better judgement. But perhaps I can repeat what I said for you. It is pretty simple: when you were in government you used substantial court fee increases to generate funds for the civil justice system, but with a much lower portion of the additional revenue being returned to the courts. In the 2012-13 budget you increased Federal Court fees from 1 January 2013 to raise a total of $102.4 million over four years, but only $30 million of that additional funding was provided to the federal courts. In the 2012-13 budget you changed court fees from 1 January 2013 to provide additional funding of $30 million over four years to the federal courts. The changes raised a total of $102.4 million over the forward estimates, of which approximately $4.2 million was also allocated to the federal courts for implementation and administration of the fees. Overall, fees in the Federal Court were raised by approximately 29 per cent, on average. As a result, public authorities such as the Australian Taxation Office and publicly-listed companies shifted matters from the Federal Court to the state courts. Consequently, in the 2013 calendar year the Federal Court collected $24.6 million in revenue but in the 2014 calendar year it collected $12.8 million in revenue. Its revenue decreased by 48 per cent. 


This is the legacy that those opposite left us. They raised fees, including almost trebling the concessional fees, and they did nothing towards returning the courts to sustainability. In a typical Labor-Greens comedy of errors, the previous government hiked the fees of the Federal Court so much that its business was halved and its fee revenue smashed. The additional fee revenue from the government's family law fee changes is a critical element of the package of court reform measures announced by the government in the 2015-16 budget, including the additional $22.5 million to be injected into the federal courts to enhance their capacity to provide services in key areas such as family law.


Other measures, including merging the court's back office functions, while important, generate insufficient savings to address the court's deficits and to meet the election commitment to streamline savings without accompanying fee increases. Given the structural deficits currently facing the family courts, the only alternatives would be to cut front-line court services, close registries and not replace judges—which would severely undermine access to justice for the Australian community. Dishonestly, the Labor Party and the Greens have characterised these fee increases as impacting on the vulnerable—who, they say, will not be able to afford the new fees. However, fee exemptions, deferrals and waivers will still apply to vulnerable litigants as before. This includes litigants who have been granted legal aid, who are holders of concessional cards, who would be subject to financial hardship by paying a fee, or who have an urgent need to file a document. Can I stress that: the government has left untouched the concessional fee arrangements. I repeat—especially for Senator Lazarus, Senator Wright and Senator Collins: the government has left untouched the concessional fee arrangements. I say that for a third time, in case you did not get it: this means that those facing financial hardship or other difficult circumstances should not be affected by these changes, and those opposite should not be peddling misrepresentations in relation to this—



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  You should not be peddling misrepresentations. It is appropriate to seek from court users a greater contribution towards the cost of running the courts, consistent with recommendations of the 2014 Productivity Commission report into access to justice arrangements. However, and I repeat: reduced fees for divorce applications will remain unchanged for vulnerable applicants in both the Family Court and the federal circuit court. Further, registrars have substantial discretion in granting reduced fees and deferred payment arrangements, even where litigants do not qualify for the concessional fees. It is only the actions of this Senate, in voting to disallow the fee regulations, that put these arrangements at risk.



Senator Lazarus interjecting—




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  Senator Lazarus, what part of that very simple comment did you not understand? Not only have we left untouched the concessional fee arrangements; registrars also have substantial discretion in granting reduced fees and deferred payment arrangements, even where you have litigants who do not qualify for the concessional fees. Not only that but, if the additional funding is not available, the government will have no choice but to consider the other, much less palatable methods of addressing the structural deficit. The Senate, in voting for disallowance, is in effect asking the government to consider registry closures and service reductions. This is a matter for those opposite but no-one will be left under any illusion about whose responsibility it will be. 



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that the disallowance motion moved by Senator Collins be agreed to.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2015-08-11,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (16:17):  I, and also on behalf of Senator Wright and Senator Lazarus, move:




That the Family Law (Fees) Amendment (2015 Measures No. 1) Regulation 2015, as contained in Select Legislative Instrument 2015 No. 114 and made under the 
Family Law Act 1975
 and the 
Federal Circuit Court of Australia Act 1999
, be disallowed.



I move this motion because substantially the same regulation was made by the Attorney-General and disallowed by this Senate on 25 June this year. The Senate disallowed the Attorney's previous unfair fee hike, and he should be ashamed of his contempt of this chamber with his action. The Attorney-General has had the opportunity to use the winter recess to think about a fairer outcome and he has not used this time wisely. Instead, he has lazily registered substantially the same unfair package and he should be admonished for his laziness.


The fee hikes are nothing more than attacks on families in the midst of one of the most difficult decisions any family can make. For many, there is no alternative to paying a court fee if you come to the difficult point in your life where a divorce is necessary. This extra fee is simply a revenue-raising exercise on families at their most vulnerable stage. Last year, 30,579 people paid the full divorce tax. The revenue the government expected to raise in the first year just from the increase in divorce applications was $10.8 million and much of the revenue raised from these increased fees will go to consolidated revenue, not to resourcing the courts, as has been suggested.


The Attorney-General seems to think that there is somewhat of a crisis about access to justice in this country and there are certainly problems, but that crisis is thanks to the cruel cuts by Senator Cormann and the Attorney-General to legal aid and to community legal centres and the consequences of a belated backflip. The increases to family law fees which the Attorney introduced a second time will only compound that problem. People who are going through the painful process of divorce are the last people the Attorney-General and the Senator Cormann should be targeting for revenue. 


The Family Court services the most complex of family law applications including those involving child abuse and family violence—not places in which to play. Senator Brandis would be collecting $70.3 million via the increased court fees and only about 20 per cent of those fees would contribute to better funding the courts. The fee increases would include a 40 per cent increase to apply for a divorce. The cost of filing a subpoena would increase by 125 per cent and $125 would be the fee to amend an application where there is currently no charge. 


In the Labor Party, we take the will of the Senate seriously and that has clearly been indicated. We also expect that any Attorney-General, as the highest law officer in the land, would set an example to the legal fraternity of appropriate standards for a legal practitioner. The Attorney should be a beacon of propriety. But what do we have instead? We have an Attorney-General who has made a regulation that is substantively the same as a regulation that was disallowed in just the autumn sittings. The Attorney-General has shown outrageous disregard to all senators in this place, including government senators, because this is a matter of standards.  I wonder how he even got this through the standard machinery of government.


His regulations are made, almost certainly, inconsistent with the Legislative Instruments Act 2013. What kind of Attorney-General ignores the will of the Senate and, in the process, breaks the law the Governor-General has asked him to administer? This is why Labor launched proceedings in the Federal Court to declare that this regulation is to have no effect. These proceedings were brought by my colleague the Manager of Opposition Business, Senator Moore, and the parliamentary secretary to the shadow Attorney-General, Graham Perrett MP. The case involves the consideration of a simple set of facts. A regulation proposing to raise family law fees was disallowed in the Senate 25 June. A mere 14 days later, the Attorney made substantially the same regulation, raising family law fees but with an additional increase of $5. Outrageous! And the Legislative Instruments Act 2013 prohibits the re-introduction of a regulation similar in substance within six months of a regulation being disallowed.


If these proceedings are successful, it will mean that the second regulation, even prior to its possible disallowance today, never did have any effect. The judge has reserved his decision in those proceedings but has assured the parties that a judgement will be delivered this week. In the meantime, each and every day people suffering family breakdown are paying fee increases that the Senate has already rejected. I think it is incumbent on us to uphold the dignity of the Senate and, at this our very first opportunity, to demonstrate our will clearly again.


The Family Law (Fees) Amendment (2015 Measures No. 1) Regulation 2015 was made on 9 July, registered on 12 July and commenced on 13 July—a very smooth passage through the machinery of government, this supposed group of adults who, Tony Abbott assures us, is governing well. I see questions in that which the government need to address. The second regulation is in identical terms to the first disallowed regulation except for adding $5 to most of the fees. The explanatory statement that accompanies the second regulation says:


Family law fee increases that were intended to commence on 1 July 2015 under Schedule 2 of the Federal Courts Legislation Amendment (Fees) Regulation 2015 were disallowed by the Senate on 25 June 2015. The Government will reintroduce those family law fee increases under the Regulation with an additional $5 increase.


Outrageous! I look forward to seeing the court's interpretation of that action. As well as thumbing his nose at the will of parliament, the Attorney has included a veiled threat to the judiciary in the explanatory statement. He says:


Given the structural deficits currently facing the family courts, the only alternatives would be to cut frontline court services, close registries and not replace judges, which would severely undermine access to justice.


This is a veiled threat to the judiciary. But, as I said, the Attorney-General's ultimatum does not take into account the fact that only a small portion of the revenue he intends to raise will go to the courts. The second regulation was made and the increased fees were implemented after parliament recessed for the winter break. There has been no opportunity for this parliament to disallow this regulation before the fees were implemented—again, contemptuous of this parliament. From 13 July and each day the court registry has been open since, the Attorney-General has been collecting, on average, about $67,000 in revenue through these increased fees—$67,000 each day, in contempt of this Senate.


This divorce tax is bad for the community. We have disallowed it once. We should not have to do so twice, but it has been re-made by an arrogant Attorney-General, who is not fit for purpose. He is already known for interfering in police investigations. He is the same man described by the national president of the Australian Lawyers Alliance as someone who 'lacks judgement'. We have seen that. He has spent more than $20,000 on bookshelves for his poetry. Let us not talk about helicopters; let us look at bookshelves—$20,000! And, yes, he has tried to ban books from schools that do not agree with his philosophy.


 He has politicised his own department, dispatching his departmental secretary to offer an inducement to the Human Rights Commissioner, we will all recall. And the Attorney was rightfully censured by this Senate over that sorry affair. He is no beacon of propriety and Australia deserves better from its first law officer. In fact, I might describe him as the member of the Liberal Party whose sense of entitlement is only second to the former Speaker in the other chamber. Such is his sense of entitlement that when he inherited a fully functioning arts funding model from the previous Labor government, he turned that model on its head. As he outlined in the Weekend Australian, the Attorney-General and arts minister felt that he had nothing to do. How entitled can you be? 'His Excellence'—as that article was entitled—has stripped funding from the Australia Council to establish his own grand private arts fiefdom and to fund his own pet projects—outrageous again! He has no respect for good process, no respect for independent thinking and has evidenced this by the implementation of this unfair divorce tax with no respect for the Senate. 


Earlier this year, the Prime Minister promised us 'good government starts today'. If the Attorney-General's disregard for the Senate and his unfair divorce tax are an example of Mr Abbott's 'good government' it is little wonder the Abbott government is so toxic within the community.

"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2015-08-11,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (16:30):  I rise to speak on this disallowance motion of the government's court fees, which I have co-sponsored with Senator Collins and the Labor Party today. As everyone in this place would be aware, on 24 June this year I moved a successful disallowance motion, as the legal affairs spokesperson, on behalf of the Australian Greens that should have put an end to this government's blatant attempt to raise revenue at the expense of Family Court users, including women and families at risk of violence. It should have knocked out once and for all this government's greedy and cruel divorce tax—their way of slugging people going through family breakdown a further $350 to obtain a divorce. But, sadly, in an almost unbelievable act of—and I will not use swear words, but people might know what I mean—legal trickery and cynical politics, this government and the Attorney-General tabled almost exactly the same regulation that was voted down by the Senate, which would increase the same range of Family Court fees to the same extent but with the addition of a further $5 in some cases. So, at best, this is a flagrant disregard of the decision of this Senate and, at worst, it is an illegitimate attempt to reintroduce a regulation that is the same in substance as that which was disallowed on 24 June 2015.


The Labor Party is currently testing the legality of the government's actions in the Federal Court. I predict that the court will find that the regulation that was reintroduced by the government will be substantially similar to the regulation that was previously disallowed and I predict that it will be struck down by the court. In the meantime, however, this move by the government has created confusion, chaos, and countless families in breakdown have been paying hundreds of dollars more at registries across Australia to access legal services that they and their children desperately need. What a way to do business! What a way for the Attorney-General, the principal legal officer in this country, to act!


Family court registries are suffering under the serious and confusing uncertainty this government's legal trickery has brought about. In fact, the day that the regulation was introduced, there was chaos in the registries as people turned up expecting to be paying one thing because of being aware of the decision by the Senate to disallow the previous regulation and were then informed by hapless court staff that the cost had indeed gone up again. So the fees went up, went back down again, went back up and now, if this disallowance is passed, they will go down again. How is this fair? How is this clear? How is this an appropriate way to run the country? What does this achieve? How long will this go on? Surely now is the time to act decisively on this issue. It is time to offer clarity to families using the Family Court who are already often in a state of distress because of the circumstances that are bringing them to the necessity to rely on the court. How will it bring clarity to families? It is important that they understand that the fees will not go up by 40 per cent and bounce around again while the government works out another way to sidestep the law and the clear will of the Senate.


But perhaps I should remind everyone in this place why the issue at the base of this, the cost of access to justice, is so important. We know that the cost of legal proceedings, the cost of access to the law, is the most common barrier for people in Australia now seeking legal help. Court fees are already too high. When it comes to accessing justice, which is a fundamental aspect of having a country where the rule of law is respected and that people can get equal access irrespective of the size of their wallet and only based on the merit of their claim—the people being failed by this government's policies and funding decisions are not just those who are suspected of or charged with some kind of wrongdoing or an offence. These people who are now having trouble accessing basic justice include the most vulnerable and innocent among us, such as children who are experiencing poverty and family violence or women experiencing domestic or sexual violence, for instance, in remote communities. They also include the most ordinary people among us—families who want to clarify guardianship arrangements for their elderly parents, divorcing couples wanting to finalise property settlements or arrangements for the care of their children, or neighbourhoods who are seeking to protect their local environment from harm or degradation.


Over and over again under this government we have seen cruel and counterproductive funding cuts that slice away at the fabric of access to justice in Australia, totalling well over $40 million since the election of this government. We have seen community legal centres and legal assistance services forced to turn away more and more people who are in need. Courts and tribunals have felt the squeeze of so-called efficiency strategies. It beggars my understand what is efficient about forcing people into a situation where they have to be self-represented or are not able to access justice at all with the flow-on costs that come from unmet legal need. There is nothing efficient about that at all. We are seeing mandatory sentencing policies and other legislative changes designed to remove lawyers and limit judicial discretion. This is the form that this particular government has. This is the form that this Attorney-General has. The result is, at best, a cruel and confusing system that fails to take into account individual experiences and leaves people in Australia without the help they need to understand what the law is and how the system works and, at worst, we are left with a system that leads to unfair outcomes, particularly for those who are not privileged enough to obtain private legal advice—leaving young people institutionalised, families torn apart and children at risk.


Let us cast our minds back.    In 2013, the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee, which I chaired at the time, commenced an inquiry, initiated by the Australian Greens, into the impact under the previous Labor government of higher Federal Court fees on access to justice. There was a great deal of interest in the inquiry from the legal community and a large number of submissions were received. The overwhelming consensus for participants in the inquiry was that the fee increases, at that time, were largely unreasonable and inhibited access to justice. 


Indeed, it is very interesting to note that the then shadow Attorney-General, Senator George Brandis, went out and decried the Labor government court fee increases and, in fact, was talking about the then Labor government's disguised divorce tax. So he was very, very loud and vociferous at the time about using the courts as a revenue-raising measure. However, interestingly enough too, as a result of the inquiry, the submissions and the evidence before the committee, the Australian Greens made a primary recommendation in our report from that inquiry that the 2013 fee increases should be wound back to the level which prevailed prior to 1 January 2013. Despite the shadow Attorney-General George Brandis's grandstanding at the time, in fact, the opposition at the time would not sign up to those recommendations. Do not look at what they do, look at what they say—that is what they would have us believe; in fact, look at what they do. 


Despite widespread acknowledgement that rising court fees were hindering access to justice, not one of the recommendations from the 2013 Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee inquiry into court fees have been implemented. This includes a recommendation that relevant stakeholders from the courts and the legal profession should be consulted before any future changes to Federal Court fees. 


In the 2013 inquiry, we also discovered that some Federal Court filing fees have tripled over recent years. This is nothing but a revenue-raising measure and an unfair tax on people who are unlucky enough to have to use the court system. Yet, here we are with this government now proposing further increases to court fees—up to 40 per cent in some cases.


The Australian Greens were particularly concerned about the $350 increase to divorce applications and the potential impact of that on women trying to leave domestic violence and family violence situations. People will understand there is a lot of discussion about family violence and there is a lot of rhetoric from the current government about the need to act. When we look at the actual practical implications of an increase like this, which will impede some women who need the closure of a divorce to end a violent relationship, when it will impede their ability to get that, you have to again say, 'Listen not to what they say, look at what they do.'


With the government fee increases, we have seen the cost of divorce applications rise from $845 to $1,195 in the first tranche of regulations and, of course, that will be even slightly higher under this second regulation that the government has now tabled. This will cause excessive and unfair delays to victims of domestic violence who will be seeking a divorce. In fact, the 2013 Senate inquiry into court fee increases found that higher court costs were indeed dissuading women who were trying to leave abusive marriages. There is evidence in that committee report for anyone who is interested in looking at it.


At a time when family violence is clearly on the national agenda, and rightly so, we must be making every effort, as a community and as a parliament, to protect victims of domestic violence and ensure that they have access to legal advice and to the courts. We have to put an end to the scourge of family violence in this country. Increasing divorce applications by $350 or more will make it even more difficult for women in abusive marriages to leave.


The changes to these Family Court fees, particularly the divorce application fee, are cynical when you realise there is no option for divorcing parties to avoid the courts. It is not as if they can be encouraged to somehow settle their legal differences or their legal claim in any other way. The only way to get a divorce in Australia is to go to the Family Court, make an application and pay for it. So even when they reach an agreement, even when there are consent orders, there is a fee imposed, and there is an increased fee now under these government regulations.


The Australian Greens say that it is completely inappropriate for the government to use family breakdown as a cash cow. While the government has tried to justify these huge fee hikes by suggesting that the money will go to improving court facilities, looking at the truth of the situation only a minor proportion of the $87 million that was predicted to be raised will actually be re-invested in the courts. Only $30 million will be spent on improvements to holding cells and to the safety of child dispute conference areas. 


Many legal stakeholders have opposed the fee increases on the grounds that they will significantly impact on low- to middle-income Australians and small- to medium-sized businesses that do not qualify for legal aid or any fee exemption or waiver. They also say these increases are unreasonably large and not justified by any rational policy objective, because really it is just about raising revenue. They are not supported by evidence that changes to fees will advance the government's policy objectives. Legal stakeholders say that these fees will impose an unreasonable barrier to accessing justice by making access to the Federal Court contingent upon the capacity of litigants of various means to meet the substantial additional cost of litigating. The impact on litigants will be inequitable and they will establish a regime which disproportionately impacts on those who have more limited financial means. So we will move, increasingly, to an Australia where justice is as good as you can buy, as good as you can afford, irrespective of the merits of your case.


On that basis, I want to conclude by saying that I urge everyone in this place to support this disallowance and to remain resolute in their commitment not to let this arrogant and unprincipled government take us and the users of the Family Court for granted.

Senator LAZARUS
 (Queensland) (16:43):  I rise to contribute to the discussion on this disallowance motion. I am supporting the disallowance of the Family Law (Fees) Amendment (2015 Measures No. 1) Regulation 2015 for a number of reasons. Firstly, the Abbott government has no mandate to increase the cost of Family Court fees. Unless I am mistaken, the Abbott government made no mention of these proposed increases in their 2013 suite of federal election campaign policies. If they were there, while Bronnie was flying around in her taxpayer funded helicopter, perhaps a set of campaign policy manuals relating to Family Court fees was misplaced during flight. Or perhaps the Family Law Court fee increase policy was also included in the GP co-payment and higher education deregulation folder, and the whole lot went missing during the flight. Regardless, the Family Law Court fee increases were never presented to the people of Australia for consideration as part of the election and so, therefore, the Abbott government has no mandate to increase these fees.


Secondly, the Abbott government has no parliamentary support to increase the Family Law Court fees. In fact, the Abbott government is effectively going against the wishes of the Australian parliament and the people of Australia by increasing the court fees through regulation—again. As we know, the government has already tried to increase Family Law Court fees and had this regulation disallowed by the Senate. Now, despite this, the Abbott government has ignored the will of the Senate by introducing new regulations which are effectively a complete copy of the original regulations. Perhaps the government is going for a trifecta; who knows? But again it is up to the crossbench, the Labor Party and the Greens to keep the government to account. Through our disallowance motion today we will be able to ensure the government does not implement another nasty budget measure which will only hurt disadvantaged and vulnerable Australians.


Thirdly, and finally, the Abbott government has no right nor need to increase Family Law Court fees. If anything, our court system needs support—not fee increase hikes. The court system should be a place where the people can resolve issues in a fair, accessible and transparent manner. Increasing Family Law Court fees will only hinder access to fair and reasonable issue resolution outcomes for Australians.


It is for all of these reasons that I am co-sponsoring this motion. I call on all of my Senate colleagues to assist me in rolling back these Family Law Court fee increases.

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales—Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Services) (16:46):  I rise to oppose the disallowance motion relating to the Family Law (Fees) Amendment (2015 Measures No. 1) Regulation 2015. In June the Senate voted to disallow family law fee changes which were intended to commence on 1 July. In doing so, those senators who supported the disallowance acted with gross irresponsibility, and if they do so again today they will be compounding their irresponsibility. The Family Court and the Federal Circuit Court are projecting substantial losses over the forward estimates. The package of measures is necessary to ensure the courts are sustainable by the fourth year of the forward estimates.


The government's budget measure was part of a package to ensure that the courts are in a strong financial position to carry out their fundamental role as the judicial arm of the Commonwealth while ensuring the efficient and effective delivery of their services. The government has considered in their totality all the issues related to court funding. The budget includes measures critical to ensuring that the courts are placed on a sustainable funding footing and meet the streamlining savings election commitment, Senator Lazarus. This includes injecting into the courts an additional $22.5 million over four years to enhance their capacity to provide services in areas such as family law, with $16.6 million to be injected into the Family Court and Federal Circuit Court and $5.9 million into the Federal Court. Injection into each court will remain as per the budget papers for 2015-16, but in the following years it will be adjusted as necessary when the courts become a single administrative body from 1 July 2016. 


It also includes $30 million in funding for critical maintenance works for court buildings. This is very important. It also includes merging the back office functions of the Federal Court, the Family Court and the Federal Circuit Court to ensure the efficient and effective delivery of shared services. Implementation will commence early in 2015-16 to facilitate formal commencement of the merged entity on 1 July 2016, and it will also include changes to court fees to commence in July 2014.


It is the last of these that Labor, the Greens and the crossbench are seeking to disallow. Of course, without the fee changes there will be almost nothing left for injection back into the courts. This action threatens to undermine the revenue base that is critical to putting the federal courts on a sustainable funding footing. The hypocrisy on the Labor side is amazing. When last in government, those opposite used substantial court fee increases to generate funds for the civil justice system, but with a much lower proportion—



Honourable senators interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order, senators.




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  But with a much lower portion of the additional revenue being returned to the courts. Can I repeat that, Senator Collins, just in case you did not quite hear it the first time. That is: when you were last in government, you used substantial court fee increases—



Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Collins, the senator has the right to be heard in silence.




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  I did sit there and listen to you in silence, Senator Collins, much against my better judgement. But perhaps I can repeat what I said for you. It is pretty simple: when you were in government you used substantial court fee increases to generate funds for the civil justice system, but with a much lower portion of the additional revenue being returned to the courts. In the 2012-13 budget you increased Federal Court fees from 1 January 2013 to raise a total of $102.4 million over four years, but only $30 million of that additional funding was provided to the federal courts. In the 2012-13 budget you changed court fees from 1 January 2013 to provide additional funding of $30 million over four years to the federal courts. The changes raised a total of $102.4 million over the forward estimates, of which approximately $4.2 million was also allocated to the federal courts for implementation and administration of the fees. Overall, fees in the Federal Court were raised by approximately 29 per cent, on average. As a result, public authorities such as the Australian Taxation Office and publicly-listed companies shifted matters from the Federal Court to the state courts. Consequently, in the 2013 calendar year the Federal Court collected $24.6 million in revenue but in the 2014 calendar year it collected $12.8 million in revenue. Its revenue decreased by 48 per cent. 


This is the legacy that those opposite left us. They raised fees, including almost trebling the concessional fees, and they did nothing towards returning the courts to sustainability. In a typical Labor-Greens comedy of errors, the previous government hiked the fees of the Federal Court so much that its business was halved and its fee revenue smashed. The additional fee revenue from the government's family law fee changes is a critical element of the package of court reform measures announced by the government in the 2015-16 budget, including the additional $22.5 million to be injected into the federal courts to enhance their capacity to provide services in key areas such as family law.


Other measures, including merging the court's back office functions, while important, generate insufficient savings to address the court's deficits and to meet the election commitment to streamline savings without accompanying fee increases. Given the structural deficits currently facing the family courts, the only alternatives would be to cut front-line court services, close registries and not replace judges—which would severely undermine access to justice for the Australian community. Dishonestly, the Labor Party and the Greens have characterised these fee increases as impacting on the vulnerable—who, they say, will not be able to afford the new fees. However, fee exemptions, deferrals and waivers will still apply to vulnerable litigants as before. This includes litigants who have been granted legal aid, who are holders of concessional cards, who would be subject to financial hardship by paying a fee, or who have an urgent need to file a document. Can I stress that: the government has left untouched the concessional fee arrangements. I repeat—especially for Senator Lazarus, Senator Wright and Senator Collins: the government has left untouched the concessional fee arrangements. I say that for a third time, in case you did not get it: this means that those facing financial hardship or other difficult circumstances should not be affected by these changes, and those opposite should not be peddling misrepresentations in relation to this—



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  You should not be peddling misrepresentations. It is appropriate to seek from court users a greater contribution towards the cost of running the courts, consistent with recommendations of the 2014 Productivity Commission report into access to justice arrangements. However, and I repeat: reduced fees for divorce applications will remain unchanged for vulnerable applicants in both the Family Court and the federal circuit court. Further, registrars have substantial discretion in granting reduced fees and deferred payment arrangements, even where litigants do not qualify for the concessional fees. It is only the actions of this Senate, in voting to disallow the fee regulations, that put these arrangements at risk.



Senator Lazarus interjecting—




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  Senator Lazarus, what part of that very simple comment did you not understand? Not only have we left untouched the concessional fee arrangements; registrars also have substantial discretion in granting reduced fees and deferred payment arrangements, even where you have litigants who do not qualify for the concessional fees. Not only that but, if the additional funding is not available, the government will have no choice but to consider the other, much less palatable methods of addressing the structural deficit. The Senate, in voting for disallowance, is in effect asking the government to consider registry closures and service reductions. This is a matter for those opposite but no-one will be left under any illusion about whose responsibility it will be. 



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that the disallowance motion moved by Senator Collins be agreed to.

Senator LINES
 (Western Australia) (19:20):  I want to take the few minutes I have tonight to make some remarks about a report published by Amnesty that focuses on keeping Indigenous kids in the community and out of detention in Western Australia. The report was published in late July and calls for action by Aboriginal people and the wider community. There is a real opportunity—in fact, a need—for the federal government to take leadership on the issue of Aboriginal incarceration, particularly the incarceration of young people in juvenile justice detention centres. There is an urgent need for the federal government to step up to the plate and show that leadership. We also need, right across Australia, a strategic approach to what is happening with Indigenous incarceration and what needs to be done to keep kids in the community, not in detention centres. The Amnesty report demonstrates that, with practical reforms to institutional practice, justice laws, community collaboration and strategic resourcing of diversion from custody and other community-building initiatives, Western Australia—and indeed every state and territory—could really achieve a change in the devastatingly high number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander youths who are in detention.


I will just go over some of the facts. In Western Australia, there is now a crisis. There is no doubt about that. At any one time in Western Australia, one in every 77 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander boys is in detention. Western Australia consistently detains Aboriginal young people at a vastly higher rate than any other state or territory. The rate of the overrepresentation is rising. Western Australia and the Northern Territory are the state and territory which do not provide national statistics in a way that is meaningful, so the Amnesty report calls specifically on the Western Australian government—and, again, the federal government could take the lead here to insist that this happens—to take immediate steps to improve the collection and dissemination of data that is relevant to the youth justice system. 


Last week, when we had our inquiry into Aboriginal incarceration in Western Australia, even the chief justice who gave evidence at that inquiry could not understand why the data could not be collected. We need disaggregated data. We need to look at police cautions and the referrals from the juvenile justice team. We need to look at decisions to arrest and to summons, by type. We need decisions around the grant or refusal of bail, by offence type, because that is another area where Western Australia stands out. Kids are often in remand because the bail options are not there. Most children in remand do not go on to receive a custodial sentence, and yet we have locked them up. The facts are that, once they get before a court, there is often no custodial sentence. But we need to have the absolute stats around that. 


We need the total numbers held in detention each year. Western Australia, along with every other state and territory, locks up children as young as 10. That is not what is recommended. The conventions on children say that children should not be in detention before the age of 12. Yet, in Western Australia and every other state and territory, children as young as 10 can be in remand. Given that Western Australia locks up Indigenous kids like no other jurisdiction across the country, there are 10-year-olds in detention in Western Australia. Ten years old—just think about that for a moment. We are putting those kids away. And of course they are taken out of school and they are learning from older kids in detention to keep breaking the law, and they are ending up back there. This is a really, really bad outcome. When I asked the chief justice about stats on that, none were available. This is a great report. I commend it to the Senate, and I will be speaking on it again.
