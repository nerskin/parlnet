Note: One consequence of this subclause is that clauses 45E and 46B (which apply if the body's VET FEE‑HELP account is in deficit at the end of a calendar year) will continue to apply to the body during the suspension.

   (ba) if the student enrols in the course after the day the Higher Education Support Amendment (VET FEE‑HELP Reform) Act 2015 receives the Royal Assent—the student being entitled to the VET FEE‑HELP assistance for the unit:


      (i) would not cause the VET provider's *VET FEE‑HELP account to be in deficit at the end of that census date (see subclause 45D(7)); and


      (ii) would not cause or contribute to that account being in deficit at the end of 2016 or a later calendar year; and


(12) Schedule 1, item 12, page 7 (lines 11 to 24), omit subclause 45C(2), substitute:

      (ii) paragraph (1)(ba) of this clause is not complied with; and


   (b) the *VET provider treats the student as being entitled to *VET FEE‑HELP assistance for the unit;


those paragraphs of this clause are taken to have been complied with.


Note 1: The VET provider should not treat the student as being entitled to VET FEE‑HELP assistance:


   (a) if the student requests the assistance during the 2 business day cooling‑off period after the enrolment; or


   (b) if being entitled would cause or contribute to the provider's VET FEE‑HELP account being in deficit.


Note 2: However, if the provider does treat the student as being entitled, the provider will contravene subclause 39DH(1) (a civil penalty provision), and the student may still be able to receive the assistance.


(13) Schedule 1, item 12, page 7 (after line 24), after clause 45C, insert:




45D


Notional VET FEE
‑HELP accounts



(1) There is a notional VET FEE‑HELP account for each *VET provider.


Note 1: The VET provider will need to monitor the balance of its account, as it will have to repay an amount to the Commonwealth if the account is in deficit at the end of 2016 or a later year.


Note 2: This account applies in relation to all students entitled to VET FEE‑HELP assistance for VET units of study with census dates on or after 1 January 2016 (whether or not the student received VET FEE‑HELP assistance for earlier units before that day). See subclause (7).




Credits to the VET provider
'
s VET FEE
‑HELP account



(2) A credit arises in the *VET provider's *VET FEE‑HELP account as follows:


   (a) if the VET provider is already a VET provider on 1 January 2015, a credit arises on the first day of each later calendar year that is equal to the amount worked out under subclause (3);


   (b) if the VET provider becomes a VET provider during 2015, a credit arises on the first day of each later calendar year that is equal to the amount worked out under subclause (4);


   (c) if the VET provider becomes a VET provider on a day after 2015, a credit arises on that day that is equal to the amount worked out under subclause (5);


   (d) if the VET provider pays on a particular day any part of any amount that becomes due under subclause 45E(2), a credit arises on that day that is equal to the amount of that payment;


   (e) if another body ceases to be a VET provider, a credit may arise in accordance with a determination under subclause (6).


A credit that arises as described in paragraph (e) arises at the time of the cessation, and is equal to the amount worked out under that determination.


(3) For the purposes of paragraph (2)(a), the amount to be credited is the amount equal to:





3




×




VET provider's adjusted 2015 total loan amount

where:




   VET provider
'
s adjusted 2015 total loan amount means the sum of the amounts of *VET FEE‑HELP assistance paid for students undertaking, with the *VET provider, *VET units of study that had *census dates during the period starting on 1 January 2015 and ending on 31 August 2015.


(4) For the purposes of paragraph (2)(b), the amount to be credited is the amount equal to the sum of:


   (a) the *VET provider's fee revenue for the period:


      (i) starting on 1 January 2015; and


      (ii) ending on the day before the VET provider was approved as a VET provider;


      for *domestic students undertaking *qualifying VET courses in that period; and


(b) the sum of the amounts of *VET FEE‑HELP assistance paid for students undertaking, with the VET provider, *VET units of study that had *census dates during 2015.


(5) For the purposes of paragraph (2)(c), the amount to be credited is the amount equal to the *VET provider's fee revenue for the 2015 calendar year for *domestic students undertaking in that year the *qualifying VET courses that enabled paragraph 6(1)(ca) or (1A)(da) to be satisfied for the purposes of the VET provider's approval as a VET provider.


(6) The Minister may, by legislative instrument, determine:


   (a) whether credits arise in the *VET FEE‑HELP accounts of specified *VET providers when another body ceases to be a VET provider; and


   (b) the amounts of such credits.




Debits to the VET FEE
‑HELP account



(7) A debit arises in the *VET provider's *VET FEE‑HELP account if a student is entitled to *VET FEE‑HELP assistance for a *VET unit of study:


   (a) that is to be undertaken with the VET provider; and


   (b) that has a *census date on or after 1 January 2016.


The debit arises at the end of that census date, and is equal to the amount of that assistance.




45E


Effect of VET FEE
‑HELP account being in deficit at the end of a calendar year



(1) If:


   (a) a *VET provider's *VET FEE‑HELP account is in deficit at the end of a calendar year; and


   (b) the *Secretary gives the VET provider a written notice about the deficit;


the VET provider must pay to the Commonwealth an amount equal to the amount of the deficit (the excess loan amount).


(2) The excess loan amount is due on the seventh day (the due day) after the day the notice is given.




Late payments of the excess loan amount attract the general interest charge



(3) If some or all of the excess loan amount remains unpaid after the due day, the *VET provider must pay to the Commonwealth an amount (the general interest charge) relating to the unpaid amount for each day in the period that:


   (a) starts at the beginning of the day after the due day; and


   (b) ends at the end of the last day on which, at the end of the day, any of the following remains unpaid:


      (i) the excess loan amount;


      (ii) general interest charge on any of the excess loan amount.


(4) The general interest charge for a particular day is worked out by multiplying the *general interest charge rate for that day by the sum of so much of the following amounts as remains unpaid:


   (a) the general interest charge from previous days;


   (b) the excess loan amount.


(5) The general interest charge for a day is due and payable to the Commonwealth at the end of that day.


(6) The *Secretary may give written notice to the *VET provider of the amount of the general interest charge for a particular day or days. A notice given under this subclause is prima facie evidence of the matters stated in the notice.


(7) The *Secretary may remit all or a part of the general interest charge payable by the *VET provider if the Secretary is satisfied:


   (a) that:


      (i) the circumstances that contributed to the delay in payment were not due to, or caused directly or indirectly by, an act or omission of the VET provider; and


      (ii) the VET provider has taken reasonable action to mitigate, or mitigate the effects of, those circumstances; or


   (b) that it is otherwise appropriate to do so.


(8) An amount payable under this clause may be recovered by the Commonwealth from the *VET provider as a debt due to the Commonwealth.

(2) The amount to be re‑credited is equal to so much of that assistance as the *VET provider reasonably believes caused or contributed to the deficit.


Note: A corresponding amount of the student's VET FEE‑HELP debt relating to the unit will be remitted (see section 137‑18).

Parliamentary Counsel





Higher Education Support Amendment (VET FEE-HELP Reform) Bill 2015





GZ155





Statement of reasons: why certain amendments should be moved as requests



Section 53 of the Constitution is as follows:




Powers of the Houses in respect of legislation



53. Proposed laws appropriating revenue or moneys, or imposing taxation, shall not originate in the Senate. But a proposed law shall not be taken to appropriate revenue or moneys, or to impose taxation, by reason only of its containing provisions for the imposition or appropriation of fines or other pecuniary penalties, or for the demand or payment or appropriation of fees for licences, or fees for services under the proposed law.


The Senate may not amend proposed laws imposing taxation, or proposed laws appropriating revenue or moneys for the ordinary annual services of the Government.


The Senate may not amend any proposed law so as to increase any proposed charge or burden on the people.


The Senate may at any stage return to the House of Representatives any proposed law which the Senate may not amend, requesting, by message, the omission or amendment of any items or provisions therein. And the House of Representatives may, if it thinks fit, make any of such omissions or amendments, with or without modifications.


Except as provided in this section, the Senate shall have equal power with the House of Representatives in respect of all proposed laws.




Amendment (14)



The effect of this amendment is to provide for the re-setting of the cap on the total amount of VET FEE-HELP assistance payable for a student. It is covered by section 53 because it will allow further payments of assistance to be made for the student from the Consolidated Revenue Fund under the standing appropriation in section 238-12 of the Higher Education Support Act 2003, and so will increase a ""proposed charge or burden on the people"".


 




Higher Education Support Amendment (VET FEE-HELP Reform) Bill 2015





SHEET GZ155



Statement by the Clerk of the Senate pursuantto the order of the Senate of 26 June 2000











Amendment (14)



The effect of this amendment is to allow a student's VET FEE-HELP assistance to be re-credited in certain circumstances. Although the assistance is capped, the re-crediting is a further payment of assistance available to students. If such a further payment of assistance is made, the increased expenditure would be met directly from the standing appropriation in section 238-12 of the Higher Education Support Act 2003.


The Senate has long followed the practice that amendments which ""clearly, necessarily and directly"" affects an appropriation is regarded as an increase in a charge or burden on the people within the meaning of section 53 of the Constitution (Odgers' Australian Senate Practice, 13th edition, p. 394). On the basis that this amendment would result in increased expenditure under the standing appropriation in the Act, it is in accordance with the precedents of the Senate that this amendment be moved as a request.


In my summing-up speech last night in relation to this VET FEE-HELP reform bill, I outlined the range of government amendments that have been proposed. These are significant additions to the arrangements that the government has proposed for this legislation. They are important additional arrangements that are being put in place. Firstly, it is important for the chamber to appreciate that these amendments will put a very clear cap on the rate of growth in the VET FEE-HELP loan scheme. We have all acknowledged that there have been problems in relation to the way this scheme has been administered, and I thank all parties in the Senate for their support of the second reading and their indication of support overall for the government's measures.


What we are proposing to do through these amendments is, firstly, to stop any further growth in the VET FEE-HELP loan scheme by capping the loan amounts available to VET FEE-HELP providers in 2016 at 2015 levels. This will ensure that providers cannot continue to expand at the rate at which they have been, and they will, therefore, need to focus their activities on existing students. Importantly, within that, priority will be given to existing students in terms of the loan cap that will be applied to individual providers, making sure, therefore, that those who are already enrolled, should they still need to draw down further on their loans to conclude their studies, will have priority to be able to do so.


The next measure that the government is introducing is some further restrictions on approvals for new VET FEE-HELP providers to come into the system. In this space, we are seeking to make sure that only those who have a very strong and proven track record are able to still enter. There is a significant backlog of applications for new VET FEE-HELP providers. This measure will ensure that anybody who is a fly-by-nighter, or anyone who is a new entrant into this space, will not be able to listed as a new VET FEE-HELP provider. Instead, through this amendment, only those who have a strong trading history of at least five years in offering VET courses as a registered training organisation will be able to be registered as a VET FEE-HELP provider. They will only be able to offer the course through VET FEE-HELP that they have a history of providing and, consistent with the freeze on the total loan amounts, they will only be able to offer loans up to the value of their existing fee-for-service operations. So this is a very narrow process for any new providers to come into the system, but it does reflect, importantly, that there are some very high-quality providers who did not rush to become VET FEE-HELP providers but who have suffered damage on multiple fronts as a result of the problems with this system. They have suffered damage—as has everybody in the VET sector—to reputation, but of course they have also suffered a threat to their market share, because they are still only offering fee-for-service operations, whereas others are able to offer the very generous VET FEE-HELP loan. So this will provide a narrow window through which only those with a very strong and credible history would be able to come in the system now, and even then only to the extent to which they have operated previously in the fee-for-service market.


The further amendments that are proposed are to provide capacity for the minister to pause payments for poor performance. This is a very important reform; perhaps one of the most important now in the overall legislative package—because, by pausing payments for poor performance, the government will be empowering the minister to be able to step in where there are relevant concerns about the way in which an entity is operating, and to stop them from being able to enrol new students under the VET FEE-HELP scheme. The only new students they would be able to enrol while such a pause were in place are students who actually pay for their services themselves. So the only opportunity for new student enrolments while a pause on payments for any new enrolments occurred would be fee-for-service students. This is a very significant power for the minister to have, and it will enable the minister to be able to step in in areas where there are concerns about completion rates for some providers, or about other dubious activities that may be occurring.


I should stress in relation to this measure—and indeed in relation to the final measure that I will highlight, which is the measure that provides for a payment-in-arrears system—that it is not the government's intention that these measures would apply to well-performing providers. We do not envisage they would apply to public providers such as TAFEs, nor to others who have taken a more cautious approach in this sector. But that does lead me into that final significant measure in the government's reforms, which is to also give ministerial discretion to shift some providers—it would be intended that these be the major, high-volume providers—to a payment-in-arrears structure. This will enable the department and the government greater opportunity to scrutinise the activities that these providers are undertaking prior to payments being made, and will of course put an additional impost into their business operations, to make sure that they are managing their cash flow and their operations in an appropriate and responsible way.


It is the government's view that these measures complement the existing legislation and build upon it; and that they are obviously additional, by their very nature—which is something we have flagged an openness to at all stages of the VET FEE-HELP debate to date. We have always been very open, and we were very open right through the drafting of this legislation, that if additional measures were warranted the government would pursue and implement those additional measures. That is exactly what we are doing through these measures.


Importantly, the freeze on total loan payments to providers is of course a temporary measure, in the sense that we have committed to a wholesale revamp of the VET FEE-HELP scheme next year to try to ensure that we have a scheme that works in terms of providing quality training with good value-for-money outcomes for those participants. It is not expected that such a freeze would apply year on year, because obviously that is an administratively difficult thing for the organisations in the VET FEE-HELP space, but it is an important signal that we are going to stop the growth and stop the expansion of the loan scheme while we undertake this rewrite during next year. I commend the amendments to the Senate.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2015-12-02,"



Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (09:41):  I indicate to the minister, for the Hansard record, my profound disappointment that the government has sought to present these amendments in this way. This is a matter that has been the subject of two Senate inquiries. The measures in this bill were the subject of a report tabled on Monday which contained the immortal recommendations from government senators that things were just fine and, on the next day, the government took those amendments to its party room and publicly released them, just as I was about to speak on the second reading debate. You will say, 'So what?' It is a hell of a way to consider such fundamental and far-reaching proposals and it should have been done much earlier. I understand they were with the Parliamentary Draftsman at least on Friday last week, so one presumes they were with the government prior to that. The normal process is that these matters would go to cabinet. Instructions would have to have been prepared prior to that, and you would have thought it would be at least a courtesy to engage the opposition in the government's proposals. It may well have been the case that you would get a better result.


As I read it, there has been no consultation outside of the department on these proposals. There has been no consideration of the impact of these proposals within the sector itself. Well may it be that the government is now acknowledging the central truth of the opposition's claims on this matter, that we have to turn off the tap. I welcome the government's acknowledgement of that matter. I am concerned about the nature of these amendments and the extent to which they will indeed fix the problem. My concern also is that the implementation of these measures will be a continuation of the shambolic and chaotic approach that we have seen to date. I will have more to say on this theme, but I ask the minister whether he can enlighten me and the chamber: what is it that the department will need to do between now—that is, 2 December—and the implementation of this matter on 1 January? What will the department actually need to undertake to implement these emergency measures?

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2015-12-02,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (09:44):  I will not repeat my closing remarks of last night except to note that the government has, through the course of this year, acknowledged the importance of turning off the tap in relation to the way this scheme has worked. I also commented last night that in many ways those opposite are like an arsonist who has lit a fire and now complains that the fire brigade is taking too long to get here. We have long acknowledged the problems in this scheme. We have been working to try to resolve and rectify them. We have conceded now that to rectify them is going to require a wholesale rewriting of Labor's scheme, and we are committing to do so.


In relation to the measures that apply to the pausing of payments for new enrolments or to moving to payment in arrears for certain providers, those measures are powers that are to be provided to the minister and would be exercised on a case-by-case basis. In those instances there is not necessarily a specific time line for departmental implementation but advice will be received on a case-by-case basis.


In relation to the new entry requirements for an RTO wishing to become a VET FEE-HELP provider, if anything this will ease the administrative workload of the department. As they have indicated, there are hundreds of outstanding VET FEE-HELP applications. The passage of those amendments will allow the department to discard a number of those applications who do not meet the very clear terms that are set out in the amendments.


In relation to freezing the total loan limit for existing VET FEE-HELP training providers, that is a relatively simple measure. That amendment essentially takes payments over the first eight months of this year and averages them into a 12-month cap. The department already has data across that eight month time horizon for the 260-odd VET FEE-HELP providers who are registered, so it will be able to fairly neatly average out that eight months into a 12-month cap on what they would be eligible to claim as payments in 2016.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2015-12-02,"



Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (09:47):  The payments that are made to providers at the moment are, of course, based on claims that are actually made by the providers—I trust that that is the case. Is it not the case that claims for payments may still be made—and, in fact, are still being made—after 1 January and that you are averaging arrangement will not necessarily take that into account?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Higher Education Support Amendment (VET FEE-HELP Reform) Bill 2015</title>,BILLS,1,1
"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2015-12-02,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (09:48):  If I understand your question correctly, yes, providers are still receiving payments now as they do during the course of this year. What our legislation is saying is that, in relation to calculating a 12-month cap on payments, we are taking the first eight months of payments for 2015 and extrapolating that into a 12-month payment. Essentially, we will average those eight months into the average monthly payment across those eight months and multiply that by 12 to establish a 12-month cap. I have an important clarification there: it is not necessarily the actual payment transaction within those eight months; it is the data in applications lodged by providers in that eight-month period. In a sense, that is a time sequencing matter, probably, as much as anything, in that payments lag applications, so payments that would have been made in January may well apply to applications made in December or November or the like. So—whichever—in a sense, it is simply just applying what seems to be the administratively simplest means by which the department can quickly establish a 12-month per-provider cap for 2016, essentially using 2015 data, albeit using the first eight months of 2015 data.

 (Victoria) (09:50):  I think I understand what you are trying to do here, Minister. Is it the case that the current arrangement depends on estimates of enrolments, not actual enrolments? And will that still apply?

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (09:50):  Payments made in advance, as they are at present, are made on estimates—that is correct, Senator Carr. The data method proposed in terms of setting this cap is data informed by actual enrolments. So there is a distinction between those two. Of course the other amendments that seek to make payments in arrears mean that those payments would shift to an actuals versus an estimates basis.

Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (09:52):  What do you think the implications of that are going to be, given that there are 260 providers there? Perhaps you could refresh my memory in the answer to that question: what is the total amount at stake here? What is the total freeze which you are establishing?

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (09:52):  Just for clarity, Senator Carr: it is around 264 providers, I believe, and the total freeze is expected to be a value of around $3 billion when the sums are finally calculated. As we have all discussed during the debate, the very rapid growth that occurred after the changes that opened the scheme up occurred in 2012, which is exactly why we are seeking to stymie that growth. It is a relatively straight formula that is being applied here, so the expectation is that—whilst anybody is, of course, free to seek to bring forward court proceedings—the grounds on which somebody may wish to pursue those proceedings would have some limitations, given the very clear and prescriptive formula that we are seeking for the parliament to apply.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2015-12-02,"



Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (09:53):  In the considerations of the preparation of this formula, has there been any assessment as to whether or not it would be possible for providers who are intent on rorting the scheme—and remember: of those 260 providers, we do know there are rorters that will be locked into this system; this is freezing the rorters into the system itself—and would it not be more efficient for such providers intent on rorting the system to actually enrol more students at higher prices within their cap?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Higher Education Support Amendment (VET FEE-HELP Reform) Bill 2015</title>,BILLS,1,1
"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2015-12-02,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (09:54):  Providers seeking to rort the system will, if you look at the collective amendments that are proposed, run the risk of finding that their provision and ability to enrol more students could be withdrawn at any time, based on ministerial discretion, as a result of the pause in payment provisions being applied. Providers may wish to contemplate how to rort the system further, if they are of that nature, but there are serious consequences for them.


The greatest problem we have had in this scheme is not, necessarily, that legitimate students have been signed up at too high a price in relation to their cost—and it is legitimate students who a provider incurs a cost to teach, because those students are engaged in the teaching and learning process. The primary problem we have faced is that students with little or no intention, and little or no likelihood of ever engaging in the teaching, learning and training process, have been signed up. 


That is the practice, overall, that the government's changes through the course of this year have sought to stamp out. I make that point because if those students are not seeking to undertake training or otherwise they come out at relatively low per-person cost to the training provider. The need or incentive to try to sign up fewer people at greater price, for profit motivation—if that is the argument you are making—is not really where the prime problem has tended to be. The prime problem has been a willingness to sign up people with no intention or likelihood of undertaking the study, regardless of the price, knowing the cost of teaching those people is negligible because they are never going to turn up to anything.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2015-12-02,"



Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (09:57):  I do appreciate that point very much. The problem is, then, catching them out because of the audit processes being structured in such a way. That has been a profound difficulty, because of the available resourcing. I acknowledge that the government has increased resourcing for this particular regulator, but there is this huge problem of identifying colleges that have a quality provision. It is not, usually, until you establish that only one in 10 students is actually completing—that is a post-factor analysis, that you discover there has been this type of rorting going on. The qualified teachers, the quality of the programs and the contact hours are all measures that have been the subject of substantial public criticism. This is particularly difficult to identify when we are dealing with online courses.


There are no provisions in these amendments to deal with this and no way of really checking to see the quality of the teaching undertaken until such time as you look at the completions. Under this range, we are locking in this very poor performance of completions for the next year. Where would I find, in this series of amendments, reference to the fact that this is a temporary measure? Where would I find that reference, the sunset clause in these amendments, that says these are temporary measures to allow the government time to, essentially, revamp the whole scheme? Where do I find that in these amendments?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Higher Education Support Amendment (VET FEE-HELP Reform) Bill 2015</title>,BILLS,1,1
"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2015-12-02,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (09:59):  I will directly answer your question, Senator Carr, and then I want to touch on some of the preceding remarks. You will not find a sunset clause in the amendments. The government has made a public commitment and a commitment in the chamber that it is our intention to revamp the scheme next year. I imagine that providers of all shapes and sizes would expect to be holding the government to account in that regard to make sure that new arrangements are put in place, otherwise the 2015 cap will carry forward indefinitely. That is not something that the providers, the states or others would want to have. In some ways I think a sunset clause would be counterproductive. By having a sunset clause for that one provision we would, in a sense, remove the gun to the head that would make us get on with making sure that, overall, the scheme is rewritten and new arrangements are put in place. So I would caution the Senate against the concept of a sunset clause there and I urge the Senate to join, no doubt with others, in holding the government to account to make sure that a new scheme that rewrites all of these rules in a much more effective manner is operational from 2017.


Senator Carr, I want to pick up on your comments about completion rates and whether or not there is effective regulation of teaching practices, completion rates and other factors. I acknowledge that you have acknowledged the extra resources that have been provided to both ASQA and the Department of Education and Training to enhance audit activity and compliance. I also draw the Senate's attention to some of the provisions that would, potentially, lead to the pausing of payments for poor performance to providers. These are quite broad provisions and they touch on some of these significant quality issues. I draw the Senate's attention to amendment (5), which inserts item 7A. In particular, I draw attention to the proposed changes to subclause 26(1)(b) of schedule 1A of the act:


(i)  the approaches used to recruit or enrol students …


(ii)  the veracity of enrolments …


(iii)  the level of teaching resources, or the quality of those resources, for any of those courses—


which I think is a particularly important component for consideration, in relation to how some of the online enrolments may occur—


(iv)  the level of engagement in any of those courses of students who receive VET FEE-HELP assistance—


again, a very important provision that means swift action could be undertaken were enrolments to be proceeding but students not turning up or participating, in any way, in those courses—


(v)  the completion rates for any of those courses …


The government does have profound concerns about some providers and the very poor completion rates that are in place. We equally have concerns about the level of engagement in a number of courses and we have spent much time talking about recruitment and enrolment practices of providers during this year. We want to make sure that the provisions are there that enable us to take swift action in response to those concerns. In terms of the power of the different amendments we are proposing, this one is most notable. Providers should expect that the government would be looking to use these provisions, if they are passed, in a relatively swift time line, and if you are out there with poor levels of engagement of students in your courses or poor completion rates it is highly probable that we are looking at you.

 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (10:04):  Senator Carr, these are provisions that apply only to VET FEE-HELP providers, as distinct from all VET providers, so in that regard we are talking about the 264 or thereabouts VET FEE-HELP providers as distinct from the some 4,700 or thereabouts registered training organisations. These provisions—the pausing of payments provisions, which are subject to a ministerial discretion or determination—are also subject to AAT appeals mechanisms as well. So—as distinct from the earlier provisions, which are a clear rule that applies consistently across all VET FEE-HELP providers in terms of a calculation of an annualised cap on their loan limit—because these are individual, subjective decisions that are undertaken in accordance with an assessment and against the terms of the amendments, there are appropriate appeals mechanisms through the AAT provided for.

"Simms, Sen Robert",AG,2015-12-02,"



Senator SIMMS
 (South Australia) (10:05):  I want to take this opportunity to put the Greens' position on these amendments on record, and we certainly welcome the government coming to the table and putting forward some amendments that will improve the protections for students within this space. We welcome that. Like Senator Carr from the Labor Party, we do have some frustrations around the process. It would have been useful to have had more of an opportunity to consider these amendments. Given the significance of these to the sector and given the community interest in this issue, it would have been very beneficial for us to have the opportunity to consult with the community around that and to have more of an opportunity to consider what the government has put forward.


Nonetheless, we do welcome the fact that the government has finally recognised that there is a need to act on this issue. Of course, we know this is a system that the Labor Party put in place. They set the ball in motion for what has been a complete calamity, but the government have sat on their hands for the last two years and have really failed to take action. So we do welcome the fact today that finally it appears that we might be about to introduce more rigour into this sector and ensure that there are better protections for students.


From the Greens' perspective—and we have made this point throughout—we do not support public funding going to for-profit providers. That has always been our view. So, whether it is the Labor amendments, the Liberal amendments or the whole bill, we do not believe that, fundamentally, this is going to be adequate in terms of addressing the needs of students in this space, because when you have for-profit providers that are focused simply on making money—that is their business model—you are setting up a recipe for disaster in terms of preying on vulnerable students, and we are very concerned about that. We would like to see public money being redirected to our TAFE system. It is a quality education provider in this country. It is accountable to the taxpayer, and we know that it is able to deliver quality outcomes. But, unfortunately, we recognise that that is not the space we operate in, because of the position of the Labor and Liberal parties, so we do welcome the opportunity to strengthen the protections for students within the VET FEE-HELP model.


I also have a few questions for the minister. I have heard talk today—and certainly the minister has talked a little bit about this—about this idea of a new model for VET FEE-HELP that will come into effect in 2007, but I am still very unclear about what exactly will be the characteristics of this new model. What will it look like, and what consultation will the government conduct with the sector and the community in developing and shaping this new model that will take effect from 2017?

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2015-12-02,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (10:09):  Senator Simms, what the government is proposing is that we will look at how we would reconceive of VET FEE-HELP as a means that provides for a higher quality of training outcomes, is more directly relevant to likely employment outcomes and has mechanisms in place to try to drive efficiency in the cost and pricing of delivery of those courses.


We are committed to consulting with the sector. I note that both TAFE Directors Australia and ACPET, representing private providers, welcomed the government's additional amendments that were introduced this week. We would work with them along with community colleges and all other providers. We would consult with the states and territories as we would with industry, employers and students to make sure that the system applied in future is one that people can have confidence in.


The principles behind an income-contingent loan scheme are sound principles of equity. That is why the Howard government proposed to apply the expansion of income-contingent loans to students in this vocational education sector, but it did so in a cautious way that required courses to have an articulation agreement with universities. The previous government, as has been well canvassed in this debate, removed that requirement and opened up some of the other measures of access to it, which has led to the very rapid rate of growth. That does not change the fact that income-contingent loans are good, equitable means of avoiding people having to pay up-front fees.


While noting the Greens' philosophical objection to private education, I would encourage Senator Simms, over the Christmas break, to have a look at the total VET activity reporting data released in the last few weeks. It is quite striking. If you have a look at the fee-for-service VET market—those providers outside of VET FEE‑HELP and those providers operating outside of state government subsidy arrangements—some of the strongest completion rates and some of the strongest employment outcomes are derived by private providers and evidenced by the total VET activity reporting.


There is a challenge, Senator Simms, as to how we make sure we get those high-quality outcomes for training and employment—that those private providers have demonstrated they deliver—expanded in areas where the government wants to apply a subsidy but without the type of rorting we have seen to date. TAFE does an outstanding job, in many instances, but there have been widely acknowledged problems over the years that without some semblance of competitive pressure, without some degree of contestability, TAFEs may not be as driven to change their ways—to focus on delivering good value-for-money outcomes—as they should be. Equally, the sorry saga of the VET FEE‑HELP episode demonstrates that without appropriate safeguards in place you will see profiteers, shonksters and fraudsters stepping into the mix and ripping off the taxpayer.


It is knowing all of those lessons the government embarks upon—saying we want to try to reconceive this scheme in 2017. We will consult with all the relevant stakeholders in doing so, and we will do so very well aware of the problems. In my changed capacity, over the last couple of months, in having responsibility for higher education, I have acknowledged, in talking at higher education fora, that I have been somewhat burnt by the VET FEE‑HELP saga and the experiences I have seen here on how you might expand access and structure arrangements. They are lessons that, equally, I take in contemplating where higher-education reform might go. They are lessons that we, the government, have at the forefront of our minds when reconceiving the scheme in 2017. I welcome your contributions and inputs, just as I will Senator Carr's. I know Minister Hartsuyker will be happy to hear from all those who have ideas.



Senator Kim Carr interjecting—




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  Senator Carr, as I have said in this debate before, has been big enough to acknowledge the mistake that happened in 2012 and where things went wrong. He, at least, acknowledges some of the mistakes and lessons that need to be learnt as well. We may not agree on all the benefits of some of the competition that, perhaps, we should find ways to preserve in any new model but, if he has innovative ideas in that space, I am happy to hear them.

 (South Australia) (10:15):  I thank the minister for his reply and for the suggestion of some Christmas reading. I look forward to undertaking that, particularly on nights when I have difficulty sleeping. I will certainly follow that up. In terms of the timetable around this exercise of envisaging a new scheme, which the minister has touched on, are there some actual time frames in place? I know the minister has talked about 2017, but what consultation time frame do you have in place or are working towards? Are there particular milestones in what we can expect in the lead-up to the announcement of this new model?

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (10:16):  Senator, I would expect that, in the next couple of weeks, Minister Hartsuyker will meet and discuss with some of the first-tier stakeholders exactly how the approach will play out, if I can put it that way, in terms of those who represent the various VET providers and other key players. The first point of those consultations will, indeed, be to, perhaps, set down some of the benchmarks and time lines that you ask about, so that it is developed in a cooperative manner. We have, perhaps too much so in not having brought this legislation to the Senate earlier, sought to be very consultative in our approaches.


In March, when I announced the suite of eight reforms to the VET FEE-HELP scheme that we applied then, I established, working within the department, a VET FEE-HELP working group. That working group brought together TAFE directors, ACPET and the community colleges. It brought in representatives of industry and consumer affairs. I think we had the New South Wales consumer affairs commission represented. We had Gerard Brody from the Consumer Action Law Centre in Victoria, who I had not met at that point in time, but who I had noted, through media, as being one of the strongest critics of the way the scheme was operating, so I wanted to have his input around that table as well on the reforms that are contained in this legislation.


The government, I think, has shown a strong commitment to consultation and a consultation which does stretch beyond the immediacy of providers and tries to make sure it has representatives, importantly, of both student and employer interests around the table, because we should never lose sight of the fact that we are debating vocational education and training. The outcome and objective we seek is that students are trained and skilled for jobs.

Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (10:19):  I will follow through on the theme. The process has been haphazard and piecemeal, and of course it has followed the long tradition in this area—that is, there is usually a scandal brought about by public exposure of corruption in one form or another, and I regard what is happening here as corruption. Unfortunately, we have a continuation of that theme developing. I remind senators—and I acknowledge the minister's comment that John Howard started this process—that it is all very well to point to the previous government—




Senator Birmingham:
  With articulation through university—




Senator KIM CARR:
  I will ask you a specific question, but I want to make a few comments. On the question of articulation, since you have raised it—and I acknowledge that you have raised it—is it your intention to revisit the question of the restoration of credit transfer arrangements? The reality is that, under that scheme, universities had a stake in quality assurance, because they did not want to be associated with crooks and shysters. All too often, I have had to point out in this chamber and at estimates that universities have let themselves down by being associated with such disreputable elements. They have subcontracted out their scripts and they have engaged brokers who behaved in a shocking way. One of their fundamental assets is their reputation for quality. I ask the minister specifically: are you prepared to consider the issue when you go to the issues of the design of the new scheme?


The view was taken at the time, in 2009—they have acknowledged that this is one of the unintended consequences—that the TAFE system was given too strong a position as a result of the credit transfer and there was reliance upon a quality assurance regime based on reputation and based on experience. The view at the time was generated from within the bureaucracy. The same bureaucracy that I have no doubt is advising you on these matters now advised the previous government that there needed to be an evening up by allowing the rapid expansion of the private sector, which of course has produced these, as said, unintended consequences.


I cannot possibly believe that an official would recommend or that a minister would agree to a proposition knowing that these types of events would occur—that has to be acknowledged—any more than I can blame John Howard for some of the abuses that occurred. The reality is that all of us in government have to take responsibility for what is on our plate at the time. It is a very short-sighted view to simply say, 'The previous government made some errors.' It is the nature of government, of course, that there is always a need to update, modernise and take into account learned experience. This area in particular has been a product of that. In the over 20 years that I have been engaged in these issues, that has been the pattern, irrespective of which government is in office.


The big difference here is that, in philosophical terms, in general, you could say that conservative governments have sought to deregulate because they want to see a higher level of private engagement in the provision of these services. The real irony is that this is a government that has pursued vigorously a deregulation agenda in education, and now it finds itself heavily regulating. That is what we have before us: a series of measures which have probably the most onerous regulatory powers that we have seen in the sector for a Commonwealth official with regard to a Commonwealth program. I take the view that, in fact, this could go much further and should go much further. I do not think these measures are adequate in terms of dealing with the problem.


I think, Minister, if I might offer this advice: you are about to discover just how inadequate these rearrangements will be. Even if you do think they are very robust at this time we will be back to actually have to enlarge these powers because there will be very smart folk out there who will find a very easy way to get around many of these provisions. And the same officers who have advised you, advised previous ministers responsible for vocational education.


I must say to you—I will make this observation—I never had the privilege of actually administering the vocational education system in my time in government; I had all the others. But I have had a deep interest—a profound interest—in this area and so I am familiar with the consequences. That is why I am concerned by your response on the question of the design of the new program that you are envisaging. It is my suspicion that there are very few real elements of the architecture prepared at this time. That is my suspicion.


I would be very pleased to hear if you are actually moving to a contract based arrangement which, of course, the states rely upon, so that individual providers actually have to have a direct contract with the Commonwealth. That would provide the Commonwealth with much greater capacities to manage this expenditure. But I am particularly concerned that any consultations that are undertaken are not limited to a series of informal discussions. There is a grave danger that proposals which involve the expenditure, as you have indicated to us today—even with your attempt to put a cap on this at $3 billion—involve just the VET FEE-HELP working group. There should be a much more formal process for discussion of specific proposals that the government has. It may be that you do not have time to do a green-and-white paper process, but that to me is the gold standard. That is the approach that we are taking with regard to the university system.


I believe that if you were actually advancing your thinking you could put out a government discussion paper outlining what you are actually seeking to do and getting people across the board to make comment upon that in an open and transparent way. The groups that have a profound interest in it are, as you said, student groups and employer groups. After all, this is the vocational education system—as you made the point. But there are also state governments, and the unions have a profound interest.


My understanding of the conversations you had with unions when you were minister for vocational education is that they were about the destruction of union involvement in the skills councils. Historically, there was a tripartite approach to these issues, which this government has sought to overturn. So those representatives of workers should have an opportunity here, because there are profound levels of expertise within the trade union movement on the questions of vocational education. But the idea of crisis management, whereby you have a meeting with this group and that group to try to shut up one group or another which makes a complaint is no way to redesign a program of this importance.


I make this observation, Minister: the Commonwealth is seeking to take over the entire VET sector. It has put those propositions to state ministers. There is no way—there is just absolutely no way—you are going to get the states to sign up to a transfer of responsibilities for vocational education to the Commonwealth when this sort of shambolic behaviour is going on. There is absolutely no way that the minister in Victoria, for instance—Steve Herbert, the minister for training—who has led this campaign to clean up the system is going to recommend to the Victorian government, as I said, to transfer powers to the Commonwealth when this sort of shambolic behaviour is in play. And there will need to be a demonstration that the states actually have a capacity to provide substantive policy advice on the administration of any new scheme.


Now, we have already indicated that there is no suggestion within these amendments that these measures are in fact temporary. I am deeply suspicious that what this program is really all about is getting past the next election. We will see what happens after that. It may well be that there will be a change of government at the next election, and there may well be an entirely different approach to the way in which these questions are dealt with.


Minister, I ask you, when you are considering these questions: will you look at the issue of the restoration of the credit transfer? I will leave it at that.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Higher Education Support Amendment (VET FEE-HELP Reform) Bill 2015</title>,BILLS,1,1
"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2015-12-02,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (10:30):  Let me deal with a few of the issues that Senator Carr has raised. He quite rightly indicated that the government of the day needs to take responsibility for the circumstances that it finds. This government has been very clear that it takes responsibility for seeking to clean up the mess that it has discovered in the VET FEE-HELP scheme. It has been a process of attempting to apply reforms that we think will fix it. We have acknowledged this week that we think it will take a profound overhaul and rewrite of the scheme to address it, but we completely take responsibility for fixing the mess we inherited. That is exactly what we have been doing, and that is exactly what we are doing through this debate today.


Senator Carr may never have been the minister responsible for VET FEE-HELP or vocational education, but, of course, he was a minister in the government that did enact the various changes that opened this scheme up. It is important that we recognise the history of the scheme. Senator Carr is right: the idea of having an income contingent loan scheme was conceived by the Howard government, but it was with very tight arrangements in place. It was with a requirement that an articulation agreement and credit transfer agreements were in place with universities and that those universities therefore acted as a quality control measure in relation to the VET FEE-HELP providers.


Senator Carr asks me whether reintroducing any provisions in that regard is something that we would consider in rewriting the scheme. I say to Senator Carr: yes, we may consider that in certain circumstances. I think it is important when we consider access to public subsidy, be that public subsidy directly paid as a subsidy or be it paid indirectly via an income contingent loan, that we consider the thresholds of standards that providers need to meet. In the VET sector we have 4,700 registered training organisations. They need to meet a standard to be an RTO, and that should be a strong standard that gives people confidence in the qualifications that are delivered. But, of course, if you are dealing in public funding then it is not unreasonable that a much higher standard is expected, because the fee-for-service market, which I was talking to Senator Simms about before, is far better able to self-regulate itself in many instances because people are making fully informed value judgements about the service they are purchasing. Whether it is an employer paying for the training or an individual paying for the training, they are assessing the value and merit of that training at the time they part with their hard-earned cash. But if they are not parting with hard-earned cash—because they are racking it up on a student loan or because the taxpayer is paying for it—then, unfortunately, we do not seem to see that same serious, informed decision making by individuals occur before they sign on the bottom line, so we do need to expect, therefore, a higher standard from those providers.


What that higher standard may be in a new model is something that we are open to. Articulation agreements may be a means—I say 'may', in a hypothetical scenario—by which you may be able to access whatever a new VET FEE-HELP model looks like, without perhaps having to jump through other hoops. So you might conceive of a model where that is one criterion of high-performance recognition that could be met that saves you having to jump through or demonstrate other hoops—that saves you, perhaps, from having to enter into a contract arrangement if that was something else that was conceived of. These are all scenarios that could be contemplated.


In terms of the process that may be undertaken and your statement that we will be back here, we certainly will be back here because to conceive of a new model will require change to this legislation. So we will be back here to rewrite this legislation under the terms of a new model. But, before that occurs, I am happy to give the Senate the commitment that we will make sure the approach that will be taken is spelt out in a manner that provides an opportunity for public commentary and feedback and that we will not be just rushing through informal consultations to a point of legislation. There will be an opportunity for informed public comment in relation to what changes may look like, not just through an informal consultative mechanism.


Lastly, I will touch on the comments around a takeover of VET. That is an idea that is encouraged by the South Australian government and the South Australian Premier as part of a grander bargain in relation to federation responsibilities that he has publicly spoken about: enhanced opportunities for the states to pursue options in early learning in return for the Commonwealth undertaking an enhanced role in vocational education and training. I think there is a real problem that the VET sector is seen, all too often, as the poor cousin of the university sector and particularly perceived, sadly, by parents, perhaps by teachers, as students are making their postschool decisions, as being something of the poor cousin. I think the inconsistencies that occur from state to state, the inconsistent policies within states and, indeed, challenges with the VET FEE-HELP system all help to plague those perception problems, whereas, notwithstanding various changes in debates over the time, we have had relatively continuous arrangements and certainty for universities since the advent of HECS. Throughout those decades, students have had confidence with how they access a university place, what the funding support for them will be and, indeed, the quality arrangements that should sit alongside that. In an ideal world, students would have the same type of confidence and the same type of certainty built up in the VET sector over a period of time. 


Whether or not those discussions proceed, absolutely the Commonwealth needs to look like it would be a competent and responsible steward of the sector were we to have a greater role in funding, noting that we already have the primary national role in the setting of qualifications and the regulation of RTOs. Those two responsibilities are already largely nationalised in any event, and it is only the funding and the student support that now have this odd arrangement where the Commonwealth is the primary agent for student support for high-level VET qualifications, in the diploma and advanced diploma space, while the states are the primary provider of support through the certificate level qualifications—yet another complication to the way the whole scheme works. A federation solution might provide a better outcome. Those are discussions that will be had between the Prime Minister and the state premiers, and the questions will resolved through that context, not here. I am very open to making sure that, if they are progressed, we then get a model that works for all qualification levels settled in a very sensible and careful way that ensures we do not repeat any of the mistakes we have seen in this qualification level.

Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (10:38):  I just indicate for the benefit of the chamber that I have been a supporter of a national vocational education system since Paul Keating's efforts. I was working in the office of the Victorian education minister at the time, Joan Kirner. So this has been a long-cherished objective of many—to build a national vocational education system. I understand there is actually a working group; it is not just a question of the South Australian Premier. The vocational education ministers have actually established a working group, and I believe the Commonwealth may well be involved with that as well. 



Senator Birmingham interjecting—




Senator KIM CARR:
  You are not involved? It is just the states? I understand there is a working group, but it will not happen if (1) you cannot organise a proper funding regime and (2) you cannot demonstrate capacity. This is what really disturbs me about these provisions. I am still not satisfied that the capacity is there. I am not criticising individual officers—we have got officers in the box here at the moment. This is not a suggestion about their personal integrity or abilities, but I am just saying that the Commonwealth bureaucracy does not seem to me, at this time, to have the capacity. This is part of the problem we have had with this arrangement, not to mention the problems with ASQA not being fit for purpose.


These proposals that we have before us will provide greater opportunities to extend the reach of the Commonwealth—I acknowledge that—but it is only to the 260 VET FEE-HELP providers. I reiterate that the fact that we have had 18 pages of explanatory memorandum and 13 pages of amendments dropped on us in the manner we have means that one cannot be confident that these measures are going to be able to do the job. The Labor Party will be supporting these amendments, but with a caveat that these provisions have been put together in such a rushed manner that one cannot be certain that they are going to do what the government is seeking to be done, even if we take at face value the minister's good intentions in the matter. 


While I am on my feet, I want to acknowledge the minister's efforts yesterday in calling together a conference to discuss these matters last night. I approached the minister and I indicated that he acted very promptly to at least get a conference of senators to allow us to consider these matters in more detail. I acknowledge that that action was entirely appropriate. It is just that it is not adequate to deal with the questions that we have before us. But it was certainly a better approach than we have seen from your junior minister, publicly announcing these at a press conference and seeking senators to go along with that, without any discussion or opportunity to go through the detail in any manner.


You have indicated that these measures are not intended to apply to TAFE, but that is not the way I read the amendments. TAFE is picked up in these questions. Can you confirm that? While I am on my feet, the second area that I would ask you to consider is clause 36(5), which allows the secretary to suspend a provider's approval. I just want the government's response formally on the record about the secretary's capacity to suspend a provider. There are provisions for the Commonwealth to establish a plan for the provider if there are problems, but the amendments do not seem to allow for the re-crediting of VET FEE-HELP funds and the wiping-out of student debts. Can you please explain to the chamber how it is that students could actually have their debts wiped off, forgiven, under these arrangements, where it is demonstrated that there has been malfeasance by a provider? Thirdly, what is the retrospectivity in regard to these measures for students who can now demonstrate that they have been badly treated and abused? What recourse do they have?

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2015-12-02,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (10:44):  I thank Senator Carr for acknowledging the bringing together of different parties for discussions yesterday. I again apologise for the fact that, having called the meeting swiftly, I was stuck here for half an hour of the meeting because of the proceedings of the chamber. But so be it.


I will answer the TAFE question first and I might need to seek a bit of extra advice in relation to the repayment arrangements. You are correct that the amendments that the government has brought forward apply equally to all VET FEE-HELP providers. That does mean that, in terms of the value of loans that a provider can receive payment for in 2016, all providers will be capped at their 2015 level, including TAFEs. I note that the growth in TAFEs has been pretty astronomical in this space as well. My recollection is that New South Wales TAFE went from receiving VET FEE-HELP payments in 2013 of about $90 million to receiving VET FEE-HELP payments in 2014 of about $190 million. So they have by no means been exempt from the phenomenal rates of growth that we have seen and, I am sure, can comfortably live within the proposed caps for 2016, given the huge expansion in growth that they have undergone. 


It is not the government's intention or expectation that the provisions in relation to payment in arrears or the provisions in relation to pause in payments would be likely to or need to be applied to those TAFEs. There are no foreseeable circumstances where that would arise, given that we think that the administration and the capability are there and that the oversight applied by the state governments is sound enough. I guess there is always a risk that a provider somewhere may undertake some sort of egregious activity and could prompt such intervention, but there is no intention by the government to use those provisions for that category of provider.


Your questions then shifted to student reimbursement and how that applies. I assume, Senator Carr, you are asking about the substantive bill as distinct from the amendments that we are currently debating. The provisions there are prospective so they apply to students who are enrolled in future, not to students who may have been enrolled in the past. It is another sad failing of the way the legislation was structured that there are limited provisions to be able to wipe clear a student's debt and for the Commonwealth to be able to recover payments from providers. Our intention through these amendments is that we will in future have some provisions to be able to do that. I do note that a number of providers, where individual complaints have come forward, have been reasonable and even generous in taking the step of wiping a student's debt, of repaying the funding to the Commonwealth for the wiping of that student debt in relation to a concern or a complaint about the enrolment practices that have occurred. That has probably been the largest category of reason or cause for providers to repay debts to date. But, rather than that being essentially a voluntary activity on the part of the provider, we are looking for it now to be something where, if the Commonwealth is satisfied that a provider has acted in breach of the VET FEE-HELP guidelines in the recruitment or the treatment of a student, the Commonwealth would have the capacity to recoup those payments from the provider and to refund the student to ensure that they are treated fairly in future.

   (2) A credit arises in the *VET provider's *VET FEE‑HELP account as follows:


   (a) if the VET provider is already a VET provider on 1 January 2015, a credit arises on the first day of each later calendar year that is equal to the amount worked out under subclause (3);


   (b) if the VET provider becomes a VET provider during 2015, a credit arises on the first day of each later calendar year that is equal to the amount worked out under subclause (4);


   (c) if the VET provider becomes a VET provider on a day after 2015, a credit arises on that day that is equal to the amount worked out under subclause (5);


   (d) if the VET provider pays on a particular day any part of any amount that becomes due under subclause 45E(2), a credit arises on that day that is equal to the amount of that payment;


   (e) if another body ceases to be a VET provider, a credit may arise:


      (i) in accordance with a determination under subclause (6) at the time of the cessation; and


      (ii) that is equal to the amount worked out under that determination;


   (f) if the *Secretary, on application by the VET provider, is satisfied on a particular day that:


      (i) the VET provider is offering a VET course of study that confers skills in an identified area of national importance; and


      (ii) the course is relevant for employment in a licensed occupation; and


      (iii) one or more students are unable to readily access training places in courses of this kind with any other VET provider; and


      (iv) insufficient credits have arisen in the VET provider's VET FEE‑HELP account for an appropriate number of students to undertake the course with the VET provider; and


      (v) granting an extra credit of a particular amount is appropriate (which need not be the amount specified in the application);


the Secretary may grant a credit, which arises on that day, that is equal to the amount considered appropriate under subparagraph (v).


I support the bill because I want to curb the rorting that is happening in this sector, but I am concerned about the impact of the bill on important and honest operators and training sectors in this country. This bill may have unintended consequences on industry training sectors such as the aviation training sector. The world is experiencing exponential growth in the aviation sector. The demand for qualified commercial pilots is expected to double in the years to come. Australia is considered one of the best providers of commercial pilot training in the world. We have eight commercial pilot training schools in Australia, several of which are based in my home state of Queensland. The aviation sector is highly regulated and unique. Due to the nature of the industry and the growing demand for pilots, the aviation training industry is expensive and in a strong growth phase. It is therefore important that this bill includes a provision for the secretary of the department to have the discretion to provide additional credits to industries and/or organisations which are considered to be of national importance and which meet certain requirements.


I would like to thank the minister for listening to my concerns in relation to the aviation training sector and for committing to support my amendment. It is imperative that we support this sector and that we ensure it is exempt from the potentially harmful, unintended impacts of the bill. We need to ensure that the sector is allowed to grow, that Australian men and women are able to pursue careers as commercial pilots, and that we support an important and growing training industry which provides jobs and economic benefits for this great country, Australia. 


Australian men and women pay a lot of money to undertake training to become commercial pilots. The first stages of training involve undertaking a recreational pilots licence and then a private pilots licence, all of which are funded by the student. These are very expensive courses and can cost students up to $30,000 or more. These courses are funded by students, out of their own pockets—not by the taxpayers. Once students have completed these courses, they can then undertake a commercial pilots licence course, which is eligible for funding under VET FEE-HELP. Commercial pilots licence courses can cost up to $90,000. There is no doubt the level of safety, compliance and risk associated in deliver of the commercial pilots licence course results in high costs. Despite this, Australia is still much cheaper in this area of training than the rest of the world, and people come from all over the world to undertake commercial pilots licence training in Australia.


It is for this reason that I will not be supporting Labor's amendments, which seek to put a cap on VET FEE-HELP for students. The cap will cripple the aviation and training sector and put aviation completely out of reach for most Australians. This means that men and women and boys and girls across the country will no longer be able to undertake a commercial pilots licence training. Only the ultra-rich and famous will be able to become commercial pilots in this country. The pipeline of Australian pilots will definitely dry up. Our airlines will no longer be able to source Australian pilots. Our airlines will be forced to employ overseas pilots. The aviation sector is a unique sector and, unfortunately, it will be hardest hit by this bill. If we look at the aviation training sector we see that most course providers generate less than 30 per cent of the revenue from VET FEE-HELP compared to other providers and industries that generate 100 per cent of their revenue through the VET FEE-HELP scheme.


In summary, I will not be supporting Labor's amendments. I thank the government for supporting my amendments, which will ensure that the aviation sector, and every Australian's dream of becoming a commercial pilot, is not inadvertently damaged as a result of this bill. I commend my amendments to the Senate.

Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (10:54):  I am very disappointed to hear that Senator Lazarus is not supporting our amendments in return for the government supporting his amendments. That is essentially what you have said. You have misunderstood our amendments. Our amendments provide for a discretion but on a more rational basis than the way this has been written up. Our amendments actually authorise the secretary to be able to be provided with the power to set caps, as happens in the university system. We already have caps in place for the most privileged. Your concern is about justice issues. In the university system, doctor's fees are set by the way in which the HEC scheme is administered for medical students, and it is within three broad bands of student contribution. Our amendments would actually allow you to have some discretion, but the amendments moved by Senator Lazarus provide for a carve-out, I presume. 



Senator Lazarus interjecting—




Senator KIM CARR:
  That is what the implication is, Senator—a carve-out. Minister, does that carve-out apply just to aviation? If so, where do I find that in these amendments?

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2015-12-02,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (10:55):  I am very happy to point Senator Carr to the details of the amendments. The amendments amend the government's amendments. We have been discussing this morning the fact that one of the government's amendments provides a cap on the value of loans that a provider may write in 2016 and caps that value of loans at a 2015 level. These amendments provide scope for limited exemptions to that cap. The scope is very tightly controlled, though.


The VET provider, having demonstrated that they are going to hit the cap and not be able to enrol anymore students under VET FEE-HELP must then demonstrate that they are, firstly, offering a course of study that confers skills in an identified area of national importance; secondly, that the course is relevant for employment in a licensed occupation. So just highlight that one, Senator Carr.




Senator Kim Carr:
  I certainly will.




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  A licensed occupation, Senator Carr—a very narrow band in that category. Then, of course, they must also demonstrate that the students are not able to readily able to access training places in courses of this kind with any other VET provider. So if, Senator Carr, you are living in Brisbane—seeing as these are Senator Lazarus's amendments—and you are a student who wishes to study aviation and the aviation providers in Brisbane have already hit their cap in relation to the number of places they can offer under VET FEE-HELP, those providers would be able to make application to the secretary to have that cap lifted for a specified amount—not unlimited, by any means, but a specified amount. This is very much akin to the kind of contracting arrangement for such an extension that you might have encouraged me to contemplate before. So they can make application to have that cap lifted for a specified amount if they can demonstrate that the skill is in an area of national importance, that it is relevant for employment in a licensed occupation, that students cannot access it anywhere else and, of course, that they have hit the cap.


So insofar as this creates an opportunity for exemption to the overall cap, it is an incredibly tightly prescribed exemption that really is only to ensure that we do not end up with the type of scenario that Senator Lazarus has described in his comments, where we had an inadvertent consequence of insufficient pilot training, for example, occurring in Australia.

Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (10:58):  Perhaps you could advise, Minister, whether it is the case that there are a whole range of licensed occupations that might well fit within a designation, if a secretary so wished, of national importance? For instance, what about licensed aircraft engineers or enrolled nurses? They are licensed. We could talk about the security industry. We could even talk about aspects of the transport industry. These are all licensed occupations contained within those industries which could be designated as being in an area of national importance should a secretary in the future choose to do so. Is that not the case?

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (10:59):  Senator Carr, you can draw out the hypothetical of what could be designated as an area of national importance if you wish. Of course, there needs to be some rationale as to why something might be designated as an area of national importance, and the skills demand for such categories would be an obvious area of consideration in such a determination. I think you are mischievously attempting to create fear around Senator Lazarus's very well intentioned amendment, and the well-intentioned amendment is only intended and expected to have very narrow scope. Overwhelmingly, the government expect that the fee cap that we are proposing will apply to the vast majority of, if not all, VET FEE-HELP providers.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2015-12-02,"



Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (11:00):  I do not doubt the good intentions of Senator Lazarus. This is not a point that has been raised by anyone other than you, Senator Birmingham. I have raised the simple question about what happens when you try to do these sorts of things on the fly, overnight, without proper consideration of the consequences. I know what the deal is here. Senator Lazarus has been decent enough to outline it. The government will vote for this amendment no matter how ill conceived and no matter what the technical problems are, which the department knows only too well and the minister knows only too well. The government will ask Senator Lazarus to vote against our propositions, which actually do fix the problem properly in a coherent way, in return for this proposition, which I say is not just for this minister—you might have an undertaking with this minister—but for the secretaries and secretaries to come.


Remember, there is no provision in this bill for a sunset clause. These provisions will stay until such time as we have to rewrite the bill at some point in the future. I think this minister is going to have some trouble getting together a new package within a year, given that we will have an election in the middle of it, which of course is the real question we have before us today. What is the real issue here? Why have we got all these amendments so late? It is because the government wants to close down public debate about these issues in the run-up to the election.


What we have, though, is a proposition, Senator Lazarus, that I do not think meets your criteria but will open up a whole series of other abuses in the future, so I am a bit concerned about that. I do not know if I could support, or recommend to my colleagues to support, such a proposition, given the way it has just been dropped on us now. That follows the pattern that I think we have seen from the government—this colossal amount of new material being presented to us today.

"Simms, Sen Robert",AG,2015-12-02,"



Senator SIMMS
 (South Australia) (11:03):  I also have some concerns about this amendment. I have to say that the assurance of the minister that it is well intentioned does nothing to allay those concerns. I am certainly not being critical of Senator Lazarus here. I understand he is concerned about a particular aspect or potential implications of the legislation and is seeking to address that, but this amendment is very, very broad. The fact that it might have consequences that may be unintended seems to be being dismissed by the minister with a fairly cavalier attitude, saying that it is well intentioned. The road to hell is paved with good intentions, as we know from the scandal that has unfolded within the VET sector.


I very much doubt that, when the Labor Party put this scheme in place and set this train in motion when they were last in government, they could foresee that there would be this conga line of scandals, rorts and stuff-ups that would eventuate. I very much doubt that anyone thought that that would be the case when this was put in place. But this is what has happened, and now we are talking about looking at an amendment that potentially leaves the door open for a whole range of exemptions well beyond the aviation industry.


We have spent the last two days talking at great length about wanting to turn off the tap, wanting to crack down on rorters and wanting to ensure that there is more rigour in this process, and now we are dealing with an amendment which will potentially be opening the door for a whole range of exemptions, and we are being told to just accept that because it is well intentioned: 'Let's just suck it and see how it goes.' That has been the problem with the way that this whole scandal has unfolded. We cannot afford to just go with it on a wing and a prayer. We need to make sure that we have appropriate safeguards in place.


I feel very concerned that this amendment will have unintended consequences that extend far beyond the aviation industry. It is not difficult to conceive of a situation of the government of the day saying: 'Okay, this is something that is of public importance. We've got a shortage in this particular area. Let's loosen some of these restrictions.' As a result, we would find ourselves in a situation of dealing with more scandals and more exploitation of vulnerable young people. I am very concerned about this. I encourage crossbench senators to think very carefully about going down this path and the implications of what we may be doing here as a Senate should this be supported.


After this huge debate, after months of debate within the public and now days of discussion here in the chamber, the community are looking to the Senate to take action and to ensure that, heading into the new year and the new academic year, there are appropriate safeguards in place. I do not want to see any loopholes in this legislation that are going to give potential rorters and shysters a get-out-of-jail-free card. I do not want to see that, so we need to think very carefully about what we are doing today.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2015-12-02,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (11:06):  I indicate that I support the amendment moved by Senator Lazarus and Senator Muir. I think this amendment was born out of concerns that Senator Lazarus has principally in relation to aviation training colleges. There has been a huge increase in the demand for aviation training. Australia is acknowledged as a world and regional leader in terms of high-quality aviation training. The scandals involving a number of colleges have not touched on aviation training colleges—that is my understanding. So that if there is a demand for aviation training, for pilot training, which goes well in excess of the cap that has been proposed, there is a discretion contained in this amendment that does allow an application to be made by the provider that the section needs to be satisfied of a number of particular criteria, including skills in an identified area of national importance, being a licensed occupation and the like. So it gives a discretion to the department to be used, I hope appropriately and rarely, where there is a genuine bottleneck, for a demand for something like pilot training. 


I think Senator Lazarus and Senator Muir are doing the right thing by their states and this will also have a significant flow-through benefit in South Australia where there are aviation training schools. All I ask my crossbench colleagues to consider is that, when Senator Carr's amendment is being considered shortly in relation to the issue of giving discretion to the secretary to cap fees, that it be considered seriously because I see that amendment being in the same vein, in a sense, to allow a discretion but it would not be proper for me to debate Senator Carr's amendment now. I understand what Senator Lazarus and Senator Muir are trying to do. I will support the amendment but I ask my colleagues on the crossbench to keep an open mind to Senator Carr's amendment in relation to that.


No doubt we will have an opportunity to discuss this with the minister. I think we all in this room want to get rid of the rorters, the shysters and the sharks in vocational training. It has turned into a multibillion-dollar mess that is costing taxpayers and exploiting and letting down students who want to do a course and get appropriate qualifications. I support this amendment. I just ask that, when we deal with Senator Carr's amendment, it is given due consideration. I hope I can engage, as I have with the minister on this previously, in a constructive discussion with him in relation to Senator Carr's amendment.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Higher Education Support Amendment (VET FEE-HELP Reform) Bill 2015</title>,BILLS,1,1
"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2015-12-02,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (11:09):  I thank Senator Xenophon, at least in relation to Senator Lazarus's amendment, for bringing some common sense back to the debate. I think we saw a level of scaremongering being attempted by Senator Carr and Senator Simms in terms of  the Lazarus amendment. Senator Lazarus's amendment sensibly provides provisions for determinations on a case-by-case basis. Let us be crystal clear here. It is not a proposal that would mean that for a category of qualification or a category of occupation that there would suddenly be some blanket exemption that applied. It is about a case-by-case basis, that an application would need to be made by a provider who had reached their cap and, in reaching their cap, was able to demonstrate the national interest in extending that cap, the relevancy of the qualification and the fact that the qualification was a prerequisite for the licensing requirements in relation to that qualification, and that they would need to demonstrate the merit and worthiness of the value of the proposed extension of that cap. So the cap itself would in fact just be increased—not lifted by increased—by a fixed and finite number on the case-by-case basis. 


Senator Lazarus's amendment is carefully crafted and ensures that, by placing the cap on the total value of VET FEE-HELP loans across the board that the government is proposing, there is scope to make sure, if there are inadvertent consequences in an area—and he has highlighted, as has Senator Xenophon, aviation as a potential area. I do not seek to prejudge that in this chamber. That is a matter that would be judged under the provisions of this amendment by the secretary to the department or he delegate. I would encourage the chamber to view this amendment as in some ways analogous to the way in which the government has crafted the amendment in relation to the admission of new providers of VET FEE-HELP services. 


The government has not slammed the door shut on any new providers of VET FEE-HELP because we recognise that there are a small number of longstanding registered training organisations who have long delivered high-quality outcomes, who have applications in, and if we shut the door on every single new application then of course we would be acting to the serious detriment and disadvantage of those providers. So we have provided a test to ensure you must have been in the sector for five years, that you can only do it in relation to the qualifications you have already offered and that you will only be able to offer those qualifications and up to a loan value that is consistent with what the fee-for-service value of your operations had been previously.


This is analogous to that in the sense that it is recognising that in applying a blanket rule, as we seek to, in terms of  the application of the cap across the total loan value, this amendment provides very narrow criteria to make sure that we do not end up with circumstances where that is to the detriment of others.


I commend Senator Lazarus for considering the consequences, for bringing this amendment forward and for ensuring that it is tight. I re-emphasise to the chamber, as Senator Xenophon did in his contribution, that this is very limited, that it will only apply on a case-by-case basis, that each one will have to be presented on its merits.


Finally, I take issue with the remarks Senator Carr made in his last contribution that the government is pursuing these amendments overall and our reforms to VET FEE-HELP to somehow close down public debate. Chair, let me assure you and the chamber that the government wants to close down rorting and we want to close down those who are ripping off the taxpayer, who are taking advantage of vulnerable students and destroying the reputation of the VET sector. But we are damned happy to have a public debate on this. We are very happy to have a public debate about the failings of VET FEE-HELP because I think, just like the pink loans scheme,  we want to make sure going into the next election that Australians remember that the Labor Party cannot be trusted to set up schemes such as this, cannot be trusted with public policy and programs because when they are, we end up with disasters like pink batts or VET FEE-HELP where huge sums of public money are squandered and where, indeed, Australian businesses suffer as a result because of shonksters and fraudsters who are let in. 


We are very happy to continue the public debate, Senator Carr. The only reason we want these measures through this parliament, ideally today, is that we want to clean up the mess we inherited.

Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (11:14):  I want to reiterate that this is not scaremongering. I acknowledge that Senator Lazarus is acting to pursue a particular concern that he has, but my concern is that this amendment does not do what Senator Lazarus was seeking to achieve. So it is not scaremongering. I think this is badly worded. I am going to presume that it was written up on departmental advice from the way it is structured, but it is very badly worded and it is wide open for a future secretary to interpret words such as 'national importance' and 'licensed occupation' to be much broader than airline pilots, much broader.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2015-12-02,"



Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (11:15):  On a case-by-case basis. We all know what happens when you have a political problem. A minister in the future—I am not making accusations of this minister—long past this debate will not recall this discussion, will not recall these circumstances and will say to a secretary: 'I want this problem fixed'. A future secretary will be able to go to this clause—and we are talking about the cap on their loans, not their fees, but the cap on their loans—and say 'Oh yes, the case-by-case arrangements demonstrate that this is a matter of national importance and it is towards the employment in a licensed occupation, so this applies to a licensed aircraft engineer or to an enrolled nurse', and a range of other areas can be exempted to fix a political problem for a minister.


The better approach is to go to the question of the cost of the course. What happens here is that you have a loan which then, of course, determines the cost of the course. It is around the wrong way and, of course, this is exactly what has been happening—the fact that you can have up to $97,000 worth of borrowings means that that is where the course rises go to. Whereas the approach that I think needs to be taken, as occurs in the universities, is that you limit the amount of money that a provider can charge the student. That is what happens in universities, and we do that for universities with no great ill effect that I can identify. My proposal allows for the discretion to be with the secretary, agreed, through disallowable instruments so we get to see in detail what it means. This provision is too broad and does not directly meet the criteria that Senator Lazarus, I think in good intent, has sought to present to this chamber in terms of the constituents he is representing in Queensland.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Higher Education Support Amendment (VET FEE-HELP Reform) Bill 2015</title>,BILLS,1,1
"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2015-12-02,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (11:18):  Let me deal with one factual error that is in Senator Carr's argument. He seems to be ignoring the fact that this amendment of Senator Lazarus's is specific to the government's proposal to cap the total loan volume of what a training provider can access. It does not matter what the training provider might be charging for their course under that proposal; the proposal the government is applying is a cap on the total value of the loans that that provider will be able to write. So Senator Lazarus's proposal is for this very narrow, clearly tested exemption to be able to apply.


I think it is scaremongering, Senator Carr, to talk about what a future secretary may or may not do with this provision and to suggest that it might somehow be blown wide open. I think it is also inaccurate to suggest that a cap on fees would negate the need for this amendment. If the government's amendment to cap the total loan value still went through—so think about it here, Senator Carr and others—and, say, your amendment to cap fees went through, but if the aviation college Senator Lazarus is worried about is charging reasonable fees today, and if that were the cap that was set, then you would still have the problem that Senator Lazarus's amendment is trying to fix and address. It is disingenuous to try to conflate the two issues. They are separate issues in relation to how the cap on fees may work and the issue that Senator Lazarus is seeking to fix today.


I understand you want to have a fulsome debate around a cap on fees and, obviously, we will have that shortly. But I think that, in relation to Senator Lazarus's amendment, he is addressing a particular problem that could arise with the government's amendments to cap the total value of loans. The proposal he has put forward is a rational way of dealing with that. The threat of mass exemptions applying is, I think, quite hypothetical and quite unlikely. But, Senator Carr, were it to occur, I have no doubt that the government of the day, the minister and the secretary providing those mass exemptions would be held to account for their reasoning for doing so. With these arrangements where exemptions are applied, they are usually pretty closely scrutinised by all to assess the reason and rationale for those exemptions. The government of the day would rightly be scrutinised as to on what grounds they had determined the national importance of the qualification, and on what grounds they had determined it was right and proper to be able to lift the volume of loans that that provider could offer.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2015-12-02,"



Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (11:21):  In terms of the approach to these matters, could I advise the chamber that the Labor Party will be supporting the government's amendments. We will be opposing Senator Lazarus's amendment to the government's amendments. We will not be proceeding with amendments to schedule 1, given the conversation we had last night, and I accept the advice that was tendered to us last night. I might remind Senator Lazarus that there was some advice on this matter tendered last night, too. We will be proceeding with schedule 1 after item 8 and we will not be proceeding with the third request that is listed on the running sheet.


In regard to the question of containing the costs to students, I will be seeking to argue the case strongly in regard to those provisions about putting caps on the prices that students are charged as distinct from the ceiling on the loans, which has been the government's approach. I am saying that our amendment to schedule 1 is quite compatible with the government's position—it is not inconsistent with the government's position—but it provides a proper and thorough supporting measure to provide the secretary with the capacity to set prices as occurs within the university system at the moment. I will explain how that can be done and done within the period for the start-up date. I know there has been some advice tendered that this cannot be provided within three weeks. I can show how it can be. The advice that I have sought overnight from state officials has explained how it can be done. I believe the advice the government has received on this matter to be incorrect; that there are schedules that are readily available and there are at least two ways in which this matter can be attended to within the three weeks that this government wishes to introduce these emergency measures. I hope that is helpful to the chamber.

There may be scope for some narrower application that just deals with VET FEE-HELP-type matters, which could be an alternative. 


In light of the constructiveness with which we have dealt with some of the issues at least, the government did not oppose your second reading amendment and is willing to work through those issues.

 (Victoria) (11:33):  I would remind you that the constructiveness extended right through this conversation. It may well be that we will have a difference of opinion which we have not abrogated our responsibilities to express, particularly on something as significant as these matters. 


It would be incorrect for you to suggest that the opposition has not been constructive in these questions. These are matters of deep concern, involving expenditure of $3 billion. I just indicate and repeat that the opposition will be voting in favour of the government's amendments, despite our reservations about the speed with which they have been put together; despite our concerns as to whether or not they will do the job that the government intends them to do. Nonetheless, as I think was put to me yesterday, these amendments are a step in the right direction. I think, however, there may well be a broader application required—I trust I am wrong on this, but my expectation that it will soon become apparent that the private colleges will find ways around these measures. I have no doubt that there will be substantial concerns expressed by some private colleges about the way in which these measures are being brought forward without consultation. There may be well be others that claim that there have been injustices imposed on them and, obviously, the appeal mechanisms, which have been outlined, will mean for many people there will not be an opportunity to appeal them. There are no appeal mechanisms, as far as I can see, for students, and the problem within the scheme is that the Commonwealth's approach is to give priority to company operations rather than the welfare of students. With those reservations, we will indicate our support for these amendments.

This is the substantive opposition amendment and this is the only position I am pursuing in regard to the amendments the opposition had foreshadowed because of the subsequent and late series of amendments that the government has put in, which I have described as somewhat panicked and desperate and rushed. All of those things reflect the current situation, which, of course, was presented to us at the very last minute for this bill. They are clearly an admission of what the Labor Party have been saying for some time: the original bill was inadequate. The government has now made crystal clear the point that its own proposals were grossly inadequate, and I have some sympathy for Senator McKenzie's role in this matter as the government chair of the Education and Employment Legislation Committee. The committee's report, presented to the Senate just on Monday night, told us:


The committee therefore commends the bill as a vital reform that will improve the integrity of the VET FEE-HELP scheme and restore confidence in the VET sector.


The report also said:


The committee recommends that the Senate pass the bill.


It is clear that the government did not accept that advice, despite the fact that, if normal custom and practice is followed in this place, the government had actually written the report that the government senators had relied upon. It is a pity they did not tell the government senators they were about to abandon them, because that is what the consequences of these provisions are. On the one hand, the government senators are told to give the scheme a clean bill of health with this particular bill, and then, as my colleague in the other place, the member for Cunningham, said, she was summoned to a meeting with the Minister for Vocational Education and Skills. That meeting took place yesterday at 12.15 pm, and I was on my feet at 12.30 pm. 


With that in mind, these complicated amendments which we have just carried—13 pages of amendments and 18 pages or so of secondary amendments—have been described in this morning's papers as 'desperate', 'emergency measures' and 'urgent'. One report said it was 'a dog's breakfast'. If you look at what is actually going on here, with these are measures they are, in effect, freezing in place the status quo to allow the government time to develop a whole new scheme, allegedly within one year. As I have indicated before, I think the real issue here is to get past an election.


The Minister for Vocational Education and Skills has announced that the new scheme will be in place by 2017. There are no details and no principles. We have probably heard a little bit more today than we have heard at any other time, and I am sure many senators would be familiar with these matters because we saw the government's attempts to deregulate the university sector end in disaster. It strikes me that you have got to have a real leap of faith to think that in a year's time we are going to end up with a fully formed scheme to replace the existing scheme within the vocational education system. So I am a little sceptical, to say the least, and a little cynical about what the government's intentions are here, particularly given that we are running into an election, which, of course, will take a very substantial period of time in any process of policy development out of the political year. 


Labor are proposing one simple proposition here, and the intent of the amendment is simple: it gives the minister an additional tool to control the rorts in the VET sector. It allows the minister, through a delegated responsibility to the secretary of the department, to control prices, as we do within the universities. The minister could seek to fix the costs of all courses or only some courses. That discretion would be available, and of course he would be politically accountable for that. But in no way could we afford the proposition that there needs to be price controls imposed on the VET sector, because what has happened has been an explosion in the costs of VET certificates. We know that because of what is published on TAFE courses, where there used to be fees scheduled, and we now see that the private colleges are charging three, four or five times what a TAFE college had and in many cases still do.


Professor Bruce Chapman, who I know is cited regularly in the press as the great architect of HECS, has called for the controls of tuition fees. He said:


You've got to cap prices otherwise people can really rort the system.


Peter Noonan, who is a well-known advocate probably more on the deregulation side of business, from the Mitchell Institute at Victoria University said:


To protect the system from itself, the government has to move in quickly and regulate prices.


The government will no doubt argue that there are technical problems with this approach and that it will take too long to get up and running. I say to you that that is just not right. We have already determined that the government is seeking to establish a new scheme within a year. This proposal that I have put before the chamber can be done very, very quickly. The original bill sought to bed down changes to cooling-off periods, to make providers aware of new prerequisites and to introduce new requirements for parents of those under 18 to sign loan forms. The department will need to put all those things in place within three weeks. It will need to introduce new systems for students to claim refunds, minimum registration periods and the change to VET guidelines for new penalties. So it goes a bit further than what the minister had indicated in a conversation we had had earlier on this matter as to what is actually required—




Senator Birmingham:
  I was just pointing to the amendments.




Senator KIM CARR:
  in this bill. The new amendments require a number of new administrative activities in determining the loan balance for each provider. The minister has explained they will do that on the basis of averaging eight months' activity applied over the whole year. That is essentially the principle. They will have to determine what is and is not a qualified VET course. They will have to establish a system of payment to providers for payments in arrears and establish a process to suspend payments to providers who have a record of poor performance, although I believe we will have some real issues about determining that record, particularly given the history in the last two years.


I am told that the new amendment allowed us to carve out providers for courses of particular industries, and we have seen that carried today. I am sure the chamber will excuse me when I treat, with some scepticism, the department's claims, which are reflected in the government's advice to us last night, that this would be too difficult, given all these other things. I have sought advice, overnight, from experts as well, and I am reminded that TAFE prices are already published. Private provider courses are supposed to be published. We had experience of one particular college that said it was a model. It appeared before the Senate inquiry, and we asked the question: where are your prices, and, of course, they could not be found. We now discover that the ACCC is still looking for a whole lot of other things that this 'model provider' claimed it had provided.


It is not hard to establish how it could be put in place, given the current regulations to require the publication of prices, and for TAFE that already occurs. There is a second way that this can be done. Our university students are currently charged according to three broad bands of subjects that they study. At university, in this country, the maximum amount that university students are required to pay is $10,440 per year for law, for commerce, for dentistry, for medicine and for veterinary science. It is $8,900 for engineering, science, allied health, agriculture and mathematics. It is $6,256 for education, nursing and humanities. It is not hard. Those models are in place now and have been for some considerable time.


There is another little problem with this question about, 'It's too hard for us to work out what prices to charge.' In New South Wales, the Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal currently reviews all VET courses in that state, and their findings are published for every course in the state. In Victoria, TAFEs charge between $5,000 and $7,000 for low-cost courses such as business or IT. There are fee-for-service courses processes. At Holmesglen, one of the more expensive courses, nursing, is at $20,000; early childhood is $10,000; and disability is $9,000. So it strikes me that it is not hard to identify what the prices actually are. But more than that, where else within the Commonwealth do we allow people to charge whatever they like and the Commonwealth picks up the bill? Where does that occur?


There is, of course, a situation now where we are having online business diplomas with minimum operating cost and people being charged up to $20,000 for them. They are actually more expensive under the VET system now than the price people are charged to do medicine. This is particularly the case when you end up with double-diploma enrolments and the like. That is if people actually know they are enrolled. We have at the moment a cost structure which is way over the odds and has increased to extraordinary levels in the last two years.


My proposal here is that we reduce, not increase prices. We put a price cap in to control the cost of running these programs. You can use TAFE as a model. You could use the university system as a model which allows for the provision of quality training which leads to real jobs and real qualifications and still provides a reasonable profit for private operators but not these superprofits these companies have been getting. They are reliant on government subsidies through this scheme for up to 80 per cent of their revenue. You have to remember that it is not jus the Commonwealth that is tipping into this; the states are tipping in as well.


The government has a responsibility to ensure the value for taxpayers' money. We in this chamber now all accept that there are abuses and that it is better to seek boundaries for the expenditure of public moneys. We protect the most privileged professions like medicine through setting of fees at universities. We have no trouble with that. Administratively there is no difficulty whatsoever. It may well be that those same schedules could equally be applied in the VET sector with very little modification. But it appears that it is too difficult to protect the most vulnerable in the vocational education system— (Time expired)

Senator SIMMS
 (South Australia) (11:54):  The Australian Greens support the Labor amendments. We encourage crossbenchers to do the same. I do not want to talk on this for too long. Indeed, I think my mum would be very unhappy if I didn't make it home for Christmas! I think we are at risk of getting to that point if we continue to debate this, but I do want to make the point that these measures are a really important safeguard to protect students. We do need to have a cap in place to guard against the skyrocketing fee increases that we have seen within the sector. This is an important measure that would provide additional support to students. We support it on that basis and we encourage others to do the same.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2015-12-02,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (11:55):  I indicate my strong support for Senator Carr's amendments. I think we need to put these amendments in context. They simply give the power to the secretary of the department to cap fees. They do not mandate the capping. It is an additional tool in the tool kit to sort out the rorting in this sector. With the Chairman's indulgence, I wish to read a brief opinion piece by Natasha Bita in The Australian this morning which I think sums up beautifully what has occurred here. I think it is worth putting on the record. It is called 'Reform dog's breakfast fails to fix VET flaws'.




The Turnbull government has pulled its punch in the fight against financial rorting by private training colleges.



In a belated admission that its planned reforms fall short, the government yesterday introduced 13 pages of amendments to its own legislation in the Senate.


The result is a dog's breakfast of stopgap measures that freeze the status quo while failing to fix basic flaws in the structure of vocational training in Australia.


Training Minister Luke Hartsuyker yesterday declared he had ""turned off the tap"" of taxpayer funding that will total $2.75bn this year alone.


The government plans to freeze funding at existing levels, to the very same colleges that are pocketing fat profits at taxpayer expense.


Despite two Senate inquiries this year, the government will spend another year consulting with the industry about ongoing reforms to start in 2017. In April, the government banned colleges from offering ""free"" laptops, smartphones, cash or meals, after The Australian revealed how some colleges were bribing students to enrol in costly courses billed back to the taxpayer through the VET Fee-Help student loans scheme.


The current bill, which the government hopes will take force on January 1, would ban colleges from charging full fees upfront, give students a two-day cooling off period and require parental consent for teenagers to take out student loans.


But it fails to treat a financially cancerous system that combines open-ended public funding with poor quality control.


The government must regulate the price of training courses, which have trebled in the three years since university-style student loans were made available to vocational training students. It is outrageous that colleges can charge as much for an acting diploma as a university does for a medical degree.


Until the government controls costs — by capping course prices or limiting how much students can borrow for each course — colleges can continue to binge on public funding while schools and universities go begging.


Well said by Ms Bita at The Australian.


I understand the minister's dilemma here. The minister has had to pick up an absolute mess. Without incurring Senator Carr's wrath, I think there was a complete mess of the system. The way the Gillard government handled this was a complete mess that opened up the floodgates to rorting. I understand the government is trying to do something about it, but for the life of me I cannot understand. I believe Senator Birmingham and Minister Hartsuyker genuinely want to do the right thing. I do not feel sorry for Senator Birmingham. I do not want to say that in a patronising way; I actually think he is diligently trying to sort out a mess that he has inherited. I am sorry that he has that role, but—I say this as a compliment to Senator Birmingham—I think he has easily the capacity to deal with this. I have confidence that he will be able to deal with this. I do not understand why the government will not support Senator Carr's amendments—unless there has been a change of heart.


I do not get it. Why wouldn't you have this sword of Damocles hanging over the head of those dodgy private training colleges where you could say to them: 'We can cap fees. We can go through this process'? You do not even have to use it; simply having that mechanism in place would fundamentally assist the intent of this bill. I commend Senator Carr for moving these amendments.

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2015-12-02,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (11:59):  I thank Senator Xenophon for his very kind words and thank senators for their contribution in relation to this amendment. I think Senator Carr started his remarks by offering sympathy to Senator McKenzie in relation to the Senate inquiry that was undertaken. I think it is important just for the record to be very clear that, yes, Senator McKenzie's inquiry recommended that this bill be carried and the measures within this bill be passed.


Despite the debates we have had on amendments in this chamber today, none of those amendments have, of course, changed any aspects of the actual bill that was presented. They have added to it. They have complemented it. They have built upon it. But that Senate committee was quite right—




Senator Xenophon:
  They are significant amendments.




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  They are significant amendments, Senator Xenophon. They are significant, new and additional amendments, but they are not amendments that in any way vary or undermine the amendments in this substantial bill. So I think Senator McKenzie and her committee did the right thing in arguing for the passage of the bill.


I want to turn now to the particular amendment that is before us, and that is Senator Carr's amendment. In turning to it, I want to reflect on the fact that the arguments that were used particularly by Senator Carr in relation to the government's amendments that were presented in this place were arguments that criticised the government for the timing of the amendments. He quoted and claimed that the timing of the amendments had variously been described as 'panicked', 'desperate' or 'rushed'. I think Senator Xenophon used the word 'stopgap'. Yet, if the government were to now accept the opposition's amendment on this, all of the same arguments could apply. There was no further or earlier knowledge of the opposition's amendment, no further or additional scrutiny provided to the opposition's amendment—in fact, from the government's perspective, less, because we had not seen it until it was introduced into this place. They are not reasons why the government will oppose it. I just highlight the hypocrisy in the arguments that are presented.


But I want to deal with the substance of the amendment and the arguments around the setting of individual course fee caps, whether they are set on an individualised basis or in some type of banding structure, as Senator Carr has suggested. The amendment that is put before us—Senator Xenophon is right—provides the power for the setting of caps without any suggestion as to how or by what means they may be set. Senator Carr made some suggestions in his contribution, which I will touch on shortly, but the amendment does not prescribe in any way how such caps may be applied.


It is important that we remember the diversity of the VET sector when we are discussing this, because in effect the Senate would be asking the government to go away and try to conceive of some process where we would set caps for everything from courses in business administration or marketing to courses in nursing or landscaping, through to courses for pilots or aircraft engineering.


Of course, there are inherent risks that would come if the government were just to trundle along on our own way and set such price caps in relation to those courses. There is the risk of what happens if you set the price caps too low. Set the price caps too low and essentially you will drive providers out of business. You will stop the offering of those courses. You will force state governments to have to increase subsidies to their TAFEs if they are to continue to offer those courses. You risk creating skills shortages in those areas where you have set price caps too low.


There is an alternate risk if you set a price cap too high. The history of price caps tends to be that the market operates at the price cap. So it is not that you set a price cap and people then differentiate underneath the price cap. That is certainly not the experience in the university sector. It is that, when you set a price cap, everybody simply shifts to the price cap. If you set it too high, you will simply drive providers, most likely, to that maximum price and in fact see the prices in some quarters go up. So by virtue of setting a price cap, because people tend to operate at the cap, we know that we would destroy any sense of pricing competition across the sector and simply be, in effect, establishing a government sanctioned price.


To go through the process of doing so would require extensive consultation. It would require additional regulation to be applied not just in setting the price but in relation to the unit structure of courses and having the government try to ensure some consistency of that unit structure across VET courses and the way in which they are priced. So it is not just as neat as discussing the price itself and how that might be regulated; there would be flow-on implications for doing so as well.


Senator Carr has suggested that perhaps we could simply adopt the price schedules of the states or of the TAFEs. The obvious question that flows from that is: which states or which TAFEs? Would he propose that we adopt one at a lower price than some of the TAFEs and some of the states and therefore force those states which are higher than that to lower their prices through their TAFEs and, if they think those courses are operating at a break-even point at present, to come up with subsidies or to withdraw course places? Or would he propose that we set it at the highest of the TAFE rates amongst the states, thereby giving the green light for the other states to simply increase their fees to be equivalent with that new highest level? Senator Carr suggested that, if we set it at the TAFE rates, providers would still be making a profit from their operations. Is that necessarily the case? The states provide various subsidy arrangements to those TAFEs. I do not think you can come in here and simply say there is an easy solution for how this might be done if it were to be done. It is a much more complicated decision that would require some greater thought than is the case.


Senator Carr makes great play of the fact that university undergraduate places operate within this type of price cap banding structure, and he particularly makes great play of medical places in that debate. Most universities, of course, would say they actually run medical places at a loss, so to draw a parallel between how university medical places are capped and the vocational sector would be to suggest that you would have to somehow then be conceiving of another layer of potential complexity in the setting of these caps—if you wanted to follow the medical example set by Senator Carr—and work out how you applied effective cross-subsidies across the different places that might be offered. That is what universities do: they run medical places largely at a loss and they cross-subsidise them with other courses that they run more cheaply. So that argument in and of itself does not particularly hold up.


I would also point out to Senator Carr and to others in the chamber that universities are but one part of the higher education sector and that we do not seek to cap the prices of other, non-university higher education providers. In fact, the universities are the only part of the education sector where the government and the parliament seek to cap prices as we do for undergraduate courses. We do not do it for other higher education providers. We do not do it for those non-university providers. We do not currently do it in VET. We do not do it elsewhere. We are not in the business of price setting, generally speaking, as a parliament, and yet that is what Senator Carr proposes we seek to do in relation to these courses.


He also highlighted the IPART processes that the New South Wales government uses for trying to set efficient prices. Of the various points you make, Senator Carr, that is one of the interesting ones that I am minded to go away and take a closer look at—it was already on my radar, I have to say—as we contemplate where overall reforms for VET FEE-HELP might go in 2017. But that is not a quick process. That is not a simple process. That is quite a detailed, analytical process.


The point that I would make to the chamber is that what we have achieved today—and pretty much all senators have worked cooperatively to implement a series of reforms—is reforms that stop the growth in the VET FEE-HELP scheme for next year. Yes, they are emergency measures, in the sense that they are trying to put an immediate stop to growth, but by doing that they are giving us the breathing space to be able to go away and design a new scheme that can actually deal with the nuances that might be required in trying to drive more efficient and effective pricing behaviour.


The greatest driver of efficient and effective pricing behaviour should be student choices. I spoke before about the way the full-fee-paying market operates and the high-quality outcomes we seem to see through that sector and the fact that that seems to work because people put a very clear value on what it is that they are buying. Somehow we need to make sure that, when it comes to the operation of income contingent loans, people equally are putting a clear value on what they are buying, because they are still buying it. There is still an expectation those loans should be repaid. They are making a purchasing decision, and they should be making that purchasing decision to undertake that course based on the merits of what they are getting as a value-for-money proposition—the quality of the training, the likelihood of an employment outcome. That is the aspiration that I hope we will be working towards in working towards a model for a reformed VET FEE-HELP scheme.


But it would be a crude and likely ineffective measure today for the parliament to simply pass this amendment, which Senator Xenophon accurately said does not mandate that the government go in and applies fee caps. But I have supreme confidence that, in passing this amendment, we would instantly hear from Senator Carr and those opposite calls for the government to mandate those fee caps and that we would be under pressure to do so and under not unreasonable expectation from people that, if the government accepted this amendment, it was our intention to use those provisions. But the government has real reservations about the impact that the use of such provisions for fee caps would have on the operation of the vocational education and training sector. We have real concerns about the administrative complexity of it. 


We do not think the arguments put by Senator Carr today, that there are easy way through this, stand up to any type of rational testing, as I have outlined. And we do have confidence that the measures we have put in place through this legislation, along with other measures that we have introduced throughout the course of this year, will give us a much better-functioning VET FEE-HELP system, will stop much of the abuse, will empower the minister to be able to step in where abuse is occurring and instantly stop new enrolments and new payments to providers, will make sure that we end the rorting that we have seen and will give us time to write a proper new scheme, rather than what this measure would be, which would be essentially to attempt to apply another bandaid to the program but another bandaid that would distract attention and resources from trying to work out how to set a new scheme in place rather than enabling us to get on with what should be the proper policy task of developing that new scheme. So I urge the chamber to reject this amendment, whilst thanking senators for their cooperation in dealing with the overall suite of reforms that we have proposed today.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (12:14):  I genuinely meant it when I said that I think it is terrific that Senator Birmingham is Minister for Education and Training. I think that he does have the smarts and the capacity to do a really good job of this portfolio. But I have got to say the arguments that he has put up against Senator Carr's amendment are so anaemic they are in need of a blood transfusion. This just does not make sense. Let us go through some of these arguments. They do not make sense. Senator Birmingham, the minister, says these are last-minute amendments.




Senator Birmingham:
  I didn't say that was a reason not to oppose them. I just highlighted the hypocrisy in Kim's argument. 




Senator XENOPHON:
  Sometimes if you highlight what you say is hypocrisy—it sounded like an argument against it. But the fact is: we have had to do this on the run. It is not satisfactory. I was prepared to support Senator Lazarus's and Senator Muir's amendment, in terms of aviation colleges, primarily, because I thought that it had merit because it picked up on an unintended consequence of the legislation. So I am prepared to be flexible. I think the opposition has been pretty flexible with a whole stack of amendments that were thrown into the chamber yesterday, and that is why I thought Natasha Bitters' column was very apposite in terms of what has been going on here. This does not mandate a capping of fees but it gives an additional weapon for the government to deal with dodgy providers. It also sends a clear signal. I think that just having this power would, in itself, have a moderating effect on prices. Simply knowing that the government has this power would give some private college providers that are not ethical, that are not doing the right thing, pause for thought in terms of some of their behaviours. We know that the current system has not worked. We know that this is a stopgap measure to try to deal with it, according to Natasha Bitters in The Australian, and I agree with her. 


My concern is if the government's argument is that there will be an expectation for us to do something if this amendment is passed. There might be an expectation but the government still does not have to do it. The government has raised a number of concerns about how it would be capped—whether it is too low or too high. Surely it is up to the government to come to the right decision if, in some cases for some courses, there ought to be a cap. I think that it would give a very powerful signal to those operators that are not behaving ethically, in addition to all the other measures in this bill. So I cannot see the harm in the government having this extra bit of power that it could use, should it decide to do so, to deal with this. Minister Hartsuyker said he had turned off the tap of taxpayer funding that will total $2.75 billion this year alone. I am suggesting that we are not turning off the tap, because the tap is still leaking, and this will give the government an opportunity to turn it off for those courses that are not behaving properly. To have the power to cap is absolutely critical for this bill to work. I see this amendment as enhancing the bill in a meaningful way, even sending a signal to those dodgy operators that they need to be aware that the government has the ability to cap their fees. That, to me, is a very useful mechanism.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2015-12-02,"



Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (12:17):  I thank Senator Xenophon for his remarks, but I do think I need to deal with some of the comments the minister has made to try to rebut these propositions. I do not intend to spend a lot of time on this. First of all on the question of timing: this is an amendment that the Labor Party have canvassed for some time. There have been two Senate reports and two Senate inquiries that led to those reports. We established the first inquiry back in October 2014 and it reported earlier this year. The evidence before that inquiry dealt specifically with this issue and this matter was a subject of that report. I remind the senator of the advice from Bruce Chapman, Peter Noonan and others who participated in the public debate about this question. This is not something that has been dropped at the last  minute. We canvassed this specifically in the second report, which was tabled on Monday, and I have publicly made numerous interventions in support of this proposition. So for the minister to say, 'we only just heard about this' defies logic, as he says.


If we deal with the issue of price capping as a principle, I think this is significant because the government does not actually like the idea of controlling the costs, which is an essential element. There is a very important philosophical difference. We say these amendments are additional measures, insurance measures, for allowing the Commonwealth to contain the costs of vocational education under this scheme. We know that unless you control the costs—and that is what all the education experts point to—you will not be able to contain the rorting that has been going on. So the government's approach has been inadequate because of a philosophical question about the role of the private sector, and this is why it has dragged the chain so much in all of this. The idea that a panacea will be arrived at by student choice has been demonstrated to be completely wrong. Students have very little choice in this because the fundamental premise of the scheme is that 90 per cent of them will not actually ever have to pay back the loans. It is predicated on the assumption of incredibly small success rates. 


The minister suggests that the vocational system is somehow different from universities. Let me tell you, Minister, I am sure you would be aware of this. Your officials will tell you this. There are probably over 10,000 university courses operating at the moment, and they seem to be able to manage with the three broad brands of student contribution being set in regulation. There are in fact 10,000 or so university courses and there are only 6,300 vocational courses. There is actually more activity in the universities, more diversity than in the vocational system. There are 750,000 domestic university students. You say, 'It doesn't regulate in regard to non-university providers.' The truth is that they do not get the level of subsidy so they do not get the Commonwealth supported places subsidies that the universities get. That is all the more reason that you have got to regulate costs of provision. That to me is a really big question, because you are forgetting that in the vocational system there is an additional subsidy that is provided and that is by the states 


They are crying out for this. My conversations suggest to me that states are demanding controls on the prices.



Senator Birmingham interjecting—




Senator KIM CARR:
  They are providing a subsidy. A huge number of VET FEE-HELP providers also get a state subsidy; they are not relying entirely on Commonwealth monies. Why is it that in Victoria probably up to 10,000 qualifications have had to be withdrawn on—



Senator Birmingham interjecting—




Senator KIM CARR:
  Because they get state subsidies as well. When it comes to the question of confidence, Minister, you said the same in March when you announced these changes. Much was said about confidence, and we know that the rorting and malpractice continued.


Labor's amendment is fair, reasonable and necessary. It is necessary to protect the Commonwealth; it is necessary to protect students; and it is necessary to restore confidence. This is where real confidence is required—not by the government but by the public in our VET system. The public needs to be confident that we have reputable, quality provision of training that leads to real qualifications of high standing and real jobs. That is what is lacking at the moment.

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2015-12-02,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (12:23):  I firstly want to deal with the inaccuracy inherent in what Senator Carr was saying about state subsidies. States do provide subsidies in their VET system. Since the expansion of VET FEE-HELP, states have largely withdrawn the rate and the amount of subsidies they provide for diploma and advanced diploma courses. It is important to remember that VET FEE-HELP is only available for those diploma and advanced diploma course. Overwhelmingly, state subsidies are directed to certificate level courses. The VET FEE-HELP scheme is not generally available to certificate level courses. So, in that regard, Senator Carr, you are quite wrong.


Do the states want to see the rorting in VET FEE-HELP ended? Yes, absolutely. Does the government want to see it end? Absolutely. Do you want to see it end? Absolutely. We all want to see it end, Senator Carr. We might have disagreements on how we can best end the rorting that has occurred, but we all want to see it end. But by no means are the states on the hook for additional payments because of the growth that has occurred in VET FEE-HELP. It is quite the contrary: the states have actually reduced their support as a result of the growth of VET FEE-HELP across those diploma categories since the previous government opened it up.


As I have said before during this debate, the primary problem that we have seen in the way VET FEE-HELP has been used and abused is not the case of good, well-intentioned students seeking employment outcomes being ripped off in terms of the price of the course. The primary problem has been the targeting of vulnerable individuals to sign up for courses that they are either ill-equipped to undertake or have no intention of actually undertaking. Overwhelmingly, the government's reforms rightly target the primary problem. We are targeting that primary problem in a range of ways. We are making sure that there are minimum prerequisites for students entering into those courses, so that there will be confidence in future that, if you are starting a course, you are in fact capable of being enrolled and completing that qualification.


Of all of the tightening that has occurred in relation to other enrolment practices that we have put in place, importantly, we are also tightening the ability of providers to be in the system. We have now tightened the value of the loans to stem the growth while we seek to re-write the system and enhance the powers of individual students to be able to seek recourse and get their money back for wrongful practices and enhance the powers of the minister to be able to intervene where wrongful practices occur and to be able to suspend new enrolments and payments to those students. So it is quite a comprehensive reform package. It is a comprehensive range of reforms that are directly targeted to the primary problem of the dubious enrolments that have occurred and the serious malpractice of providers around those dubious enrolments.


Senator Carr, I acknowledge that, on this issue, we differ. That is clear for the Senate and all to see. I want to drive efficiency in pricing across the VET sector, but I do not want to drive out competition in pricing and I do not want to drive out innovation and differentiation in the VET products that are offered. I am afraid that that is what would be the logical consequence of the amendment that you are proposing. That is why the government cannot accept it. As we look to redevelop this scheme in 2017, we will absolutely be looking to find ways to get the most efficient pricing behaviour across both providers and students to occur in the VET sector. But we will not support what we think are measures that would stamp out competition and risk innovation and diversity in the offering that is available to students to help them train and be skilled and secure jobs in the future.



The CHAIRMAN:  The question is that amendment (2) on sheet 7800 be agreed to.

Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales) (12:45):  I rise today to extend an invitation to everyone in this chamber, and to all Australians, to attend a very special event in my home town of Inverell next month. You ask: 'What is that event?' Before I explain, I want to go back 98 years to the battlefields of Belgium and a young soldier from Inverell, Private Alan James Mather.


Private Mather, who was in his mid-30s, signed up on 10 January 1916 and left Inverell two days later as part of a group of men who were to become known as The Kurrajongs. There were 114 men who marched through the streets of Inverell in that muster, responding to the terrible news coming back from the war front of the horrific casualties, particularly at Gallipoli some eight months earlier. It is said that 5,000 people lined the streets to farewell them. The mayor proclaimed: 'It is one of the proudest days in Inverell's history', and The Kurrajongs marched to the Inverell railway station. At the time this was the largest single group of men to leave a country town for war service. The train collected other recruits along the way at Delungra, Warialda and Moree before setting up camp at Narrabri.


Most of the volunteers, including Private Alan Mather, became members of the 33rd Battalion AIF. The farmland, the livestock, the easy-going rural life enjoyed by Private Mather and his Aussie mates were a world away from what they faced on the battlefield in Belgium. His 33rd Battalion became engaged in the Battle of Messines on 7 June 1917. It was fierce fighting involving 216,000 men from Australia, New Zealand and Great Britain. The following day, 8 June 1917, Private Alan Mather, who was from a small property just to the north of Inverell, lost his life when a German shell exploded near the trench he was in. He was one of 6,178 Australians who served in the Ypres campaign, and his name was added to the Menin Gate alongside those with no known grave.


In August 2008—a long time later—archaeologists, who were combing through the battlefields in Belgium, discovered Private Mather's remains of his rifle, ammunition, corps badges and the contents of his pockets and haversack underneath the site of what had apparently been a big bomb blast. An identification disc was found, but was too corroded to provide any useful information. The Australian Army commissioned DNA testing on surviving relatives. The younger Alan Mather was able to put the investigators on to an even closer relative, Cath Mitchell, a cousin living in Armidale, who was aged 96. When I say 'the younger Alan Mather', he is still alive and well in Inverell today. The identification was confirmed, and you could not begin to imagine the emotions of the Mather family when they heard the news.


On 22 July 2010 Private Alan Mather, service No. 1983, of the property 'Flaggy' at Pindari near Inverell, was formally buried with full military honours at the Prowse Point Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery in Belgium. His great-niece, Kim Blomfield, and nephew, John Mather, joined the Chief of Army, Lieutenant General Ken Gillespie, and the Ambassador to Belgium, Luxembourg and the European Union and NATO, Dr Brendan Nelson, in a solemn remembrance ceremony.


The lady who performed the service at the burial of Private Mather, Katie Inches-Ogden, may attend the very function I spoke about earlier. We are having a march on 10 January in Inverell, which is a re-enactment of The Kurrajongs march. That may be attended by, as I said, Katie Inches-Odgen. Another special guest will be Dr Kerry Neale, who is a curator at the Australian War Memorial. She will speak on 'Healing a nation—wounded veterans and family caregiving after the First World War'. Dr Neale will recount the stories of wounded soldiers who returned to Australia shell-shocked, disfigured, blinded and suffering the effects of being gassed.


The committee, headed by Private Mather's great-niece, Kim Blomfield, and ably supported by Ann Hodgens OAM, has organised an outstanding program that will be enjoyed by thousands of locals and visitors alike. The big day, as I said, is Sunday, 10 January, when the re-enactment march will be held. An enormous amount of work has gone into tracking down descendants of The Kurrajongs to participate in the march and commemorative events, and already some 220 people have registered to march. On Tuesday, 12 January a service will be held, as well as the re-enactment, of the presentation of the New South Wales Governor's shield. This is very important as this shield was presented to Inverell for providing the most recruits per head of population in New South Wales during a campaign in 1918.


Today a memorial to The Kurrajongs stands proudly among the avenue of Kurrajong trees lining the eastern entrance to Inverell. Inverell shops will be decorated, and the town is really getting into the spirit of this re-enactment. Yesterday there was a bus tour of some of the points of interest hosted by Ian Small, who wrote The Kurrajongs, a book which is a mixture of fact and fiction. I thank the federal government for its contribution to the event through the Anzac Centenary Local Grants Program and the Inverell Shire Council, Inverell RSM Club and Inverell RSL sub-Branch for their outstanding support. Australians are flocking in their many thousands to visit war graves overseas, and I hope to get there myself one day. One Inverell man retrieved a handful of soil from the Oakwood area just to the north of Inverell and sprinkled it on the grave of an Oakwood man who had been killed in World War I and was buried in St Pierre Cemetery in France. It was his way of reuniting the soldier with the land where he had been born and grown up.


We saw a magnificent Anzac Day this year, the Centenary of Anzac. I remember my late father telling me, many years ago, when he was president of the RSL sub-branch in Inverell that there was concern that Anzac Day was waning, it was fading and people were losing interest. That has certainly not been the case and, indeed, it has got bigger and bigger every year. It is great to see the youngsters participating and being involved in that. 


Next January the 10th, our hometown of Inverell will host the commemoration for the 100 years since the Kurrajongs marched and headed off to war. They were brave young men—many never returned. Many believed they were going on an exciting journey but found the absolute opposite in the battles they faced, and against the odds. I thank those people who have done so much work to organise the re-enactment: Kim Blomfield and the crew of the committee and Ann Hodgens. They have done a wonderful job, well done. We look forward in Inverell to the big commemoration remembrance of the 100 years of the Kurrajongs on 10 January and the couple of days following that.

Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (15:01):  Earlier today, Senator Siewert asked me a question about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander incarceration. The Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody made 339 recommendations and published its national report in 1991. The recommendations covered a broad range of areas, including health, education, employment and justice, reflecting the commission's finding that the overrepresentation of Indigenous people in the justice system was a result of underlying socioeconomic disadvantage. All governments agreed to report on their efforts to implement the royal commission's recommendations. After five years of reporting on that, from 1993 to 1997, governments ceased the annual reporting process. Governments no longer collect or publish consolidated advice on the continued implementation of the recommendations. However, I can report that the last of these reports stated that, at the time, the Commonwealth considered it had implemented all of the recommendations that it supported. However, I am happy to provide a further briefing to the senator should she wish. As Senator Siewert would be aware, many of the recommendations are also the responsibility of state and territory governments.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2015-12-02,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (15:01):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Attorney-General (Senator Brandis) to questions without notice asked by Senators Collins and Wong today relating to the Special Minister of State (Mr Brough).


The first point I would like to make about question time today is to reflect on the disappointment that the standing orders regarding question time were not upheld. Senator Brandis knows full well that there are other opportunities in our program to deal with matters such as those he was dealing with in response to Senator Wong's question. He deliberately and unconscionably avoided responding to her question and used all of the time to avoid dealing with the important matters that were before us. But that is, of course, not the first time that Senator Brandis has done that. He did that yesterday, as I reflected in taking note of answers.


Let me go to yesterday's example, now that I have had the opportunity to look at the Hansard—although, in making that point, I should highlight the fact that his criticism of Senator Wong, whilst allowing himself the opportunity to reflect on yesterday's Hansard in relation to Mr Keenan in the other place, did not acknowledge that Senator Wong had not had that opportunity either. But he should have dealt with those issues at another time in our program rather than—quite unrelated to the standing orders—during question time in answers to a question. Let us look again at the question he avoided answering, as an example. Yesterday, he was asked:


Did the Attorney General speak to anyone else about the execution of a search warrant on the home of Mr Brough? If so, whom did he tell and when?


What is interesting about his answer—once you get through points of order and other distractions that, unfortunately, have been allowed in the course of this debate—is his final sentence. I have to say, his contempt is audacious. His answer was:


I may well have done.


That is it—full stop. 'I may well have done.' He was asked whom he told and when, and his answer to the Senate was: 'I may well have done.' I am sorry, but that is completely inadequate.


We wonder why Senator Brandis is being so sensitive. I think it is quite clear. I think that, for example, Malcolm Farr got it right yesterday when he said:


The personal and political destruction of Liberal-turned-independent Peter Slipper was so complete and vicious it seems unlikely Mal Brough was the only senior political figure involved.


I thought that I would reflect on a bit of history here. I can recall that, back in around 2004 or 2005, Senator Brandis was very keen to claim credit for Queensland preferencing in the Senate election. He was quite chuffed to accept some responsibility there. I remember that, in 2008, Senator Brandis, now the Senate leader, was up to his neck in the Liberal National Party merger discussions and Senate preferencing. In fact, he made himself No. 1—




Senator Heffernan:
  I rise on a point of order. Is there any need to shout? Why do you have to shout?



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  That is not a point of order, Senator Heffernan.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  The point I am making is that Senator Brandis, back in 2008, was up to his neck in the Liberal-National Party merger discussions and up to his neck in the new Senate preference arrangements, and it is very hard to believe that he had no knowledge of matters around Peter Slipper in 2012. Then again, Senator Brandis knows all about metadata these days. We will see what metadata does in fact reveal, unless he has taken Malcolm Turnbull's advice and started using unofficial means of communication. What is the concern here? It is best reflected today, in this case, by Laura Tingle. She says:


As so often happens with such political controversies, the problem for Malcolm Turnbull in the Brough affair is that it is rapidly shattering from one unpleasant political problem into a collection of equally dangerous shards.


I could not have said that better.


What is unfortunate, though, as I said, is how the Leader of the Government in the Senate is treating question time. It is not only him; it is also other government senators, who either seek to portray Labor senators as shrieking or screeching or shouting, or indeed refuse simply—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Shrill.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  Shrill—thank you; I will take that interjection, Senator Macdonald—or simply refuse to answer— (Time expired)

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (15:08):  The Labor Party is plainly embarrassed by Senator Wong's performance yesterday. I want to begin this contribution by saying—




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  You should have told her you're doing this.




Senator Conroy:
  You are a coward.




Senator BRANDIS:
  May I predict that throughout this contribution there will be attempts—




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  Did you tell Senator Wong you were doing this or are you being a coward?




Senator Conroy:
  You didn't even have the guts to tell her.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  You didn't tell Senator Wong you were doing this. You're a coward.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  The Senate needs to come to order.




Senator BRANDIS:
  I do predict that I will be shouted down throughout this contribution by Senator Collins and Senator Conroy. However, I do want to address the matters raised by Senator Collins. Senator Wong asked me a question today in which she referred to an interview that Mr Brough gave during a 60 Minutes program some time ago. There is no dispute that Mr Brough did give that interview. The subject of that interview was what has come to be called 'the James Ashby affair'. Senator Wong attributed some words to Mr Brough in her question and it was not a quote from anything Mr Brough said in that interview. It was not a quote from anything Mr Brough said in that interview, and yet Senator Wong attributed those words to him and stated a conclusion on the basis of the attribution to Mr Brough of words that he did not use. Let me say that again: she announced a conclusion about Mr Brough on the basis of attributing to him words that he did not use. The reason I approached the answer to that question in the way that I did is that Senator Wong did the same thing to me yesterday when she attributed to me words that I did not use and she attributed to Mr Michael Keenan, the Minister for Justice, words that he did not use.




Senator O'Neill:
  The President called it a confession. She told the truth and you are trying to cover up. The Attorney-General is hiding from the truth.



Senator Conroy interjecting—



Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting—



Senator Ian Macdonald interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  The Senate needs to come to order. There is far too much interjecting.




Senator BRANDIS:
  What is being suggested against Mr Brough by the Australian Labor Party is serious, and we know that there is a police investigation, which means that it is even more important than it ordinarily would be that senators who wish to make allegations against him and wish to make those allegations on the basis of his words should quote those words accurately. That is what was not done on this occasion. That was not done.




Senator Fawcett:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Standing order 203 goes to persistently and wilfully continuing to refuse to conform to standing order 197, which you have requested the senators to observe.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I accept that point of order, Senator Fawcett. Again, I ask senators to cease interjecting and come to order.




Senator BRANDIS:
  What Senator Wong put to me yesterday in the second of two questions she asked me is this, and I read from the Hansard:


I refer to the Attorney-General's previous answer to my question in which he claimed not to recall any conversation with the Minister for Justice in relation to the execution of a search warrant on Mr Brough, the Special Minister of State. Is the minister aware that, a short while ago, the Justice Minister informed the other place that he told the Attorney-General the warrant would be executed?


Both of the propositions, both of the words attributed in that question by Senator Wong to me and to Mr Michael Keenan, were wrong. The question that Senator Wong asked me in the first of her two questions was this:


Did the Minister for Justice inform his senior minister, the Attorney-General, of the AFP's intention to execute a search warrant to the home of Mr Brough?


The question was not whether I was informed in relation to the execution of a search warrant but whether or not I had been informed of the AFP's intention to execute a search warrant. Equally, Mr Keenan, when he was asked a question, replied:


After the warrants were executed, as I would normally do in a matter like this, I informed the Prime Minister's chief of staff and the Attorney-General ...


'After the warrants were executed'. The difference between the past tense and the present tense may not be apparent to Senator Stephen Conroy. The difference between the present tense and the future tense and the past tense may not be apparent to Senator Stephen Conroy. The fundamental difference in meaning between the statements that were made and what Senator Wong attributed to the statements that were made is very clear to us. (Time expired)

This is, fundamentally, not the issue. What is clear from Senator Brandis's contribution is that there is not a word in support of Mr Brough, not a word to defend Mr Brough.

It is now abundantly clear that Mr Brough should do the right thing. Unfortunately for the PM, it does not appear that he will. The result is it now reflects very badly on the PM's judgement in both promoting Mr Brough and by continuing to stand by him, in this circumstance. The jury is not out on this matter. The court of public opinion has found against Mr Brough on this matter. Senator Brandis's poor performance in question time and during take note of answers, today, simply highlights the fact that Senator Brandis's defence of Mr Brough was left wanting. Mr Brough does need to make a full explanation of his role in the Ashby affair. However, it is now apparent that in every turn Mr Brough does not seem capable of making a full account to parliament of the circumstances of his involvement in, what is being called, the Ashby affair.


I will address the broad issue, again, which was raised yesterday and also raised by Mr Dreyfus this morning. His note went on to say that as a consequence of the minister clearly misleading the House of Representatives during question time yesterday, and not taking the opportunity of correcting the record in parliament, despite the House of Representatives sitting until 9.30 pm last night, the minister has failed in his obligation—under clause 5.1 of the Statement of Ministerial Standards—to correct the record as soon as practicable. I know everyone in this place takes that role very seriously. At the first available opportunity, if you think you have misled parliament you should immediately take that opportunity to correct the record. We now have a clear indication from Mr Brough that he had to be—literally, it seems—pushed back into the chamber to make another poor explanation of what his circumstances were.



The Sydney Morning Herald belled the cat in this respect. It states Mr Brough said: 




""Yesterday during question time I said: 'In relation to the 60 Minutes interview, what was put to air was not the full question.'



""Mr Speaker, my recollection of the interview was that the question was put to me in a somewhat disjointed manner, and I answered the question without clarifying precisely what part of the question I was responding to.


""This is confirmed by the tape provided by 60 Minutes and that was the reason for my answer yesterday.


""Mr Speaker, I have taken the opportunity to review the tape and transcript, and apologise to the House if my statement yesterday unwittingly added to the confusion rather than clarifying the matter.""


It went on to say that this in itself created the confusion. 


Mr Brough should make a full explanation rather than use those words. What is really telling in all of this that transpired this morning is that the government's Leader of the House, Mr Christopher Pyne, did not try to defend Mr Brough. Instead, they gagged the debate rather than let it run through. This government has a lot to hide and they ought to encourage Mr Brough to do the right thing—more importantly, do the right thing by this parliament—and make a full explanation. (Time expired)

"Fawcett, Sen David",LP,2015-12-02,"



Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (15:19):  I also rise to take note of the answers provided to the questions by Senator Collins and Senator Wong—but I also come to the questions themselves. The Senate is a great place as a legislative chamber for the Australian people. It is a place where we see things questioned and often, through the committee process, legislation improved. 


Increasingly, though, and I guess it has always been thus, it seems there is a very political motive for a lot of things that occur, including questioning, in this place. Having seen the response of members opposite during the Ashby affair, the quiet that has continued up to this point, it comes as no surprise that there is a renewed focus, on this, at a time when the Leader of the Opposition has an approval rating of 15 per cent. He seeks to leave the parliament, to go to France, to try to get some media around his rather unbudgeted approach to climate change that would cost our economy, dearly. 


One has to question what the true motivation is behind the questions from the Leader of the Opposition, in this place, around this issue. It appears, very much, that they are seeking a distraction. The Australian people are far more concerned about where this country is going, about the growth of the economy, the security of the nation, jobs for their children, the health system, the education system, a whole range of things, as opposed to the internal within-the-beltway discussions, here, amongst the political people—staffers, media, members of parliament and the Senate. This whole debate appears to be yet another of these distractions. It appears to be no coincidence that it occurs at a time when Mr Shorten has an approval rating of—merely—15 per cent 


There was a deal of discussion during this about Senator Brandis's answer—




Senator Conroy:
  Mal Brough. His name is Mal Brough.




Senator FAWCETT:
  and I do come back to the point that, when the question was asked about Mr Brough—



Senator Bilyk interjecting—




Senator FAWCETT:
  when the question was asked about Mr Brough—and I hope members opposite are listening to that; that is three times now, or four times—what Senator Wong asked was a question about a pre-emptive statement by Mr Keenan, or advice. And the Attorney-General correctly answered. So the political nature of this comes up when Senator Wong then thinks, on the basis of Mr Keenan's answer, that she has a 'gotcha' moment and, rather than either studying carefully what he actually said or, worse, perhaps admitting the context of what he said, seeks to then embarrass or show up Senator Brandis in this place, who correctly points out that what Mr Keenan had said was about his reporting post the event—two quite distinct events. So Senator Brandis quite correctly reported that.


Subsequently in the question Senator Brandis said that he did not agree with the premise of the question. There was great consternation among those opposite, including Senator Wong complaining that he was not being relevant to the question. Mr Deputy President, can I take you back to 21 August when Senator Wong, in answering a question, said: 'I don't agree with the premise of the question.' And she goes on. There was another time, on 13 September 2012, and in fact it was, funnily enough, an interaction between Senator Brandis and Senator Wong. Senator Wong says: 'Mr President, on the point of order: once again Senator Brandis is rephrasing the question. The question commenced with a false premise. It is very difficult for the minister to be directly relevant to a false premise.'




Senator Conroy:
  Oh dear! His name is Mal Brough.




Senator FAWCETT:
  So that is Senator Wong's own position—




Senator Conroy:
  You've got 45 seconds to mention Mal Brough.




Senator FAWCETT:
  and you can go through time after time where Senator Wong and other ministers have disputed the premise of the question and have continued to provide an answer—




Senator Conroy:
  35 seconds. Mal Brough.




Senator FAWCETT:
  and the President has upheld their right to do so. So all I would ask is that they be consistent.




Senator Conroy:
  30 seconds. Mal Brough.




Senator FAWCETT:
  And for Senator Conroy, who is interjecting yet again, in contravention of standing order 197, I bring him to the point—because he questioned the president about the standing order under which the President can make a decision, and standing order 197(5) says:


The President may hear argument on the question, and may determine it forthwith, or at a later time, at the President’s discretion.


That is the standing order he applied. I would encourage you to abide by it. (Time expired)

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2015-12-02,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:24):  If it were not such a serious issue, this would be extremely funny. Not only today but yesterday we had people on that side in the debate on the motion to take note of answers not even attempting to defend Mr Brough. Today we had Senator Brandis in taking note, and what did he do? He defended himself! What a joke! Yesterday we had Senator Bernardi—he could not defend Minister Brough. And today we have had Senator Fawcett who, after a lot of heckling—and I will admit: it was heckling—finally said the name, but did not go on and defend Mr Brough.


The government know they have a huge problem with Mr Brough. I do not think their memories on that side are so short that they do not remember what happened to their last leader when he failed to take action on Mrs Bishop in regard to her $5,000, 80-kilometre helicopter ride from Melbourne to Geelong. I do not think their memories are so short that they have forgotten that. So we know what happened to Mr Turnbull's predecessor, and I think that, if he was a half-smart man, he would actually be doing something to make sure either that Mr Brough sets himself aside or that he be sacked.


We all know that, with the Bronwyn Bishop helicopter affair, you on that side were all running around scratching your heads wondering why it took so long to make the decision. So why don't a few of you go and talk to Mr Turnbull, now that he is back, and get him to make the decision about Mr Brough, rather than just letting the ministerial code of conduct go out the door. We all know that the ministerial code of conduct gives the Prime Minister the power to make the decision to step Mr Brough aside, just on the basis of the investigation.


This member of the House of Representatives, Mr Brough, had his home raided by the AFP. That in itself should be a warning to those on that side that this is a big issue. This is a big deal. Warrants do not get given out willy-nilly.


I am not sure how long the government is prepared to let this issue drag on. Previously, Senator Sinodinos in this place stood aside, and it was for much less. But it seems Mr Brough is in some sort of protection scheme—I don't know; it is nearly a witness protection scheme.


The Prime Minister needs to start making some decisions based on what is right, because, in the court of public opinion, can I tell you: people do not think it is right that Mr Brough has not had to step aside. We know that the Prime Minister has made a lot of decisions based on possible promises that he made to people to get to the leadership and on who he has to appease. We know that. But he really needs to make a decision.


I am happy to say that Mr Turnbull is a good salesman. I will admit that. But he has got to actually deliver the goods, and if he cannot deliver the goods on the ministerial code of conduct for someone who has so obviously done something wrong—as I said, you do not get a warrant to have your house searched for no reason—and if he has not got what it takes to get Minister Brough to move aside then he should not be the leader.


When the statement was put on 60 Minutes, Mr Brough's comments were unequivocal. But then he got up and he misled the House of Representatives by blaming an editing job. That backfired on them no end, because what is going to happen when you do that? If you have a go at the media, they are going to go back and get out their footage.


I did hear Senator Conroy interjecting earlier and suggesting that maybe Minister Brandis would like to go on Laurie Oakes and try and explain his position. I do not think that is going to happen, Senator Conroy, because I do not think that Minister Brandis will be able to defend Mr Brough any more if Laurie Oakes were to ask him than he could today in question time.


It is interesting to wonder about how the court of public opinion would see this. And can I say that, in the court of public opinion, people are out there thinking, 'It took a few weeks for Tony Abbott to do something about Bronwyn Bishop. Is Malcolm Turnbull making that same mistake?' Yes, he is. He needs to—as I say—sharpen his pencil. He needs to get in there, he needs to be a leader and he need to pull Mr Brough up.

The speeches read as follows—



SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM) BILL 2015


Mr President,


Every time I sit down with leaders in remote communities, they say, 'can't the Government fix things so our people have incentives to work and earn their own money.' 


It's a good question and one that we will answer by passing this Bill.


Remote community leaders are telling us that welfare reliance is becoming the norm and is the primary driver of social dysfunction in their communities. 


In remote communities around one in five adults of workforce age is in receipt of welfare. People in remote communities often move onto welfare payments at a young age and stay on welfare for extended periods – sometimes for life. 



We know that long-term welfare reliance on this scale is detrimental to individuals. In turn, it impacts on health, community safety and crime. Andrew Forrest also highlighted this issue in his recent Creating Parity report stating that 'Nothing destroys family and traditional culture quicker than despondency, dependency and poor lifestyles'.


But, today we have the chance to help community leaders lift people out of the welfare trap: to create the right incentives for communities to work with. 




Community Development Programme



The Community Development Programme (CDP), introduced on 1 July 2015, responds to the problem of welfare reliance. 


It assists people to gain the skills, experience and commitment necessary to find paid work where it exists and enables them to contribute meaningfully to their community in the absence of paid work, through participation in up to 25 hours of CDP activities five days a week. 


There is now a broader, more flexible range of CDP activities that people can participate in to meet their activity requirements. Activities are now useful to the community and job seekers and can include: vocational training; work preparation and foundation skills such as language, literacy and numeracy training and obtaining a driver's licence; programmes to address pre-employment barriers such as drug and alcohol problems; and community activities such as volunteering at the school canteen and supporting older people. 


CDP also includes employment incentives and support to establish small businesses. 


These incentives include $25 million per year to support the development expansion of remote organisations; support to provide hosted placements which provides job seekers real workplace experience; and support for employers to encourage them to employ job seekers.


CDP is already showing steady progress. We have seen a 50 per cent increase in job seekers placed into activities since the start of CDP with around 66 per cent of eligible job seekers now placed in activities.




Problems



Notwithstanding these changes, the evidence shows that further reforms to the income support system is required for remote communities to drive the behavioural changes needed to get people active, off welfare and into work.


Feedback is regularly received from CDP providers that current compliance arrangements are failing them and their communities. 




They argue that current incentives need to be strengthened to support individuals to move off income support and into work. 




This is a particular issue given the nature of the job market in remote Australia, in which intermittent casual or part-time work is often the only type of work available.


We need to make sure the social security system is geared to encourage job seekers to readily take up this work.



Additionally, the national compliance framework is designed to re-engage job seekers in their mutual obligations and is simply less effective when applied in remote Australia. 


Community leaders and jobs providers often remind me of the positive elements of the previous Community Development Employment Project (CDEP) in remote Australia. 



One correspondent reflected, and I quote, ""Non-compliance activities and attendance were quickly resolved within a day, engaging community participants quickly back into their activity. This can now take over 2 to 8 weeks, penalties through Centrelink are causing disengagement, which leads to alcohol, drugs, family violence, children non-attendance at school, crime and so on"".


As that correspondent points out, current payment and compliance arrangements are complex, and lack both agility for those trying to apply the rules and immediacy for those on the receiving end.


Consider that a five week period can occur between when a financial penalty is imposed for not attending work and the penalty hits the hip pocket. 


As a result, remote job seekers do not get the link between attending activities and receiving income support. Young people in particular don't see the link between Centrelink money and giving back to community through activity. 


This undermines the effectiveness of the compliance system


And it's complex and confusing for individuals. 


Delays in applying compliance lead to 'flood and famine', where job seekers' income can vary from fortnight to fortnight with little understanding of the reasons behind the variations. Obviously, this makes family and community budgeting harder. 




Bill



This Bill gives effect to measures that are designed to address these problems. The Bill creates a new income support payment and compliance arrangements for individuals living in remote Australia who are eligible for activity tested income support payments including Newstart, Youth Allowance, Parenting Payment, Disability Support Pension and Special Benefit. 




Payment and activity arrangements



Individuals on remote income support payments will no longer be subject to the National Job Seeker Compliance Framework. Instead, a simpler, more tailored compliance framework will apply.


Eligibility for income support, the level of income support and the level of activity requirements is unchanged. 


Responsibility for receiving, processing and determining claims for a job seeker's payment as well as assessing eligibility and capacity to work will remain with the Department of Human Services (DHS). DHS will also continue to fully administer other payments such as Family Tax Benefit and income management.


Income support payments for remote job seekers, however, will be made regularly every week by CDP providers on the ground instead of fortnightly at arm's length by Centrelink. 


CDP providers will be permanently based in remote regions and be accessible and able to support the nature of the payments.




Job seeker compliance arrangements 



CDP providers will be able to apply an immediate financial penalty to each job seeker for every day they do not attend activities. 


I will work with communities and CDP providers to ensure the detailed arrangements are appropriate before implementation via a disallowable instrument. 


This will enable the application of penalties on a weekly basis, with the maximum daily penalty equivalent to a day's remote income support payment. There will be greater flexibility within this maximum penalty though. Penalties will not be limited to only a full day but instead will allow providers to reduce an hour's payment for an hour's non-attendance – lessening the financial burden on the job seeker while maintaining the behavioural impact. 


This will strengthen the link between attending activities and receiving income support and, as proven in past programmes, will promote work-like behaviour. 


The instrument will also provide arrangements to ensure job seekers with a reasonable excuse for not attending an activity, such as illness or cultural business, are not penalised. 


In addition, a new community investment fund will be established to enable funds that have been withheld as a result of compliance penalties to be put back into communities to assist local economic and community development initiatives and programs. This will be delivered through the Commonwealth's Indigenous Advancement Strategy.


To summarise, weekly payments and a new, simplified and tailored compliance framework administered by locally based CDP providers, who know and understand the job seeker and the community will result in more immediate and easier to understand compliance arrangements. 



New income thresholds to drive employment



In addition to the compliance framework, we are also setting new income thresholds to drive employment in remote Australia.


Full-time work is always the goal, but the reality in remote Australia is that casual, seasonal and part-time work is often the option. There is little incentive for remote job seekers to take up this work because currently an individual's income support tapers off after earnings greater than around $100 per fortnight. So the current system means that often this short term work is done by fly in fly out workers. To increase incentives to take up casual and intermittent work when and where it's available, these new measures would allow job seekers in remote income support regions to earn up to the equivalent of minimum wage before their income support reduces. 


Increasing the income thresholds means that individuals will not be penalised through a reduction in their income support. If a job seeker undertakes paid work instead of attending their work for the dole activities, they would receive less income support (as penalties are applied) and receive more real income. With low complexity in the system, job seekers will be able to seamlessly move between CDP activities and intermittent and casual employment. This measure reflects the on-the-ground reality in remote Australia.


The new arrangements under this Bill will be phased, in order to ensure the settings are correct. They will be introduced initially in up to four regions and following extensive community consultation. CDP providers will be consulted in the development of supporting systems and processes, and to ensure that the selected providers are ready to implement the revised arrangements. Further regions would be progressively added, based on community readiness and provider capability. 




Conclusion



Improving the lives of Australians is the nuts and bolts work of this Parliament. Even if you haven't experienced it personally, you know that the problems in remote communities are acute, immediate and unique. 


This proposed Bill answers the concerns of CDP providers and community leaders and is an important next step in helping communities put an end to welfare reliance and the resulting social dysfunction. 


I commend the Bill to Senate


 


COURTS ADMINISTRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2015


The Courts Administration Legislation Amendment Bill, will merge the corporate services functions of the Federal Court of Australia with those of the Family Court of Australia and the Federal Circuit Court of Australia, and bring the courts together as a single administrative entity. 


But in doing this, the Bill will set the scene for achieving a vital public policy outcome: placing the courts on a sustainable funding footing over the longer term, leaving them far better placed to deliver services to litigants. This is because savings arising from the efficiencies will be reinvested in the courts. This is an important point. These are not savings to be extracted and returned to Government. Savings will be retained by the courts to benefit the courts.


As the Bill solely deals with the administration of the courts, it will have no impact on the judicial and functional independence of each court. The Bill maintains and supports the separate standing of each of the courts concerned.




The imperative to merge corporate services



The merger of the courts' corporate services was central to the package of measures announced by the Government as part of its 2015-16 Budget Streamlining and Improving the Sustainability of Courts. 


The pressing need for efficiencies forecast from the merger is manifest. The Family Court and Federal Circuit Court, in particular, are facing significant budgetary pressures and ongoing deficits. The serious financial circumstances of the family courts triggered the need for the Government to consider and implement this reform.


The community understands the fundamental importance of the courts' independence and impartiality to ensure integrity and transparency in the judicial system. However, the community also demands the efficient and effective use of taxpayers' funds, particularly in the current tight fiscal environment. All arms of government are currently expected to operate within these constraints. 


Constitutional protections, of course, are in place for the courts to preserve the separation of powers and ensure their independence. Appropriately, however, the Executive Government and the Parliament retain oversight of the courts' operating budgets.


At the time of the Budget, the family courts were projecting over $44 million in operating losses over the forward estimates. The Government could not allow these losses to continue unabated. 


Without the merger implemented by the Bill, alternative and much less palatable measures would need to be explored to allow budgets to be met. Because access to the courts is a fundamental tenet upon which our justice system is based, the Government was anxious to ensure budget rectitude did not result in frontline court services being cut.


The performance, funding and operation of the courts has been considered in many reviews and reports. These provided a strong evidence base for the Government's decision.


The 2012 Skehill Strategic Review of Small and Medium Agencies in the Attorney-General's Portfolio considered there was merit in the idea of amalgamating the corporate services functions of the federal courts.


Most recently, amalgamation was recommended by the 2014 National Commission of Audit Report, Towards Responsible Government, and the 2014 KPMG review into the performance and funding of the federal courts. 


The KPMG review also highlighted the necessity to address the unsustainable financial position of the federal courts as it found that the courts were on track for a deficit of almost $75 million by 2017‑18. 


Further independent analysis conducted by Ernst & Young in 2015 identified potential savings and efficiencies to be gained from a merger model.


Merging the courts' corporate functions is projected to deliver efficiencies to the courts of $9.4 million over the six financial years to 2020-21 and result in ongoing annual efficiencies of $5.4 million from this time.


In turn, this will create potential for further organisational agility through economies of scale and improvements in the long term financial sustainability of the courts.


Importantly, the savings and ongoing efficiencies generated are to be reinvested into the federal courts to support the delivery of their core business of providing justice for Australian litigants.




Corporate services efficiency



Currently, the Family Court and Federal Circuit Court maintain separate corporate administrative structures to the Federal Court. More effective and efficient services will be delivered through the sharing of financial, human resources, information technology, property and operational corporate services.


There is increasing recognition that, although courts are specialised institutions, they share characteristics with other large public organisations with many staff and large systems. 


Courts' administration, therefore, can benefit from increased collaboration, organisational streamlining and centralised corporate services, within appropriate frameworks. 


With ever-growing caseloads and the current tight fiscal environment facing all arms of government, more efficient administration provides scope to relieve some of the administrative burden on our federal courts. 


This is consistent with Government's commitment to reduce inefficiencies in public administration by removing unnecessary duplication.


Staff of the single administrative entity will have new opportunities to share their knowledge and expertise with a larger group of colleagues.


Working groups consisting of key corporate services representatives from each court have already been established, collaborating to complete the essential implementation planning for a 1 July 2016 commencement.




Merged model and maintaining courts' independence



The Bill is directed to the organisation and administration of the courts. It, of course, maintains the protection of the judicial and functional independence of the courts in accordance with the Constitution, while promoting their effective management.


Access to justice for court users will not be affected. Each court will maintain its separate and distinct judiciary, with no changes made to the courts' jurisdiction. Therefore, there will be no loss of family law or general federal law expertise across the courts.


The Bill consists of a carefully designed governance structure to preserve the autonomy of the heads of jurisdiction in relation to their own courts. Heads of jurisdiction will retain responsibility for managing the administrative affairs of their respective courts (excluding corporate services).


The separate and independent standing of each court will be further supported through replacing the position of joint Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Family Court and Federal Circuit Court with separate CEOs for each court. This will ensure each head of jurisdiction has a dedicated CEO to assist in managing the administrative affairs of their respective court.


To facilitate this amalgamation, the courts will be designated as a single entity under the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 (the finance law) and a single statutory agency under the Public Service Act 1999 from 1 July 2016.


The Bill will place control of corporate services in the hands of the Federal Court CEO. The Federal Court CEO will also hold the roles of accountable authority under the finance law and agency head under the Public Service Act. 


This does not mean that the Federal Court will be 'taking over' the running of the Family Court and Federal Circuit Court. Each court will remain independent in their core functions and will not be subject to the control of another court.


The Federal Court CEO's pivotal role in delivering shared corporate services is key to generating the expected savings from the amalgamation. Mr Warwick Soden OAM, renowned for his sound financial management, will continue in the role. 


Mechanisms exist in the Bill to ensure consultation between the Federal Court CEO and heads of jurisdiction and the other CEOs for decisions relating to corporate services matters.


The Bill contains provisions to ensure the Federal Court CEO makes relevant delegations to the Family Court CEO and the Federal Circuit Court CEO, in relation to the administrative affairs of their respective courts. The Federal Court CEO will be under a general statutory duty to ensure the other two CEOs have the necessary powers and functions to fulfil their roles.


Further detail in relation to these matters will be set out in a Memorandum of Understanding between the courts.


The Bill also contains provisions to safeguard the allocated budget of each court within the single administrative entity. 


Merging the courts into a single administrative entity with shared corporate service is not a new idea. In many ways, it is consistent with the historical administration of the courts by the Attorney‑General's Department prior to the courts becoming self‑administering in the latter part of the last century. This is still the approach taken in many state jurisdictions.


There is an important difference: the corporate services to be provided to the courts are to be provided by a court and not a government department. It is entirely consistent with the Government's view that the courts, as an entity, are self‑administering within the legislative and budgetary obligations placed on government entities.




Key features of the Bill



Schedules 1 to 3 of the Bill will facilitate the establishment of the single administrative entity under the finance law through amendments to the legislation governing the Federal Court, Family Court and Federal Circuit Court.


Schedule 1 of the Bill amends the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 to support the merger. It provides for the courts to become a single entity under the finance law and a single statutory agency under the Public Service Act. 


Powers and functions relevant to the finance law and the Public Service Act, including appointment powers, are centralised in Schedule 1. These powers are given to the Federal Court CEO, with delegations to be given to the other CEOs in relation to the administrative affairs of their respective courts. The position of the Federal Court CEO will be retitled.


The Bill clearly delineates what is within corporate services and these items are excluded from the administrative affairs of the courts. Corporate services are defined as including communications, finance, human resources, information technology, library services, procurement and contract management, property, risk oversight and management, and statistics. Critical security functions will remain within the administrative affairs of the courts.


Schedule 2 and 3 of the Bill contain amendments to the Family Law Act 1975 and the Federal Circuit Court of Australia Act 1999, respectively, to support the changes, including defining corporate services and repealing provisions that will be centralised in the Federal Court Act. 


A separate position of Federal Circuit Court CEO will be established and the position of Family Court CEO retitled, to effect the separation of this role into a CEO for both courts. Each CEO will also hold the position of Principal Registrar, with the combined Family Court CEO and Principal Registrar role to take effect from 1 January 2018. 


Schedule 4 of the Bill amends the Native Title Act 1993 to reflect the amalgamation and update references to position titles. 


Schedule 5 of the Bill consists of consequential and other amendments to a number of Acts to change and update relevant titles and references.


Schedule 6 of the Bill provides for transitional arrangements to ensure the courts can continue their administrative and corporate services functions without disruption at the date of the merger. There is also a rule making power to respond to further areas where clarity in transitional arrangements is required.




Conclusion



The Courts Administration Legislation Amendment Bill signals a significant reform in the approach taken to the management and administration of Australia's federal courts.


The merger will facilitate not only short term savings but also substantial scope for longer term efficiencies, all to be reinvested in the courts to ensure their financial viability. The Bill implicitly upholds the key features underlying our federal courts system, such as independence and impartiality. 


As a lynchpin to ensuring the financial sustainability of the federal courts into the future, the merger will enable the courts to continue to deliver core judicial services to litigants without compromising access to justice.


Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of these bills be adjourned to the first sitting day of the next period of sittings, in accordance with standing order 111.


Ordered that the bills be listed on the Notice Paper as separate orders of the day.




Senator SCULLION:
  I seek leave to make a short statement in regard to the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Community Development Program) Bill 2015


Leave granted.




Senator SCULLION:
  In remote communities around one in five adults of working age are in receipt of welfare. Many people start on welfare at a young age and stay on it for long periods of time, often for life. When I sit down with leaders in remote communities, they say, 'Can't the government fix things so our people have incentives to work on and earn their own money.' We know that long-term welfare reliance impacts on health, safety and wellbeing. The bill creates a new employment support payment, with a simpler, more tailored compliance framework. Eligibility for income support, the level of income support and the level of activities required is unchanged.

It delivers the greatest rate of subsidy to those who earn the least, while targeting more hours of subsidy to those who work the most.

The PRESIDENT:  So included.




Senator LINES:
  I, and also on behalf of Senators Peris and Siewert, move:


That the Senate notes that:


(a) support to 'Close the Gap' on health has been a bipartisan commitment;


(b) the World Health Organization has declared incidents of ear disease in communities in Western Australia and the Northern Territory to be a 'massive health problem', with the number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in remote community suffering with middle ear infections to be as high as 93 per cent;


(c) the relationship between hearing loss and early interaction with the justice system has been recognised by Indigenous health experts;


(d) the Western Australian Minister for Health, Mr Hames, has, during the week beginning 29 November 2015, cancelled the Government funding of the Telethon Speech and Hearing's Ear Health program, an Aboriginal children's ear clinic based in Perth, despite its rating of 'outstanding' in an independent review; and


(e) to achieve progress toward closing the gap across Australia, governments at all levels must recognise the importance of adequate funding for ear health services for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children.


I seek leave to make a short statement.



The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator LINES:
  This motion arose because of a snap decision of the WA Barnett government to close the ear service that is run by the Telethon Kids Institute in Western Australia. It is run primarily to pick up hearing difficulties for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. It has an outstanding reputation. It works well, right across the state, and yet, without warning, it has had its funding cut. This is a backward step, given that we are not meeting the targets on Close the Gap.


I would hope that the minister in here, Minister Scullion, speaks urgently to the Western Australian government about their intentions and why they have closed this outstanding service that is of absolute importance to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. I would urge all in this chamber, particularly the Western Australians, to take this matter up directly with Premier Barnett.

  I asked to be joined to this motion because it is so important. People may remember that the Community Affairs References Committee did a report on hearing services in Australia. We had a whole chapter on hearing services for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. We know very clearly the links with the issue that we have just been talking about. I have another motion on the links between hearing and incarceration. For example, the last information that became available on the hearing of Aboriginal prisoners in incarceration in the Northern Territory and in the Darwin Correctional Centre was that around 90 per cent of Aboriginal prisoners had some form of hearing impairment. The link is really clear, which is why we are so passionate about making sure we are addressing hearing, particularly of Aboriginal children. We know the life impacts that it has if we do not address these issues.



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Peris, you can seek leave. It is up to the Senate, but there has been a strong recommendation that there be only one speaker per party during this time. In fact, the Procedure Committee some time ago indicated that this is normally for the discovery of formal business and no debate or speeches should be made, but there has been this tolerance for some time.

  I table an explanatory memorandum and seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave is granted.




The speech read as follows—



RESTORING TERRITORY RIGHTS (ASSISTED SUICIDE LEGISLATION) BILL 2015


In 1997, Kevin Andrews succeeded in pushing a private member's Bill through Federal Parliament. It overturned the first legislation permitting assisted suicide in Australia, enacted in the Northern Territory.


Since then, not only does assisting someone to commit suicide remain a serious crime in all States, it is also a crime in the Territories. Three states have life imprisonment as the maximum penalty, while in others the maximum penalty varies from 5 to 25 years.


This is extraordinarily cruel. The denial of the right to die at a time of our choosing can result in a lingering, painful death. It is also at odds with the fact that we have both a fundamental and legal right to choose whether we wish to continue living.


It's important to state this clearly, because people forget suicide was once illegal and failed attempts often led to prosecution.


In Medieval England, suicides were denied a Christian burial. Instead, they were carried to a crossroads in the dead of night and dumped in a pit, a wooden stake hammered through the body to pin it in place.


But punishment did not end with death. The deceased's family's belongings were handed to the Crown. This remained the case until 1822. The suicide of an adult male could reduce his survivors to pauperism.


From the middle of the 18th century there was a softening of public attitudes towards suicide. While it is obviously still an occasion for sadness, there is also a recognition that people do not belong to their families or to the government. An individual may have good reasons to take his or her own life.


But there is a catch. The law says we are only permitted to die by our own hand, without assistance. Indeed, in three states, reasonable force can still be used to stop a person from committing suicide. And if we are too weak or incapacitated to end our lives ourselves, we are condemned to suffer until nature takes its course. It is a serious offence for anyone to either help us die – or even to tell us how to do it for ourselves.


One of the consequences of this is that it can compel people to end their lives sooner than they would like. Understandably, people prefer to avoid the risk that they will become incapable of committing suicide themselves.


There is no better marker of individual freedom than the ability to decide what to do with our own body. If the law prevents us from making free choices about it, then we are not really free at all; our bodies belong to the State.


Legalisation of assisted suicide is long overdue in Australia. Opinion polls show more than 80% of Australians are in favour, across all political parties. It is high time governments accepted that on this deeply personal matter, their intrusion is not warranted.


Despite what some people think, this is not about bumping off granny to inherit the house. Assisted suicide is simply helping someone to do something that they would do for themselves, if they were not so ill or feeble. The absolutely essential element is voluntary consent, which is emphatically not merely implied consent or acquiescence.


Of course, consent must be verified. Medical practitioners are no better qualified than anyone else to confirm this, but clearly the decision must be genuine. One of my concerns with Senator Di Natale's Medical Services (Dying with Dignity)Bill 2014– although I support its general intent – is that it over-medicalises the process, giving too much power to doctors. 


In the short term at least, the easiest way to smooth the path to legalising assisted suicide would be the repeal of the Euthanasia Laws Act1997 – the 'Andrews Act' I referred to earlier. It removed the power of the ACT, the NT and Norfolk Island to legalise assisted suicide, with a specific focus on repeal of the Northern Territory's law.


While it is not feasible simply to reinstate the Northern Territory act, repeal of the Andrews Act would send a signal to States and Territories that their legislatures may now turn their attention to this issue. As a bonus, it would support competitive federalism in law making. For too long, the Commonwealth has waded into areas that are properly the business of the states.


To that end, this Bill repeals the Euthanasia Laws Act1997 as well as repealing the specific provisions that were inserted by that Act into the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 and the Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act 1978 to prevent the Territories from legislating on assisted suicide. Because it isn't desirable to bring the Rights of the Terminally IllAct (NT) 'back from the dead', this Bill also ensures it remains inoperative. Should my Bill be passed, the Northern Territory Parliament will have to revisit the issue.


Given that the Rights of the Terminally IllAct (NT) was enacted 20 years ago, this is probably the best way forward – it is highly likely the Northern Territory Parliament will be able to enact an improved law.


I commend the Bill to the Senate.




Senator LEYONHJELM:
  I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

That the Senate—


(a) notes that more than 90 per cent of teaching students met benchmark literacy and numeracy standards in an exam trialled by the Federal Government to ensure universities are preparing teachers to the highest possible standard; and


(b) calls on the Government, through its focus on research and innovation, to:

(ii) ensure universities are accountable for all graduates meeting national professional standards for teachers.


I seek leave to make a short statement.



The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one  minute.




Senator WANG:
  I always had the highest respect for our teachers because teachers are engineers. Teachers are builders of the foundation of our country's future prosperity. Teaching quality directly determines the quality of education our kids receive. This is why the findings from the literacy and numeracy exam trialled by the federal government are alarming. I welcome the fact that the government is embracing research and innovation, and I urge the government to look into how our teaching quality can be improved as well as how our teaching can be innovative not only in what we teach but also in how we teach.

Last week the UK confirmed their program of 138 jets and will procure JSF earlier than planned. The government is committed to acquiring a fifth-generation JSF aircraft and the significant opportunities it provides for Australian industry and suspects that this is another deal whereby a vote in the Senate is being used for other purposes.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (16:12):  What we have in those who sit on the other side of this chamber is a government that is uncaring, a government that wants to hit the lowest paid in this country, a government that has a plan to introduce a GST of 15 per cent on the low-paid in this country. The government has had that plan since it came to government and it is doing it at the behest of big business.


You cannot trust this government. Go back and look at the last election, when this government promised so much to the Australian people and where it said that it would not do certain things. But, as soon as it came to government, it set about ripping at the pension and ripping at social welfare and trying to take the rights away from working people in this country. The government took $80 billion out of education and health. It had the rhetoric of 'lifters and leaners'. So if you got some support from government, no matter how well deserved, you were a leaner and you had to make your way as an individual. All the privileged people on the other side of this chamber, who come from privileged backgrounds, do not know what it is like to not be able to put food on the table for your family and do not understand what it is like to struggle to pay your mortgage.


It is quite clear why the National Party are so upset about this. The National Party should actually be standing up for poor people because poor people, as a percentage of the population, reside more in National Party seats than they do in other seats. Yet the National Party said absolutely nothing when that first budget was brought down. They just acquiesced to the ideology of the Liberal Party. They were in the true saying of how they are described here. They were the real doormats of the Liberal Party. The Liberal Party wiped their feet all over them in relation to that first budget. There was $80 billion taken out of health and education. Why was that $80 billion taken out? It was because they had a plan that they wanted to force the states to push for a GST. That part of their plan worked because some state premiers are saying, 'How do we get any extra money unless we have a GST?' The reason that they are arguing for a GST is that that rotten mob over there took $80 billion out of health, out of education and out of resources for state governments in this country.


They wanted to impose $7 on the poorest people in this country every time they went to see a doctor. They did not tell the public that when they went to the election. They wanted to increase the PBS. Every time you got a prescription you were going to pay more. They cut the pension. They cut the rate at which the pension would increase, which was an effective cut to the pension in this country, so retirees lost some of their benefits. Pensioners on the pension lost some of their pension. People on family tax benefit B lost money when their children turned six.




Senator Canavan:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order on relevance. This is actually a topic picked by the Labor Party, but Senator Cameron cannot seem to stick to the topic in seven minutes. It is such a weak matter of public interest that he cannot do that.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Williams
):  Senator Canavan, there is no point of order. That is a debating issue.




Senator CAMERON:
  I can clearly understand why Senator Canavan would want to shut this discussion down. Senator Canavan purports to represent low-income people, but every action that Senator Canavan has taken in here rips away at the living standards of low-income people. What I am trying to say here is that they are a government that cannot be trusted, so, when they stand up and say there is no GST there, there is a GST of 15 per cent waiting there.


Peter Hartcher in The Sydney Morning Herald this morning exposed it. They asked the Treasurer that developed the plans for a 15 per cent GST. The GST is on its way, and the same people that lead this country sat around that cabinet table and inflicted all those problems on the community as a result of that first GST.


This government has not changed one iota. The GST is about attacking those that can least afford it. You will pay an extra $3,200 a year if you get an increase of 15 per cent in the GST with no change to the base. If it ends up being on fresh food, health care, education, water and sewerage, you will pay an extra $6,200 a year. It will stand up and deny it, but it is clear. That mob over there and their minions out there—the Business Council of Australia, ACCI, the business groups—all want a cut to company tax, and how do they want to pay it? They want it to be paid—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Cameron, address your comments through the chair, not through the gallery, if you would, please.




Senator CAMERON:
  Through the chair: what they want to do is force the poorest people in this country to pay for a cut in business tax. The theoretical argument is that if you cut business tax you will create more jobs. Around the world, when you look at what has happened when business tax has been cut, the chief executive, the executives and the chairpeople of the board get more money and the workers get nothing. No more jobs are created. It is an absolute furphy that that is the position.



But what will we have here? We will have everything becoming more expensive. The least well off will be hurt the most. You cannot trust them when they say there will be compensation, because they are an untrustworthy government. It is the thin end of the wedge for more tax increases from a government that say they are a low-taxing government. It is simply unfair to force a GST onto the workers of this country, who are battling to keep their heads above water now, just to give their big business mates that fund their campaigns more money.

Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (16:20):  I am not going to take lessons on tax reform from the Labor Party. No-one in their right mind in this country would take lessons on tax reform from a party that has a record of absolute disasters and failures when it comes to reforming our tax system. They were only in government for six years last time, but they presided over failure after failure after failure on tax reform in this country. They put up a mining tax—an absolute failure. Only the Labor Party—maybe with the assistance of the Greens; thank you, Senator Whish-Wilson—could design a tax which raised no money in net terms. It raised some small amount of money, but after compliance costs and administrative costs no money was raised. All the hassle, all the rhetoric and all the rigmarole we went through in this country—




Senator Polley:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. I just remind you—through you, Acting Deputy President—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Williams
):  Please.




Senator Polley:
  that there has to be some relevance to the matter of public interest before us.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  There is no point of order, Senator Polley.




Senator CANAVAN:
  The matter of public interest is in regard to tax. The MPI is put forward by the Labor Party, suggesting advice on tax to this government. I am making clear that no-one—not just the Liberal Party, not just the National Party; not anyone—in their right mind in this country would take advice on tax reform from a party that presided over the disastrous mining tax. Indeed, it was a tax designed through the mishandled Henry tax review process as well.


That is not how we are going to run this process. We are not going to run it like the Labor Party did last time they were in government. That was an absolute failure. That was a lesson in how not to do tax reform. What they did with the Henry tax review was to rule out lots of options. They did not even let him look at the GST. Mr Ken Henry was the pre-eminent adviser on economic matters.




Senator Lines:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. The matter of public importance does say, 'the plan to increase the rate of GST', and I have yet to hear that being mentioned by the senator.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Williams
):  Senator Lines, as I ruled when Senator Canavan took a point of order against Senator Cameron, that was debating point and I will rule the same against you. There is no point of order.




Senator CANAVAN:
  Thank you, because I think this motion does go to what the government is doing with tax reform, with our white paper process, our consultative process. It is important to contrast and to learn indeed from the mistakes of the former government and how they mishandled the tax reform process while they were in government. And they did mishandle it. I do not think anybody could deny that now. They instructed the most pre-eminent adviser on economic matters at the time, the then Secretary to the Treasury, Mr Ken Henry to not even look at the GST. They did not even have the guts to take advice about the GST from their Treasury secretary. That is how scared the Labor Party were of tax reform. Then when they received his report—which had nothing in it about the GST because he was told not to—just before Christmas in 2009, Wayne Swan took it to the beach and read it in between surfing trips. He was so scared by it, he did not release it for four or five months. He kept it under wraps in his office for four or five months. It was not put out to the Australian people for discussion. He was not brave enough and he did not respect the Australian people enough to allow them to look at it and to consider it, to take into account the views of the Australian people.


And what happened? Because the then government's response was developed in a cocoon, without input from the Australian people, without the antiseptic abilities of sunlight, we came up with a disastrous policy option of putting in place a mining tax which very few people could understand, which did not deal with the practical realities of the mining sector or the financial sector and ultimately lead to the destruction, probably, of a Prime Minister or at least played a major role. It was an absolutely disastrous outcome and we will not repeat it.


We are confident that the Australian people can have a mature debate about the tax system. They can have a debate which looks at all elements of the tax system. Of course, the GST is one of the most important parts of the tax system. It raises over $50 billion a year. It is an incredibly important source of funds for our state governments and, of course, it needs to be part of any review into taxes in our nation. Indeed, if you really believe the rhetoric of the other side about the GST, if you took Senator Cameron's contribution to its logical conclusions and if Senator Cameron, through you chair, were serious about the exaggerated and overwrought claims about the impact of the GST, why is the Labor Party not taking a policy to remove the GST? Why is the Labor Party not rolling back the GST? They have tried it before. If you really believe what they are saying about this tax, that it causes devastation across our landmark landscape, that it causes people to go into poverty and not be able to pay their bills, why are they not taking a policy to remove it? 




Senator LINES:
  It does.




Senator CANAVAN:
  Senator Lines, if you think it does those things, it would be an incumbent on you to take to the Australian people a policy to get rid of the tax completely but you are not doing that. It did not do that while you were in government. So your claims right now are exposed as the complete political rhetoric they are. They are not based on what you really believe impacts people. They are based on a political argument which you are seeking to have to focus on cost-of-living issues will.


The irony is that, on this side of the chamber, we are having a mature debate about what our tax system should look like and about how we can promote economic growth; on that side of the chamber they are proposing a massive tax which is going to hit poor people in this country. They are the ones proposing this tax. They are going to do it through another carbon tax. Just last week we saw the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Shorten, put forward a 45 per cent cut in our carbon emissions by 2030, almost halving our carbon emissions by 2030. The only way they are going to do that is through a new carbon tax or a new emissions trading scheme, which is another word for a tax. They are going to put another tax on the Australian people if they get back in power and guess who is going to be paying this tax? Guess who will be most exposed to paying Labor's carbon tax version 2.0? It will be the poorer households in our nation, just as it was last time. 


The Australian people rejected the tax last time but the Labor Party are coming back for a sequel. We know it will hit the poorest people because the Labor Party did modelling on this when they were in government. They commissioned economic modelling from the Treasury when they were in government into this type of reduction, into a reduction of around 45 per cent in carbon taxes—44 per cent, to be precise. We know from that modelling, from the experts, from the Australian Treasury, what would be the impact of such a tax. The impact would be that income per person would be $4,900 lower by 2030 if we were to implement such a policy. 


No-one is asking us to do this policy. It is beyond the proposals coming from other countries in Paris right now, yet the Australian Labor Party—the party which once represented workers, the party which was formed under a tree in Barcaldine to represent shearers of our nation—are putting forward a tax which will reduce the income of the average person by $5,000 a year, which will hit those industries which employ workers in this country, particularly in our steel, in our aluminium and in our power production sectors. Indeed under the Labor Party modelling on the carbon tax, all 37 coal-fired power stations in this nation would close—all of them. 


I know Senator Whish-Wilson and Senator Rice will be licking their lips at the prospect that 37 coal-fired power stations would be out of action but it is not the stated view of the Labor Party. The Labor Party do not believe in shutting down our coal-fired power stations; yet they are pushing a policy which should have that very effect. What are they going to say to the people of the Hunter Valley, what are they going to say to the people of the La Trobe finally, what are they going to say to the people of Central Queensland who lose their jobs because they are pushing a policy which is are ideologically driven and will not deliver a practical result for the environment and will make us economically poorer? From that modelling we know that the coal, oil and gas industries would be around 23 per cent lower than they otherwise would be in 2030, that the coal mining output would be 42 per cent lower and the aluminium industry would halve under their model 


These are their figures. They are not my figures, they are not Senator McGrath's figures, they are not any government minister's figures. They are the Australian Labor Party's figures from when they were in government about this particular policy option. It is complete madness. It is madness on stilts to be proposing such a tax, which would hit the poorest Australians the most. We would not be able to afford compensation either, because this policy actually reduces their economic growth.


We on this side are focused on tax reform ideas that will promote economic growth and job creation. Yes, that might mean some change to the mix of our tax system, but that is how we are going to afford a bigger pie which we can share among all Australians to fund all the public services we expect and to make sure every one of us will be better off as a result of that change, as was done with the GST. The way you do not do tax reform is to put taxes on individual sectors of our economy—wealth-producing ones like coal, aluminium and steel—which would lower economic growth, shrink the economic pie and make it harder to make sure every Australian can have a better day tomorrow than they have today.


That is what we are focused on. We are focused on making a brighter and stronger economy for tomorrow than we have today, and we will do that through considered, well thought-through and consultative tax reform. We will not impose massive new taxes on individual sectors of our economy that seek to divide our community, lower our economic growth and make us all poorer.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2015-12-02,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (16:31):  A progressive tax is when your tax rate is leveraged according to your income and your wealth, so income taxes are a progressive tax. A regressive tax is when rich people pay the same rate of tax as poor people, so a regressive tax is a GST, a goods and services tax. Any high school or first-year economics student would be able to tell you that. The Greens do not support regressive taxes.


This debate is not just about the impact that this tax is going to have on those Australians who can least afford to pay more of their disposable income—what little they do have—on goods and services in this country. It is also much bigger than that; it is about the debate we should be having on real tax reform. As soon as we go down the GST path there will not be any discussion on other tax options. The government has a green paper and a white paper to discuss tax reform, but all we hear about now is GST. It has become the political football. It has become the national conversation.




Senator Canavan:
  You chose the topic!




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  Let's talk about what we do need to talk about, Senator Canavan, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President Williams. We need to talk about getting rid of capital gains tax and the concessions that go with capital gains and with negative gearing.




Senator Canavan:
  Did you run this through the party room?




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  Yes, Senator Canavan, we have very strong policies, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Williams
):  Order on my right! Disregard the interjections, Senator Whish-Wilson.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  We need to talk about getting rid of negative gearing, making housing more affordable and getting rid of capital gains taxes. We need to talk about progressive superannuation tax concessions. We need to talk about getting rid of fossil fuel subsidies. There is so much more we need to be focusing on in tax reform in this country. I sat in here until this government got elected, listening to them talk about how each Australian household was going to be slugged under a price on carbon. Guess what? According to work we had done by the Parliamentary Library, at a 12½ per cent rate the GST is going to cost households an extra $31 per week. A 15 per cent GST is going to cost households an extra $62 per week—that is $240 a month. Multiply that by 12 and we are talking about a significant burden for those Australian households that cannot afford to pay it.


In comparison, the carbon price, which was all we ever heard about in this place, was $11 per week. I know that you, Mr Acting Deputy President, have spoken on this as well. If you want to talk about burdens on households, then GST is your No. 1 culprit. What concerns me most is that this will stymie real debate on tax reform in this country. There is a whole range of things that should be on the table that will immediately get shunted into the too-hard basket if we go down the GST road. The Greens will not be supporting a tax that makes life harder and less fair for Australians, particularly for those on low incomes. Why should a multimillionaire like our Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, pay the same rate of tax on his groceries as someone who is on social security, or is a struggling single mother who has to provide for her children? How is that fair? It is not fair, and that is why it is called a regressive tax.


We need to look at a taxation system in this country that not only raises revenue,—in my opinion, that is a secondary consideration—but can make the country fairer and more equitable. Hopefully we will find a choice of policy mix that achieves both, that makes this country fairer and more equitable and raises the revenue we need to balance budgets over a cycle. This is not just about how we can make money quickly—a quick fix. This is about how we can improve our country. Let me tell you, if you want to make this country more fair and more equitable, then GST is the worst possible thing you can do. It is the worst of all the options we have in front of us for making this country more fair and more equitable. This is the debate we have to have. It is irrefutable that the GST is a regressive tax. Let's talk about how we can improve this country, raise revenue, make housing more affordable and help those Australians who are in need.

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2015-12-02,"



Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (16:36):  I rise to speak about the Abbott-Turnbull government's plan to increase the rate of GST, and to broaden its base. With Christmas just around the corner, all the kids are starting to write their 'naughty and nice' letters to Santa, so I thought it was appropriate and timely to talk about the government's 'naughty and nice' lists regarding what they are doing to support families with the cost of living.


Unfortunately, when it comes to the cost of living for Australian families, there is nothing on the government's nice list. In fact, it is completely empty. Their naughty list, however, is another story. This list is a lot longer. This list whacks Australian families left, right and centre. But the naughtiest thing of all on this list is the 15 per cent GST that will increase the cost of everything and hurt every single Australian family. If Mr Turnbull gets his way, the cost of everything will increase and everything will cost more. 


For families already struggling to keep their heads above water, increasing the GST will only push up the cost of living, making everything more expensive and leaving families worse off. Every time they have to pay a bill, they will be paying more—be it water, gas, electricity, mobile phones, rates or the internet, it will all cost more. Every time they stand in line at the supermarket checkout, they will be paying more. In fact, they will be paying more than just the 10 per cent, up to the 15 per cent on most items. When it comes to fresh fruit and vegetables, they will be paying 15 per cent more. Every time they go to the doctor, every time they have a hospital visit, every time they have a pathology test, they will be paying more on each and every one of those. Every time they buy a new school uniform for their children, every time they buy their schoolbooks, shoes or clothing or pay for public transport, they will be paying more. Why? It will be because of this government. Whatever they do, every Australian and every Australian family will be paying more.


This is why Labor will never support Malcolm Turnbull's plan to raise the GST. We will never support a tax that is regressive and will hurt those who are the most vulnerable in our communities. There is nothing fair about jacking up the price of everything, especially for those families and those individuals who can least afford it. The government is hurting Australian families instead of helping them. We know they are an unfair government. We know that when they went to the last election, they said there would be no new taxes, there would be no surprises. What did we get? We got cuts to health, cuts to education and cuts for pensioners. Every single thing that this government have done through their last two budgets has been about hurting the most vulnerable in our communities. There is no other way to put it: quite simply, this is a government that is clearly out of touch with the Australian community. 


A lot of people have told me how they had a sense of relief when those on the other side in the Liberal Party knifed Tony Abbott. They felt a sense of relief that Mr Turnbull was now Prime Minister. Slowly but surely, it is now sinking in that they have been dealt a dud, because this will be the Prime Minister who will increase the GST, a regressive tax—a tax that will be supported by some in the community. 


We hear those on the other side quoting premiers from various states around the country who are talking about the GST. Since this government has come to office, they have cut funding to those states. They are bleeding the states dry and they know they will have little choice, because they will not be able to deliver the important services that they need to deliver to their communities while this federal Liberal government are cutting their funding and making it more and more difficult.


Let's face it, it is a simple thing for those on the other side to clear up the concern about this side talking about this increase to the GST. All they have to say is: 'There will be no increase to the GST. The GST will not be raised to 15 per cent.' It is very simple. But they say that everything is on the table—that includes increasing the GST. What do they do? They come in here and accuse us of being scaremongers and raising concerns unnecessarily in the community. But we know, as the Australian people know, that it is those on the other side who won the last election with their three-word slogans, putting fear into the community, misleading and lying to the Australian people. That is not we are doing. We are saying very clearly that we will never support an increase to the GST. It will not happen. It is against everything that the Labor Party believe in.


It is quite clear that the Liberal government will be getting a bag of coal for Christmas and Malcolm Turnbull is the Christmas cost-of-living Grinch. It is regrettable, because the Australian people put their faith in this government and they have been badly let down by those on the government benches. (Time expired)

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2015-12-02,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (16:42):  For anyone listening to this debate, I do not think it needs me to emphasise the complete lack of any conviction or truth in the arguments put forward by the Australian Labor Party. There is only one politician I have ever heard talking about a 15 per cent increase in the GST—that is, the Labor Party Premier of South Australia. The Labor Party Premier of South Australia is the only person I have ever heard talk about a 15 per cent increase in the GST. All of those pious words, that lettuce-leaf attack from the Labor Party in this debate, supported by their Green allies, is simply a straw man. It is something that they have made up and something they are trying to scare the Australian public with.


I entered this debate in rather a unique fashion. I think I am the only senator in this chamber who was there when the original GST debate was had and when the GST was implemented. I remember the same arguments from the ALP at the time: how awful it was, how terrible it was, how it was going to destroy everybody and hurt all those on low incomes. Subsequently, they came to government and did they do one thing at all to get rid of the GST? We knew that would be the case. We said to them back in the original debate, 'If you think this tax reform is so bad, give us an undertaking that you will reject and repeal the GST should you ever become the government.' Well, they did become the government, more to Australia's shame and pity, and did they do anything about removing the GST? Of course they did not. All of the arguments you hear from the Australian Labor Party senators—I have heard them all before. They are all so disingenuous, so mischievous and such a real lie as to the present position as not to warrant any relevance at all. I am sure the public of Australia understand that.


I am sorry: there is one other person that has mentioned 15 per cent in the GST, I beg your pardon, and that is me. I have made it clear that, having made a promise back in the 1998 legislation, I would never be part of a parliament that voted for an increase in the GST; I would be voting against it, if the Labor Party or anyone else ever brought up a proposal for an increase in the GST. 


I remember well the 1998 election campaign: we went to the election telling the Australian public we were going to introduce a 10 per cent GST. At the time, the Labor Party, the media and the ABC all said: 'You'll introduce it at 10 per cent. You'll do what New Zealand has done. You'll increase it to 12½ per cent then 15.' John Howard and I and everyone else in the government at the time signed in blood that we would never increase it beyond 10 per cent, and I intend to discharge that commitment I made to my electors at the time. 


I have said that I would go back to the original proposal that the people of Australia voted for when we had the courage to take that proposal to the election—that is, it was to be a broad based GST at 10 per cent with appropriate compensations for lower-income groups. We had to change that to get it through the Senate at the time, but I would go back to it. That is what the Australian people in that election agreed with, and I would go back to the broad based GST at 10 per cent. 


I remind any listeners, because the Labor Party try to confuse the issue: with an increase in the GST, the money goes directly to the states. The federal government, the then Howard government, the Turnbull government, if they were looking at a broad based 10 per cent—any increase in revenue does not go to the federal government; it goes to the state governments, half of which, regrettably, are controlled by the Labor Party. And would the Labor Party give back any additional funds they might have, if there was a broad based GST? Of course they would not. 


I repeat: the only person to have called for an increase to 15 per cent is a Labor Party politician—the Premier of South Australia. Yet you have the hypocrisy of senators from the Labor Party coming in here with all this bleating and bleeding. Why don't they go and talk to Mr Weatherill, if they are so concerned about it, because he is the only person who has spoken about an increase in the GST to 15 per cent?


The Labor Party, and we know you cannot believe them—we had a proposal for a 10 per cent GST and we actually took it to the Australian public, who endorsed our proposal—before the 2007 election promised the Australian people they would never, ever introduce a carbon tax. It was a solemn promise, a week out from the election, two days out from the election, 24 hours out from the election—a promise repeated and repeated by the leader and the Treasurer of the Labor Party: we will not introduce a carbon tax. What was the very first thing they did? Introduce a carbon tax. 


The contrast between the Liberal and National parties, and the Labor Party could not be more stark: on our side, if we have a proposal, we take it to the Australian people, who in our case, endorsed it; in the Labor Party's case, they lied to the Australian people that they would not introduce a carbon tax and then, as soon as they were elected, came in and did the opposite. 


We do have plans. Australia needs taxation reform. We are involved in a broadscale discussion on that now. That must happen, if Australia is to move forward, but we will do it honestly.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (16:49):  Senator Macdonald is right: the coalition—John Howard, in particular—did take his change of heart on the GST to the Australian people, which is the right thing to do. If there is a fundamental policy change, you ought to take it to the Australian people. Whether you like him or loathe him, John Howard did do the right thing and showed a lot of political courage in taking the GST issue to the people in the 1998 election. He nearly lost it but he scraped through, and you must admire the fact that he did go to the people in relation to that. 




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  And isn't Australia better off for it? 




Senator XENOPHON:
  Senator Macdonald asks if Australia is better off for it. If the sky did not fall in, then the answer to Senator Macdonald's—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Williams
):  Order on my right. Senator Xenophon, pay no attention to the interjections.




Senator XENOPHON:
  There was some tax reform. The concern I have is: if we try and push up the GST and go down that path, that it will be regressive. This whole approach ignores some fundamental issues. We need to look at service delivery, of government working more efficiently and other sources of revenue where there are, if not loopholes, areas ripe for reform before we consider increasing the GST, which itself would be quite regressive. It would concern me to bring the GST across the board to include fresh food, health and education. 


In relation to health and education, it is interesting that Henry Ergas—I think he is Senator Cameron's least favourite economist—in an opinion piece in TheWeekend Australian on 10 January of this year said that extending the GST to private health and education hurts the public system, creates longer waiting times and actually causes a distortion and more pressure on the public system. I think there is something in that. Also, a GST on fresh food, I think, sends the wrong health message in terms of what we need to do. 


My view is that, before we even consider going down the path of an increase in the GST, we ought to look at other issues in terms of raising revenue: superannuation tax breaks are unsustainable in their current form. I think that the shadow Treasurer Chris Bowen came up with some pretty sensible solutions in terms of paying more tax on super, if you have more than over $2 million or $3 million—or thereabouts—in relation to your superannuation. I think that needs to be looked at very closely, because those superannuation tax concessions are unsustainable.


The other issue relates to negative gearing. I am not against negative gearing per se, but I think it can be tweaked to have a greater emphasis on new, affordable rental housing, which would make a difference in terms of those Australians that need to be housed in good, safe, quality accommodation. My concern is that unless we tweak negative gearing it will continue to cause the budget to blow out more and more. Also, we need to make sure that multinational corporations—the Googles, the Apples and the Microsofts of this world—pay their fair share in tax. These are just some of the issues we need to look at before we look at an increase in the GST that will hurt lower income earners and will hurt the poor and the disadvantaged in this country. There are a whole range of other measures we need to look at.


I want to make reference to something that I think is worth reading, something that I read some time ago, The Fourth Revolution by John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge. John Micklethwait was editor-in-chief of The Economist magazine—I guess his politics are right of centre—and Adrian Wooldridge was a senior contributing writer. As I understand it, Mr Micklethwait now runs Bloomberg News as the editor-in-chief. They draw some interesting comparisons in terms of how the modern state delivers services most efficiently and in a way that does not compromise service delivery. Interestingly, despite that perhaps right-of-centre perspective from Mr Micklethwait, they have looked around the world at what has happened and where there have been good results. 


One of those areas is Scandinavia, where the health system, in terms of outcomes, has improved. Costs have been reduced because they have worked on a model of social inclusiveness and on driving efficiencies, and that, to me, is the way for the modern state. I think our temperament here in Australia is closer to the Scandinavians than to the Americans in terms of social equality, opportunity and having a safety net for people that are most vulnerable. So that is the sort of approach we should be looking at. We should not be looking at increasing the GST, which would impose an additional, disproportionate burden on the poor.

"Lines, Sen Susan",ALP,2015-12-02,"



Senator LINES
 (Western Australia) (16:54):  At least those opposite are consistent. The Turnbull government is at least consistent. It is going after the poor, the disadvantaged and those on benefits and pensions in the Australian community. They are consistent in doing that while completely ignoring the big end of town who put the big donations into the Liberal Party and the National Party to fund their election campaigns, and ignoring multinational tax evasion that goes on completely unabated. They are trying to create transparency around Mr Turnbull's companies and others that were on the secret list before it got published, yet they are hell-bent on making poor Australians and Australians on low incomes pay a big, fat, new tax—a massive five per cent increase in the GST that will go onto absolutely everything. 


It just demonstrates how out of touch the Turnbull government are. They simply do not appreciate that those on low incomes or fixed incomes spend all of their income on day-to-day living expenses: food, rent, health, pharmaceuticals, school costs and so on. It takes up all of their pay or all of their benefit in a way that it does not for those on higher incomes—and particularly for politicians in this place. Those opposite, who go on and on, saying, 'Let's put everything on the table,' but focus on a GST, have no idea what it is like to walk in the shoes of someone on a low income. We have cleaners in Parliament House this week taking strike action against the government because of their failure to make sure that those cleaners get a decent wage increase. But before that they ripped money out of their pockets. 


We have seen that every move this government has made is designed to really hit Australians doing it tough. This proposal is definitely on the table—it is not ruled out; it is definitely on the table; it was shopped around well and truly by Mr Abbott before he lost the prime ministership. We have not had Mr Turnbull come out and say, 'It is not off the table.' We have not had that categorical denial. We had Mr Turnbull on the radio in Adelaide saying that his view is that changes to the GST should be on the table. Of course, what would Mr Turnbull have in common with a low-income earner, a cleaner cleaning his office? Absolutely nothing. He probably has not noticed that they are not here this week. Well, I have, and I stand with those Parliament House cleaners. They deserve a decent pay rise and they certainly do not deserve a big, fat, whopping GST applied to every single thing they do. 


The other group that I met with today are seafarers from the MV Portland. Again, there has been not a single word from those opposite about the plight of those seafarers who have been sacked by Alcoa. They have worked on Australian seas for 25 years with not one day lost to industrial action, and what has Alcoa done? With one flick of the pen they have sacked them. And guess what. They are going to be replaced by foreign workers earning $2 an hour. Do those opposite care? No, they do not. I met a seafarer today who has been at sea the 20 years. He has now lost his job. Do they care? No. 


They bleat on every day about how they are creating jobs and how they are making Australians better off. They are not making seafarers better off and they are not making cleaners better off. On top of denying them wage increases and sacking them and letting Alcoa sack Australian seafarers and doing nothing about it, they want to impose a big, fat, new tax of 15 per cent on every single thing that those workers buy. It is not on. It is time that the Turnbull government acted in the interests of all Australians, not just those at the big end of town. It is time that we had some multinational tax transparency in this country. It is time that multinationals and those who earn a very big income—a much bigger income than a cleaner on 20 bucks an hour—started paying their fair share, started actually contributing. But, no. 


No wonder some of the states are calling for a GST—the Turnbull government is starving them of funds. There are the massive cuts to education, which were not signed off by the Australian public. There are the massive cuts to health, which were not signed off by the Australian government. All of those funds have been taken away from state governments. Whether they are Liberal governments or Labor governments, they are all in the same boat, and they are desperate to provide those services. Yet we have, day in and day out, the Turnbull government absolutely refusing to categorically state that they will not introduce a big, fat new GST of 15 per cent on everything. A GST on food, on health, on education, on pharmaceuticals and on school goods to be paid by cleaners on 20 bucks an hour and paid by Australian seafarers from Victoria, who those opposite have no concern for, who have been sacked by Alcoa and will be replaced by workers on $2 an hour. Where is their concern? It is completely missing. Those seafarers are in the parliament. If you would like to meet with them, just talk to me. They will tell you what an increase of the GST to 15 per cent will do to them, as they face the unemployment queue. It is a disgrace. They should absolutely rule out a GST increase once and for all, but they will not do it.

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2015-12-02,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (17:00):  I rise to speak on the motion. I am very proud of a government that has a holistic approach to tax reform. I am very proud of a government that actually considers all the evidence before it before it makes decisions. I remember in previous governments there was a media release here and a media release there. The chock backlog of legislation that has not even got through the Senate from that previous government beggars belief. Do not worry, bank the savings and plan the budget on the media release, but they never get the legislation through. That is the reality of how the opposition approaches the economic management of our nation.


When Senator Cameron stands up and says, 'The government cannot be trusted,' I would say the reality is that we have an opposition in denial. They are denying that today growth is going well, exports are up, our economic plan is working and Australians are more confident. Businesses are is more confident, and do you know what happens when businesses are more confident? They employ more people and more people have jobs. When a person has a job, they can provide for their families and they can provide for themselves rather than have the state or the Commonwealth government providing for them. Then, government can do what it should be doing, which is ensuring that those very poor and those that are unable to care for themselves, the severely disadvantaged and the disabled, have a safety net that we can afford. To sit here and listen to those opposite who think that money grows on trees and that this Senate can continue to accept all the spends and reject all the saves is just an opposition in denial.


When I think about what state governments have to fund, I want them to be able to fund excellent state primary and secondary schools. I want them to be able to provide the young people of this country with excellent state education. I want people to have a very positive and safe experience in our state public hospitals. That requires the state governments to have a revenue source with which to do that. To sit here and think that they have the possibility to do that is actually missing the point.


I am straying from my theme of 'denial'. The opposition are in denial about the role of economic growth and its relationship to job creation, and denial about our place as a nation in this very, very competitive world. They are also in denial about the relationship between government debt and deficit and the provision of services. They are in denial about their own record on tax reform, and it is a record that we are really proud not to follow. It is about spending a lot of money and getting some really good thinkers around a table to conduct a tax reform of this nation but ignoring the fact that we are in the Federation. They ignore the fact that the GST is within the tax mix. 'You can look at this, you can look at that, but you cannot look over there,' which is a shocking way to approach taxation reform in this country. We will not be following it, because we are not afraid of great ideas. We are not afraid of bad ideas. We are not afraid of ideas.


I thought it was going to be the year of big ideas. It might be the year of big ideas for Bill Shorten, but it is absolutely not the year of new ideas. They are so bereft of any idea that they have opened up the Keating playbook. They are thinking, 'What are we going to do? We've got ""Mr 15 Per Cent"" here. What are we going to do? When did we last have a leader that we could actually back?' Nobody has any credibility on the other side with backing either former Prime Minister Rudd or former Prime Minister Gillard, because somebody had their knives out for one of them at any one point. So going back to Keating. How did he actually win that unwinnable election? It was through a scare campaign, an absolute scare campaign, against the ideas of the coalition opposition at the time. What we have is a very frightened opposition. They are very fearful, and they are not putting forward any big ideas or new ideas. They are returning to the politics of old, of fear, mistrust and fragmentation.


We as a government are not going to stand for it. We have a positive vision for our nation, going forward into the 21st century, where science is the heart of our economic policy and will drive the transformations we need to make to be a 21st-century economy. Those young Australians who graduate in about 15 years time will be graduating into jobs that we have no idea will even exist right now. To be returning to the early nineties for your policy ideas just shows how behind the times you are.


As a National Party senator, I get offended when those opposite choose to say that I do not care about the poor, or that I do not care that people are losing their jobs. Absolutely I care, and I can guarantee to you that everybody on this side of the Senate cares about the welfare of the Australian citizenry. It is why we all came to this place. We want them to be the very best that they can be. We want them to hold jobs and to contribute their creative talents, wherever that may be. We want them to win a gold medal at the Olympics, or not. We want them to live in a society where they can be all that they can and should be and be safe. That means we need to have an economy that can provide them with that expectation. I do not back away from wanting to live in a society with a very strong safety net for those who are unable to do so. Do not come in here and say to me that I do not care about poor people. If you cared about poor people and their disposable incomes, you would not have come out with the tax on tobacco.



Senator Polley interjecting—




Senator McKENZIE:
  Seriously—you want me to show you the stats on the proportion of smokers who are poor and addicted? You will take out of their pocket money that they could use to feed their children. I think it is an absolute joke. It shows how out of touch you actually are.


We are very excited to be taking a holistic approach to our tax reform agenda to ensure that our tax policy going forward will be one that allows us to take advantage of all the opportunities that this century will offer and assist us with overcoming the challenges of the 21st century, ensuring that our society has the skills, education and jobs to take us forward.


In the brief time I have left: the GST is about the states, and the Labor premiers have been very clear in their remarks.

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2015-12-02,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (17:08):  I rise to speak on this matter of public importance:


The Abbott-Turnbull Government's plan to increase the rate of GST and broaden its base.


I also would like to make a few comments about the contribution by Senator McKenzie when she talked about caring for Australian people who are on low incomes—not her words but basically the intent of her contribution. This is a senator who is part of the government that wants to strip thousands of dollars from family tax benefits—from Australian families. They wanted to introduce a GP tax after they said there would be no changes to health. This is the same senator who said she was concerned about the cost of living for Australians, and yet they did not take it to the election. They were not brave enough to take these things to the election.


They also wanted to take money off pensioners. They ripped billions of dollars from the states and territories through health and education. And, of course, there was the classic: no money for unemployed people for six months. Living on fresh air! This is the caring attitude from those opposite. After listening to that contribution, you would not believe that these were their policies. There was denial in the chamber today and it was coming from Senator McKenzie. Most of those measures came out of the government's disastrous first budget. I think that, if the government senators were honest, they would agree that it was actually a disastrous first budget and that, if these measures had actually got through the Senate, it would be a sorry state of affairs for those vulnerable people that we just heard the senator say she actually cared about.


She also talked about the legislation that came through during the former Labor government. Of course, most of our legislation did get through. That was in spite of the slogan driven opposition of Mr Abbott at the time. They did not enunciate their policies at all. We all remember that they were on a unity ticket on basically everything that the Labor Party stood for. They never enunciated any policy. They never told people what they were going to do, so why should we trust them now when some of them say there is no proposal for a GST and some of them say everything is on the table? They cannot be trusted and have actually shown that.


Some people have been interested in the serialised feature that has been running in The Sydney Morning Herald which tells of a meeting between Mr Abbott, Mr Hockey and Treasury officials just before the leadership change. This was a meeting to discuss tax reform prior to the leadership change. On the agenda, according to the article, was a clear path to increase the GST from 10 to 15 per cent. It was also proposed to cut the top—




Senator Smith:
  Madam Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I do not know if Senator Brown is trying to suggest that Premier Weatherill's 15 per cent tax is not an original idea—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Reynolds
):  That is not a point of order.




Senator CAROL BROWN:
  I know they are sensitive on the other side. They have been tumbled. The Australian people are not stupid. They know what your plan is.


We had Mr Hockey come see Mr Abbott with the Treasury officials to talk about the GST going from 10 to 15 per cent. The Sydney Morning Herald article says:


By the time the change was fully phased in over two to four years, this would generate about $40 billion in extra revenue to pay for the other parts of the plan.


It goes on to say:


But the extra GST alone was not enough to pay for the tax cuts. To make up the shortfall, the government would have to make big cuts to spending.




Senator McKenzie:
  Madam Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of clarification. Senator Brown mentioned that the Labor—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  That is not a point of order. Senator Brown, continue.




Senator CAROL BROWN:
  Thank you again, Madam Acting Deputy President. Seriously, I had to sit here and listen to the complete drivel from Senator McKenzie without standing up and making a point of order, and here she is! It is just ridiculous.



Honourable senators interjecting—




Senator CAROL BROWN:
  I know they do not want to hear, but the Australian public do. They want to know exactly what the government are planning to do. It is incumbent upon the Labor Party to let the Australian people know. We know work has been done. We know it has. They may not have the bravery and the courage that Senator Macdonald talked about with former Prime Minister Howard, because it appears that they do not.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  The time for the discussion has expired.

Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (17:15):  by leave—I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the republic of Indonesia, which took place from 27 September to 1 October 2015. I seek leave to make a statement.


Leave granted.




Senator BACK:
  Four participants, with the secretary of the delegation, Ms Sophie Dunstone, visited Indonesia. Along with me were Senator Anne Urquhart, from this place; and Mr Ewen Jones, the member for Herbert, and Mr Stephen Jones, the member for Throsby, from the other place. There were those who thought they were identical twins! I had to inform our hosts that they were not. I want to pass on my thanks and those of the delegation to the honourable Australian Ambassador to Indonesia, Mr Paul Grigson; the first secretary, Mr Murray O'Hanlon; the second secretary, Ms Annelise Young; and Mr Monty Pounder, who so ably looked after the group in the visits we made to Jakarta and to Balikpapan, in Indonesia.


Madam Acting Deputy President, you know the importance of the relationship with Indonesia. It is our largest, nearest neighbour, second only to Papua New Guinea in proximity. It has a population of some 250 million people. It is a country with which Australia has the opportunity to do much more business. Our relationship over the last few years has been somewhat strained, but I am delighted to be able to confirm and report that the meeting of Prime Minister Turnbull with President Widodo, only recently, has certainly turned the quality and the direction of that relationship around.


I will turn briefly to trade. In 2013, our two-way trade with Indonesia was worth some $15 billion, of which $11½ billion was in goods and $3.5 billion in services. But of course there is enormous capacity to increase that trade relationship, and I look forward to that happening in the future. In the goods areas there are wheat, other agricultural products, sugar and molasses, export of live animals—live cattle export to Indonesia is now back on track as a very significant trade area—crude petroleum and cotton. In the services area the importance of education cannot be overemphasised. We will see more in the future as we see more Indonesian students studying in Australia. Under the New Colombo Plan, I am pleased to report to the chamber, the single largest country to which Australian New Colombo Plan students wish to go is Indonesia.


The group had the opportunity in the education space to visit a madrasah, a school, where Australia is providing enormous support. Australian financial support under our aid program has now moved from physical construction and upgrading of buildings to improving the standards, governance and educational standards of the principals, the school administrators and the schoolteachers. In fact, the pilot program coordinated by Australia is so successful that the Indonesian Ministry of Education and Culture are now rolling out that same program throughout their schools in Indonesia.


In Balikpapan, we had the opportunity to meet with a number of educators to learn from them what more we can do. Many of them, in fact, had had secondary and/or tertiary education here in Australia, so they knew our country well. Again, they were appreciative of the relationship between our two countries.


In Balikpapan, the group visited Thiess Bros, obviously a Queensland originated company, and Coates Hire. In both instances there were significant numbers—I think Coates Hire, out of 160 staff, only had three expats. In the case of Thiess, they had a very, very active program undertaken to Australian certification levels in a range of trade skills areas—welding, diesel mechanics et cetera. We were keen to know what the equivalent standards were, and they informed us that they were sending many of those who had completed their apprenticeships to work in Brisbane, where they performed very, very well and indeed were so much in demand that there were requests for them to stay.


Madame Acting Deputy President Reynolds, you would recall from your military experience that Balikpapan was the scene of one of the last battles of the Australian infantry in July 1945, when our troops were able to maintain a beachhead and then overcome the Japanese on that particular location. The group had the privilege and the pleasure of visiting what is now Chevron's headquarters on Balikpapan, where we laid wreaths and reflected on the contribution made by our Australian troops. That contribution was not lost when we met local government officials in that particular city.


Indonesia remains a strong neighbour, a very important trading post, and I was delighted that the delegation was able to have the impact it did.

 (Western Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (17:21):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


I rise to speak briefly in regard to document No.1, which is the President's report to the Senate on government responses outstanding to parliamentary committee reports as at 1 December 2015. I would just like to draw the Senate's attention to one response in particular that is outstanding, and that is the response to the report of the Community Affairs References Committee inquiry into grandparents who take primary responsibility for raising their grandchildren. We eagerly await the government's response to that. I understand it is not too far away at all. But, in the context of the very important issue of the increasing vulnerability that some Australian grandparents find themselves in as they start to take primary care responsibilities for their grandchildren, I would just like to reflect very favourably on two decisions the government has taken over the recent week.


Last Sunday my colleague Senator the Hon. Simon Birmingham, Minister for Education and Training, announced that grandparents who are the primary carers of their grandchildren will be exempt from the childcare subsidy activity test. In short, this means that grandparent carers will be eligible to access up to 100 hours of approved child care fortnightly. In addition to that, I am pleased that our Western Australian colleague, Madam Acting Deputy President Reynolds, the Hon. Christian Porter, the new Minister for Social Services, has announced that the government will exempt grandparent carers from the proposed changes to family tax benefit part B. These are very solid first steps in the government's recognition of the important role that grandparent carers are playing. I know that other members of the Community Affairs References Committee eagerly await the government's response to that committee report. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

 (Tasmania) (17:25):  I present the 14th report of 2015 of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. I also lay on the table Scrutiny of Bills Alert Digest No. 14 of 2015, dated 2 December 2015.


Ordered that the report be printed.




Senator POLLEY:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


I rise to speak to the tabling of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee's 14th report of 2015. As most senators would be aware, the Scrutiny of Bills Committee scrutinises each bill introduced to the parliament and reports to the Senate against the principles outlined in Senate standing order 24. Five scrutiny principles underpin the work of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. These principles broadly reflect the themes of good governance, administrative fairness and accountability and the need to maintain appropriate parliamentary involvement in the legislative process.


Importantly, the committee is the only parliamentary committee to routinely consider amendments made to bills, which it does against the same terms of reference. The committee has a longstanding practice of undertaking its scrutiny in a non-partisan, apolitical and consensual way. The committee aims to quickly identify possible scrutiny concerns in order to bring them to the attention of senators and other committees undertaking bill inquiries. 


The committee and ministers communicate through correspondence published in the committee's reports. For example, in this report, the committee's 14th report of 2015, the committee has sought advice from relevant ministers in relation to a number of bills amending proceeds-of-crime and family law legislation and government amendments made to the Corporations Amendment (Financial Advice Measures) Bill 2015. Cooperation and respect for this communication process underpins the work of the committee.


Currently the Scrutiny of Bills Committee does not have any formal procedural measures available to it to ensure a timely response from ministers. Unfortunately, on occasion there have been delays in receiving responses from ministers, which has led to legislation being introduced and passed before the committee can complete its scrutiny process. For example, in the committee's Alert Digest No. 7 of 2015, which was tabled on 12 August 2015, the committee sought advice in relation to the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Allegiance to Australia) Bill 2015. The committee has not yet received a formal response to that request, despite the fact that the bill has now reached Committee of the Whole stage in the Senate.


I might add that, in the last decade, there has been a high level of cooperation from ministers with the committee in terms of responsiveness to its requests for information, regardless of which party is in government. But, while there has generally been a high level of respect for the scrutiny process, regardless of who is in government, instances of delayed communication and responses from ministers can undermine the committee's ability to carry out its scrutiny function efficiently and to be effective. This is not about who is in government; it is about respecting committee processes and it is about ministers being more timely and responsive in their dealings with the committee. This is critical to ensure that the committee can perform its scrutiny functions effectively. On behalf of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, I take this opportunity to draw to the attention of senators the importance of timely responsiveness to the committee's requests for information. 


I would like to place on record the committee's appreciation for the work undertaken by Toni Dawes and the staff at the secretariat, who undertake their work in a very timely manner, with the diligence and respect that this work deserves. I commend the committee's Alert Digest No. 14 of the 14th report of 2015 to the Senate.

These are savings measures that the former Government promised prior to the last election to help repair the budget; but since the election they have failed to keep their promise to the Australian people. 


We are now introducing legislation to allow the former Government to keep its promise to the Australian people to fix the budget. These measures will provide savings to the budget of over $2 billion over the forward estimates.


Two of the measures were removed from the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment Act 2014 during its passage through the Senate in March 2014, and reintroduced in the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Student Measures) Bill 2014 on 17 July 2014. This Bill has not passed the Senate.


The two other measures were introduced in the Higher Education Support Amendment (Savings and Other Measures) Bill 2013, which has also not passed the Senate.


This Bill facilitates the former Government keeping their election promises. That is what we are doing. We are giving them the opportunity to keep their election promises, because they did not reverse the decision to proceed with these measures in the 2013 Economic Statement or in their document outlining their costings for the 2013 federal election. Since the election, they have been saying—claiming, incorrectly—that we have deepened the budget deficit. 


In fact, they are the ones—by their own actions—who are deepening the budget deficit by not passing these measures. There is no sense of embarrassment about it. They are just opposing what they took to the last election.




Schedule 1—
Student Start-up Loans



Schedule 1 to the Bill replaces the current Student Start-up Scholarship with an income-contingent loan, the Student Start-up Loan.


The Student Start-up Loan aims to help students with the costs of study, including the purchase of text books, computers and internet access. 


This proposal will provide significant savings to Government while maintaining students' access to funds to assist them with the up-front costs of study. It also recognises the financial difficulties that some students and their families may experience in undertaking education and training, and includes a number of measures to assist people financially.


Under the new arrangements, there will be a limit of two Student Start-up Loans per year, of equivalent value to the Student Start-up Scholarship (currently $1,025 each and to be indexed from 2017).


The loans will be available on a voluntary basis, and will be repayable under similar arrangements to Higher Education Loan Programme debts.


Students will only be required to begin repaying their Student Start-up Loan after their Higher Education Loan Programme debt has been repaid.


This measure will commence on 1 January 2017 (or, if Royal Assent occurs after 1 January 2017, the first occurring 1 January after Royal Assent). 


This measure only applies to new recipients of Youth Allowance, Austudy and ABSTUDY after the day it takes effect. It does not affect the entitlements of individuals currently entitled to these benefits, who will continue to be able to obtain student start-up scholarships.




Schedule 2
—
Efficiency dividend



Schedule 2 to the Bill amends the Higher Education Support Act 2003 and the Commonwealth Grant Scheme Guidelines 2012 to apply an efficiency dividend to Commonwealth contribution amounts in the Act and loadings under the Guidelines. 


It will adjust these amounts for the year in which the Bill receives Royal Assent and later years. The adjusted amount would be the amount that would have been payable in these years had the efficiency dividend applied in 2014 and 2015, consistent with the original policy announcement of the former Government. 


These amendments result in significant savings that have already been included in the Budget bottom line, but are not expected to impact on access to, or the quality of, higher education.




Schedules 3 and 4—
Removal of the upfront payment discount and voluntary repayment bonus



Schedules 3 and 4 to the Bill amend the Higher Education Support Act 2003 to abolish the HECS-HELP upfront payment discount and the Higher Education Loan Programme voluntary repayment bonus. 


The removal of both the discount and the bonus would occur from the first 1 January occurring at least three months after the Bill receives Royal Assent.


As a result, from this time, students will no longer receive a discount of ten per cent on their student contribution for units with a later census date by paying the amount up front, nor will they receive an additional five per cent reduction in their Higher Education Loan Programme debt if they make a voluntary repayment of $500 or more.


Again, while these amendments result in significant savings that have already been included in the Budget bottom line, they are not expected to impact on access to, or the quality of, higher education.




Schedule 5 – Interest charge



Schedule 5 to the Bill will allow for an interest charge to be applied to certain debts incurred by recipients of Austudy Payment, Fares Allowance, Youth Allowance for full-time students and apprentices, and ABSTUDY Living Allowance.


The interest charge will only be applied where the debtor does not have or is not honouring an acceptable repayment arrangement.


At present, current recipients of income support with debts have their payments reduced until their debts are repaid. For former recipients of income support, on the other hand, there is no incentive to repay their debts.


Debtors who are already making repayments, or who come to a repayment agreement with the Department of Human Services following implementation of the measure, will not be charged interest.


The key purpose of the interest charge is to encourage debtors to repay their debt, in a timely fashion, where they have the financial capacity to do so.


Once the interest charge is in place, debtors who have not been making repayments will have an incentive to engage with the Department of Human Services to make a repayment arrangement in order to avoid the interest charge.


The rate of the interest charge will be based upon on the 90‑day Bank Accepted Bill rate, plus an additional seven per cent, as is currently applied by the Australian Taxation Office for unpaid tax debts under the Taxation Administration Act1953. Over the last four years, this rate has averaged approximately 10.1 per cent, and currently stands at 9.15 per cent for the quarter July to September 2015. 


This measure will commence on the 1 January or 1 July first occurring after Royal Assent.


Debate adjourned.


Ordered that the resumption of the debate be made an order of the day for a later hour.

"Nash, Sen Fiona",Nats,2015-12-02,"



Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate and Minister for Rural Health) (19:20):  In the spirit of festivity, as we come to the conclusion of another parliamentary year, I welcome two forthcoming events this December. The first is on 18 December, when the fabled Star Wars franchise obtains a reboot through new eyes, and, of course, a week later we get to spend time with our loved ones, relatives and in-laws at Christmas. Why Star Wars? There is an immense amount of optimism with respect to the arrival of Star Wars: The Force Awakens, underlining the impact the famed original trilogy has had, transforming the way we make, market and enjoy film.


The original cast are returning, the beloved Millennium Falcon has snuck into the previews, and early sales of tickets here in Australia point to unprecedented demand. According to Event Cinemas, in late October the Star Wars: The Force Awakens first-day presales in Australia totalled 30,000 in just four hours. To put that in perspective, that is four times as many as the first day of presales for The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn and Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows: Part 2 in the same period.


I can remember being amazed at seeing Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill light up the screens in George Lucas's magnificent space opera in 1977. I do point out, Senator Smith, that I was 12, and I thought Mark Hamill was actually quite handy. C-3PO and R2-D2 started us on a journey that traversed hyperspace. The movie transcended a generation. I remember my two boys, Will and Henry, at a very young age being transfixed by their remote controlled Darth Vader.


A recent irony that dawned on me was that there are a whole range of topics that are touched on that are central both to the galaxy far, far away and to our own world, even in this chamber. We see backroom deals, executive authority, citizen engagement, defence legislation and other political topics. In fact, it is amazing how links from this mythical universe transverse the modern political lexicon.


Locally in Australia more than 70,000 people—0.37 per cent—declared themselves members of the Jedi order in the 2001 census. The Australian Bureau of Statistics issued an official press release in response to media interest on the subject. Debate aside on the intentions of those that declared themselves as Jedi, of interest is that this is one of the first examples of a concept going 'viral' on the internet in Australia. There is not a more obvious example of Lucas's franchise shaping than this, than the originally derisive nickname given to President Reagan's missile defence program, 'Star Wars'. 


Even the current Obama administration has not been without its Star Wars moments, either. In early 2013, the Obama administration responded to a White House petition calling on the president to 'secure resources and funding and begin construction of a death star' by his last year in office. Unfortunately for many Star Wars fans who signed the petition, this was not deemed a priority in Obama's final term. The memorable response from the White House read:


The Administration does not support blowing up planets. Why would we spend countless taxpayer dollars on a Death Star with a fundamental flaw that can be exploited by a one-man starship?


Puns aside, one of the subliminal messages in the movies is clear—democracy cannot exist without an active and engaged citizenry. Becoming involved in politics and being engaged in debate is the core of what drives the best in Australia's political system. I hope everyone enjoys the return of the fabled classic and when John Williams' magnificent score opens to the famous Star Wars scroll, I am sure old fans and new alike will be ready to join the battle between the good and dark sides of the force. 


On a more serious note, the Christmas season is a time to reflect on a year gone by and to give thanks to the opportunities the year presented, to learn from the challenges and to thank people who have helped make the year so dynamic. In this respect, I would like to sincerely thank all the people you do not visibly see every day yet are the heartbeat of this chamber. They include all Senate staff, catering, cleaning and security. Your work here is truly appreciated and it is always nice to have friendly faces going about their work on a busy sitting day.


Many of us here will have the fortune to go home to loved ones this Christmas period and have great merriment watching children and grandchildren enjoy the essence of Christmas. My thoughts are also with those who are not so fortunate and to those who, for whatever reason, are having a difficult time this year. 


I would like to close by wishing all senators a merry and safe Christmas and, as the minister responsible for food policy, sensibly enjoy the turkey, seafood and pudding, and whatever other delights are offered. I would like to finish with a passage from Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol which beautifully captures the message of Christmas.


But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas-time, when it has come round—apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and origin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that—as a good time; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know of in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one consent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people below them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and not another race of creatures bound on other journeys.
