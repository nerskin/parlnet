"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,1999-09-02,"—On behalf of Senator Coonan and the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, I give notice that on the next day of sitting Senator Coonan shall withdraw business of the Senate notice of motion No. 10 standing in her name for 11 sitting days after today for the disallowance of the Public Service (Parliamentary Officers) Amendment Regulations 1999 (No. 1), as contained in Statutory Rules 1999 No. 112. Madam President, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard  the committee's correspondence concerning the regulations.
Leave granted.
The letters read as follows—
Public Service (Parliamentary Officers) Amendment Regulations 1999 (No. 1) Statutory Rules 1999 No. 112
12 August 1999
The Hon David Kemp MP
Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service Parliament House CANBERRA ACT 2600
Dear Minister
I refer to the Public Service (Parliamentary Officers) Amendment Regulations 1999 (No.1), Statutory Rules 1999 No. 112, which apply changes to the Public Service Regulations to officers in the Parliamentary Departments.
The Explanatory Statement notes that subsection 9(6) of the Public Service Act 1922  provides that the Governor-General may make regulations in relation to officers and employees of the Parliament on the recommendation of the President and/or the Speaker. However, neither the Explanatory Statement, nor the Act itself, indicates whether the recommendation of the President or the Speaker is mandatory or directory. These Statutory Rules do not appear to indicate on their face that they have been made on the recommendation of either or both of the President or the Speaker.
The Committee would therefore appreciate your advice as to whether either of the Presiding Offic 
 ers has made any recommendation and whether subsection 9(6) is mandatory or directory.
Yours sincerely
Helen Coonan

Parliament House CANBERRA ACT 2600
Dear Senator
I Refer to your letter dated 12 August 1999 regarding the Public Service (Parliamentary Officers) Amendment Regulations 1999 (No. 1), Statutory Rules 1999 No. 112.
You have noted that the Governor-General may make regulations in relation to officers and employees of the Parliament on the recommendation of the President and/or the Speaker, and you have asked whether such a recommendation was made in this case, and whether such a recommendation is mandatory or directory.
In answer to your first question, both the President and the Speaker recommended the making of Statutory Rules No. 112 to the Governor-General. The attached Executive Council documents refer.
In answer to your second question, I am advised that subsection 9(6) of the Public Service Act 1922  is mandatory in requiring a recommendation of the President and/or the Speaker. This is because of the empowering nature of the subsection, and the operation of the doctrine of the separation of powers and the privileges of the Parliament. I can provide you with fuller legal opinion on this issue if you wish.
I trust this information assists the Committee's deliberations. Please contact me if you require any further information.
Yours sincerely

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1999-09-02,"—by leave—I understand that the effect of the amended motion which Senator Campbell has moved, and has been granted leave to amend in the way that he has outlined, would be that general business not proceed today, that there be a dinner break, that we proceed to complete the legislation on the Notice Paper —effectively the youth wages legislation and the RFA legislation—and that the Senate would rise upon the completion of those bills.
The opposition supports the position advanced by the government; indeed, it was the opposition that proposed that this legislation be dealt with. We had, of course, as Senator Faulkner said yesterday, put before the government a proposal that we proceed to complete the RFA legislation by sitting until completion today, and we offered to give up general business to facilitate that occurring.
We saw yesterday the remarkable events that took place in the House of Representatives when Minister Reith made the outrageous suggestion that the opposition had refused to permit the youth wages legislation, which is on the Notice Paper for today, from proceeding. Of course, that was absolutely untrue. The opposition had not been asked to facilitate that debate. Indeed, it was always within the control of the government, as everyone here knows, to put that legislation on the Notice Paper and, indeed, it was on the red last Monday. The only issue at that time was whether it was competent to be there, because it had not been through the selection of bills process that was to be completed at a meeting at 4.15 p.m. on Tuesday. The advice given at that time was that, of course, the government could list the bill and it could proceed pending that. So it sat on the Notice Paper, second in order behind the RFA.
During the week we have seen the situation where there has been quite a deal of debate—not by the opposition, I might say, but particularly by Senator Brown and by various Democrat senators—to the RFA legislation, which took the debate through to yesterday afternoon. As I said, in the intervening time we had the outrageous suggestion by Mr 
 Reith in the House of Representatives in which he misled the House of Representatives by saying that the opposition had put a barrier in the way of dealing with the youth wages legislation. So we now see that the government has put forward the youth wages legislation as a priority, and it has dropped the priority for the RFA legislation.
One has to say that if this thing had been properly managed, and if the government did indeed have a priority for the youth wages legislation, it could have been listed at any time as a priority over the RFA legislation, but it was not. It was only after matters blew up yesterday, following those outrageous statements by Mr Reith, that the government decided to pull the RFA Bill and to seek to commence the second reading debate on the youth wages legislation. The opposition has never been worried about the debate coming on; in fact, we would be, as indicated by our support of the motion today, anxious for that debate to proceed, just as we are for the RFA legislation to follow the proper course. The RFA legislation has been on the Notice Paper for a great many months, and the government has been very tardy in pursuing that. The Forest Protection Society and others in the timber industry have been very critical of the government for leaving that matter sitting in abeyance and giving it a low priority.
We have been saying, effectively, that we want that legislation dealt with. We have announced our position, and we will debate that legislation to completion today, just as we will debate to completion the youth wages legislation, which is before the chamber at the moment. But, one would have to say that the situation that we find ourselves in, and the fact that the Senate will obviously sit until the small hours of the morning, probably at the earliest to complete this legislation, is a circumstance which has been brought on not because the opposition has been reluctant to properly deal with the government's legislation but because the government has not managed its legislative program properly.
If there is to be a late sitting, we support it. If there is to be a late sitting, we will be here. But one would have to say that the government should improve its approach to manage 
 ment of legislation in this chamber and, if there is to be a priority for legislation, let us not make those decisions on the hop. Hopefully, the Prime Minister will speak to Mr Reith about the way in which he misled the Australian parliament and the Australian public about the processes in the Senate. He misled the Australian people by suggesting that the opposition has been putting a barrier in the way of dealing with this legislation. Frankly, Madam President, what Mr Reith said in the House of Representatives yesterday was absolutely untrue.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Days and Hours of Meeting and Routine of Business</title>,Business,8,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-09-02,"—by leave—I actually agree with most of what the Opposition Whip said in relation to what we are trying to do here today, but I disagree with him in relation to the interpretation of Mr Reith's comments in the House of Representatives.
The opposition in the Senate has actually been working very constructively to try to reach a conclusion of the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998 —there is no doubt about that. Everyone knows what has been going on in the Senate for the last three weeks. Senator Brown—who, of course, has a strong interest in the Regional Forest Agreements Bill—has been ensuring that we have had, what one could only call, an extremely extensive committee deliberation on that bill. Some might call it a filibuster. I have seen a few in my time. I think we have now spent 21-plus hours on the bill. It has had an extraordinary length of time spent on it.
Most senators in this place have an interest in the RFA Bill. It is an important piece of legislation. But Senator Brown has decided to pull on a stunt or do something about it. I think the debate has been incredibly repetitive. I do not think it is actually achieving anything. But a decision has been made by one senator that we will spend at least three or more of the handful of weeks we are sitting between now and Christmas on the one bill and therefore limit the time available to consider about 120 other pieces of legislation. But that is a decision that has been made, and 
 there is very little—as the Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate, the Opposition Whip and the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate know—that one can do about it.
On Monday I approached other parties and said, `Could we please, after over two weeks of consideration of the RFA Bill, move to close that debate.' After some, I think, 15 or more hours at that stage we sought to guillotine that debate on Monday night or Tuesday so that we could get on to the youth wages bill. That was the proposition I put, and I did not get agreement. The Labor Party said, `No, we'll just see how we go.' They did say, `We'll cooperate to get the RFA finished; our speakers will not keep speaking,' and so forth, but I could not get agreement to close down that debate after two weeks.
Then, when the opposition made a very generous offer of their time in relation to general business today and sitting late tonight to try to conclude the RFA, I said to the Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate, `If we are able to get the RFA'—I guess it was a hopeful hope—`before today, would we be able to get an extension of time to get youth wages done?' The answer came back: `No, this offer is in place to do the RFA only.' That is fair enough; no-one disagrees with that. But the reality of it is that, over here in the Senate, Senator Faulkner and Senator Carr have acted constructively to try to conclude the RFA Bill, yet in the other place yesterday the acting Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley—sorry, the Leader of the Opposition I guess he is; or temporary leader until they decide that he has had his time—made a fool of himself by getting up and saying, `Why don't you bring on the youth wages bill?' So he is over there saying, `Bring on the youth wages bill,' but over here we are having very constructive, genuine negotiations on getting the RFA completed. What Mr Reith said was actually quite accurate. You can put interpretations on it, but Mr Reith said that—
—But he lied. I will withdraw that, Madam President.
—Mr Reith said that we had approached the opposition twice to get on with the youth wages bill and, on 
 both occasions, the answer was no—and it was. What he said was absolutely accurate. I said to Senator Carr on Monday that we wanted a guillotine so we could get on with youth wages, and the answer was no. I went to him on Tuesday and said, `If we can get RFA done early, can we please get on with youth wages,' and the answer was no. So what Mr Reith said was absolutely accurate. But Senator Faulkner, I think, turned it into a huge thing.
In relation to the RFA, Senator Faulkner and Senator Carr have acted in absolute good faith. They are assisting us in managing a difficult position where one senator has extended this debate over an enormous amount of time, and we are very thankful for the offer. We decided, after the provocation of Mr Beazley yesterday, that we would bring on youth wages and effectively ensure that we did get that bill. We thought it would be rude to ask to get RFA done as well. We are genuinely appreciative of the efforts of the opposition to see if we can accommodate the conclusion of the RFA Bill as well. We are genuinely appreciative.
The objects of the government are to complete the  Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Youth Employment) Bill 1999  today and to sit tonight until both that and the RFA Bill are completed. I also indicate that my motion would have the effect of not having a dinner break tonight, but it is the government's intention that there be one for at least one hour at an appropriate time—probably around seven o'clock. I do not think you necessarily need to put it into the motion. The government will indicate that it will seek to suspend for a dinner adjournment between seven o'clock and eight o'clock this evening.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Days and Hours of Meeting and Routine of Business</title>,Business,8,1,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1999-09-02,"—by leave—The Manager of Government Business in the Senate has made a number of points which have highlighted the approach that the opposition has taken in terms of its cooperation and its intention to assist with consideration of the legislative package that the government has brought forward. He has also highlighted what he sees as Mr Reith's statements with regard to the attitude to the opposition. The attitude of the opposition was 
 spelt out by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate yesterday. He made it perfectly clear that, as far as we are concerned, it is the responsibility of the government to bring legislation forward and it is the responsibility of senators to seriously consider government legislation, to put their view and to debate that legislation.
There is always an interest in how long the debate should take. Senator Ian Campbell says that he approached me with regard to the issue of a guillotine for the RFA Bill. That is true; he did. He put to me in, I might say, a less than serious manner, his view in the context of what he has always put: that there ought to be a guillotine on all legislation; that there ought to be `time management'—I believe that is the trendy, sort of politically correct expression that is used; and that this government believes that there ought to be limited debate in the Senate as a matter of course. He also knows that my response to him was what the Labor Party's response has been on all occasions: that we do not support that approach to the management of important legislation.
Senator Ian Campbell interjecting—
—I think Senator Robert Ray would have said something to you about being serious: `Don't come to us with your trendy terms; come to us with what you really mean.' Of course, you have now explained what you really meant was that there ought to be a curtailment of debate as a matter of course in the Senate, which is not a position that we support. We think that legislation should be debated on its merits, that amendments should be considered thoroughly and properly, and so we encourage a thorough examination of government legislation.
Senator Brown has been criticised because, perhaps, he has been a bit too thorough. There are occasions when I think there are legitimate concerns about the length of time that is taken on a particular proposition before the Senate. It may be argued that spending the entire week on a particular bill may be a little excessive. Senator Brown is entitled to pursue his views on this matter, just as the rest of the Senate is entitled to pursue its views as to the way in which this legislation is processed.
But at no time did this government come to us and say that they wanted to bring on the youth wages bill, which is what they should have done if they were serious about having the matter dealt with as a matter of priority. The priority was set by the government at all times. The government determined that it wanted to deal with the RFA Bill first. The government now says that it wants to change the priority, which is in direct response to the criticisms that were made by Senator Faulkner yesterday where he highlighted the hypocrisy and total dishonesty of Mr Reith in suggesting, as he did, first of all at a doorstop yesterday morning—
—Senator Carr, I think that is a statement that is not in order, and I would ask you to withdraw it.
—I will withdraw anything that is not in order. What I would suggest to the Senate is that it is totally inappropriate and disingenuous for Mr Reith to announce at a doorstop yesterday morning that the Labor Party was, first of all, changing its position on junior wage rates and that we had gone on some sort of rampage to prevent the consideration of the government's legislation in this chamber. That was a position which was totally wrong. It was a position that was totally untrue.
What we are seeing now from Mr Reith is a pattern of behaviour—a pattern of behaviour which goes to his credibility. What is apparent to us all is that Mr Reith is quite prepared to say and do anything if it suits his narrow political purposes. You cannot deal with a bloke who constantly seeks to misrepresent the facts. Of course, what we have here is a situation which has nothing really to do with the way in which we treat young people in this country, but has everything to do with Mr Reith's positioning for the leadership of the Liberal Party. His representation of these events has been totally disingenuous. As I say, the man is quite prepared to say or do anything.
In the House of Representatives yesterday, Mr Reith said:
Our understanding was that the Senate would deal with this matter this week and now we find that, to 
 the convenience of the Labor Party, this issue is  not going to be dealt with by the Senate.
That is a statement which is totally untrue. As I say, the man is prepared to say or do anything to suit his narrow political purposes. What we have seen with this motion before the chamber is what was always the case: the government determines the political priority that it gives to the legislative program. The management of the program in this Senate is the government's responsibility. Our job is to see that matters are carefully considered and to ensure that there is proper accountability of the executive, which we do effectively and will continue to do effectively.
The motion before the Senate is one that we support. We do acknowledge there is a need to have a break to allow people, particularly staff, to at least meet minimum conditions within this chamber. However, we do say that it is important for us to consider both pieces of legislation, and we are prepared to support the government in its move to see that both these pieces of legislation are dealt with today. I trust that the Senate as a whole agrees with this, and I trust that Mr Reith will desist from his gross misrepresentations, his untruths, his distortions and his crass political manoeuvres which, as I say, are aimed more at his colleagues within the Liberal Party than at informing the Australian public about the truth of the way in which this parliament actually functions.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Days and Hours of Meeting and Routine of Business</title>,Business,8,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-09-02,"—by leave—On behalf of the Australian Democrats and in my capacity as acting whip at the moment, I would like to speak to the motion mainly, rather than to the fairly extraneous political debate that has been happening instead of addressing the motion over the last 20 minutes or so. I will also briefly respond to some of the comments that have been made in a broader sense. Firstly, I would say that personally it would not surprise me at all that Mr Reith and Mr Beazley have absolutely no idea of what is happening in the Senate, what the processes of the Senate are or how the Senate works. I would expect that their interest and understanding of it is fairly limited, and I imagine that is behind the statements that both have been 
 making over the last couple of days—more highlighting their complete lack of understanding of the Senate's process, which probably goes hand in hand with their lack of understanding of or interest in the Senate's important parliamentary role as well.
Be that as it may, clearly it is always in the government's gift or power to order the priority of government legislation in this chamber, and that is a fundamental bottom line in relation to all of the backwardsing and forwardsing on that issue. That fact probably emphasises that the government has chosen to give priority to the youth employment bill, but it is important to emphasise what does not seem to have been noted in the debate around this issue—that is, it is obviously something the government and the opposition have given political priority to.
There is absolutely no legislative priority on this one. This is an issue that actually does not need to be debated or passed until next year. The youth wages exemption that the bill relates to runs out, I think, in June or July next year, so there is no need for legislation to be passed prior to that. There is certainly no need in any urgent legislative sense for it to be passed at all this year. It is clearly a political priority—and that is fine; political priorities come into being—but it is important to highlight that that is exactly what it is. The Senate's time in terms of the very crowded legislative agenda that we always have to deal with is being utilised to deal with the political priorities of both the government and the opposition in relation to the youth wages legislation. There is absolutely no priority for this legislation in a true legislative sense. We could deal with it next year. The same outcome would happen and there would be no problem in doing so.
Nonetheless, the approach that the government has decided to take—and obviously it suits the opposition's political aims as well—is to have the bill out of the way as quickly as possible. The political pain and bleeding that they are doing internally and the quite justified outrage and abuse that they are getting from sections of the community and the trade union movement over this particular bill and their support of it is something that 
 I am sure they would like to end as soon as possible, so again I am not surprised that they are supporting it being given the political priority that it is being given. In a political sense, from their position, I do not blame them for doing that.
In terms of the process in relation to this motion—as with any agreement determined between the government and the opposition that in effect enables legislation to get through to meet political priorities—I could take the usual cheap political shots and talk about shabby backroom deals and shonky agreements to try and push things through and all that sort of stuff, but I will not do that because I think that those sorts of arguments are fairly hollow. By virtue of not doing that, I hope that I will not have to listen to them again from the opposition because they seem to like to employ that sort of feeble rhetoric when other parties reach agreement that they are not supportive of.
I can understand that part of getting legislation through this place and part of getting agreement on things is reaching agreement across party lines. That has happened here and that is fine; that is the way to make things happen. Unless I was completely not listening last night in the whips meeting, which I suppose is possible, I did think last night we were talking solely about dealing with youth employment today and not RFAs. When the government initially put forward this motion in its first incarnation, it was to deal with RFAs all day today for as long as it took. At the whips' meeting last night my understanding—unless I was completely off track—was that, instead of dealing with RFAs, we would deal with youth employment. Now we get in here this morning and find we are actually dealing with youth employment and RFAs. I think that is a bit excessive.
Again not going through the shabby backroom deal cheap rhetoric, but in a spirit of cooperation on this, whilst the Democrats do not necessarily support and would prefer to see the RFA Bill not pushed through, we do think that it would be better, ideally, to have been made aware of this in advance rather than find out about it on the floor of the 
 chamber. I realise things can change quickly, but I just make the point that it is a change from what my understanding was from the whips meeting last night, and the first we were aware of it was when it was moved on the floor of the chamber this morning. I just make that point for what it is worth.
In recent times, the Democrats have supported—it is no secret and we don't back away from it—guillotines on legislation which we have seen as a legislative or political priority. Ones that we do not believe should be guillotined, we do not support. For that reason, we certainly have refused to support any countenance of a guillotine on the RFA legislation. Our views on that legislation are quite well known. In effect, whilst this is not a guillotine, it is a guillotine by exhaustion, if you like. For that reason, and particularly given that it is now been put on top of the youth employment bill, it is not something that the Democrats are able to support.
We think it is appropriate to put that on the record, especially given that we are now dealing with the youth employment legislation as well. It is something that the Democrats will not be attempting to filibuster in any way. It is an important issue on which we have a number of amendments, particularly given the very valuable contribution which the ALP made to the youth wages debate three years ago and which we have taken on board. We want to ensure that those arguments get a full hearing today. Our amendments relate to some of those important principles that the Labor Party stood for at least three years ago—in fact, until a couple of weeks ago. Dealing with the RFA legislation as well will make it a fairly long night.
While we certainly will not filibuster on youth wages, we think it is an issue which needs to be given a proper airing so that some of the furphies surrounding it are teased out and exposed. There is a gradual sinking realisation that we are probably in for a long night, but that is the way it goes. Obviously the ALP and the government are supporting both of these bills. That being the case, I may as well stop talking so that we can get on with it.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Days and Hours of Meeting and Routine of Business</title>,Business,8,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-09-02,"—by leave—Firstly, I want to thank the Labor Party for being direct with me about what has been happening. Senator Faulkner indicated to me that there had been a move to guillotine the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998 . I gave him a commitment that, as I saw it, that legislation could be dealt with by this morning and certainly, by the use of Labor's time, this afternoon. There are a couple of very important clauses of that bill which are yet to be dealt with. Whenever it comes before this chamber, I will be dealing with those in the way I would have in the ordinary course of events. At no time has the government spoken to me about truncating or changing the debate on that matter. I want to thank the Labor Party for at least being direct about the moves that were afoot. It does help to have good and efficient running of this place if everybody is direct with everybody else.
You will be aware, Madam President, that I have been making a big contribution to the regional forest agreements legislation, but that is my parliamentary life. I would not be in this place if it were not for that matter—and many others—and the impact it has on my home state, Tasmania. It would be derelict for me to simply skip through and take a light-hearted attitude to it as if it does not matter. It does matter. Senator Ian Campbell used the words `stunt' and `filibuster'. I have to see that for what it is, ignore it and keep going as I would ordinarily. Even from that point of view, what is the worst—creating a stunt or creating a million stumps, as the Prime Minister would do through his regional forest agreement process?
The other important thing to recognise is that whenever it comes before this place I will debate the regional forest agreements legislation just as I would normally—no longer, no shorter, no different—because it is so important to me. I foreshadow that I will move to amend this motion, which the Senate has given leave to be debated today, by deleting the words `and  Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998 ' because I do not believe that it should be shoved late into the night on 
 Thursday. I believe it should be debated in the ordinary course of events.
Senator Bartlett has just spoken about keeping the youth wages legislation until when next we come back. The same does really apply with the regional forest agreements legislation and we do not need to be using this pincer movement to put pressure on so that both pieces of legislation go through. If that is how the government wants to work, then so be it.
I ask the Senate, particularly the Labor Party, to consider very seriously the mooted amendment that I will be moving. It will bring incredible pressure on me later in the day—and, I am sure, on the Democrats—when we want to debate the regional forest agreements legislation. We are up to meeting that pressure and, as I said, dealing with the legislation as we would ordinarily. I wonder whether it is worth discomforting everybody in this way, simply to meet a government schedule which has come out of another place which is not affected by the pressure put on the Senate. Madam President, I seek leave to move an amendment.
Leave granted.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-09-02,"—I make these remarks in continuation of my speech during the second reading debate yesterday. To pick up where I left off, the shoppies union, in its submission to the Industrial Relations Commission, had reflected all the evidence that I had outlined earlier. That is the same submission that the Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, described as a sensible position, so sensible that he advocated it as recently as March 1999 in the parliament. Now that the Leader of the Opposition has unwisely allowed himself to be dubbed `the great liberator', he faces the risk of his young voters demanding that he live up to his name 
 and liberate them from the tyranny of youth wages where they shouldn't be applied. 
I want to show that junior rates are not a proven requirement to protect young workers. If they were, why has youth employment fallen in real terms over the last two decades? If they were, why have more young jobs disappeared from the metal trades than from the retail trade even though the junior rates in metals are a lot lower than in retail? Why does youth employment in the building trade continue to grow strongly, despite the absence of junior rates? Let us remember that the vast bulk of young workers in Australia are not employed on junior rates; 31 per cent are on adult rates, 40 per cent are on training rates, and only 29 per cent are on junior rates. And whilst we are at it, let us also remember that the vast bulk of young workers fall under state, and not federal, legislation.
The Labor Party could have easily used the opportunity to change federal legislation to lead policy changes in just one of the six jurisdictions in which we have junior rates awards. The economics of this issue is populist, pro-employer and discriminatory bunkum. The Labor Party, liberated from the need to support the good policy which it should have supported on this, has fallen for that bunkum—hook, line and sinker.
According to shadow minister Arch Bevis, the government has accepted every one of the Labor amendments. But I know that numerous Labor members of the House of Representatives and numerous Labor senators would have liked the ACTU position accepted. Where is the amendment to deny youth rates for ages above 18 years? Let me quote what the shadow minister Arch Bevis said on 10 February 1999 in what seems an eminently sensible set of remarks:
At the age of 18 you can decide whether you want this government at all, you can vote for them, you can be held criminally liable and sentenced in court as an adult. Obviously you can participate in all legal activities, you can consume alcohol, you can freely join the military, you can wear the Australian military uniform and go overseas and die for your country but, as far as this government is concerned, when it comes to your civilian life you are still a junior and should be paid as a junior. And how is that defensible? How is . . . anyone on the govern 
 ment benches going to defend the proposition that says that as an 18-year-old or 19-year-old or 20-year-old you can die for your country and you can vote to determine the policies of your nation but the day you go and get yourself a job we think you are a junior and you are not worth full rates of pay. It does not matter what the job is . . . it does not matter what the productivity is, you will be paid according to the date of your birth, if John Howard and Peter Reith have their way. There is no equity in that.
Mr Bevis went on:
It is not too hard to work out an alternative system . . . We make judgments every day in determining conditions of employment—not based on age but based on skill, competency and things like that. Is there some magical barrier to applying skill and competency for someone who is under 21? What absolute nonsense.
He then went on:
We will oppose this legislation. It is unfair and it is intimidating.
I must say I find him a very professional shadow minister to deal with, and in that instance I cannot help but agree with his sentiments. I now turn to the Leader of the Opposition, who in March 1999 when he was talking about the government's junior rates policy which would turn adults into juniors said:
Those aged 18 to 21 years vote, they marry, they have children, they enter into contracts, they have legal obligations and they are entitled to be worthy of their hire.
That is a ringing endorsement for putting a reasonable ceiling on youth rates. I know that a number of Labor senators continue to support that position, and they are put into an impossible situation of having to support a set of amendments that they fundamentally disagree with. That quote was from the Leader of the Opposition before he was liberated. This is a leader who we know on this issue had the government over a barrel and let them go, who had all the aces and threw his hand in.
To some in the Labor Party—not to all, but to some—18-year-olds are just kids and are the cannon fodder in this issue. But for what? Where is the social and political benefit of your achievement? Where is the empirical evidence that says that the amendments that you have negotiated will have a positive 
 social and economic outcome for this country? The coalition have been consistent throughout in their policy. But the Labor Party's policy has been turned on its head, and it is that inconsistency which deserves to be exposed.
We now share with the Netherlands the distinction of being the only country in the world that treats 22-year-olds as kids on payday. If you are an honest believer in youth rates, how on earth can you believe that a 22-year-old is a kid? You have to believe in some sort of a ceiling. Canada, Greece, Hungary, Japan, Mexico, Poland and Spain have all abolished junior rates. France, Luxembourg, Turkey, Ireland, Korea, Portugal and the Czech Republic allow junior rates only below the age of 18. Our near neighbour New Zealand—which many people admire—has a ceiling of 19. Why is it that in this country we think it is acceptable to have 22 as an age of discrimination? So, of 20 OECD countries with minimum wages, seven have no junior rates, seven define it as less than 18 years, four define it as less than 20 years and only two define it as over 21 years.
From what I have heard of the remarks of the Hon. Bob McMullan today on these issues, he seems to be trying to mislead the general public about the difficulties in applying such ceilings in Australia. In reality, they could be introduced with ease and would be very sensible. The shoppies union—this is your union, Senator Collins—said in its submission to the Industrial Relations Commission:
The retention of junior rates for workers aged below 21 years is illogical in a society which, for all other purposes, regards a person as an adult when they reach 18 years of age. Moreover this is particularly so when the junior rates system has not demonstrable logic or common approach to it.
I agree with the honourable Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, on this—it was a sensible statement by the shoppies union.
Now the shoppies are furious with the ALP. Why? Because their amendments actually make it harder, not easier, for the shoppies union to get junior rates for workers over the age of 18 years abolished from their awards. That is for several reasons. First, Labor's 
 amendments place an onus—a heavy onus—on the applicant to prove their case. Second, that onus will be measured against the criteria of the need to protect the competitive position of young people in the labour market; the need to promote youth employment, youth skills and community standards; and the need to assist in reducing youth unemployment. So, to ensure that young adults are paid at adult rates, the shoppies union have to prove that their application will achieve all of those things. Age discrimination—that fundamental principle that Labor supported ending—does not come into it. That has been precluded as a consideration, because junior rates are deemed not to be discriminatory. So Labor is saying that it is all right to discriminate against somebody who is 22 years of age.
Third, Labor adds into those criteria `community standards'. What does that mean? Does that mean that awards have to reflect the prejudiced community standard that is out there that young people are lazy, hopeless and should be paid less? It is open to an employer to argue that that is the community standard. Fourth, Labor has failed to define, to attempt to define or to give the IRC an opportunity to define what a junior rate is. There is no definition—no age limit, no guidelines, nothing.
We are sympathetic with the shoppies union. The Labor amendments have made a tough government anti-worker bill—we think it is an anti-worker bill—even tougher. It will be almost impossible for the shoppies union to win an adult rate for 18-year-olds under these amendments.
I cannot believe that these very capable senators—Labor Senators Collins, Hogg, Campbell and Bishop—have moved so far from the workers they used to represent that they could possibly put their names to these amendments. Because of their past positions and statements I can only conclude that their hearts are not in it; they have been told by their caucus masters to do the unconscionable. Nothing can disguise the fact that this is a sell-out. It is appalling.
—I raise a point of order on your behalf, Mr Acting Deputy President. I think I have to ask the senator to withdraw 
 his statement that you are a member of the SDA.
—There is no point of order.
—I know exactly what Senator Campbell is a member of. I quoted him earlier in the speech, if you had followed, Senator Quirke. I had suspected Labor might do a deal on junior rates and I would have had no objection at all to a sensible one, but I never suspected that you would go lower than the ACTU's bottom line compromise of an 18 years ceiling as the maximum. I had hoped that the Leader of the Opposition would deliver what he said he would but, in that, the union movement, Australia's 200,000 young workers and I were to be disappointed.

"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,1999-09-02,"—I rise very briefly to set a few facts straight with respect to this debate. It has been very interesting listening to Senator Murray and his colleagues. Of course, he tried to slur the current chair by including him as a member of the SDA. Senator Allison was quite erroneous—
—I raise a point of order on inaccuracy, Mr Acting Deputy President. On the Hansard  record I clearly quoted you in your former capacity and your views on youth rates. I merely included you in that list of Labor senators as one of those who had expressed a very clear position on the issue of youth rates. And by the way, I compliment you for both your speech and your previous position.
—Thank you, Senator Murray, but there is no point of order.
—Turning to what Senator Allison had to say  in this debate, Senator Allison tried to concoct the opinion around her that there were former officials of the SDA in this place. I just want to point out for the benefit of the Democrats that there are three current serving officials of the SDA in this chamber, as those who are bright enough well know. They are: the President of the Tasmanian branch, Senator Brian Harradine; 
 the President of the Queensland branch, me; and the President of the Western Australian branch, Senator Bishop. So there are three officials of the SDA—
—Paid or unpaid?
—Unpaid officials of the SDA in this place.
—Doing a John Morris.
—No. Senator Alston, I take your interjection. No, definitely not that, but definitely so that people understand who is whom and where they come from. There are also three people in this chamber who are on the national council of the SDA: Senator Brian Harradine, Senator Mark Bishop and me. I point that out because that was an erroneous statement by Senator Allison in the first place. Then we have had the litany of speakers from the Democrats coming in here and throwing rocks. They are the last people in the world who should throw rocks. As a matter of fact, if you look at them, not even Benji and Lucy would roll over as often as the Democrats do. Senator Murray knows exactly who Benji is and those who listened to Senator Greig's first speech yesterday know who Lucy is.
—They don't throw rocks; they throw marshmallows.
—I will take that interjection too.
—Was that interjection from the chair? I raise a point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President. I call on the chair to withdraw his interjection.
—I make the point, Senator Murray, that I did not interject.
—What we have here is people who come into this chamber and feign conscience, feign equity and feign justice. That is what they come in with as their mantra. And they desert their mantra when it suits them. Look at when they have rolled over in recent times.
Senator Murray interjecting—
—They rolled over on the first wave—and you did it very well, Senator Murray. They rolled over on the GST and did 
 it very well, Senator Murray. You rolled over on the environment, Senator Murray, rolled over on the preamble and, from what we hear, you are rolling over on the second wave as well. You have form on the board, Senator Murray. You are well known in this place for rolling over, being scratched on the tummy by the government and enjoying it. What we have in the Democrats is people who have no principle, who feign equity and justice for their own political ends. I am here today to point out to you people that, before you come into this place and start to throw rocks, you should look at your own behaviour.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH EMPLOYMENT) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Quirke, Sen John",ALP,1999-09-02,"—I think Senator Hogg was a bit hard on Senator Murray. We are all pretty fond of Senator Murray around here. We all know that Senator Murray is basically a decent chap who has a number of problems in life, not the least of which is his own caucus. At the end of the day, Senator Murray came in here and put on a reasonably straight face on this. Let us be straight up and down about this debate. This is the Democrats attempting to get even for all of the stuff they have had to wear this year. Now that you have made it clear, Mr Acting Deputy President Hogg, that they did not do their homework—or indeed that Senator Allison did not do her homework about the present positions of people—I think it would be fair to say that the Democrats must have been smarting. They must have been smarting about all of the deals they have done, all the times they rolled over—I think they were the words you used—for the government. Indeed I was somewhat surprised at the Democrats and I am not normally a person who gets surprised very often. Most times I am a reasonably cynical person about political motivation. However, even I was shocked at the Democrats' behaviour during this year.
In fact, I think the GST debate was probably the one which shocked me the most, because they did a deal with the government which they got nothing out of. I want to single out Senator Allison for this, because I commented in a speech earlier this year that basically the Democrats at the end of these benches were a bunch of fairly odd people 
 with some very odd views. I now regret that because, in fact, what the Democrats got out of it was a pea and thimble trick with diesel fuel. I do not have any great problem with that, but it seems to me that somebody went around to the Democrats and told them that diesel was bad. I do not know who it was who told them that; I am not sure whether one of their few members even went and told them that diesel was bad. But somebody told them that diesel was bad, so that became the big issue of the day—that is, how to make sure that farmers, miners and a few other groups could not get cheaper diesel.
We did not support any part of the GST package, so any concessions or whatever they got out of it are up to them, but I made the comment in here yesterday that what they got out of selling out the taxpayers of this country was the legislative equivalent of 20 Rothmans. I was wrong; I was very wrong. I do not know whether Rothmans come in 10-packs these days, but if they do, that is all these people got out of it. They rolled over for nothing. In terms of the first wave of industrial reforms, it is the same story.
I would have thought the environment was something that these people would have stood firm on. After all, we come in here and listen to them one after another get up and tell us, `We can't have Jabiluka, we can't have this and we can't have that.' There are many senators who agree with them. We listen to Senator Allison come in here day in and day out asking ministers questions on this environmental issue and on the other. Now they are upset about the RFAs. I suspect that one of the things they are upset about is that they have still not been able to do a deal with the government on RFAs. But I do not think it will take very long. We are going to be here pretty late tonight dealing with the RFA Bill; that is all right, we will get it over and done with. It will save the Democrats doing a deal next week. That is the way the whole thing goes. But on the environment, I would have thought that they would have held the line. Did they? They couldn't get into bed quick enough with this government. Anyone would think they were ladies of the night swinging 
 their handbags down in Oxford Street, or wherever it is in Sydney.
—Not Oxford Street!
—Sorry, I withdraw that; I just realised what I said. One of the streets down there—I am not sure where it is—where the ladies of the night swing their handbags.
—And the gentlemen.
—I have no knowledge of that, but I must say that these people jumped into bed so quickly with the government that even Mr Howard and his friends were shocked. What did we get yesterday from a few of them? Senator Allison was probably the most aggressive of all the senators. We had Senator Murray, who is a good-hearted fellow, who tried to put a reasonable face on kicking the ALP. That is what he wanted to do—kick the shoppies and, sadly, kick a number of officials of the shoppies union here. But Senator Murray does not kick too hard. He does it fairly softly and he apologises afterwards, so we are quite fond of Senator Murray for that.
I also want to declare an interest: I am a member of the shoppies union myself. And before the minister interjects, no, I have never received a dollar from them. I just happily pay my membership to one of the best, if not the best, unions in the country. If anyone wants to get a membership form they can do so. Senator Allison said, and I read from the Hansard:
Tonight I want to talk about leadership, about liberation from policy and perhaps principles, about consistency, and about Mr Beazley and the Labor Party. Like many Australians, including 100,000 members of the shoppies union aged under 21, I am trying to work out why Mr Beazley and Labor have backflipped so spectacularly on the issue of youth wages. I am sure that Senator Collins, Senator Bishop and Senator Hogg—all former officials of the SDA—are in the same quandary, and I look forward to hearing their views on the issue later in this debate.
It is a bit rich for Senator Allison to be talking about policy free areas. What is the Democrat policy? The Democrat policy is to go out to the community, tell them impossible things that are absolutely unrealisable in a real world, make people feel good about them 
 and then go around to the Prime Minister's suite and sell them out. That is their form. And that is the form they have adopted here over recent years.
At the end of the day I suspect they are very upset because this was shaping up as something they could bottle up in some sort of deal on the second wave of industrial reforms. I will make the prediction here that the Democrats will probably sup tea at the Prime Minister's table again on the second wave. I could be wrong; I do not want to pre-empt that debate. They may say, `We wouldn't even consider it.' But I suspect that is exactly what they are going to get up to. Somehow or another they are going to go around to the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister is going to say, `You beauty; I can see a mug coming.' He can see a mug coming at at least 400 paces, which is what it is from here to his office. That is what happened on all the other issues: he saw a mug coming. Could he see a mug? And did he get one? And did they help him in the process? They even came in here and gagged the debate for the whole process.
What we find in Senator Allison's address, if we extricate the stuff where she is obviously painting the ALP as a bunch of people who sell out, roll over and twist, is that she tells us that their opposition to this particular proposal is well founded, has principles and has a number of other things going for it. In fact the Democrats have none of these principles. We will be looking very closely at the amendments that they are going to move because in the industrial area the Democrats are well known around the trade union movement, around here and in the ACTU for what they did several years ago.
I think we have had a number of Democrat senators come in here and say, `We are going to test the ALP out on some of our glorious amendments.' I have got to tell the Democrats that when we do a deal we stick, and that will be seen to be true as the day unfolds. We do a deal and we stick to it.
—Are you authorising a policy in the chamber?
—It is a policy that I have always followed, as most people would 
 know, in my political career. This is not my deal but it is a deal that is done by the people I voted into their positions, so we will stick with it.
I will toss one back to the Democrats, and I look forward to their picking up this challenge and running with it. I want to know whether they are going to vote down the second wave of Mr Reith's industrial reforms. I want to know exactly what they are going to do about it. Are they going to come in here and say, `Look, we have had enough deals for the year; two or three good big deals are enough for us,' or are they going to continue on in this de facto relationship that they have with the coalition in this country? That is what it is: a de facto coalition with the coalition parties in this country. That is what will be delivering next year to taxpayers the 10 per cent GST. That is what is going to be delivering to the environment movement a result which would never have got through here had the Democrats decided that they would stick to the principles that they avow every day, day in and day out, here in this chamber.
I do not want to be here tonight any later than I have to be. I think these debates need to be finished. I just want to go back to a few remarks that were made yesterday. I think that ostensibly speakers on this side made out a good case for supporting this particular arrangement. In 1996 the Labor Party lost government and we have been for one term, and now two terms, dealing with most of these so-called reforms from the opposition benches. As a consequence of dealing with them from the opposition benches, we also have to cut the best deals for the people we represent out there. In fact, that is what this arrangement is.
I want to finish my remarks today by saying that one of the more curious arrangements that I have come across has been the deal that has been done between Mr Reith and the Labor Party on this issue. It is as if Mr Reith did not want the deal. I cannot understand it, really. He has spent weeks now bagging it. He has postulated that we are going to break it. He has postulated that in fact we are not going to stick, that we are 
 going to get mugged on the way down here to the chamber or that we are going to get our arms and legs broken by our constituents. Our constituents understand very well that we are in this process to pull out the best arrangement we can for them. But it does not make doing deals easy. When you get an arrangement that is mutually satisfactory, you actually go out and sell it. You do not go out and start bagging it and bagging those people who joined in on it. I think that the debate should proceed. I am sure that most workers in this country will understand the necessity for our use of our vote here in the Senate to achieve the best possible outcomes we can for the people we represent.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH EMPLOYMENT) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1999-09-02,"—I begin my remarks on the second reading of the Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Youth Employment) Bill 1999  by picking up one point from the comments of the previous speaker, and that is a defence of cutting the best deals. As my honourable colleague Senator Bartlett said in his contribution yesterday, the Democrats are not opposing the fact that deals are done in this place. We would just like to see better deals done—not a deal that has given to Peter Reith not only ostensibly what he was after from day one, and that is the indefinite retention of junior rates in federal awards, but also the possible extension and expansion of junior rates to those other 44 per cent of federal awards that do not have them. So, if you are going to cut a deal, cut a better deal.
It is with a great deal of sadness and anger that I am speaking on this legislation today, in the knowledge that yet again, as my colleagues have pointed out, young Australians are being treated as quite expedient and are being betrayed by their parliamentary representatives, and in particular the two `L' parties. This legislation is one of the greatest attacks in a long line of continuing attacks on the rights of young people, and in particular young workers. It is sending a very clear message to young Australians that their rights can be ignored and compromised for so-called economic gain, that they can be discriminated 
 against on a daily basis and that their strident opposition will count for nothing in convincing those people who might be bent on achieving certain political or economic ends.
We have heard a lot in this debate today about the GST, the preamble, diesel and processes—a whole range of predictable attacks on my party, which has been one that has actually stuck to its principles and has spoken out in particular against this Labor sell-out of young people. But we have not heard many substantive or actual justifications or reasonable defences as to why the Labor Party have gone back on a presumably long held position, certainly from 1996 until a couple of weeks ago, that they do not support discrimination on the basis of age.
I thought for once we might get through a speech by Senator Quirke without a sexual metaphor, a sexual analogy. But, no, yet again the Democrats were targeted in sexual terms. I am only thankful that in this contribution he did not call us whores like he did in the last one. Perhaps he would like to come back at some stage and defend the deal that has been struck for young workers without talking about sexual positions or prostitutes for once. I would have thought this parliament had moved beyond that kind of rhetoric and commentary that we have seen for many years.
This legislation is the latest in a line of legislative changes spanning over a decade and two governments. In his contribution, Senator Murray made the point that the Labor Party could have done something about youth wages in the 13 years that they were in office. Of course, in 1996 we had a heated debate in this chamber, debating in particular the Labor Party's opposition amendments that at that stage sought to end discrimination on the basis of age. Yesterday I heard from an honourable senator—one of the right-wing Labor senators—that Labor `joined with the Democrats'—and I will correct that if that is not so—in sending this issue for analysis to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. I am glad that they have decided that they actually supported that move.
It was a bold and clever move by the Australian Democrats at that time. Of course, 
 some of us would have liked to have seen the instant abolition of junior rates but we understood this needed examination by the Industrial Relations Commission, so we agreed to that. In fact, we were the only people that bothered to put in a submission from a political party: only the Australian Democrats put on record their perspective, their views and their policy on this matter.
We have seen a long line of legislative changes that discriminate against young people in this place, legislation usually supported by both parties, from the raising of the age of independence for Austudy by the Labor government to the raising of the age of independence for the youth allowance by this government. The old parties are deeply wedded to the notion that young people are adults when it comes to their obligations in society but they are children when it comes to society's obligations to them. Both parties are very keen to expound the virtues of mutual obligation but it is a one-way street for them: all obligations seem to rest with young people.
The last occasion that the opposition colluded with the government to impose a policy on young people designed to scapegoat them for their lack of employment opportunities was their backflip over work for the dole. Here we have another backflip from Labor on young people's pay rates. Young people were not forgiving then and they are not forgiving now. But not only young people have been outspoken, along with the Democrats, about this deal between Labor and the Liberals; the unions have too.
I must put on record some of the concerns of some of the youth representative and advocacy organisations as well as, of course, those of the ACTU representatives, union representatives and youth affairs councils around the place. Perhaps one the best expressions of concern was that of the President of the Young Christian Workers Movement, Tim Gill. He is the head of an organisation that has long sought equity for young Australian workers. Tim said:
Wages are the lifeblood of a young worker. They provide and determine a standard of living, enable independence and provide the main opportunity to 
 participate in society. Young workers have less bargaining power in the workplace anyway. Their casual job offers no security or predictability, yet they have the same needs as older workers. Young workers are as about cock-a-hoop about this decision—
he is quoting the Prime Minister's comment there—
as you would be if someone put laxatives in your Bonox.
I think that describes it quite perfectly. The National Union of Students is similarly strident, and with good reason. Its National President, Jacob Varghese, said:
It is no wonder that young people are increasingly disenchanted with politics when politicians in Canberra can so glibly decide to continue discriminating against them.
Even Young Labor condemned the federal party for the deal and they have committed themselves to ensuring that the discrimination now entrenched in federal awards will not be extended to state awards. I congratulate women like Stephanie Key, who speaks up on youth affairs issues in South Australia in the Labor Party, for also stating how inappropriate this deal was. So Labor on a federal level are being condemned by state counterparts, by their youth wing and by us.
Much has been made of the opposition by unions to this deal, and rightly so. The whole rationale for union support of the Australian Labor Party is to ensure federal representation of the interests of workers. This bill before us today undermines that very objective. The Labor Party have perpetuated the furphy that wage reduction leads to more employment opportunities. How they intend to restrict this capitulation to junior workers and maintain that adult employment levels are not affected by wage elasticities escapes me. So the unions have every right to be worried and to be angry with a party which seems to have completely reneged on a large part of what it stands for.
As my colleague Senator Bartlett stated earlier in this debate, the ALP have come a very long way in a short time to clinch this deal and support this legislation. How some members of the opposition are reconciling their earlier comments with their actions last week is a complete mystery to all of us. How 
 they will explain their support for this legislation to their constituents and at up-coming preselection contests is also a mystery. I have to exempt Senator George Campbell from that particular difficulty. He put, with great courage, his views on record yesterday, certainly explaining his concerns with this deal. I look forward to seeing him and other people who may share his concerns about discrimination on the basis of age crossing the floor, just as they urged me to do in 1996 when they put forward their amendments to the industrial relations legislation.
I understand that some unions have wanted to direct some members of the Labor Party to do that. That would be very interesting to see. In fact, it reminds me of Senator Sherry's quote from 1996. He exhorted me to cross the floor to support his amendment, and I challenge him to do the same. We might even move it to give him the opportunity to do that. Perhaps he will support an amendment along the lines of replacing junior rates with competency based wages. Perhaps he would simply like to come down here and explain what has happened on this road to Damascus, what has made him completely change his mind to completely contradict views that he put forward so stridently in this chamber in 1996.
That 1996 debate was heated; it was enraged. I was amazed at the level of invective and vitriol that was directed at my colleagues and me in this chamber, in particular from Senator Nick Sherry and, of course, Senator Lundy, who is the voice of youth. She is the youth spokesperson for the Australian Labor Party and even in March this year she referred to youth wages as a reflection of generational elitism, a charge she must now also bear. She spoke of her experiences as a young worker in making that comment.
Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting—
—For Senator Collins, I will actually quote from Senator Lundy:
As a 16-year-old I was able to enter the work force on adult wages. This provided me with an opportunity to participate in society with economic independence. . . I find myself in this place defending this simple notion of dignity for young people 
 in the work force, defending this simple and fundamental right of young people to be able to get a job and be paid wages that are not discriminatory.
That is a great quote from Senator Lundy.
—She's not in this place now.
—I will take that interjection, Senator Bartlett. Senator Lundy is not in this place now but I am sure that, in her role in this place of assisting the shadow minister for workplace relations, she will come down and speak to this legislation, which I do not think she could possibly be happy with, because I know there are certainly many members in the opposition who are not happy with this particular deal. Perhaps Senator Sherry is busy right now comparing notes with Senator Lundy. They are both absent today, certainly in sharp contrast to their behaviour on this issue in 1996.
But, given the vacuum of information from the Labor Party defending this deal, I will explain why the Australian Democrats not only will oppose this but will not sell out on young people. We know there is no doubt that youth wages are discriminatory. No-one has disputed this fact. They contravene article 7 of the United Nations International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which we are signatories to. The existence of youth wages relies on an exemption from the antidiscrimination provisions of the Workplace Relations Act, and this situation will be perpetuated indefinitely, thanks to the Labor Party.
Youth wages—and this was put forward by Senator Campbell yesterday—are a historical accident in our workplaces. They emanate from a time when young people's incomes were determined according to the needs principle. They were never designed as an employment enhancement measure but because, in the words of the Argus newspaper back in 1926:
Boys only a few months from school in many walks of life are receiving wages which not many years ago were those of men with family responsibilities, while business, factory and shop girls in their teens are remunerated upon a scale which is a standing temptation to extravagance, thoughtlessness and irresponsibility. 

These words appeared almost three-quarters of a century ago and, despite massive social and economic changes that have taken place in the interim, this is still the message which the old parties in this place are sending to young workers—this week in particular. The old parties have run a mile from the notion of comparative wage justice, leaving behind all the people who have supported them, forsaking the words they were uttering so boldly and proudly just two weeks ago, let alone almost three years ago during a comparable debate on this matter. No; the ALP is now content for young people to continue to be the only participants in the labour market who are paid according to their personal characteristics, not their skill, experience, expertise or education but their age—a discriminatory factor.
Much of the blame for the failure to expand wage based contractual training arrangements in Australia lies with inadequate wage structures and this bill, as my leader, Senator Meg Lees, has said, is a lost opportunity to improve young people's access to workplace training. Since the mid-1980s, no other OECD country has offered its young people fewer opportunities to acquire recognised vocational qualifications at the point of labour market entry than Australia. Current junior rates do not contain structured training or skill development components. As such, they provide the employer with a strong incentive to use the young employee merely in a productive capacity rather than as a learner and rather than allowing for training provisions. But minimal training provisions now are the legacy of this country as a consequence of these wage arrangements.
The ALP capitulation on this legislation precludes us from inserting training components into award determination provisions. Not only are the government and the opposition happy to condemn young workers to pittances of pay rates for work of equal value to their older colleagues; they are now preventing young people from accessing training opportunities while they are actually earning that pittance. Of course, many young workers work in low skilled occupations: 49.4 per cent of 15- to 19-year-olds work in the retail 
 sector, 8.8 per cent in manufacturing, and 8.6 per cent in cafes and restaurants. Even more startling is the fact that the three large companies responsible for approximately one-third of youth employment are Coles Myer, Woolworths and McDonald's, company and franchises. They are responsible for most of the youth positions in the work force in this nation. I would be very interested to hear from the members of the opposition, hopefully, or government. Maybe they could try to argue that work in these companies under junior rates is highly skilled or that 15-year-olds are less proficient at making hamburgers or operating a supermarket checkout than 19-, 20- or 21-year-olds. Certainly Senator Andrew Murray has put on the record that there are examples of people up to 22-years-old being paid junior rates. How is it that we can possibly define a 22-year-old in our society as not being an adult, as being essentially a child, a junior?
I will put this on record once again for the Democrats, as we have done many times in public, in the chamber and in our submission to the IRC: we do not oppose the concept of differential wage rates and never have. We just believe that the determining factor in how you are paid should be your skill, your competency, your experience, your education, not your age, which is a discriminatory factor. This hot little deal that Senator Quirke is so proud of not only entrenches, indefinitely retains, junior wage rates in federal awards as they currently exist but, thanks to the case by case provisions, allows the extension. So the ALP is perpetuating, allowing, the notion that discrimination on the basis of age is okay. What a great message to send to not only young workers in our community but older workers. If they have really fallen for this correlation between wage rates and employment opportunities, what is to stop the ALP, in a deal with Mr Reith, capitulating once again and allowing reduced wage rates for older workers in order to allow for so-called employment opportunities?
I was interested to hear the response of the minister the other day to my question without notice on the issue of the need to protect small businesses through the retention and 
 extension of youth rates. That is what his response was. The government has used the Productivity Commission inquiry into youth wages in support of its contention that low wages equal job creation. Yet this study excluded small business from its consideration although, perhaps, it counted McDonald's franchises, which sometimes, somehow, qualify as small businesses.
At this juncture, it might be useful to actually add some real evidence to the debate. The government has relied on four studies to support its position: the 1983 Bureau of Labour Market Studies study on youth wages and employment levels; the 1997 report of the Productivity Commission; the Australian Retailers Association survey of members; and, of course, the report of the IRC into junior rates of pay. The first three studies do not bear up particularly well to scrutiny. The BLMS report made no allowance for dynamics or different levels of technology in different workplaces and the impact of these factors in hiring decisions.
In addition to the aforementioned criticism of the Productivity Commission report of last year, it confuses male adult, adult female and junior data sets in its elasticity estimates. It does not discuss the relationship between changes in minimum wages for juniors and consequent changes in youth earnings. Even more interestingly, the Productivity Commission report manages to conclude on the one hand that there is no relationship between youth employment and youth wages, by finding that adult workers are complements rather than substitutes for youth in employment, and that adult employment will fall with any rise in youth wages. However, it also manages to find to the contrary as well, as expounded on many occasions by Peter Reith, who obviously did not read the rest of the report. Perhaps page 67 was the only page he read.
In the committee stage of this legislation I will expand on some of the difficulties with those other reports, identifying in particular the IRC report, which identifies the twin objectives of equal opportunity for young job seekers and equal treatment of employees, and concludes that age discrimination is a poor 
 means of resolving these. I am sure we will hear many more examples and excerpts from the IRC report as we continue in this debate. But the Democrats have always favoured—and we are not ashamed of this—a case by case analysis to undertake the development and implementation of alternatives, those very alternatives that the commission was precluded from doing so.
On this matter, young people are not going to be sold out by the Australian Democrats on this issue, but they sure have been by a combination of the government and its dirty deal with the opposition. If you are going to defend doing deals, do better deals, but do not do deals that not only indefinitely retain youth wages in the 56 per cent of federal awards to which they already apply but then give Mr Reith exactly what he was after, and that is the opportunity to extend and to expand junior rates of pay to the other 44 per cent of awards that currently are not affected. It is a dirty deal and one that the constituents of the ALP, their members and their backbenchers are not going to forget.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-09-02,"—In 1996 Senator Stott Despoja said in regard to the notion of discrimination on the basis of age:
There is breathtaking hypocrisy in here this afternoon.
I think little has changed in 1999. We have to make it clear that in 1996 it was the Democrats who gave the numbers to the Reith-Kernot deal to extend the laws discriminating against young people and to keep youth wage discrimination on the statutes. That in turn has led to the situation where Labor can join with the government to keep the discrimination going.
What the Democrats did in 1996, Labor is doing in 1999. In 1996, former Senator Margetts from the Greens (WA) said:
Two years ago I thought the whole aspect of youth wages was based on the NIMTO principle—that is, Not In My Term of Office principle.
She noticed that that was continuing. She said:
It is time we bit the proverbial bullet.
She also said:
We finally have heard that it is not the Democrats preferred position—
that is, to keep youth wages going—
and it is basically to avoid a double dissolution that they are going against their own preferred position.
Senator Margetts went on to say:
This is no basis upon which a good decision should be made in the Senate.
I concur. So, of the parties in this place, only the Greens, right throughout this decade, have stood against the discrimination in wage fixing in this country against people on the basis of their age.
I agree with the content of the speeches of Senator Stott Despoja, Senator Murray and the other Democrats senators that we should not discriminate against people on the basis of their age. Wages should be fixed on the other parameters that have been so cogently put forward. But we cannot get away from the fact that this opportunity to keep the discrimination going is built on the basis that the Democrats established in this chamber in 1996. People who are aggrieved against youth wage discrimination continuing in this country are aggrieved because of the actions of the Democrats, and now the Labor Party, and always the coalition. Let us have that straight.
A fundamental argument is that we need to take money off some young people by not paying them adequately to create employment and training opportunities for other young people. It is a specious argument. There is a rapidly growing gap between the haves and the have-nots in this country. This legislation is an effort to keep in place the discrimination against the have-nots in our young working population.
Mr Acting Deputy President, I wish to move a second reading amendment, which has been circulated. I move:
Omit all words after ""That"", substitute ""this bill be not further proceeded with until separate legislation has been enacted to prevent corporations, which employ young people at rates less than those given to other employees who do similar work, from providing to any person a remuneration package in excess of $1,000,000 in any given year"".
If we are going to take money from one lot of workers to create jobs or training for other 
 people, surely we must start with the workers who have the most money. We are in a situation in Australia where there are now dozens of chief executive officers taking home more than $1 million each year in their package.
Let me refer to an article by Jody Scott in the Australian of 9 August this year headed, `Fat cats grow fatter as they roll in their options'. There is a chart in that article labelled `Top of the tree' which lists Australia's highest paid chief executives. I will read from that chart:
. Frank Lowy, Westfields Holdings, $6.44 million—
this is in one year—
. George Trumbull, former AMP chief executive, $4.95 million
. Paul Batchelor, new AMP boss, salary yet to be settled
. Dennis Eck, Coles Myer, $3.3 million
. Rob Ferguson, Bankers Trust, $3.25 million
. Robert Kirby, Village Roadshow, $3.2 million
. Allan Moss, Macquarie Bank, $3.1 million
. David Morgan, Westpac, multi-million dollar salary plus proposed $32.49 million share options performance package
. John McFarlane, ANZ, $2.77 million—
and on it goes. We go right down to Gerry Harvey at Harvey Norman who is on $250,000 but owns a 33 per cent stake in the Harvey Norman empire worth $1.03 million. I am not for a communistic principle which says, in the worst of enforced dictum, that everybody shall get exactly the same amount. I believe in free enterprise.
—A huge concession.
—You've come out on this one.
—We are getting some government input to the debate now. They might be able to bring up some of these matters with President Jiang Zemin, the communist leader they will be entertaining next week.
However, in the meantime, the Greens believe that everybody should get a guaranteed adequate income which makes sure that they have an opportunity, in particular, to be 
 in the work force. What we do not accept is that we should be here locking in discriminatory wages against young Australians while doing nothing about these obscene income packages going to a handful of super-rich people. We are in a world where 535 individuals own as much of the wealth as the 1½ billion poorest people on the planet. That is out of control. That needs legislative action. That needs politicians with guts. That needs a government with principle. I find that the prospect of locking in here again discrimination against young people, who are getting very tiny wages compared to these packages, with no mention—except for a Green intervention—of these people because of the influence that they have over the political domain in this country, is quite extraordinary. We will see how we go with that amendment.
Senator Murray has made it abundantly clear why we do not have a desperate need to get this legislation through here today. We do have ample time to adopt this Greens amendment and look at least at balancing legislation. After all, the amendment which the Greens have moved will affect far fewer Australians than the legislation we have before us now. It will be a restraint on wages for far fewer people in Australia than would be the case under this legislation. So, whatever argument might be put about the discriminatory nature of it, it pales into insignificance when compared with the number of people that this discriminatory legislation we have before us will affect.
I oppose the legislation. I hope Labor will reconsider. I accept the contributions from the Democrats as genuine. It is a pity, however, that the Reith-Kernot deal occurred when it did. It is a blot on the historic record as far as the Democrats' avocation to ending discrimination in the workplace is concerned. But we cannot ignore it because, without it, we would not be here today enabling this discrimination to continue.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH EMPLOYMENT) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1999-09-02,"—It has been a fascinating debate. I must say that I think a number of senators have actually risen to the bait. What the Democrats seem to fail to under 
 stand is that the reason the Labor Party has rolled over on this is not so much because it just thought that it had to do something different for a change; it is because it had nowhere else to go, because all the logic takes you inexorably in this direction.
Rabid zealots like Senator Brown—who regard international conventions as ends in themselves irrespective of the consequences for ordinary citizens, let alone young people—will of course never countenance any compromise on these issues. But the fact is, however, that, if we look at the situation in the UK, we see that the UK Low Pay Commission concluded that:
Those in the youth labour market—
—They don't want the UK, do they?
—Well, it is a nice, friendly Labour government over there.
—No; I said, `They don't want the UK, do they?'
—Well, of course; they don't want anything except zealotry. The UK Low Pay Commission concluded:
Those in the youth labour market or trying to enter that market are among the most vulnerable in the work force. Above all else, they need work, and they need work which will allow them to acquire basic skills to enable them to develop. In any case, of course, low pay is a transitory experience for most junior employees. Under the junior rates system, employees can expect to progress to higher paid jobs every year providing they remain in employment. When they develop the skills and experience, they can compete successfully for jobs that are paid at adult rates.
I was intrigued to hear Senator Stott Despoja rabbiting on about the right to be not discriminated against. But, of course, what that UK report says so eloquently is that they have an even greater right, and that is a right to a job. They would much prefer to have money in their pockets and food on the table than to have some sort of high-minded principle when in the dole queue.
What is very difficult for the Democrats to come to terms with is that they pushed long and hard for the very inquiry that has now come down and comprehensively rejected their position. The series of amendments that 
 they have proposed were all considered and rejected by the AIRC. Indeed, the whole notion of a competency based wage system has been comprehensively rejected by the independent umpire. The commission found that none of the non-discriminatory alternatives to junior rates put to it were feasible. Competency based classifications were not even the best of the bunch of options available. They said that there was an indisputable relationship between junior rates, their possible abolition and the employment prospects of young people.
The Democrats' proposal is that the replacement of the age based structure with a competency based model should not be on a lowest common denominator basis. They argue that young people must be given the same wage as an entry level adult would expect to receive. This would mean that the cost of employing a 15-year-old, employed under typical junior rates, would increase 150 per cent; for a 16-year-old, 100 per cent; for a 17-year-old, 67 per cent; and, for an 18-year-old, 40 per cent. I do not think there can be much doubt on any of those numbers that no employer in his or her right mind would regard the fact that someone happened to be 15 and not deserving to be discriminated against as a sufficient reason to pay those sorts of premiums.
Quite clearly the whole notion of age does equate with experience. We all know that in our own lives. The AIRC recognises it, as do young people. Of course there are professional industry advocates who want to run the line that somehow young people support ongoing discrimination against their right to work. But as to this notion that is being trotted out by the Australian Democrats that somehow 22-year-olds do not deserve to be discriminated against, the fact is that only one federal award of nearly 1,700 surveyed by the AIRC has a junior rate for a 21-year-old. So the bill leaves the ages to which junior rates apply to be determined by the commission on a case by case basis.
—It was 22, not 21.
—There is only one for 22. Okay, my note is wrong, but that is 
 consistent with the proposition I am advancing. I defer to that.
I understood that the Democrats—at least Senator Stott Despoja, who presumably does not speak for the Democrats on many of these issues—were nonetheless arguing that the Democrats supported a case by case assessment. If that is the case, it is quite extraordinary that the very report which they called for for so long and which comprehensively rejects their position should only be touched on with the merest feather by Senator Stott Despoja. You can throw around terms like `sell out of young people' as much as you like, but the fact is that what the Labor Party has done is actually to stand up to the trade union movement. It is only for five minutes. It is only a tactical retreat. No-one for a moment thinks that this signals a new era of independence. They still remain wholly owned subsidiaries. We only had to see this parade of people jumping up to demonstrate their union credentials to show—
—Where?
—We had Senator Campbell, Senator Hogg—
—Two.
—Who else was there? Senator Quirke.
—Three.
—That is three out of probably five people in the chamber at the time. Senator Campbell was not able to speak because he was in the chair. They are falling over themselves to demonstrate that they have not lost faith with the cause. It is pretty clear what the union movement expect for their investment, for putting all these people in parliament. They expect some return and they do not think they are getting it.
`I cannot understand why the ALP would be embracing a key element of the deregulated labour market agenda of the Liberals' is about the only statement of principle I have seen. Your beloved Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association national secretary said, `I think as a union we have got to review our relationship. This goes to show you cannot rely on the Labor Party to represent your point of view in parliament.' In 
 other words, what he is saying is, `They have always been in our back pocket. We have always been able to rely on them 100 per cent, but now there is a bit of a doubt.' In other words, `Gosh, maybe they are not the mouthpieces that we paid them to go into parliament to be.' I can understand why he is very concerned. He will be wanting his money back at the next preselection round, probably so he can come in and have a go himself. It would probably be a pay increase.
There is a whole litany of unionists who are very, very annoyed. Jennie George—and I suppose Senator Stott Despoja thinks she deserves a seat in the state parliament of New South Wales but I doubt that many people on the Labor Party side do—is here again claiming that union leaders—and I suppose the feminist network does, do they, Senator Collins?
—What was that?
—They think that Jennie George should get a seat in the upper house in New South Wales. 
—No idea.
—No? No idea. No comment.
—No idea.
—No idea? That is even worse—not interested.
—She would make a first-class parliamentarian.
—This is very worrying, Senator Murray. You have obviously been spending too much time with the ACTU.
—Minister, it might help if you directed your remarks to the chair.
—Thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President. Of course, she expressed the claim that, `Union leaders had unanimously expressed deep concern and disappointment. The unions were very angry at the ALP. We are supposed to be on the same side.' But of course Mr Crean reassured them that this was only really a little blip. He said, `These things will heal. What we have to do is try and find a position that can actually get the numbers in the parliament and 
 then ensure an agenda that the government was hell-bent on introducing is not carried out and that we succeeded in.' I am not quite clear what he is saying there. `We are supporting junior wage rates until we get the numbers in parliament when we will do what you ask us to do and repeal them'? Not very inspiring stuff. If this whole backflip strategy is designed to enable Mr Beazley to go out there and say, `Look, I stood up to them; I am not the wholly owned doormat you thought I was. I am not simply trotting out to everything that the union movement asks us. I have taken on the full raft of our employers,' it is sending a mixed message, isn't it?
I suppose the answer to all that is that Mr Beazley says one thing and Mr Crean says another. We are happy to regard that as healthy competition. Senator Campbell has made it plain with his actions in recent days. He has got nowhere else to go, and I suspect a lot more people will be going in that same direction. The union movement lives in hope that Mr Crean will get up and reverse this deal. But for the time being at least, we applaud the Labor Party's morality on this issue.
—Have you read Mr Crean's statements on this?
—Yes. I just quoted one of them. He said to the union movement, `Don't worry. As soon as we've got the numbers, we'll fix it up for you.' That is probably sufficient for our purposes.
I do not have anything more to say on the subject. The evidence is overwhelming. Anyone who reads the AIRC report will understand that there is no way to approach this issue other than to put the rights of young workers to a job ahead of any other consideration. We are delighted that at least the Labor Party acknowledges that.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH EMPLOYMENT) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,1999-09-02,"—I welcome the Coal Mining Legislation Amendment (Oakdale Collieries and others) Bill 1999  into the Senate today and the government amendments which passed through the House of Representatives earlier this week. Although I commend the government on the bill, which finally provides full payment to the workers from the Oakdale mine, I am also disappointed at the amount of 
 time and the events that had to transpire before they were forced to take that action.
It is well known that Labor have been advocating for the protection of workers' entitlements for a number of years. Labor introduced bills into both chambers in the last parliament. In this parliament I introduced the Employment Security Bill 1999 [No. 2]  in May this year. Had the government been willing to work with us on the issue then, and had they been willing to work towards protecting the livelihood of normal Australians, many Australians would have been saved from financial and emotional hardship.
When there was still no action from the government after I introduced the Employment Security Bill 1999 into the Senate, I wondered how much more prompting the government needed. Unfortunately, it took an event so large and so outrageous to the Australian community that it forced the government to do something. The event I am referring to is the closure of Oakdale Collieries.
Back in May this year, the workers of Oakdale Collieries turned up to work only to find that their jobs had disappeared. Their company went into liquidation and they were left on the unemployment scrap heap. Under a government more interested in cost cutting than assisting people, they had limited access to adjustment assistance. The tragedy of job loss—the tragedy that affects a quarter of a million workers every day—is bad enough. Like most workers in such a predicament, they knew they would not be able to rely on the government to assist them in transition to their next job. Unemployment can be demoralising, but it is particularly so when you know you have to go it alone.
But for the workers of Oakdale, like many others, the story gets even worse. The entitlements that they had accumulated over years of hard work, worth a total of over $6 million, had also disappeared. They were told that these entitlements, which they had always thought were secure, provided the firm with working capital at a cheap rate. Some people even had the audacity to tell them that these entitlements were not actually theirs; that they had knowingly loaned them to the company 
 and, it had just so happened, that the debt went bad. This is not just a distortion of reality; it is a moral outrage. Who asked them whether their money could be used in unscrupulous operations?
It was for this reason that, when the jobs of 125 coalminers were terminated without access to their long service leave, their annual leave, their sick leave or their redundancy pay, the public began to focus on the problem. The workers at Oakdale, like those at Cobar and Woodlawn before them, had to fight for what was theirs. Their union, the CFMEU, campaigned strongly to protect the interests of these workers, and I am pleased to say that they did so with the full support of the Labor Party. With the weight of public opinion behind these workers, the government was forced to back down. The government has now agreed to pay these workers from the coal industry's long service leave fund.
This legislation provides for full payment to the former employees of Oakdale. In taking this step, the government has acknowledged that these moneys are entitlements. I trust that whatever scheme the government develops to deal with the broader issue will maintain that principle. There are already concerns associated with capping in the current proposals. That may mean problems for the government when you consider that, in the case of Oakdale, the employees will get 100 per cent entitlement but a future regime may mean something different. It may mean something different for workers who, under this current scenario, would have access to 100 per cent payment now it has been extended to situations which may occur between now and the end of the year and not just the Tasmanian example that was originally canvassed.
As I said, Labor supports this bill, particularly as the government has made amendments to provide for the payment of entitlements to the eight coal workers from Maryvale in Tasmania and, I believe, any other employee who may be affected by the closure of a mine before the end of the year. Let us hope that miners after the end of the year will attract as attractive entitlements. This bill is a sensible short-term response to this issue, but is only a short-term response; and it is a 
 belated response because this issue has been around for many years.
Australian workers in small TCF companies have been losing their entitlements for many years. The number of medium-sized companies that have gone bust over recent years is on the rise. They go bust owing workers substantial amounts of money. This is a very worrying trend, particularly with the government's agenda of further weakening the powers of regulation that exist that usually regulate these matters for workers. It is a trend that peaked, of course, with the Patricks debacle. The most worrying element of that trend was that the government was actually caught up in that matter. The government willingly conspired in the Patricks debacle. As a consequence, there were problems associated with employee entitlements very similar to those that were faced by the Oakdale workers that the government has now been forced to accept it has to meet.
Patricks was a situation in which a company deliberately restructured its finances to strip money out of parts of its organisation and put it into other sections of the corporate structure. This was done deliberately to ensure that workers would be denied their entitlements—denied any claim to accrued entitlements of annual leave, sick leave, redundancy payments and long service leave. They did this because they intended to sack them and they did not want to pay them a cent. It is bad enough that a company actually thought to do that with no regard to the effects it would have on so many of their employees and their families, but what is worse is that the government and, in particular, Minister Reith knew about it—they supported it; they assisted it.
This government is on the record endorsing that practice of Chris Corrigan and his company of asset stripping to ensure that workers would not get access to their funds. We cannot go into too much detail because there are still some legal cases floating around about that. One day, though, those legal cases might get to court, and won't it be good for the Australian public to see the full disclosure in court of the sordid details which many of us in this place know about but are con 
 strained from talking about. That is the history of this government's approach to employee entitlements.
You would have thought that, by the time we got to the Oakdale dispute—with the public support that the Oakdale miners clearly had and with the concern that was palpable in the Australian public about this problem—that the government might have been a little more sensitive, but it was not. No less a person than the Prime Minister was hitting the airwaves—and I seem to recall a particularly astounding interview with Alan Jones—defending the right of companies to take their workers' money and use it for whatever they wanted.
The assumption that everyone can look after themselves is a dangerous one for both the individuals concerned and for society as a whole—just ask the Oakdale miners, their families and their community. They thought they had provided for themselves, thought their own hard work would help provide for them, only to find an unscrupulous employer ready to rip their entitlements out from under them and only to discover a government that, until now, did not care about looking for ways to preserve employee entitlements.
I would like to add here one matter that the government may well raise. I have heard many times the argument that Labor did not do anything about this over 13 years of government. It is a common response, but unfortunately it does not actually represent the facts. The fact is that, historically, this problem occurred in small TCF companies where often the amounts that workers had been denied were nowhere near as significant as, for instance, in the case of Oakdale. Notwithstanding that problem, Labor has done things over the years to try to preserve employee entitlements. That is why we no longer face this problem in the area of superannuation. People might recall that the genesis of the debate about superannuation was to ensure that companies were not `misinvesting' employee superannuation funds. Now we move on to one further step of reform: we want to ensure that employers are not `misinvesting' other employee entitlements.
It is not good enough for governments to treat people we claim to represent in the manner that they have on this issue. The Howard government elected to wait it out in the hope that they would not have to budge. While the government waited it out, and then while they ummed and ahed about whether they should give the workers the money they had earned, 125 miners from Oakdale and their families suffered great financial hardship and stress.
The hard work of the CFMEU and the Labor Party, and the decency of ordinary Australians in their response on this matter, made the government change their position. It reminds me of the position of ordinary Australians on the decisions of the government post Patrick. It was a pity that Mr Reith did not actually realise that that was the sort of response he would get to his behaviour before the fact; we might not have had that debacle.
When working Australians are next under the hammer, I do not expect to see the government standing up for their rights; in fact, I do not know if I have ever heard John Howard or Peter Reith utter the words `workers' rights'. On the contrary, this government is hell-bent on destroying the rights of Australian workers, a prime example being the second wave of Reith legislation that is currently before a Senate committee. The government will not get away with it, because Australians do have a sense of fairness; they will deny legitimacy to any government proposing to do to Australian workers what the Howard government wants to do. In some cases, like this one, the Howard government will eventually realise that the weight of public opinion is such that it cannot do it.
The broad issue of employee entitlements is not a simple one. Let us be clear about that. However, it starts with a relatively simple premise that people work their butts off, accruing entitlements along the way; they work hard, with one eye on keeping their heads above the water, and the other eye looking to the future. When that future is suddenly taken away, the effect is quite deep. The capacity to feed, clothe, house and entertain not just ourselves but those for 
 whom we are responsible is suddenly jeopardised, and that is despite the fact that we have worked for that future. When we work for our future nobody has the right to take it away. Strong government must recognise this. It is not a costless exercise, but the issue at stake is a threshold one: it is about protecting those who play by the rules. In the end, it is about accepting shared responsibility as a basic statement of the sort of society we choose to live in.
I think I will skim over my concluding remarks and, with the government's acceptance, once they look at them, incorporate them, for the sake of brevity. In this non-controversial legislation I am keen to allow all of your agenda to pass through. I will just briefly refer to a couple of comments I have with respect to the revised explanatory memorandum that Minister Alston circulated in the chamber a couple of hours ago.
I note the change with respect to options in that revised explanatory memorandum. It was a point I was going to make. I was going to query whether you were going to amend the explanatory memorandum in light of the amendments, because this bill is no longer about a one-off example; it is about whatever examples of similar cases occur between now and the end of the year. A query on that relates to the fact that I am assuming that there are no workers who have access to this fund who have been in similar circumstances and have received only a partial payout who may equally feel they have some claim on the fund. I am not aware on the spot of examples that would fit that category, but I understand from some limited advice that that is not the case.
The explanatory memorandum also, I believe, on a quick look, adds an option, option 3, which refers to matters pertaining to the government's discussion paper. I am somewhat amused that it is presented here as an option. I assume that is in response to criticisms in the House of Representatives about the fact that this is only a partial solution and that we need a broader solution into the future post next year. But given the way it is expressed here, my query is: is this really an option? We look, for instance, at the 
 discussion of impact on government—benefits and costs—that would be assessed in decision making on the national scheme. Fair enough, but, if you are not going to say anything, why bother presenting it as an option?
My other query on the explanatory memorandum is with respect to the costs associated with option 1, where we talk about the costs and the impact on government, and the comment there is `Nil'. I suppose you can argue that on a very narrow meaning of option 1, but I would have thought the potential consequences of the government's decision to go down this path in relation to Oakdale were much broader: they are as broad as the costs and benefits associated with the discussion paper that we will be considering, and on various scenarios they could be quite considerable.
But the government have established, I believe, a worthy precedent on this matter. I think it will be difficult, on the basis of the Oakdale decision, for them to then argue that a national scheme should be tightly capped, and I direct that point also at Senator Murray. It is going to be a very difficult argument for the government to run that Oakdale miners are entitled to get 100 per cent of their payments and that mine workers in the future, when a mine might suffer a closure, should get only, for instance, $20,000. That will be a very difficult argument for the government to address, I believe, in the future debate.
But, as I said, I am seeking to keep my comments brief in order to facilitate the process of non-controversial legislation so that we can get through as much business as we can today. I was going to seek leave from the Senate to incorporate my remaining concluding remarks but that is no longer necessary.",SENATE,<title>COAL MINING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (OAKDALE COLLIERIES AND OTHERS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-09-02,"—Senator Collins, I am interested by your view of brevity when it comes to non-controversial legislation. I think you saved us three minutes out of 20 and I am quite sure your whip will be reminding you of the fact. Whilst I am addressing this bill, with your leave, Mr Deputy President, I want to acknowledge the presence in the government advisers box of Mr Anderson. I want to formally place on the Senate record my 
 appreciation, and I hope Australia's appreciation, for his outstanding work at the Geneva conference on the convention of child labour. He carried Australia's flag very high. I was fortunate enough to witness his work, and you have the compliments of me and my party for your efforts, Mr Anderson.
Turning to the Coal Mining Legislation Amendment (Oakdale Collieries and others) Bill 1999 itself, I am always somewhat surprised by the nature of the remarks opposition parties and coalition parties exchange over legislation such as this. I would have thought this was a time to be gracious and congratulatory, because this is genuinely a bill which is warmly welcomed by the Australian Democrats and by many of the Australian people. I think it meets a need that really had to be met. Senator Collins is quite right in that the government were resistant to going down this path originally, but they were never resistant to the idea that the coalminers at Oakdale should have an accommodation of some sort or the other. You might ask why I know that. I know that because I have been pursuing the general issue of a national entitlements scheme with the government and with the minister, and he at all times has made it clear to me in those discussions that if Oakdale miners could be accommodated the government would wish to do so. On the record, I do wish to acknowledge that they have wanted to do that.
But far more important in this debate is to commend the CMFEU, whose strong advocacy and passionate defence of their workers' needs turned the public relations tide, turned the media tide and was able in the end to persuade the government to overcome the employers' rejection of going down this route. They deserve some warmth in this debate. Plainly, too, the Labor Party and the Democrats fully supported this mechanism, and therefore I have to express our pleasure—on behalf of the Democrats—that this has happened.
I should also make a remark on Senator Collins's remarks about corporate restructuring. In 1988 a recommendation was made as to how to deal with corporate restructuring processes which result in bad outcomes for 
 creditors and employees. That was from the Law Reform Commission during the time of the Labor government. Finally, when we had had enough of all that, we moved an amendment—in 1996 or 1997; I cannot recall the exact year off the top of my head—to fix the corporate restructuring problem. Labor supported us, the amendment went down to the House, the government rejected it, it came back here, and Labor did not insist on it. In relation to all that stuff about Patrick, restructuring and so on, it would have been helped if you had insisted on the amendment which you had already supported in the first place.
In closing, Parliamentary Secretary, I give the thanks of the Australian Democrats for producing this bill, for meeting the needs of those workers, and I look forward to the government developing a national employee entitlements scheme which will relieve much of the pain so many workers have felt for decades from being unprotected in this area.",SENATE,<title>COAL MINING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (OAKDALE COLLIERIES AND OTHERS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"West, Sen Sue",ALP,1999-09-02,"—I rise briefly—and I will be brief, unlike my colleague—
—Oh—
—I am sorry, it was a very good speech by Senator Collins, and Senator Collins has actually made a number of the points that I wished to make so there is no need for me to do that.
—That's never stopped you before.
—Order! This is non-controversial legislation.
—Senator Quirke, that is not warranted.
—They are fighting amongst themselves.
—We are not fighting. Senator Collins's contribution was excellent, and the point that she made was an important point—the fact that Labor, when we were in government, had undertaken to overcome a number of the anomalies and problems that were being wrought in relation to employees in this country by unscrupulous employers, particularly in relation to hopping into the 
 superannuation funds of the employees and raiding those so that people were left with no superannuation.
But whilst the Coal Mining Legislation Amendment (Oakdale Collieries and others) Bill 1999 covers those who work in the coal industry and are covered in the coal industry it does not cover those who are in other metalliferous mines, those in the TCF industry, those in building, those in child care, or those in the abattoirs or the meat industry. That is just to name a few areas where I am personally aware of employees who have lost their jobs because their employer has gone into bankruptcy, for whatever reason, and have lost quite considerable amounts of money.
We still know very clearly about the Cobar miners, who are still probably five to 10 per cent short of their final payouts. They have been waiting now for about 20 or 21 months since they were made redundant. The Woodlawn miners have received nothing. We have had the abattoirs at Grafton go belly up.
Yesterday I was talking to some textile workers from Melbourne and they outlined to me that they had lost their jobs. One of them had 10 years service and was going to get nothing; in fact, he had worked the last week of his employment for free, because at the end of that week they were not paid. He not only lost his 10 years of entitlements because of being made redundant; he also lost a week's pay. He was able to outline to me very clearly some of the shenanigans that the employer, the owner, had indulged in, changing and swapping around companies and items within various companies and moving assets around within his companies. In fact, the receiver had been called in, and he alleged that the receiver that he had used was the accountant in one of his other companies. One has to question that, and I am sure that that will be done through the role of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission.
I am also aware of another company that was picked up as having insolvency problems only because the Taxation Office, at the end of the 12 months, asked them where their employees' compulsory superannuation was, as it had not been paid in. That company 
 went into liquidation and a number of the employees lost their superannuation entitlements. Those employees were on the list of creditors but were not advised of the final meeting for creditors. So there are lots of these examples happening within these business failure regimes where the employees are being ripped off.
We only hear about the Oakdales and the Woodlawns and the abattoir at Grafton because there are large numbers of employees involved. We do not hear about the small ones with five, six, 10 or 20 employees because they fail to make the headlines and get the coverage that is needed. Often, of course, these small places also have non-unionised work forces so that they are really on their own battling to get some redress of their justifiable grievance.
I think it is very good that we are able to provide the Oakdale miners with the rights that they are entitled to, along with the miners from Tasmania and the others in the coal industry, by the end of the financial year. But there are a lot of employees out there that have been made redundant because their company or their boss has gone into receivership or liquidation and they have received, and will receive, nothing.
This opposition has been pushing for some considerable time now to close that loophole. I know that some members of the government say, `But you had 13 years.' Senator Collins has already advised of one of the number of measures that we took to close the loopholes, but the employers have moved on to try to exploit another loophole. This government is almost halfway through its second term and it is about time that it did something more constructive than just talking about possibly introducing some legislation to overcome the problem for employees other than those in the coal industry.",SENATE,<title>COAL MINING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (OAKDALE COLLIERIES AND OTHERS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",IND,1999-09-02,"—I preface my remarks in supporting this bill by informing the Senate that I do have mining interests. In speaking in support of the bill for Oakdale Collieries, I would like to speak briefly on the rights of those miners. The issue that we have before us today involves wages that have not been paid to 
 those miners, annual leave entitlements and sick leave entitlements.
I believe that we are adapting the Aspro analogy to a problem. We are giving these miners something that will take away the pain temporarily but will do nothing to solve the problem. I believe we need changes to legislation that will give security to workers for their entitlements. We need further amendments to legislation that will guarantee the moneys that are accrued by these workers being held in funds, not available to the employers, to secure those rights for those miners. If we look at the wages, the annual leave entitlements and the sick leave entitlements, that money morally belongs to those workers.
If we look at payments in lieu of notice and severance pay, I believe that, for an initial period, if they are not met by the company they should be met by the government. In setting up legislation that would allow for that, we would also need to give the government some real teeth. Having paid those entitlements to those workers, the government should have the ability to go out and get the money from the individuals and stop them hiding behind these pseudo companies.
There would be two problems if we levied industry to cover these payments. Firstly, it would give anybody who wanted to manipulate the problem an out. A person could say, `It will be all right; the government will pick up the tab.' Secondly, the good guys would be paying for the irresponsible operators, and I believe that that is unjust as well.
There is another source that we could look at from which we could pay for these entitlements. I believe we could look at our overseas aid and assess the merit and need for some of the projects in relation to the needs of the workers of Australia—and I would refer to some of the appropriations that have been used for military purposes in the Asian area. I believe that the rights of the Australian workers should come before giving aid to an Asian area for military purposes, and I do not think there would be too many people in this chamber who would disagree with that.
I commend the government for this step in appropriating for Oakdale Collieries but I would recommend to the Senate that we need 
 to look at the actual problem and find a realistic outcome for it.",SENATE,<title>COAL MINING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (OAKDALE COLLIERIES AND OTHERS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1999-09-02,"—I will be brief, as I understand we have other legislation to deal with at this time of day. I support this legislation and put on the record my strong support for an ongoing process of legislative amendment that will protect all of the rights of workers, particularly their wages, conditions of employment and accrued leave entitlements.
I spent many years in the union movement prior to coming to this place pursuing employers for unpaid wages and entitlements when employees were terminated or resigned and also when companies closed down with very little notice and left workers stranded. In all of that time, I cannot recall the Liberal Party, in opposition or indeed in government in the states, doing anything at all to support the rights of workers in those situations. Indeed, in all of those years the position was that the coalition opposed every single national wage increase for workers, particularly for low paid workers.
This is probably the first time I can recall when anything has come out of this government that actually provides some positive benefit for workers. But a lot more needs to be done. The fact is that it is only through the controversy over the Oakdale situation and earlier situations such as those Senator West has mentioned at Woodlawn, Cobar and Grafton that action has finally started to occur.
It is because of the efforts of the trade unions that these issues are taken up. I ask the government to pause and consider the rhetoric they often use, particularly the minister in this chamber, in attacking the role of unions. I do not have to defend them, but I think it needs to be acknowledged that they are often the only recourse left to workers in this situation to try to pursue rightful payment.
As somebody once said to me, it is often better to be in a union and not need its assistance than to not be in one when you need it. I pay tribute to the CFMEU, to the AWU and to the other unions that have continued to pursue the rights of workers, particularly unpaid entitlements, in this indus 
 try and in many other industries. They will continue to do so, and they are entitled to the support of the parliament of Australia to ensure that those entitlements are paid.",SENATE,<title>COAL MINING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (OAKDALE COLLIERIES AND OTHERS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,1999-09-02,"—I thank honourable senators for their contribution. I particularly thank Senator Forshaw. He was a man of his word when he said that he would be brief. I also want to thank Senator Murray for his comments in congratulating Alexander Anderson. So many times people who are behind the scenes do not get the praise they deserve, and I think congratulations are very appropriate. I am sure he appreciates the comments that Senator Murray made at the beginning of his speech.
Senator West asked a question. I think it was: what will the government do for employees receiving part payments? If this is not the question Senator West asked, I am sure that the minister will look carefully at the Hansard and ensure that the answer is given. But I believe the answer to her question is that, if any employee was dismissed before 31 December 1999 when the employer went insolvent after 1 January 1999, that employee will receive any entitlements not paid by the employer direct from the Coal Mining Industry Long Service Leave Fund. I have been advised that the only known cases are at Oakdale and Merrywood.
With respect to the issues that Senator Collins and Senator Harris raised—and I also acknowledge and appreciate the support for the legislation from the opposition, the Democrats and Senator Harris—the Oakdale bill is not a precedent for a national scheme. A discussion paper has recently been released which proposes a safety net of fair and reasonable protection. As honourable senators know, the coal issue is different because an industry fund already existed to cover the period until a national scheme was introduced. But of course the government is concerned about those people who were not covered by this, and that was raised by honourable senators here. That discussion paper addresses that, and I am sure Senator Harris and Senator West will take an active part in the debate on 
 that discussion paper in order to make it fair and equitable for people who are in employment where their employer is declared insolvent or bankrupt. I thank honourable senators and commend the bill to the chamber.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
Bill read a second time, and passed through its remaining stages without amendment or debate.",SENATE,<title>COAL MINING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (OAKDALE COLLIERIES AND OTHERS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,1999-09-02,"—The Ministers of State Amendment Bill 1999  is merely housekeeping legislation. Because the Howard government increased its cabinet from 15 to 17 after the 1998 election, and because of the differential pay rates between cabinet ministers and non-portfolio ministers, the bill seeks to remedy the financing of that. It is true to say that every new government always makes a mistake in its composition of cabinet. In 1983, the first Labor cabinet left the finance minister in the outer portfolio. In the first Howard cabinet they left the Attorney-General out. Both of those ministers are absolutely critical to cabinet deliberations, but that is soon remedied by experience.
The great pity of this bill is what it does not do. It does not make provision for the payment of parliamentary secretaries. We 
 currently have 12 parliamentary secretaries undertaking a range of responsibilities and a substantial workload for no reward—unless someone can put a figure on psychic salary. In the history of the Australian federal parliament, different terms have been used to cover parliamentary secretaries. They have been called assistant ministers, permanent undersecretaries and parliamentary undersecretaries. The terms have varied throughout history.
There have been a variety of experiments with parliamentary secretaries, often with differing responsibilities, some inside the Executive Council, some not. For instance, the first major experiment in the use of these positions was in 1921-23, then in 1932-36 and then again in 1938-39. In 1942, two honorary assistants—J.J. Clark and Alex Wilson—were appointed to help the then Minister for Commerce and Agriculture. Wilson, of course, was an Independent and not a member of the government parties. Also, R. James, C. Morgan and D. Watkins were appointed to work with the then Minister for Labour and National Service. As I understand it, Prime Minister Menzies continued to experiment with those positions until the mid-1950s. In 1971, Prime Minister McMahon appointed six assistant ministers, or parliamentary secretaries as we now know them. Among them, of course, were Michael Baume and John McLeay. None of those six, however, were members of the Executive Council.
The next major move forward in this regard was by the Hawke government in 1990, which appointed four parliamentary secretaries. Prime Minister Keating, in his first government, appointed eight and, in his second government, had 11 such appointments. The current Howard government has 12 such appointments.
The concept of parliamentary secretaries has occasionally been discussed in parliament. In a parliamentary debate on 25 June 1941, Maurice Blackburn—during one of those periods in which he was in the Labor Party and not expelled, which seemed to be year in and year out—stated:
The Lyons Government tried the experiment of appointing parliamentary under-secretaries. I never 
 understood why the system was abolished because to me it seemed to be a great convenience to Ministers and Members of Parliament.
At the time, many doubted whether it was constitutionally possible to pay these people. Crisp, in his authoritative work in 1949, quoted Menzies as saying in regard to the payment of parliamentary secretaries:
. . . that cannot be done without first amending the Constitution, because those gentlemen, not being Ministers of State, would hold an office of profit under the Crown.
Menzies went on to say:
The system of having Assistant-Ministers is not altogether satisfactory. I have felt myself since becoming Prime Minister, and I am quite sure some of my predecessors must have felt the same thing, that it is desirable that everybody who sits in Cabinet should sit in Cabinet as a Minister of State with specific responsibility for some department of state with accountability to parliament for the way in which he administers that Department.
The payment of parliamentary secretaries was subject to substantial legal evaluation in the mid-1950s by some of the best legal minds in Australia: Barwick, Nigel Bowen, Tom Hughes and a whole range of eminent legal minds. I might say that they were on the conservative side of politics—the conservatives were in government and they were the ones who were thinking about it—but they gave thought to the payment of parliamentary secretaries. Each one basically said, `Be cautious. Don't risk incurring the provisions of section 44 of the Constitution.' This matter was also considered in detail by a very capable Senate committee which reported in 1981. I think it had Senators Evans and Durack and many others on it. They also urged caution in thinking about paying parliamentary secretaries.
All those bodies were of the opinion that the legal impediments which inhibit paying parliamentary secretaries were not easy to overcome. But I am sure that, in terms of modern day legal thinking, a route can be found through this particular impasse. Following the Hawke government changes in 1987, in which you had portfolio ministers and associate or junior ministers, a lot of legal consideration was given at that time to making sure that that regime was valid, and I 
 think the same validity can be passed over to parliamentary secretaries. It is also clear that, when we finally get around to reforming section 44 of the Constitution—which is a day coming closer, I think, because of other problems—we should address this area because it was not really meant by our founding fathers, as office of profit under the Crown, to inhibit the payment of parliamentary secretaries or their like. It simply was not, but that is a consequence of historical interpretation.
Why have parliamentary secretaries? Firstly, the major argument, which I agree with, is workload. The demands on both cabinet and non-portfolio ministers is such that parliamentary secretaries play a major role in easing that workload. Secondly, parliamentary secretary positions are seen as effective apprenticeships before moving on to the ministry and to cabinet.
—Hopefully!
—There are many classic examples where this has occurred, though not for everyone. Nevertheless, it has been a very good training ground—and I do not say that patronisingly—for people to move from the backbench of parliament eventually to cabinet rank. I do not think we have had a parliamentary secretary yet who has become Prime Minister, but we await developments in that regard.
The third reason—to be a little cynical—is that Prime Ministers use parliamentary secretaryships as a means of assuaging the pain of their colleagues who have not yet been seen as suitable for immediate promotion to ministerial rank. There is nothing wrong with that. There would be if parliamentary secretaries were just a title, but because they have such a heavy workload it does not matter whether a Prime Minister of any persuasion is being cynical about it, you have to evaluate the end result.
Most parliamentary secretaries are given real responsibilities. They are not just people put in to sign letters or be a general factotum to a minister. I remember when I was Minister for Defence—it is hard now, it was a long while ago—that I did give one of my parliamentary secretaries responsibility for 
 emergency services in Australia, a distinct area that you could carve easily out of the ministry, and had someone give it a lot more attention than a minister had in the past. I found that worked very effectively. I have seen it in both persuasions of government. You really should give a parliamentary secretary a real area of responsibility, not just use them as a general dogsbody. I think that has been our experience in the parliament, that they have been given real responsibility.
We have seen evolving since 1991 a tendency in this chamber to give a parliamentary secretary the responsibility of Manager of Government Business in the Senate. I might just inform the Senate of how this occurred. I was manager in June 1991. Most people would remember we had a leadership disagreement in the Labor Party at that time. I went to the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, and suggested that Senator McMullan would make a good parliamentary secretary as Manager of Government Business. He snarled at me, `Why should I promote him? He did not vote for me.' I said, `No, but I did.' The lesson of that is that I wanted to get rid of it.
From then on a parliamentary secretary basically had responsibility for managing business, and I think it has worked very effectively. The problem with a minister having that role is that they are constantly pulled out of their office to deal with matters. That interrupts meeting schedules and other particular work, whereas a parliamentary secretary can concentrate on a matter. So it has worked reasonably well.
I would say that, at the very least, a parliamentary secretary performs at the level of a first assistant secretary in the Public Service, plus they do another job. They are a member of parliament with all its full responsibilities. But for all this they receive no remuneration whatsoever. They do receive extra travel rights. But who in politics wants to travel any more than they have to after the first couple of years? They do get additional staff—and that is certainly justifiable with the workload—and they are reimbursed up to $10,000 a year for expenses. That is the sum total of what they get. My view is that parliamentary secretaries should at least receive a salary 
 increment of $20,000 a year for performing the tasks of parliamentary secretary. The total cost to government in a year would be something like $220,000. Of course, no-one would be happy with that, but in the overall budget within DOFA and within this parliament it is a minuscule amount.
People may ask: why didn't the Labor government address this during the period 1990 to 1996? I may be wrong in this, but we judged at that time that we would not get support in this chamber. That was our judgment. It may have been correct, it may have been incorrect, but that is why we never attempted to do it. The fact is that if you think an opposition is going to be opportunistic about this, or you think the minor parties are going to demand staff increases as a pay-off for their support, of course a government would not tackle this particular issue.
I have no idea, if the government progressed the proposal to pay parliamentary secretaries, what the Labor Party attitude would be. All I can say in this chamber is that I will do everything possible to convince the Labor Party that they should be paid. I am sure those who served as parliamentary secretaries in the Hawke and Keating governments would also support any attempt to resolve this particular situation.
The ideal time, of course, to address this is just before the next election. Unless there is an absolute clear-cut matter—
—Oh, straightaway!
—Straightaway.
—I will take those interjections and come back to them. The only reason I say that this is the ideal time is because you are more likely to get it through then because, in reality, even though we are all confident of our own chances, no-one is actually certain who is going to form the next government. So it is fair for everyone. It also means that coalition parliamentary secretaries would have gone ahead unpaid for six years. Guess what? That equates with the previous Labor ones. But if I had my druthers I admit I would pay them from tomorrow.
We have our differences across the chamber, we have our spats across the chamber, 
 but one thing I do at least recognise is that parliamentary secretaries do not, in my view, bludge. They have a substantial workload yet at the same time they have the example of people like me who chair committees. I am getting paid more than Senator Patterson because I chair a committee, and so do a lot of her colleagues and a lot of my colleagues on this side. They have less responsibility, we have to admit. Committee secretaries get an increased salary—and I am not going to knock mine back—but parliamentary secretaries do not get a cent.
In modern society they do not do the task for the money. No-one can tell me that a parliamentary secretary is putting up their hand to do this particular task for the money. Even if we remunerated them, it would not motivate anyone an extra degree to the work level. But you have to recognise that in our parliamentary system there are some pay rate differentials. Of course the Prime Minister gets paid the most, and of course the Treasurer gets paid virtually the next most, and so down the list.
I certainly think it is time to cut the Gordian knot, to again look at the legal consequences and the way through on this particular issue and move as soon as possible for the payment of parliamentary secretaries. If the Labor Party opposes it, at least the coalition can blame the fat Indian up the back here and quote me and assuage any political damage that will be done by it.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERS OF STATE AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1999-09-02,"—I indicate that the opposition will be supporting the Ministers of State Amendment Bill 1999 . We accept the reasons for the increased appropriation and we regard this as essentially a housekeeping item.
I will, however, accept the opportunity that the bill presents me with to draw attention to the hypocrisy that has been displayed by government speakers on the last occasion that a very similar amendment to this bill was debated. That was way back in May 1996, after the time when Senator Ray would have had much fonder and better memories of being Minister for Defence. At that time, the amount appropriated for ministerial salaries 
 was increased from $1,615,000 to $1,640,000. The then Minister for Administrative Services, Mr Jull, pointed out that this increase was required to meet increases in salaries for ministers under the previous Labor government. He said, on the other hand, that the Howard government was going to reduce both the size of the ministry and the sum required in future years. He said that this would go down from $1,600,000 as from the 1996-97 financial year.
Madam Acting Deputy President, what happened? John Howard was no sooner re-elected for a second term than he increased the size of the ministry to 30; he increased the size of the cabinet to 17; and he is now increasing the appropriation for salaries. You have to wonder whether it is a surprise at all that we greeted his promises of frugality, probity and higher standards of government with the scepticism that we did. The point is that our scepticism again has been vindicated.
I want to make it quite clear: we are prepared to support the passage of this bill. But on this occasion, as we deal with the Ministers of State Amendment Bill 1999 , let us not have the hypocritical posturing that we had in May 1996.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERS OF STATE AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-09-02,"—May I say something about what was said by those senators who spoke in this debate. Firstly, Senator Ray gave a thorough assessment of the situation in relation to parliamentary secretaries. The government will take on board his comments. The comments made by Senator Ray have not gone unnoticed—perhaps I can take it no further than that.
In relation to Senator Faulkner, can I say that this is a housekeeping matter. It results from the inclusion in the cabinet of Minister Ruddock. If the Labor government had stayed in power, this amount today would be $1.78 million because, unlike the previous government, there is a differentiation between ministers' pay in cabinet and out of cabinet. That was not something which was in the previous government.
We reject outright any statement or allegation that we have increased expenditure in this regard in relation to the previous govern 
 ment. In fact, we have not. Let us not make more of this bill than needs to be made. It is purely a housekeeping matter and no more. I commend the bill to the Senate.

We think that the primary goal of the bill is an important one for the Australian defence legislation. That primary goal is to implement a process for urine drug testing of Australian Defence Force members who are involved in combat or combat related duties as well as 
 established associated disciplinary measures by amending the Defence Act 1903.
The ADF has had a no drugs policy for many years. The policy requires the relevant service authority to initiate disciplinary or administrative action against any member of the ADF found selling, possessing, dealing in or administering an illegal drug. The administrative sanctions include termination of appointments for officers, discharge from the service for non-officers or reduction in rank.
In July 1995, following trials that had been conducted since September 1993, the Chief of the Defence Force directed that a urinalysis testing program be implemented across the ADF. The proposal entailed a UTP, for narcotic substances, of samples from randomly selected ADF members. The testing process was going to have an emphasis on personnel from operational and basic training establishments.
The initiative was supported by the then Minister for Defence, Senator Robert Ray, and the then Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Senator John Faulkner. However, it was not able to be implemented without legislation, following concerns raised by the Privacy Commissioner and the Attorney-General's Department. That same year, the Labor government commenced work on drafting legislation to implement the UTP, but it was not able to be introduced into parliament prior to the 1996 general election.
The Australian Defence Association and the Armed Forces Federation of Australia support in principle a drug testing program but do not have any specific position on this bill, I am advised. A general view expressed by the ADA and the Armed Forces Federation of Australia is that any drug testing program should apply equally to all uniformed personnel, irrespective of their duties, considering that in time of combat all ADF personnel may be in combat or combat related areas.
It is a matter of balancing OH&S concerns with civil liberties of ADF members. Like the initiative launched under the previous Labor government, this program would specifically focus on combat and combat related personnel. Labor will be monitoring how the program is conducted, and will be consulting 
 with the relevant organisations over the coming years to ensure that this program is achieving its goals, but at the same time is protecting the natural justice balance for ADF personnel.
The other measures in the bill, such as allowing senior ADF personnel to directly transfer to the reserves at the end of their service contracts or appointments, are issues that we also support, particularly in these times when the government is increasing its demands of the reserves. We believe that maintaining the skills of the experienced personnel is crucial.

Is the minister aware of evidence given to the Senate transport committee last Friday by Patrick's Chairman, Mr Chris Corrigan, that the Howard government never sought a commitment from the stevedoring companies to lower their rates in response to a significant cut in their operating costs directly funded through a government guaranteed loan?

Just to reiterate the question for the minister, is the minister aware that Chris Corrigan has alleged that no commitment was sought by the government in terms of the lowering of stevedoring rates as a result of the operating costs directly funded through the government guaranteed loan? Mr Corrigan is alleging that the government actually never requested that commitment of him or of any stevedoring company.

.	 This Bill was to be passed in June this year, but was delayed by the Opposition.
.	 When the Bill passes through the Senate and is proclaimed, it will enable a regulation to be made to provide for an indexation mechanism for 
 the accommodation charge that will ensure that the maximum accommodation charge does not rise in real terms.
.	 Indexation of the accommodation charge will occur in July each year, in line with indexation of other accommodation payment amounts, such as retention amounts for accommodation bonds, and Commonwealth residential subsidies.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Aged Care: Accommodation Charge</title>,Miscellaneous,24,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-09-02,"—The Democrats are opposing schedule 1, item 1, page 3, lines 5 to 10, because of the term used in the clause of `protecting the competitive position of young people'. If you look at page 3, lines 5 to 10, it presently says:
Protecting the competitive position of young people in the labour market, promoting youth employment, youth skills and community standards and assisting in reducing youth unemployment.
Implicit in the term `protecting the competitive position of young people' is a classical economics view of competition in markets. Our belief is that when `competitive position', as commonly used in this parliament by the parties who attach themselves to the philosophy known as economic rationalism, is mentioned it sparks the thought, by necessity, of lower wages. In our view, Labor and the coalition are saying that it is an objective of this bill that low wages for young people must be protected. The minister might well reply, `Surprise, surprise! Of course that's what we are saying.' Our concern is not that the existing status of young people might be protected but in fact that more people may be forced onto youth rates than would otherwise and that people getting out of youth rates for whom it is no longer relevant might find it a lot harder.
So when Joe de Bruyn goes down to the Industrial Relations Commission for his case by case analysis to try to get junior rates abolished for shop assistants above 18 years, he faces the heavy positive onus Labor is now imposing on him because he will be up against a commissioner whose statutory obligation will be to protect the competitive position of young people. How does he do that? In classical economics, the economics of economic rationalists, the commissioner may believe he or she has only one choice, that is, lower wages.
The Industrial Relations Commission's junior rates bench has already made its views pretty clear that low wages are essential to the competitive position of young people. I refer you to page 177, paragraph 6.16, of that report. What the Industrial Relations Commission is saying there is that cost advantage is a key reason why juniors are employed in some industries requiring low skill cannon fodder employees. It is not a question of creating new jobs, but rather cheap young people displace not quite as cheap older people.
I would be interested in Senator Collins's views, as a former advocate of the shoppies union, when she talks to this amendment, as to how else Joe de Bruyn could defeat a statutory obligation on the commissioner to protect the competitive position of young people. Senator Hogg might have a view on it, too. We recall that in 1996 he discussed the impact of junior rates on young people. Really, Labor need to say to us whether they understand what a commissioner will have to do to overcome a statutory obligation to protect the competitive position of young people when trying to deal with the issues of age discrimination.
Before I sit down, I would like to refer to some remarks made earlier about whether or not we had lost our case that was put before the Industrial Relations Commission. That was a strange way to present it, because it was in fact an inquiry, not a case.
—You do take the point, though?
—I take the point; that is why I am responding to it. I thought the 
 various submissions, including those from the government and from people attached to the Labor Party, were very helpful. The final decision, if it can be described as such, of the AIRC is spelled out on page 212, item 7.14, of their inquiry report. There are five dot points in that item 7.14. I must advise the Labor Party, who seem to think that somehow those five dot points undermine our views and our position, that we actually accept all those dot points. We do not resist them in any way whatsoever. Our argument is and has been that the principles which govern relativities—the balance that needs to be had with regard to youth rates and employment—need to be moderated by an overriding desire not to discriminate against young people on grounds which do not have a reasonable basis.
We go further and believe that it is the obligation of Australia, as a mature and progressive democracy, to follow the leadership of other countries in the OECD and impose a ceiling on the extent to which age rates apply. There is nothing inconsistent between our approach—which is an amalgam, if you like, of our long held views and the ACTU's position—and the conclusion at 7.14 of the AIRC report. I will indicate for the record what those five points are. They are:
.	 the avoidance of discrimination on grounds of age that has the effect of nullifying or impairing equality of opportunity or treatment in employment or occupation;
Why on earth would the Democrats regard that as a failure? That is exactly what we believe in. The second point is:
.	 maturation skills and related personal attributes in the employment or in performance or particular work required under the classification;
We agree that it is appropriate that any such review of a particular junior rate classification should take that into account. Of course we agree with that. That is their second conclusion we agree with. The third point is:
.	 the need for protective measures for young workers in the industry or employment covered by an award classification;
We agree with that. The fourth point is:
.	 the desirability of maintaining a junior rate having regard to the availability and use of structured training under New Apprenticeships in the relevant industry; 

We agree with that. The last point is:
.	 the likely effect of the junior rate classification in securing a reasonable balance of entry of young employees in the relevant industry.
We agree with that. If we agree with the findings of the report, I find it an extraordinary allegation from you that somehow we have been defeated in this whole thing. We are simply saying that in the development of appropriate principles to govern the exercise of youth rates in our economy, which should continue on a case by case basis, certain fundamental principles should be established. Those are principles agreed by you before you got into this situation of having to defend the indefensible. They were agreed by you in all the quotes we have quoted from the Labor Party and agreed by the unions which represent young people and indeed agreed by the Industrial Relations Commission. In many respects they are also agreed by the coalition.
Where we differ with the coalition is the breadth with which they wish to deal with this matter. They want to extend youth rates far wider than we do. Secondly, they will not apply a ceiling. Thirdly, they do not intend to give guidance on the matter of relativities within the commissions dealing with the act. The argument you put up, Senator Collins, is to me a bit of a distraction. Given how much time we have to deal with the two acts we have to deal with today, I do not think that we should go on too much about it. But you raised the argument. I am raising the response. We can agree to disagree. On the record I am telling you that we support the five principles laid out at page 212 of the AIRC's report. That is our position.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH EMPLOYMENT) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1999-09-02,"—I indicate for the record that we are opposed to all of the Democrat amendments. I want to refer to this one, in particular, because I think it has been the cause of some misunderstanding at both ends of the other side of the chamber. This morning I said that only one federal award out of nearly 1,700 that have been surveyed by the department had a junior wage rate for 21-year-olds. I was immediately told that that 
 was wrong; it was 22. I therefore want to spell out the facts.
Senator Murray, in particular, has repeatedly stated that many awards apply junior rates to 21-year-olds and that some apply junior rates to 22-year-olds. This is completely wrong. It is apparently based on a misinterpretation of a survey undertaken by the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business which is included in the joint governments' submission to the junior rates inquiry. The survey described in attachment A to the submission examined 100 key federal awards. Of these, 76 were found to have junior rates. The table in attachment A sets out the number of awards that pay adult rates at 18, 19, 20, 21 and 22. All the awards that include junior rates pay adult rates on or before age 21, except one. In other words, only one award prescribes a junior rate at age 21 and none whatsoever do so at age 22 or higher.
I hope Senator Murray is listening to this because these are facts. I will repeat the ultimate conclusion: all the awards that include junior rates pay adult rates on or before age 21, except one. Only one award prescribes a junior rate at age 21, and none whatsoever do so at age 22 or higher. This result is confirmed by other surveys.
A more comprehensive survey undertaken by the department in January this year of all 1,690 federal awards which contain wage provisions identified only one federal award which applied a junior rate at age 21. It is the GIO Australia award 1991, which applies junior rates from 16 to 21 years, with adult rates applying at age 22. It is the same award identified in the original departmental survey. GIO advises that this is a longstanding provision and that only a handful of employees are employed on junior rates. A survey conducted by the junior rates inquiry itself was consistent with this. Of the 196 awards examined by the inquiry, all of the 111 which contained junior rates paid adult rates by the age of 21.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH EMPLOYMENT) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,1999-09-02,"—There are just a few issues that I would like to clarify at this stage. They deal with some of the matters that Senator Murray just raised. In the light of the Democrats' 
 amendments I should clarify for Senator Murray—although I too do not want to spend considerable time on this debate—that when I referred to the failure, or what was lost, in terms of the commission's inquiry and report, I meant any case at all from this report that there should be a ceiling imposed by legislation, by this parliament, on the commission's deliberations. That is the case that does not arise out of this inquiry or report. I should go back a step. That is the case that does not arise out of the report. I would probably join with you in saying that there was plenty of evidence in the inquiry supporting the two propositions that you and I both support, which is that there need to be changes which reflect community standards and the link to unemployment that is commonly referred to.
Much of the evidence that was heard by the commission both you and I would support. What does not arise out of that evidence is a recommendation that a ceiling should be applied. That is where the Democrats lost an argument to support the amendments that are before us now. I do not even know whether you ran the argument in that case. It might be an interesting thing for us to consider here, although, as I have said, I hope we are not going to spend considerable time debating these issues. You convinced us back in 1996: this is for the commission to determine. And this will go back to the commission. Whilst your comments about reinforcing the presumption that the commission should apply in relation to guidance on relativities has some merit, we believe that that is built into the implication that the commission already admits is in the act. It is built into what we have built into its guidance on relativities in terms of community standards and youth skill.
I think that all of the arguments that you are running are relevant to the section that I highlighted earlier in this summary—the points that everyone here would support, point 7 of the summary at the very end, although I reinforce the point that I have already made. Senator Stott Despoja should not drop words when she quotes commission decisions. The commission said, `Age discrimination measures present an ill-suited process for that task.' 
I go back to my earlier point. The one issue that the commission said we need parliamentary or court guidance on is the definition of `discrimination'. In that, they did not mean `put a ceiling in for us'. That is obvious from the discussion in the report and in Justice Munro's appendix. The department's advice on that is that that is obvious. I will be interested to see, Senator Murray, if you seek to deal with that matter at all.
But let me clarify for you the questions I think that the Democrats have not answered in relation to these amendments. They are: what is your alternative schema for clarifying the meaning of `discrimination' in the act? In that context I should highlight that even your amendments about inserting a ceiling still leave discrimination. So what guidance do you propose that the commission deal with in relation to those areas below the ceiling that you are proposing? That is what this report sought from the parliament or the courts.
The next issue—I need to clarify it because Senator Murray seemed to indicate at the time that he could answer this one—is: where is the support for legislating 18? I agree with you; there is much argument that supports that proposition. The problem the Democrats face is that there is nothing in the commission's report which supports that proposition. Originally I was going to ask: why have you ignored the conclusion at point 7 in the summary that the commission found? But I suppose the question on that one is why, at least in respect of Senator Stott Despoja, do you misrepresent it by dropping words? I think it took it completely out of context.
I have indicated again that the presumption that you raise is already there. I have pointed you to material which I think supports the argument that that presumption is already there. We came to terms with the government in boosting that presumption by incorporating job skills and community standards and, frankly, these additional words are too little, not really adequate and too late.
There are only two other issues in relation to earlier comments that I want to go to, and that will probably conclude my remarks with respect to this amendment. Senator Stott 
 Despoja feels that she could have done a better deal. These amendments, frankly, do not represent that, and the confusion that I have seen in the Democrats' position does not either. She says that it is a `dirty deal'. Senator Stott Despoja, I do not make dirty deals, and I find that language offensive.
On top of that, for some reason the Democrats continue to avoid the straightforward situation that we are in—the government moved a bill; the government refused to change that bill in the light of the commission's decision; and we went to the government and said that we were not prepared to support anything in this area unless it reflected the commission's decision, and we believe the situation before us now does indeed do that.
In conclusion, the final point I want to address is Senator Murray's connection between women and junior rates. That is an interesting one in terms of some of the debates we had back in 1996, because I remember that it was actually the Australian Democrats that dropped the principle of equal remuneration out of awards—and the principle of equal pay in awards dropped back 15 to 20 years. So please do not talk to me about women in this area. But let me raise one issue that is obvious out of the report in relation to that analogy. This report deals with junior rates, and it talks about things like maturation factors. Most people realise that young people have maturation issues that are relevant to the skills they apply in the work force—that is a pretty common proposition, accepted by most people. The setting of ceilings that you grapple with in your amendments, in part, reflects that.
I hope you will admit—although some would argue that the situation is pronounced in the other direction—that maturation issues are not relevant in relation to the connection between men's wages and women's wages. As one of my other colleagues mentioned when I raised this point with him, women actually tend to mature earlier than men. So the connection here between men's wages and women's wages is a bit tenuous.
The other element of the commission's discussion of the issue is that the meaning 
 that the commission can apply to discrimination with respect to men's wages and women's wages is much clearer than the meaning they have to rely upon in relation to age discrimination. Again I reiterate: the meaning of age discrimination was the one issue I came across in this report about which the commission said, `We need more assistance from the parliament or from the courts in how we deal with it.' Your amendments simply do not cover that point.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-09-02,"—I turn now to amendment No. 3 on sheet 1524. I move:
(3)	 Schedule 1, page 3 (after line 10), after item 1, insert:
1A  Subsection 4(1)
	 Insert:
 junior rate  means a rate of pay paid to a worker aged less than 18 years of age that is less than an adult rate of pay for the same or equivalent work.
We regard this as the most important amendment we will vote on today. It is an amendment that I am moving at the direct request of the ACTU—not of `some unions', Senator Collins, but of the ACTU. This is the amendment that the ACTU want Labor to back. I do know that the minister handling this legislation has had a lot of fun teasing the Labor Party about their connections with the ACTU, and the Labor Party have had a lot of fun in responding that you are, in fact, properly close to them. We are moving their amendment for you. The first preferred position of the ACTU is that junior rates be abolished completely and replaced with clauses based on skill. Both the report and every senator who is—
—Overnight?
—concerned with this issue acknowledge that that is difficult. Its second-best fall back position is that, if there must be junior rates, they should peter out at 
 18 years, as they do in 14 out of the 20 OECD countries that have junior rates.
—Overnight?
—Why not? The position of junior rates at 18 years is the official position of the largest representative organisation of young workers, the shoppies union.
—Overnight?
—I think I will have to respond, because I am getting a repetitive theme here.
—You are out of order, Senator Collins. Not only are you repetitive but you are repetitively out of order.
—Do not make me laugh, Mr Temporary Chairman; it offends the gravity of the moment. The question of anything overnight, of course, always exercises our minds with regard to bills. If the good senator had concerns about that, transitional provisions are always appropriate, and I will accept an amendment if you choose to put one up on that basis.
To return to the amendment, of the OECD countries, only Australia and the Netherlands have a statutory law that they can treat 21-year-olds as juniors. The official position of the largest representative organisation of young workers who are unionised, the shop distributive union, is that junior rates should apply only to those up to 18 years of age—I might quote at length from pages 5 to 7 of their submission to the Industrial Relations Commission—and this is the position that the Hon. Kim Beazley was saying eight months ago was sensible. As recently as March 1999, as well, Mr Beazley said that young adults should not be paid children's wages. Mr Beazley said:
Do not kid yourselves that 19- and 20-year-olds in our community do not have family responsibilities, because there are plenty who do. There is no suggestion that, if they did have a couple of kids, there would be any exemption from the processes that the government is putting in place. If you are a young truck driver aged about 19 and with family responsibilities, you are likely to be deprived of $80 a week in your wages if you are then subject to an extension of junior awards or junior rates into the 18- to 21-year-old categories. Those aged 18 to 
 21 years vote, they marry, they have children, they enter into contracts, they have legal obligations and they are entitled to be worthy of their hire.
These are her leader's words which Senator Collins directly refutes in her arguments. It is a wonderful statement. It is classic Beazley, if I might say so, but unfortunately he did not believe it; he was just an actor delivering his lines. That is no longer the Labor Party's position. There are two parties in this debate who have held consistently to their position: one is in government and the other is the Democrats. The Labor Party have moved their position.
I have to confess that I was not terribly surprised that Labor did a deal on junior rates; I had been expecting it. What did surprise me was that they settled for so little. I was amazed that they did not fight for an 18 years of age definition or some similar ceiling. I heard Senator Collins pick Senator Stott Despoja up for using the words `dirty deal'—and quite rightly so—but I suspect Senator Stott Despoja did so with tongue in cheek, because what she was really doing was bouncing Labor's words back at them. I do not think it is inappropriate for Labor to have had a deal or an arrangement with government—why should I? I think it is perfectly proper. But whenever we do it or Senator Harradine does it or somebody else does it, it is always referred to by Labor as a `grubby little deal', a `cosy little arrangement' and so on. I do not quite have the theatrics that they attach to it. I am not going to use that language, but what has happened with this deal, we think, is that you were unable to achieve a better outcome.
The way that the bits of this law interact it will now be impossible for Joe de Bruyn and the shoppies union to implement the policy of trying to cut out junior rates at 18 years. The commission will be so hamstrung by the bill and the amendments that attach to the bill that it will never be able to grant such an application and fulfil the onerous statutory duties that this bill imposes on it. It will therefore be hamstrung on the case by case response. Our approach was to rather set the ceiling and, within the case by case response, let the Industrial Relations Commission make a proper evaluation on relativities.
The amendment we are proposing would certainly give Joe de Bruyn and his shoppies what they want—and rightly so. I know we are going to lose it, but it has never stopped us putting amendments before and I do not see why it should now. It would also, though, bring Australia into line with most OECD countries with junior rate definitions. I repeat that Canada, Greece, Hungary, Japan, Mexico, Poland and Spain have abolished junior rates. France, Luxembourg, Turkey, Ireland, Korea, Portugal and the Czech Republic allow junior rates only below the age of 18, and New Zealand has an age of 19. Those are adult ages. So, of 20 OECD countries with minimum wages, seven have no junior rates, seven define it as less than 18 years, four define it as less than 20, and only two have it over 21 years. Eighteen years in our own award system is already the case for adult rates in awards in the copper industry, the food, beverages and tobacco industry and the business equipment industry. Labor's Senator Campbell, in his excellent speech earlier, highlighted the anachronism of junior rates in terms of their history, which was also canvassed in the Industrial Relations Commission's report.
The term `junior' in relation to wage rates replaced the term `boy' or `lad' in awards in the period 1910-17 and was set in most awards at below the age of 21 years. That was not terribly surprising for that time, because 21 was the age of majority. It was the age at which people could vote. In most awards it is stated as age 21 ever since. But community standards have shifted. The relativities, once put in awards, have tended not to be changed and have stayed, with links to a bygone era.
One of the arguments that has been addressed constantly is the need for modernisation and simplification. It is a theme of the minister and it is a theme I have agreed with by and large—that you do need to modernise and simplify awards. This is an area where it needs to be modernised. Since the 1960s, the ACTU's equal pay for work of equal value policy has committed the union movement to abolishing junior rates above the age of 18 years. The ACTU's Grant Bellchamber, in 
 particular, has tried very hard indeed in recent years to improve matters on this front. This really became an issue in the 1960s because 18 was the age for the draft, and people felt that if people were old enough to fight and die they were old enough to be paid an adult's wage. In 1972 the federal government gave people the right to vote at age 18 years and the equal pay case for women was resolved.
At that time the metals union started to try to improve the junior rates in the awards but were largely rejected by the commission. There it stood for 20 years until the 1991 national wage case introduced skill based career paths and insertion of the 1993 antidiscrimination provisions into law. What I am trying to say is that the age of 21, which the minister quite correctly indicates is scattered right through numerous awards, is a historical anachronism. It was the age of majority in 1920 when junior rates were first set, but it ceased to be the age of majority in 1972. Why haven't our pay scales caught up? I am not here referring to issues of training or issues where it is generally obvious that people have to be discriminated against in wage terms because of the nature of training and apprenticeships. I am talking about where an adult is doing an adult's job and happens to be aged 18, 19, 20 or 21.
I know from what has been said before that this is going to go down. For the assistance of the chair, I indicate that for emphasis reasons we have a number of `in the alternative' amendments following this amendment. I will put those, but I will put them to the voices. This is the only amendment on this section that I will put to a division.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-09-02,"—I move Democrat amendment No. 4 on sheet 1524:
(4)	 Schedule 1, page 3 (after line 10), after item 1, insert:
1A  Subsection 4(1)
 Insert:
 junior rate  means a rate of pay paid to a worker aged less than 19 years of age that is less than an adult rate of pay for the same or equivalent work.
This is the same ceiling amendment, if I can describe it as such, as I moved previously, but with 19 years of age. That would bring us into line with 15 out of 20 of the OECD countries. As I have already said, workers are paid adult rates at age 19 in the copper, business equipment, aluminium, food and beverages, and oil and gas industries. I should also indicate the different percentage rates that 19-year-olds are paid in different awards. One of the difficulties we have is the inconsistency in the relativities between awards. For instance, a 19-year-old is paid in the metals industry 82½ per cent of the adult rate; 
 in hospitality, 90 per cent; in construction, 88 per cent; in meat processing, 88 per cent; in clerical industries, 80 per cent; in the retail industry, 80 per cent; in the clothing industry, 93 per cent; and in the entertainment industry, 97½ per cent. That is one of the problems that we have with the present youth rates regime. There is no consistency; it is pretty arbitrary. Frankly, the employers—and we understand their motive—want to keep wages as low as they can, and whatever they have been able to argue with the union on the rate, they have managed to achieve.
Having spelt out those percentages, if you move to a junior rate of 19 years, it would mean a pay rise of between 10 and 20 per cent for 19-year-olds moving to an adult rate. Once again, anyone who has ever been in business knows that that is a large movement. Nevertheless, we think that if other countries can accept it and find that it is appropriate and it does not destroy jobs or harm their economies or their industries then we should do the right thing here. You have to ask: could industry afford such a thing? The company profits figures released last week suggest that they can. Company profits were up by a healthy 17.4 per cent last year. In retail, profits jumped 69 per cent. The shareholders are therefore getting a 17.4 per cent increase. The company executives will be getting performance bonuses of at least that, and Senator Conroy was wonderfully eloquent on that matter. So why can't we afford to give young people a decent wage at age 19? If New Zealand can do it, we think Australia can too.
What would a junior rate above 19 years do to reduce or increase youth unemployment? We think it is not an issue about jobs but an issue about equity. If anything, such a rate would make it more attractive, we think, for industry and awards generally to operate in a better regulated situation. I do not think I will go through all my notes; I am getting a little weary of the argument.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH EMPLOYMENT) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,1999-09-02,"—I missed my opportunity, as I was being briefed when we came to the question on the last amendment, so I will deal with some of those issues now. They are just 
 as relevant in relation to this amendment, as I am sure Senator Murray would acknowledge. Senator Murray, we agree with your objectives; we do not agree with your process. You mentioned the SDA's position and the argument that the SDA ran in the commission. The SDA's argument in the commission was that you may actually need to deal with some of these matters—down to a more appropriate adult rate—with a transition process. I cannot recall the precise number of years but I think it was possibly even up to about six years. There is no such proposition before us at the moment.
In terms of process matters, the Labor Party believe that the commission is in the best position to determine the process on a case by case basis by being able to assess on a case by case basis the costs and the issues involved. You are right, we could stand here and talk for ages about the various different examples and what percentage points would be involved, but again we would be doing it on a case by case basis; I do not think it is possible for us to frame a transition arrangement which is universal, and it is certainly contrary to the advice that has been given to us by the inquiry that you guys established.
We have not had an answer to the question that I raised in relation to where does the commission find that we should legislate or set a ceiling. That is the fundamental point in relation to these amendments. It would be completely inconsistent for the Labor Party, given that we took the position that we accepted that the independent umpire determined this matter, to change that position. It would be logically inconsistent for us to change that position and now say, `But on top of that we will now impose a ceiling on the commission,' and particularly to not leave scope for the commission to determine transitional arrangements. I think it is appropriate for the commission to hear your arguments and many other arguments about how the community standard today is well behind on the issue of what is an appropriate adult rate. I think it is appropriate for the commission to determine transitional arrangements to introduce more appropriate rates, taking into 
 account all of the factors that we establish in this bill.
Senator Murray referred to the New Zealand example, and earlier there was some discussion about the United States. I want to raise those issues in the context of dirty deals, as Senator Stott Despoja suggests, done dirt cheap. This is not a dirty deal done dirt cheap. Let me address why. I was actually scared stiff one would be done, but it would be done by your party, Senator Murray. A dirty deal done dirt cheap might have been the sort of deal that was done in New Zealand. As I understand the New Zealand context, the age of 19 for the adult rate quite appropriately was brought in in 1983 in its current form, but—and this is in part a message to the ACTU—in the context of their independent contracts legislation.
I knew the Democrats were going off to talk to the government about an attempt to change this bill, and what scared me stiff was the prospect of what the government would take to give it to you. The only thing you guys had to offer was what is in the next wave, and Reith does not do a deal for nothing. Thus the outcome was that you did not get a deal out of the government, but that was obvious before the fact.
—What is your deal?
—What are you getting out of it?
—The deal that the Labor Party got out of this matter was as follows. We got the position that we had supported all along, which is a framework which the commission sought after duly considering all of the factors that you guys had established. We got to continue to support the role of the independent umpire.
—You might address your comments to the chair, Senator Collins.
—Through the chair, what else we got was that you did not do a deal with the government that traded something else for some ad hoc or partial position on junior rates. What we got was a scenario in which, I hope, the Australian Democrats will fight in the future for an 
 independent and strong Australian Industrial Relations Commission.
I hope that what else we got—going back to my United States example—was a scenario where we will not go down that path, because, while the United States does not have junior rates, just think about the rates it has in its deregulated environment. That is the path we do not want to go down. We want the commission to determine, in the light of promoting job skills and community standards, more appropriate rate classifications for all Australian workers, men or women, young or old. That is what the Labor Party wants.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH EMPLOYMENT) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-09-02,"—Senator Collins, I do not recall all the aspects of what was a very complex and sometimes very technical report from the inquiry, but I do not recall them actually ruling out a ceiling. They certainly did not rule it in—and I agree that is not in their recommendations—but I do not agree that they ruled it out.
The second thing is that I do not seem to recall that they looked beyond 19-year-olds in their analysis. I think their not having done that is a weakness. One of the difficulties when you are looking at 19-year-olds—who are a year above adulthood—is that, if they had been in the work force since age 15 and 16, as many young people who have not been in education have been, they would have two, three or four years experience and often would have reached work maturation levels that would make them ready to move out of youth rates. It is a difficulty, frankly, in that someone who has entered the work force at 15, who is in an award which has a youth rate up to the age of 21, and who effectively has been six years on youth rates, might have reached the appropriate skill or maturation level within two or three years.
The other issue is that the 19- to 21-year-old labour market is very different from the 15- to 19-year-old one. It becomes much more speckled, if you like, with young people who have undertaken education—they are completing a secondary traineeship, a TAFE course or so on—and are, quite frankly, ready to go; they are young adults with appropriate skills. So I just make the point that, whilst we 
 value the IRC report, I do not think it is the last word in all this and I hope the debate will continue.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH EMPLOYMENT) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,1999-09-02,"—I agree with you: there are inadequacies in the commission's inquiry. They have acknowledged that there are many inadequacies, but they do suggest a framework, or an approach, to proceed into the future. That is what this bill supports. Senator Murray, I suggest you have probably got two options.
—Could you suggest that through the chair, Senator?
—Through the chair, I suggest that Senator Murray has two options about how to proceed from here. One option is to present that case—and I think Senator Murray would acknowledge that he certainly does not have that case together for us to consider here now—on a case by case basis to the commission by intervention. The second option is: if he wants to review this matter further, perhaps he should throw it on the table in the next wave inquiry.
I do not think that case is here now; it is certainly not developed in terms of these amendments or how transition might occur. The impact on industry overnight of these amendments is acknowledged by unions such as the SDA. I think you will find that, beyond those two options, this piece of legislation is not really an option to further that case in terms of how well it has been developed today.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH EMPLOYMENT) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1999-09-02,"—May I ask through you, Mr Temporary Chairman, whether Senator Murray could enlighten the committee on how anybody, if there is a principle to be upheld in his amendment No. 3, could vote for amendments Nos 4, 5 and 6?",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH EMPLOYMENT) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-09-02,"—Thank you, Senator Harradine. That is a good question. If you are going to be arbitrary as to a cut-off point for discriminating on the basis of age alone, you need a standard which is accepted as a community standard. That community standard in years gone by was 21, the year of adulthood. The 
 year of adulthood is now 18 and I think that is a rational point to pick. We have, as you might recall from your long Senate memory, in fact accepted—
—Senator, you might care to address your comments through the chair.
—My apologies, Mr Temporary Chairman. Senator Harradine might have recalled with his long corporate memory that our position was never that we should adopt an arbitrary age position. But we have thought that, in the interests of this bill, it is appropriate to accept what we regard as a sensible compromise solution from the ACTU.
However, as the age of 18 has been rejected by the Senate, our position, therefore, is to try to recover ground for any adults who are still being paid youth rates on a basis which is acceptable to other countries. In other words, the principle of comparability. It is this principle of comparability that we are trying to flesh out as we go along. In particular, because we share a highly mobile labour market with New Zealand—as many senators know—we thought the age of 19, for instance, is another benchmark age. If we as a parliament were to agree there should be discrimination, at least it would allow everyone above the age of 19 to be paid adult rates.
If implicit in Senator Harradine's question is whether we understand that this is an arbitrary line—yes, we do, but it is a comparability exercise.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH EMPLOYMENT) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1999-09-02,"—There is a point of principle about the definition of a junior rate—juniors being those under the age of 18—and a lot of arguments have been educed in support of that, particularly outside this chamber, over a number of years. Unless the Industrial Relations Commission is going to deal with the matter in an appropriate way, I cannot see that supporting a definition of a junior as under 19, 20 or 21 assists in the ultimate resolution of the matter that junior workers are those under the age of 18. In other words, those workers 18-years-old and over are ultimately to be considered adults.
That is the difficulty I have in supporting anything other than amendment No. 3 which, of course, I supported. But in principle I just cannot support the other two amendments, which I think do not have the arguments to sustain them that we saw in relation to the 18-year-olds. I know what arbitrary points Senator Murray is making, but I think they are too arbitrary. I want to make it clear that under those circumstances I wish to abstain from voting for amendment Nos 4, 5 and 6.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-09-02,"—I move:
(5)	 Schedule 1, page 3 (after line 10), after item 1, insert:
1A  Subsection 4(1)
	 Insert:
 junior rate  means a rate of pay paid to a worker aged less than 20 years of age that is less than an adult rate of pay for the same or equivalent work.
This amendment puts the age of 20 as the cutoff age and, of course, any such selection of an age group enables those above that age to be paid an adult wage. Let us see what that would mean to 20-year-olds who might be now regarded as adults if this were to pass.
Under the hospitality award, it would make absolutely no difference to them because they get 100 per cent of the adult rate. In the metals industry, they get 97.7 per cent—a ridiculous discount. Why? What possible ground is there in the metals industry for adults at the age of 20 not to get the full adult rate? They are all receiving adult rates in the building, meat processing, banking, transport, manufacturing, textile and travel industries. The clerical and retail industry is the odd one out, paying 20-year-olds only 90 per cent of the adult rate. So there is inconsistent treatment at age 20. In the hospitality or building industries, they receive adult rates; in the metals industry, they receive 97.7 per cent; and in the retail and clerical industries, they receive 90 per cent and are still treated as kids.
That is what discrimination and prejudice means. You discriminate or are prejudicial towards people on unjust grounds, where there is no rational basis for it. That is exactly 
 what it means. There is no rational basis for discriminating in that way against 20-year-olds in those industries. Given that most industries seem to regard 20-year-olds as adults, should we not try to stop the remaining industries that attach themselves to archaic awards from paying 20-year-olds as kids? I find it unreasonable that the Senate cannot accept that argument.
At age 20, our junior rates definitions would come into line with the United Kingdom, the United States of America and Belgium. We would be in line with 18 of the 20 OECD countries. I have heard all your sophisticated arguments, Senator Collins, but 18 out of 20 OECD countries draw a ceiling at least at the age of 20.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,1999-09-02,"—I have a very quick question for Senator Murray. I think it highlights the fact that, whilst I agree with much of his case, the case has not been fully developed. The case has certainly not been developed that it should be parliament which determines these matters. Is he aware, for instance, of the environment in which the 19 rate was introduced in New Zealand? Was there a transition arrangement? If so, how was it developed? Was it done by parliament? Was it introduced over time by the equivalent of their commission? Is he in a position at this stage to answer any of these questions? I suspect not. This is a matter for the commission.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,1999-09-02,"—I will make a very brief comment on this amendment. The strategy is obvious, but the point I need to make in response to it is that this matter should have been dealt with by the commission a long time ago. I am pretty confident that, had it been, it would not even be in front of us here. Alternative processes need to be explored about why we are confronted with this issue in relation to workers over 21. There is still one award that has an adult rate up to 22, which Senator Murray would suggest is an outrage. I will not comment on the details of how that continues to exist. I do not know why. Again, it should not be the case, because if the commission had reviewed it, I doubt very much whether it would have continued.
Amendment not agreed to.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH EMPLOYMENT) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-09-02,"—I move:
(7)	 Schedule 1, item 2, page 3 (line 23), at the end of subparagraph (ii), add ""while seeking, as far as possible, to eliminate discrimination in pay rates on the basis of age"".
This repeats a similar amendment I put earlier, but it obviously applies to a different section of the bill. It is similar to the one I moved on the objectives of the act in section 3. This amendment is to section 88A, which is the objectives of part 6, the functioning of the commission in dispute prevention and settlement. All the arguments I made earlier apply.
Personally, I do not believe that a new objective is needed for section 88A. The overriding objectives of the act are already there. If we had done what Labor described as dirty dealing and refused—
—I wouldn't have, Andrew.
—I do not believe that Senator Collins would have, but some in her party might. They refuse to back what we regard as sensible amendments. The objectives of the act already make it a statutory duty of the commission to protect the competitive position of young people. At least in section 3, the objectives of the act, there is the countervailing objective (j) about discrimination. But in section 88A, there is no 
 countervailing objective. So it will be an objective of the act that settling a dispute must further the competitive position of young people. We think that will mean an encouragement for much lower wages. There will be no countervailing objectives of seeking to prevent or eliminate discrimination.
This is not just about junior rates clauses. We think it sets a dangerous precedent. The deliberate tilting of this field against the interests of young people might end up applying to all elements of dispute prevention and settlement. Looking at a training award clause, study leave provisions, casual loading, redundancy, hours flexibility or all the other things that make up an award, and looking at any dispute hearings about treatments in the workplace or discrimination, the commission may take the view that it must override those in the interests of the competitive position of young people.
I cannot, as none of us can, foresee exactly how the commission will react. However, it is a fear, and that is what lies behind this amendment. Discrimination might not be seen as important by the commission because it will now look solely at the competitive position of young people.
I still think a result of this is that in many respects young people will be second-class in the commission's considerations. I think the amendments agreed to by the Labor Party and the coalition will end up tying the commission's hands by forcing them to a particular style and approach to this, which I regard as unsatisfactory. Parliament will end up making sure that the specific overrides the general. By repeating objective 3AA and the objects of part 6, it will send a clear message that some objects are more important than others and that discrimination will simply be a second-order issue, which we do not agree with.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH EMPLOYMENT) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,1999-09-02,"—I understand the concerns that Senator Murray has raised, but I do not think this amendment actually addresses them. If it is a concern with the balance of how these objects are reflected, that is obviously an issue which we feel is solved by the insertion of the words the government has accepted as 
 part of our arrangement regarding community standards and job skills. If his concern is that the commission's attitude will go much broader than just the issue of rates of pay and that it will go into other conditions of employment or broader matters, adding the words `while seeking as far as possible to eliminate discrimination in pay rates on the basis of age' does not really address that concern.
Amendment not agreed to.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH EMPLOYMENT) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-09-02,"—We seek to oppose schedule 1, item 2, page 3 (lines 11 to 23). This goes to the paragraph which outlines the commission's functions and powers in relation to making and varying awards. I have spoken already at length on the impact of the new objects clause. It is a message to the commission that discrimination on the basis of age is not just a good thing in terms of junior rates clauses but that it is justifiable in a wide range of other employment conditions as well.
As I said earlier, when the commission is looking to protect the competitive position of young people, we do not know what the age of those young people will be. It could be 18 years old as the age of maturity; it could be 21 years old; it could even be the age of 25. I understand that, in certain United Nations categories, people below the age of 25 are considered young people. I think Young Labor people, Young Democrats and Young Liberals are probably categorised below the age of 30. The Labor Party as an organisation certainly defines young people.
I do not know what they will mean by the categorisation of young people, and that is the point of a ceiling. In theory, the commission can ratchet up the ages at which youth rates apply and decide that journalists who have not reached 10 years experience are not yet worthy of being paid appropriately. There is no ceiling to this. In changing the way in which the commission is required to determine these things, we may see some unintended consequences that we would regret. So, when Joe de Bruyn goes down to the IRC for his case by case analysis to try to get junior rates abolished for shop assistants above 18 years—which he can do under this 
 law; it has not been ruled that he cannot do it—because of the heavy positive onus on him, he will be up against a commissioner whose statutory obligation will be, in our view, to reject his case. Because in classical economics—the economics which is laying behind the intent of his bill—we think the commissioner may feel that he or she has only one choice, which would be lower wages. If the Industrial Relations Commission says that there is a key cost advantage why juniors are employed in some industries, it will insist that youth rates continue. Once again, we feel that this approach outlined in this paragraph is a negative indication, and we therefore oppose it.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH EMPLOYMENT) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,1999-09-02,"—I want to speak just briefly with respect to this matter. What we are really doing is readdressing the issue raised at item 1, which is the presumption that the commission would apply. I think I have dealt with that matter adequately. As we move through those, though—and relevant to the previous item we dealt with where Senator Murray is worried about the potential scope of the additional objects that the commission will consider—can I say that, unfortunately, some of these concerns are also far too late in the process. Before we came back in this afternoon, I had heard from the press gallery that the Democrats were putting the position that they had not really intended to move amendments today. That concerned me, and I indicated—
—That sounds like a Labor Party spiel to me.
—Senator, I indicated at the time—defending your honour—that in fact that matter had not been raised with me. I am sure you are not doubting the honesty of my statement that I was in fact approached by someone from the press gallery with that claim.
—I don't doubt that.
—The matter of delaying this matter had not been put to me. I took it as an opportunity to say that perhaps the arguments that have been run to date about the concern with whether many of these amendments actually do what is 
 intended is coming home to some people. Again, this one simply deals with the presumption issue again, and the earlier one did not really seem to do what Senator Murray intended he wanted it to do.
—The question is that schedule 1, item 2 stand as printed.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-09-02,"—Mr Temporary Chairman, I would to ask that amendments (9) and (10) be dealt with together. Can that be done if one seeks to oppose?
—Senator Murray, one seeks to oppose an item. Therefore, what you propose would not be in accordance with standing orders.
—Thank you for that guidance.
—Senator Murray, you could speak to both together if you wish, but they would be put separately.
—I will speak to (9) and (10) together and put them separately. We have heard arguments from Senator Collins that I hope we can now turn a little against her. She has been arguing quite strongly—and I would agree with her sentiments although not the debating points—that the commission should be independent and should have the ability to exercise that independence. But explicit in much of what the government and the Labor Party are doing with this deal, arrangement or agreement is that they are in fact going to be reorientating the direction of the commission. The consequence of that is telling the commission what to do with respect to certain matters. I think that it is appropriate at times to ask that the commission take into regard certain things. But if we make those requirements such that it constrains the commission's ability to do the right thing, I get a bit worried about it.
In directing the commission, you are saying that it must protect the competitive position of young people. The commission will therefore lose its independence to balance discrimination and employment issues in looking at 
 junior rates, which is a position it has adopted over two decades—not always with good outcomes, but nevertheless it is a position it has adopted. With these provisions, we think the young people will be treated in a way that they might not otherwise if the independence of the commission had not been curtailed. As indicated in (10) we will be opposing the clause. In amendment (9), we were seeking again to add that qualifying consideration that we have put throughout.
In the Industrial Relations Commission's junior rates report, on pages 65 to 66, they refer to how the commission have approached junior rates decisions over the past two decades on a case by case basis. Their conclusions are on page 66. That is how the commission have been working—and, I guess, from reading the report, would prefer to continue working. But now they are going to be required to take account of youth employment. The government says that is a perfectly valid and legitimate thing for them to do, but we say you should take it into account provided you balance it against the issue of whether discrimination is arbitrary—that it has little to do with youth employment, and just has to do with cost and paying young adults youth rates.
The concept of needs is not there either. The issue of discrimination is not there. The commission laid out four factors, of which only two seem to be surviving as a result of these changes. Once again I would remind you that the consequence of what we are doing here is going to make things worse for young people rather than better. Before Senator Collins responds, if she is going to, or before the minister responds, I am quite happy to take those two items on the voices. I move:

 provide the balance that he is referring to as being needed—that is, that the commission needs to be mindful of community standards and job skills. In addition to that, though, throughout the report there are various references to other factors which	 assist the case. For about the fifth time today I go back to my earlier point about what the commission thinks is the task ahead to get it right.
Here and elsewhere the commission are directing us more towards issues associated with appropriate classifications and work value matters. They quite clearly say that in their view age discrimination measures present an ill-suited process for the task. Again I am not really sure that this amendment changes the balance in the way that the Democrats might like. The commission are telling us that they think that this process is ill suited. We think an appropriate process is there. In my earlier discussions I have already referred Senator Murray to the presumption that the commission accept is already in the act and remains in the act. I can only add one further factor that I am seeking clarification of—I am short of an adviser at the moment—and that is that I think the principal object of fairness was one of the ones that disappeared back in 1996, in the deal between the Democrats and the government. But I am unable to confirm that just at the moment.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-09-02,"—I will now speak to (11) and (12), but I will put them separately in line with our previous procedure. These, we think, again are crucial. Of course, everybody who puts amendments says that, but we do, because we think that without this there can be no fair case by case analysis of junior rates. I am referring to amendment (11) when I say this. Without this amendment there is no possibility that the commission will be given sufficient independence to at least restrain discrimination. This morning, the Hon. Bob McMullan, former Senator McMullan, was saying that adult rates for young people were 
 a legitimate aspiration. Without this amendment, we think the deal that has been put forward will close off that option from ever occurring.
I wish to remind the chamber again that the economic evidence that junior rates are needed to reduce youth employment is tentative at best. Junior rates have not stopped a long-term decline in full-time youth employment. The absence of junior rates above age 19 has not prevented jobs being created in the hospitality or financial services sector or in the building sector. It is absolutely essential that the commission only be allowed to authorise discrimination if it is the only way—and only to the extent necessary to achieve the objective of youth employment. I do not think the economics of junior rates is sound, but if they can be justified let us give the commission the capacity to award them on a case by case basis. The onerous duty of the commission in its case by case analysis is now to always deliver junior rates, and that is what the changes to section 3, 88A and 88B have already achieved.
So this is a last-ditch stand, if you like, to rescue this proposed Labor-coalition bill from its consequences. Labor's Senator Campbell gave an eloquent speech yesterday but I do not think he would be aware from a close reading of the bill how the commission's powers are going to be affected and how preordained the outcome of any application on new junior rates is now likely to be. And I doubt that Senator Lundy, who, like Senator Stott Despoja, carries the youth portfolio, would be aware of the possible consequences. I suspect that a number of key figures in both the coalition and Labor Party are, and that is one of the reasons they want this bill pushed through rapidly, even though it would only really need to be dealt with by June next year. Another two weeks of sustained lobbying from the ACTU, the SDA, the NUS or Young Labor might get a bit uncomfortable.
I am hoping that, when this has all gone through, they will have a repeat action of it come the second wave, and hopefully by then Labor might have reconsidered some of these matters. Senator Collins, who quite rightly has been outlined as spending her working life 
 defending the rights of shop assistants and young people, would then not have to stand here and defend the indefensible, and Senators Lundy, Bishop and Hogg, who would probably also have the same beliefs about young people, would also not have to defend what we think is indefensible. That is probably why it is being rushed through.
I do not know the people well enough, but I am not sure Joe de Bruyn, Doug Cameron or Jacob Varghese will forgive you. I forgive you because I do not think your heart is in it. I think you have been told by your caucus leaders that you have to defend this thing. I think this will be a festering sore for Labor. I will be very surprised if you are not obliged to try to re-address this issue. The consequence for the minister will be another agonising session listening to arguments he does not agree with. Having said that—as you know, you can hear the sound of defeat in my voice—I move the Democrats amendment No. 11:
(11)	 Schedule 1, item 4, page 3 (line 35), at the end of subsection (4), add:
	 where the Commission has ruled that such discrimination is clearly necessary to:
		 (a)	 protect the competitive position of the young people in the labour market; and
		 (b)	 promote youth employment, youth skills and community standards; and
		 (c)	 assist in reducing youth employment;
	 provided that the discrimination is permissible only to the extent necessary to further these objectives.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH EMPLOYMENT) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,1999-09-02,"—Senator Murray, this really is the last stand. Defending the indefensible is something, again on this one, I need to put back to you. In relation to amendment No. 11, I heard a couple of claims but no argument which dealt with the provisions of the Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Youth Employment) Bill 1999  or the act which demonstrated that case. I do not see anything particularly problematic with the wording here, but we would argue that this change is not necessary. Essentially, it deals with some of the arguments you have run.
As you have indicated already, this is your last stand. It is a re-run of much of that and 
 draws on the language that is already in the bill. I am still not convinced about what it achieves over and above what is already there. Again, because I cannot see that it actually does anything, the opposition will not be supporting this amendment. I really do not see how you can say that the government and Labor are pushing this through rapidly. I am not aware that the Democrats raised any concern about the debacle that occurred yesterday. Was I missing something?
—I was amused; I don't know about concerned.
—If you were amused by what transpired yesterday but raised no concern about it, you have been in this place long enough to know how legislation proceeds. I know some in the press gallery were a bit confused about how you could deal with a bill but not deal with amendments. They had a bit of trouble understanding that there is not a special procedure that relates to Democrat amendments that can be carved off a process and set aside for two weeks. You certainly do know how the process works. I have seen you work it with 500 amendments in other circumstances. I really find it difficult to see how it can be argued that we are pushing this through rapidly. Everybody was aware of what Labor's position was in June of this year. We have brought the government back to that position and we are happy to process that position. We are not rapidly rushing anything through.
To the extent that there has been only amusement and no complaint by the Democrats—and perhaps a little political posturing in the process—I think you are hardly in the position to say that we are pushing this through rapidly. We are dealing with your amendments. There is no guillotine. I would rather be thinking about heading home some time this evening, but I am still here and I am prepared to stay for as long as you want to debate this. I heard earlier that there was some prospect that you were going to string it out until 8 o'clock tonight. I cannot say I am aware of the direct source of that comment, but in relation to this being your last stand, I am quite pleased that we have worked 
 cooperatively through the process of addressing your amendments today.
When we started the committee stage this afternoon there was no-one here from the Democrats. I was a bit concerned and thought, `Good heavens! Maybe their way of not wanting to deal with the amendments is not to turn up in the chamber,' but we worked on from there. I have listened to your argument and I do not see how you have demonstrated that these words actually do what you have described as your intent. I have heard the claim that you are concerned about various factors, but these are the words we have inserted into the objects, into various other provisions in the act, and I do not see how putting them here actually adds anything further.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH EMPLOYMENT) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-09-02,"—The attempt in amendment No. 11 is once again to balance the issues which have quite properly been attended to by Labor and the coalition—that is, wanting to examine youth employment with the issue that discrimination should not be arbitrary and should be permissible only to the extent necessary to further these objectives. It is a constant balancing act. As to the events yesterday and the view about hastening the Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Youth Employment) Bill 1999  through, there is no subterfuge in my approach. I would like you to have as many weeks as possible to be subject to as much pressure as possible on these issues. You understand that, I understand that, and that is what it is about.
As to my amusement yesterday, many people have opinions about the minister. Everyone knows that the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business is an extremely capable and experienced politician. The way in which he was able to manufacture an event which had a lot of humour to it, with the consequence that we are dealing with his bill ahead of other ministers' legislation, I thought was rather masterful, given the nature of things. I think we all have understood what has happened. Surely the only winner in the legislative timetable is Mr Reith. We must admire political skill where we see it, frankly, even 
 if the opinion of the minister might vary according to the person who is dealing with him.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH EMPLOYMENT) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,1999-09-02,"—I have one comment to add to Senator Murray's, because he has gone down the path of Mr Reith's behaviour yesterday. I am not going to go into the point about how masterful I regard the minister, but I will say that Senator Murray and I have a differing perspective about the minister's motives. In the context of his earlier comments, I would like at least to put them on the record. There is one view that the minister thought this pressure that the Democrats think they are able to develop was actually going to change Labor's position. From what has been highlighted since he made his political ploy, I think it is pretty clear that Labor is not moving on its position. I think he understood that yesterday morning. I think he has understood that for quite some time. I think the minister's motives on this occasion were to take an opportunity to kick the Labor Party. You can debate how masterful he has been at that, but I do not think it was a masterful strategic ploy that was going to make sure Labor stayed on the line. The minister knew very well that the Labor Party was not shifting on this issue.
The only reflection there is that perhaps it might be nice if the Democrats had more influence on the Labor Party or the government. The reality is the minister was not going to accept any proposal from the Democrats on this issue unless they had something to offer. The only thing they have to offer which scared me stiff is barking on something on the second wave. I am considerably pleased that they did not have that opportunity.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-09-02,"—I move Democrats amendment No. 13 on sheet 1524:
(13)	 Schedule 1, item 5, page 4 (after line 19), at the end of the item, add:
	 (3C)	 The Commission must not approve an application under subsection (3A) to include in an award a junior rate of pay for employees who have turned 18 years of age.
This does not deal with making existing awards pay adult rates at a lower age. This deals with the ability for the commission to decide on a case by case basis that there will be new award junior rates clauses. One of the surveys we referred to earlier, when the minister and I were discussing matters early in the debate, indicated that about three-quarters of all awards have youth rates. This amendment would deal with the quarter that do not. It tries to make sure that any new award junior rate clause at least recognises that young people are regarded as legal adults at the age of 18. We are trying to give some guidance to the commission on new applications to insert junior rates in new awards. That is particularly important because of the way the objectives of the act and section 88A and 88B are framed. Thanks to this agreement between Mr Beazley and Mr Reith it will be almost impossible, in our view, for the commission to refuse an application to insert junior rates clauses in new awards. The government and the Labor Party might take the view that that is perfectly appropriate. But we say that, if there are to be new junior rates, let them not be over the age of 18. I am indebted to the Leader of the Opposition for putting it so well previously. I have quoted the speeches accordingly. I hope the Labor Party will agree with this approach. It quarantines junior rates to those awards that have them for people aged over 18 years.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH EMPLOYMENT) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,1999-09-02,"—I have a question for Senator Murray. I thought he had already made his last stand, but this appears to be his last stand on the issue of a ceiling. Can he tell me how he has in mind that a new award be defined? I am going to take the opportunity to get some advice on this briefly from the department, because I can see some obvious on-the-face problems here.

 while I get that advice, he might give us any understanding he has.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH EMPLOYMENT) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-09-02,"—There might not be the need to take advice. I might have used language a little loosely. There are existing awards which do not have youth rates. The purpose of the amendment is avoiding a youth rate provision being put in an existing award. Did you get that response, Senator Collins?
—Sorry, Senator. I understood that you would want further advice on that problem, too.
—Let me repeat my response. I said I might have used language a little loosely. I meant that there are existing awards which do not have youth rates. If youth rates were introduced into existing awards, this would prevent those youth rates extending beyond the age of 18.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH EMPLOYMENT) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,1999-09-02,"—No, Senator Murray; I understood that that was certainly your intent. My problem and concern, even in addressing the issue of principle here, is that there are some other complications which appear fairly obvious to me. As I understand it, although the scope to achieve it is reasonably limited, there are still some state awards in the system that aspire to federal jurisdictional status. I suspect a consequence of this amendment would be that the classification schema in those awards would not be translatable into the federal jurisdiction.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-09-02,"—Mr Temporary Chairman, I wish to move amendment No. 14. But before doing so, I make a suggestion to the minister and to Senator Collins. I can see the way in which this is going. Frankly, I feel like somebody who is punching a marshmallow, because I am just not getting anywhere. So my inclination is to put the remaining amendments I have, one after the other, speaking very briefly to them. That means that the full arguments will not always be expressed. Other senators may, of course, want to have a longer exposition but, if you are happy that most of the arguments that surround this issue have in fact been debated—we have a remaining eight amendments which we do consider important—I would like to do that. I also ask, without having given the government or the opposition the advantage of seeing my notes, if it might be appropriate for me to incorporate my notes—if I was permitted by Hansard  rules—to make sure that they are grammatically correct and edited. Otherwise, I would have to read my speaking notes, and I am conscious that senators have a program ahead of them and may prefer for us to get on with this.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,1999-09-02,"—Senator Murray, perhaps I can just address your request. You are right; some of these issues are simply revisiting arguments that you have earlier put. It is my view that from the opposition's perspective those arguments have actually been adequately addressed and countered. I would hate to think that I would read something the next day, after the vote had occurred, which had been incorporated that I might actually find has some valid substance. I am not quite sure how you propose to deal with that difficulty. I do not believe that we have simply been standing here rejecting, rejecting, rejecting; I think that there have been very valid concerns raised from the opposition's perspective. I know that Senator Alston has been very quiet. From his perspective, maybe he thinks this is just a deal. But, from our perspective, yes, there is an arrangement, but I think that there are quite rational reasons for upholding that arrangement, and I think I have dealt with that on every issue that these amendments have raised so far. I would hate to think that you might actually raise a valid argument that gets lost because you have incorporated it and that we would not see it.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH EMPLOYMENT) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1,speech

(21)	 Schedule 2, item 1, page 6 (line 13), at the end of paragraph (ea), add ""while seeking, as far as possible, to eliminate discrimination in pay rates on the basis of age"".
I will speak as briefly as I can to these amendments. Amendment No. 14 is about completing the process that the commission was empowered to do by our 1996 junior rates amendments. What we asked the commission to do—and some people have always misrepresented this—is, firstly, hold an inquiry generally into junior rates and then apply the act as it stands, with its joint emphasis on promoting employment and opposing discrimination on a case by case basis, to current awards. The commission was even allowed to authorise junior rates on a case by case basis past June 2000 where it was of the opinion that was justified.
As an aside, I am quite glad that that little item was not incorporated, because the typing error was `juniper' instead of `junior'. That would have confused Hansard no end.
However—moving on from `juniper' rates—mindful of the commission's work backlog, this provision seeks to extend that process to 1 July, requiring the commission to complete its case by case analysis of junior rates by then. Without this deadline, without forcing both unions and employers to face up to the issue of junior rates, we did not think anything would happen. Under this provision the commission would be forced to test case by case whether junior rates were needed to promote youth employment. Our view is: what union would, in the absence of a deadline, commit itself to wasting scarce union resources making an application under the new bill to review junior rates when the hands of the commission have been so comprehensively tied? I have gone through the operational aspects of why the unions will probably never succeed in having a junior rate 
 removed or reduced under this act, and I do not propose to repeat that.
Amendment No. 15 refers to the strangling clauses. I have tried to put in a fall back by asking the chamber to at least ensure that when the commission considers youth employment ages it also considers age discrimination issues.
Amendment No. 17 is the provision we inserted in 1996 which allowed the commission to pursue junior rates clauses past 22 June 2000 only on a case by case basis using principles established by a full bench. We thought that was a good and fair process. The five very fair, very considered, very workable principles established by the commission should have made it into the act, and the fact that they are missing is a problem. The principle of maturation skills we have had a discussion about earlier. The principles of discrimination, protecting workers, measures for young workers, junior rates and training wages and a reasonable balance of entry for young people to industry have been discussed, so I will not explore those at any length, unless there is a decision to debate them.
Amendment No. 19 has been moved at the request of the ACTU. Mr Greg Combet, Assistant Secretary of the ACTU, who I understand is to be the new General Secretary, said:
The present situation is one of widespread and arbitrary inconsistencies in the minima payable to young workers in different industries not accounted for by differences in the nature of the work done or the skills utilised by the workers concerned. No coherent rationale is available for these discrepancies which remain because award restructuring under a longstanding IRC structural efficiency principle has not yet been applied to junior rates. Young Australian workers deserve a fair hearing in relation to such fundamental issues as: who is a junior; how sensitive is youth employment to changes in youth wages; and consideration of the relationship between skills, training, competence and age, particularly for over 18-year-olds.
So that amendment seeks to establish the rationale for principles that Mr Combet viewed as so essential for the systematic development of junior rates clauses. Obviously, in moving the amendment, we indicate that we agree with them. A quick look at the table on page 75 of the IRC report shows just 
 how inconsistent the relativities between awards are—and nobody disputes that. The Labor Party does not dispute that and the coalition does not dispute that. But the rationale for the different rates needs to be challenged, and we think there should be some kind of consistency, some kind of principle, which emerges from it.
I think amendment No. 21 is self-evident. We have discussed that before, so I will leave it at that, unless senators want me to respond to any particular issues.
—Did you speak to amendment No. 20?
—I will not bother to speak to No. 20 either, Mr Temporary Chairman.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH EMPLOYMENT) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,1999-09-02,"—I will attempt to run through these amendments very quickly also. I think I will go back to amendment No. 14. Senator Murray, I think I will call that your GIO amendment. Presumably, the motivation behind this one is to prevent the GIO circumstances ever being maintained, which is to require the commission to review, I presume, of its own motion. It is an interesting idea. Unfortunately, it is too little too late. As I said, having received these late yesterday, I have not been in a position to apply a comprehensive analysis of how it sits in the total schema of the act. I do not think the department really has been either, in that context.
To require the commission to review these awards of its own motion is an argument that has some merit but, in the context of the commission's own decision that we need to proceed on a case by case basis, which will in some sense establish some of the principles that the commission will use to guide it in consideration of matters on a case by case basis, I do not really see how bringing in this requirement at July 2000 is, in terms of the commission's processes, even achievable. As I recall, in the decision itself the commission implied that a task of that nature it itself would not regard as a priority. The Democrats might argue with that position—and they could probably run a fairly good argument—but that is what the report says, and I have 
 already indicated that Labor's position is to accept the decision of the independent umpire. We are not completely happy with everything in that decision either, but again we have accepted the decision it has come down with, and that is what this bill seeks to implement.
Moving on to amendment No. 15, I think that is a case of `ditto' where it was argued earlier in your amendments. In amendment No. 17 you seek that the full bench establish principles. Well, the commission's decision already tells us the framework and the approach that it thinks is appropriate. Again, that is what this bill is doing and that is what Labor is supporting. I can understand why the Democrats might like another full bench inquiry to revisit the areas where you do not think you have been successful in the commission's decision, but again I have indicated that Labor's position is to support the framework that the commission has recommended should be established.
With amendment No. 19, you have indicated that Mr Combet made various comments. As you were going through them, I was thinking, `Gee, it sounds very similar to the description that the commission has given of the field as well: the inconsistencies et cetera that exist.' Indeed, the commission has described difficulties associated with junior rates and discrimination. I think the ACTU and the commission are at one on some of those problems, but again their solution to those problems is different, and Labor have indicated that we support this bill in establishing the framework to implement the commission's decision, the decision of that independent umpire.
Again we are dealing with a full bench consideration to establish principles. That is going to occur through the case by case process in the current scheme. Much of what is drawn on here draws on existing wording in the act or attempts to introduce the presumption that I have argued is still within the act. To highlight that point look at point (e), the structural efficiency principle. Commission principles apply to the structural efficiency principle already. That is a case of repetition and draws on much of what I have already said about how the commission deals 
 with classification structures and work value issues, et cetera.
I highlight one issue that Senator Murray referred to, and that is consistency. I agree with your concerns about consistency; I wish we could go back to prior to 1996 in terms of how the act was framed with respect to the issue of consistency. That comment on its own makes exactly the point I am making: there are many areas of inconsistency that have developed under the government's schema since 1996—quite deliberately, because it is Minister Reith's intention that there should be more inconsistency as workers bargain on, or in many cases bargain away, many of their entitlements at a workplace level because they simply do not have the same bargaining position as the employers that they are dealing with. Minister Reith is quite happy for that to occur and he wants to further extend the schema of this legislation to enable more of that to occur. I look forward, Senator Murray, to more from you on the issue of consistency because we will obviously draw on those principles over the next month or so.
Moving to the last two amendments: the comments I made about amendment (19) apply to amendment (20); ditto my comments on various amendments going back to (1) for amendments (17) and (21). So I have nothing further to say on the amendments as they stand. Labor will be opposing them because they are not consistent with our support of this bill as implementing the framework that the commission sought to implement arising from its decision on the junior rates inquiry—the inquiry which was commissioned as a result of the deal done between the government and the Democrats back in 1996.

I oppose the clause for a similar reason to that which I have just given. I think there ought to be a termination provision in legislation that affects the forests of this country. We need to ensure that we can review regional forest agreements and state management plans that are not being abided by. There is a need for the Commonwealth to review the expenditure that is going to the forest industries. If the forest industries or their minions in the states are not complying with even these weak provisions, the Commonwealth ought to have the ability to terminate.

6A  Amendment of RFAs
	 Nothing in this Act is to be taken to prevent the amendment of an RFA by the parties to an RFA where the parties agree that the circumstances are such as to warrant amendment of the RFA and where they have consulted interested stakeholders about the amendment.
Amendment (9) seeks to insert an additional clause, 6A, which would read:
Nothing in this Act is to be taken to prevent the amendment of an RFA by the parties to an RFA where the parties agree that the circumstances are such as to warrant amendment of the RFA and where they have consulted interested stakeholders about the amendment.
We would suggest that this is a commonsense measure that empowers parties to an RFA to make marginal changes in the light of unforeseen developments. For instance, one can envisage that a natural disaster—a bushfire—occurring in an RFA region could have a substantial impact upon the operation of that RFA and the operations that are permissible under that regional forest agreement. Therefore, unforeseen circumstances could possibly require that some amendment to the terms be implemented.
Similarly, it is possible that, during the period that an RFA is in operation, new information may come to light that had not been reasonably available at the time that the RFA was entered into. The parties may, as a result of that new information, believe an amendment to the RFA to be necessary. In such circumstances, one can readily envisage that it could lead to agreement for areas to be reserved that are additional to those agreed upon at the outset of the RFA.
We submit that it is likely that this power exists in any event, but our amendment seeks to make it explicit that this power exists and to impose a requirement that interested stakeholders must be consulted about the terms of any such amendment. We believe that would be reasonable, given that that process is required to take place during the development of an RFA itself. This is a commonsense amendment that adds clarity to the bill, and we ask this chamber to support it.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,1999-09-02,"—The 
 government opposes this amendment, as we consider it unnecessary. The bill, as it stands, only makes special reference to termination and compensation provisions originally contained in an RFA to ensure that they are not subsequently watered down. It does not otherwise attempt to restrict RFA variations by mutual consent. Senator Murphy noted in the Senate on 10 March 1999 that:
The bill is really the warranty or the insurance policy for the regional forest agreements.
. . .              . . .             . . .
So we have to understand that the legislation is underwriting what has been put in the agreements. The agreements are the crucial aspect to all of this.
It is assumed that the reason for this amendment is not to attempt to subsequently circumvent those termination and compensation provisions. If, rather, it is to deal with unforeseen events, such as fire or disease, that might compromise the character of reserves found in an RFA region—as I said, we consider the proposed amendment unnecessary—the RFAs themselves allow for such amendments, and wood supply contracts with state agencies also allow for such unforeseen events as fire and disease to be taken into account.
Further, the Office of General Counsel has this to say about the proposed clause. I quote from advice dated 10 August 1999, page 10, paragraph 26:
This clause would require consultation with interested stakeholders before an RFA could be amended. The term `interested stakeholders' is vague and has the potential to be extremely wide, thus making compliance with this term difficult. If, on the other hand, this proposed amendment is an attempt to ensure that RFAs in existence before 1 March 1999 can be amended to comply with the changed definition of RFA in the bill without going through the parliamentary scrutiny process, this also seems doomed to failure.
On the basis of clear legal advice from the Office of General Counsel from which I have previously quoted, adoption of that changed definition of RFA will have the likely effect of ensuring that existing RFAs will not be recognised as RFAs under this bill.
There is some further legal advice which has considered one implication of this. I am following a question which was raised with it 
 by Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. I seek leave to table that advice.
Leave granted.
—As a result of that advice, RFAs made prior to the commencement of this act, such as the Tasmanian RFA, are likely to be reopened to the parliamentary scrutiny process, contrary to the assertions of the opposition. So we oppose the amendment.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech

(12)	 Clause 6A, after ""RFA"" (first occurring), insert "", in order to protect the environment,"".
Democrat amendment No. 12, on sheet 1514, page 4, seeks to amend opposition amendment No. 9 on sheet 1290 Revised 2. It puts in the words `in order to protect the environment'. This makes it explicit that regional forestry agreements can be amended for environmental protection.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1999-09-02,"—I indicate to Senator Greig that we cannot accept the amendment. The reason is that the effect of the Democrats amendment on our proposed amendment would be to limit its operation to relate only to amendments of an RFA where those amendments are related to protecting the environment. It is quite feasible that such amendments that might be agreed upon between the state and the federal governments are related to protecting the environment, but it is also possible that other amendments could be made in the future that have another purpose as well as that, such as with respect to employment. We do not believe that our amendment to the bill should be restricted to amendments which relate only to protecting the environment.
That is not to say—in case it is even contemplated—that amendments to RFAs would be proposed that would somehow be injurious to the environment; rather, we are saying that there can be a range of reasons why the state and federal governments might believe that an amendment to an RFA is necessary. They can be related to environmental reasons. They can be related to employment reasons. They can be related to social policy reasons, community reasons and so on. We do not believe that it 
 should be restricted to the environment. Our amendment ensures that what Senator Greig may be trying to achieve is already encompassed.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-09-02,"—Regarding this amendment, I ask Senator Forshaw for his view on who the interested stakeholders are. I presume the parties are the Prime Minister and the Premier of the state. Who are the interested stakeholders?",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1999-09-02,"—I will respond to Senator Brown. Interested stakeholders would certainly include those groups that would have been consulted in the development of the RFAs—those groups who chose to be involved in the processes of developing the RFA.
—Very vague!
—Senator Troeth, if you want to argue your point that it is vague and therefore would be held by a court to be invalid or unconstitutional, I think you should get some better legal advice. If you read the national forest policy statement, nowhere does it exclusively define the various groups that may have an interest in the development of an RFA and who can be involved in the process. If you have a look at the way RFAs are being developed in those areas so far, you will see that it is pretty easy, in practical terms, to identify who the interested groups are.
One could start with the industry—the companies that operate—whether they be large companies or small timber mills. They would also include trade unions—the employee representatives. They would include industry organisations, such as NAFI, or their state based equivalents. They would include environmental groups. They would include local government. They would include state government departmental bodies. It is pretty clear who the interested stakeholders are.
We are talking about an amendment that is directed at amendments to an RFA. If we could have legislation that results in RFAs which come about as a result of consultation, negotiation, agreement between state government and federal governments and a whole range of other groups, then surely it is equally possible that, when an amendment of sub 
 stance is proposed to that RFA, we can identify who those interested stakeholders are. I do not have any concerns that anybody who wanted to argue that this term was not able to be clarified, in the particular circumstances of the case that might come before a court, would have any great difficulty in identifying whether or not it had been complied with. After all, the concept of reasonableness is one that runs right through the law.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-09-02,"—The Australian Greens will support this amendment, but I am very aware that what it really means is that at some future date there can be an emendation of a regional forest agreement by a Prime Minister and a Premier. Never in the history of the whole fight for the forests can we cite a case where compensation flowing from such an act or change has been anything but for the woodchippers. We have to have that in mind and have trust that the woodchippers have got everything under this legislation—supported by both the major parties with some minor amendments—and that there may be at some future time an amendment that could be made by a Prime Minister and a Premier more responsive to the vast public opposition to the destruction of Australia's forests which is written into this legislation.
It is vague, but I would say to Senator Forshaw, who has brought forward this amendment, that it is better than the point of view being exhibited by the government, which is that the public, who are opposed to this legislation, should not be consulted at any stage in the future; that it should be lock-down legislation to their friends in the woodchip corporations. The anti-public face of the government—and, in particular, the Prime Minister, who is signing these agreements—comes to the fore when the government cannot even take a step to support consultation with stakeholders for a mutually agreed change to a regional forest agreement in the future. I will, of course, support Senator Greig's amendment because it says, in effect, that an amendment ought to be looking to protect the forest environment in this country, and that is what we Greens are totally about.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-09-02,"—I move Greens amendment No. 13:
(13)	 Clause 7, page 4 (lines 28) to page 5 (line 13), omit the clause, substitute:
7  Compensation for breach of RFA
		 The Commonwealth is not liable to pay any compensation arising out of a breach of an RFA.
This amendment would affect clause 7, page 4, line 28 to page 5, line 13 by omitting the clause and substituting instead under the heading `Compensation for breach of RFA' that:
The Commonwealth is not liable to pay any compensation arising out of a breach of an RFA.
Here we are in the heartland of this legislation, which is lay down misere for those who would destroy Australia's wild forests unnecessarily. Here we are at this point where the Howard government not only is prepared to give woodchippers the control of the forests for the next 20 years—that is the term of the duration of this legislation—but also says that, should any future minister of the Commonwealth move to protect one tree anywhere in the vulnerable forests in this nation of ours, then the woodchip corporations get the compensation. In other words, the Australian taxpayers, who own those forests, have to give money to the woodchip corporations, that do not own the forests, for not cutting the forests down. These are the woodchip corporations that not only do not own the forests but also have not paid a red cent for any of it.
So it is the blackmail clause. But the blackmail is being paid on the very people who do 
 not have a say in this; that is, the Australian people. The opinion polls show that 80 per cent of Australians are opposed to this legislation. It is 87 per cent, I think, in the latest Western Australian opinion poll. These people do not want this unnecessary destruction of our forests in Western Australia, Victoria, Tasmania, New South Wales and Queensland where these regional forest agreements, signed personally by the Prime Minister, will come into play with millions of hectares of those forests then targeted for logging—that is, cutting down, with the destruction of the ecosystems and the wildlife in them—over the next 20 years. And the Prime Minister says, `When I put my signature on these documents, not only my government but no future government for two decades in this country ought to be able to get in the way of those chainsaws.'
Then we come to clause (7), which was added late to this legislation. It says that the Commonwealth is liable to pay any compensation if it should intervene to protect forests in the future and that the money will be payable out of money appropriated by this parliament. As far as this government is concerned, the only activity this parliament can take part in for the next 20 years is to dip into the pockets of the people of Australia to pay off the logging corporations for not cutting down forests. What an extraordinary failure this is—failure of the government to respond to the people of Australia and their wishes and failure of responsibility to future generations who want this forest heritage and its wildlife kept.
The influence of the woodchip corporations who fund government election campaigns is written right through it. You have to look at how that influence works. The very people who are most likely to benefit from this clause are companies like North, the biggest woodchipping corporation in the Southern Hemisphere, which, by the way, is mining uranium against the wishes of the Mirrar people at Jabiluka at the moment. I have here the latest figures for contributions from North to political parties. They are for last year, 1997-98. According to this, the Labor Party 
 got $89,000 and the Liberals got $90,000—a total of $179,000 for the year.
—What about the Nationals?
—A National Party senator, Senator McGauran, interjected there and said, `What about the Nationals?' It may well be that what Norm Sanders, former Democrat senator in here, had to say about then Tasmanian governments giving away the forests was true—that those politicians did not even have the brains to put their hands out. I do not know about the Nationals, Senator McGauran, but you can get up and talk about the corporate backing that the Nationals get and why you will be voting for this compensation clause.
—Mr Chairman, I rise on a point of order. We can all sit here and listen to this argument being repeated over and over again by Senator Brown. It is untrue and it does not wash. I draw his attention to standing order 193(3), which says:
A senator shall not use offensive words against either House of Parliament or of a House of a state or territory parliament, or any member of such House, or against a judicial officer, and all imputations of improper motives and all personal reflections on those Houses, members or officers shall be considered highly disorderly.
I think it is very clear that Senator Brown is more than impugning; he is actually stating that the decisions taken by members of the parliament from a number of political parties are based upon improper motives. I would ask you to call him to order and rule that those arguments are highly disorderly. They are defamatory and they are untrue.
—On the point of order, I advise you, sir, to be very careful about going in the direction that Senator Forshaw implies, because we are moving in the realm here—
—Senator Brown, I am ready to rule. There is no point of order. I have listened carefully to what you have said in this debate so far and, although you have gone fairly close, I do not think you have impugned. 
—That is a very proper ruling, Chair. I am very careful in these matters, but of course they are very legitimate matters for debate.
—Nice to know you think our motives are proper.
—The sensitivity of parliamentarians must never be allowed to get in the way of open public debate on the way in which politics works in this country.
—All this is on the public record.
—Over the interjections, Chair, I want to go on with this chart, because we are dealing here with a compensation clause which is most likely to end up benefiting the big woodchip corporations in this country. If we look at Amcor, which operates in three states, we see that in 1997 it gave $30,000 to the ALP, it gave $90,000 to the Liberals and it gave $10,000 to the National Party. That is a total of $130,000. Boral, which is very active in New South Wales but also has taken over Northern Woodchips in Tasmania, gave $52,500 to the ALP, $69,000 to the Liberals and $19,000 to the Nationals. That is a total of $140,500. The National Association of Forest Industries, NAFI, gave $3,000 to the ALP and $5,000 to the Liberals. And the New South Wales Forest Products Association gave $2,000 to the Fred Nile Party, which of course is not represented here. In Western Australia, Wesfarmers, which I understand owns Bunnings, gave the ALP $23,000—
—Wasted.
—I think that is an unfair reflection on Wesfarmers. These corporations have an obligation to their shareholders. They do not give money away for charitable purposes; they give money away because they are in the business of purchasing influence. Wesfarmers gave the ALP $23,000, it gave the Liberals $25,000 and it gave the National Party $20,000, a total of $68,000. When you add all that up, just in one year these companies and associated interests gave the major parties in this country more than half a million dollars.
Here we have a clause which says, as direct as you like, that, if any future particular minister for the environment moves to cut across the interests of those corporations as written into this regional forest agreement legislation, the parliament will be obliged to compensate those corporations. These are regional forest agreements that the government does not want this parliament to vet and is opposed to this parliament seeing. We have seen in the last couple of days that the Tasmanian, East Gippsland and Central Highlands regional forest agreements in Victoria cannot be brought before this parliament—except in one circumstance, and that is when a future federal minister moves in the interests of this nation to protect a forest or an ecosystem, if not for its aesthetic or intrinsic values then because the country is howling against the impending destruction of that place. And in that circumstance we do come back to parliament to work out how much money—blackmail money—is given to the woodchip corporation so that they will keep their chainsaws at home. What an extraordinary circumstance. What would the people of Australia think if they knew what was going on in this piece of legislation?
Of course, I put this to the government in this committee. Who drew up this clause? Were the barristers and legal advisers of any woodchip company in any way involved? I think they were. Was Daishowa, totally owned in Tokyo, or any of its legal advisers involved in the drawing up of any part of this legislation, particularly this compensation clause? And do you know what? The government is not going to answer those questions because it cannot truthfully answer them.
So we have this extraordinary situation where, at an extended sitting—because the government wants to get this legislation through before it can come under any further scrutiny—we get to the part which says in such explicit terms that the beneficiaries out of this, no matter which way you look at it, are a handful of woodchip corporations, and the losers, whether you look at it from an environmental or an economic point of view, are the people of Australia.
The chamber is almost empty. The government can get two people to sit in its seats for this debate. The Minister for the Environment and Heritage, who is out of this chamber, has been in here once during the debate leading up to this particular impasse, and that was for about five minutes when he made no contribution at all. What a dereliction of parliamentary duty from a government which said that it was there to govern for all of us.
If the government cannot explain why this is written for the woodchip corporations, I ask it to explain why there is no compensation clause here for the workers. Senator Troeth is quick to fire off broadsides at the conservationists, quite wrongly transferring the blame for the loss of jobs in the industry from the woodchip corporations and their automating across to conservationists. Whoever is the cause of loss of jobs, is it only going to be a Green in this place who says, `This compensation clause is not the right one. If you are going to compensate someone, compensate those who are going to lose their jobs in the wake of these regional forest agreements,' like the 480 who have already lost their jobs in Tasmania? As soon as the Prime Minister's signature was on the paper, they started shedding jobs. Why is there no clause here which gives compensation to the people who are really hurt by these deals?",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,1999-09-02,"—The government has no intention of agreeing to this amendment. It would seek to destroy any confidence remaining in RFAs if the other Green amendments were agreed to. Senator Brown is trying to indulge in a total erosion of confidence in the RFAs, whereas the government believes that the RFAs set strong economic frameworks around the timber industry. This amendment would ensure RFAs are no different from previous forest agreements where parties have been able to walk away from their commitments with impunity and they would be back where we started, which is exactly where the Australian Greens would like us to be. This government does not intend to breach any RFA to which it is 
 a signatory. We are clearly committed to ensuring that RFAs work.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech

"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,1999-09-02,"—The Australian Democrats will be supporting this amendment for all of the reasons which Senator Brown outlined. Further, Parliamentary Secretary Troeth argues that, in her view, and presumably in the government's view, this amendment would bring about a total erosion of confidence in the RFA process. I would argue that the RFA process has suffered, most particularly in my home state, the greatest erosion of confidence in any piece of public policy I have seen in a long time. Senator Brown's amendment is an attempt, I believe, to introduce some confidence into the process. For that reason, the Democrats will support it.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-09-02,"—I thank Senator Greig for that support. Of course, he is absolutely right. You will have noted, Mr Temporary Chairman, that my challenge to the government to say whether the legal advisers to the woodchip corporations were involved in drawing up this legislation, and in particular this compensation clause which advantages them, has failed to get any response at all. The parliamentary secretary cannot answer because to answer that question would be to indict the government for the process that is involved here, which gives clear favour to the woodchip corporations. I read out just a while ago the way in which the woodchip corporations give clear favour to the parties who are involved in bringing this legislation before the parliament.
Let me look at how those corporations work in their influence elsewhere. Let me give the example of the forest companies in Tasmania making donations to the Forest Practices Board. This is the so-called arbiter of whether forestry is proceeding according to the law and with the aims set out by parliament. Here we have a situation in which the Forest Industries Association of Tasmania puts in 40 per cent of the funding for that board—$349,000 in 1997-98—and Forestry Tasmania, 
 which is in effect an extension of the woodchip corporations, though it is a semigovernment instrumentality and, by the way, has been excluded by Labor and Liberal parties in Tasmania from freedom of information surveillance, puts in 48 per cent. So 88 per cent of the funding of the so-called independent arbiter in Tasmania, the Forest Practices Board, comes from the agents of the logging industry. Can anybody say that that is a right and proper process? Can anybody say that an instrumentality 88 per cent funded by people with vested interests is going to be free to independently levy the management of forests in Tasmania?
The Forest Practices Board is the forest practices unit which is charged with carrying out the Tasmanian government's laws in regard to logging in that state—and remember this regional forest agreement turns over all Commonwealth powers to that process. You find in the Forest Practices Board 1995-96 annual report that for that year $61,000—over 10 per cent of the total funding of this forest practices unit—came from none other than North Forest Products, the biggest woodchip corporation and the owner of three woodchip mills for hardwoods in Tasmania. At Hampshire, south of Burnie, it recently built the largest export woodchip facility in the Southern Hemisphere, which can crush a million tonnes plus of rainforest and eucalypt forests in any given year and send them to Japan or Korea with no further processing. In its establishment it shed 80 jobs out of the industry in Tasmania. It employs only 10 people to run its computers. That is what this whole process is about: an extraordinary farrago; a network of influence which is the major agent for undermining confidence in the whole industry. Ask the small sawmillers in Tasmania what they think of the influence of the big corporations on government, on political parties and on Forestry Tasmania. I dare say it is the same everywhere else.
If we are going to look to the future, let us also look overseas. Under this clause, which Labor supports the government in wanting to put through, we could find ourselves in Australia facing the same situation as the Canadians, who just 10 years ago, to get back 
 the South Moresby Islands for a national park and world heritage area, paid $106 million into the lumber industries. To do what? Just to keep their chainsaws at home. The Canadian public paid $106 million to logging interests so that they would not go in and log these spectacular islands on the coast of British Columbia. Who did that? It was the Canadian national government and the provincial government of British Columbia.
That is the prescription that this clause puts in place in Australia. If in future we had a minister for the environment who actually rolled up his or her sleeves and went into bat for the environment in this country, something we do not have at the moment, and he or she looked at their responsibilities under the World Heritage Convention and said, `Well, I want to protect the world heritage value forests of the Picton, Huon and Weld valleys in southern Tasmania and/or the tallest trees in the Southern Hemisphere in the Styx River valley, because that is in the nation's interest and I don't want to see those forests pulverised and destroyed so that they are lost forever from this nation's heritage,' she or he is going to run into a blackmail provision. The industry is going to do the assessment, isn't it, of what it thinks it is going to lose out of those forests. It is going to raise the spectre of hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars compensation. It is going to use those monetary figures to crush any minister who moves in that direction in the future.
Tonight we have the Labor, the Liberal and the National parties saying, `Well, we are going to give legal teeth to a situation which leads to that blackmail situation down the line.' It is not conjectural. This is real. This is here because the woodchip corporations have international connections. They know that what they can do in Canada one year they can do in Tasmania another. I ask the government: what is the value of the forests that are now open to the woodchip industry under this legislation? What is the figure? If you are going to have a compensation clause which puts at stake taxpayers' money in this country, then you should know what that compensation clause makes you liable for. I 
 want to know from the Howard government, the Rt Hon. John Howard, who signs the legislation which puts at risk the taxpayers' money in this country—
—Mr Temporary Chairman, I take a point of order. I would ask that Senator Brown refer to the Prime Minister by his correct title. The Prime Minister is not the Rt Hon. John Howard; he is the Hon. John Howard, Prime Minister of Australia. I ask that Senator Brown refer to the Prime Minister by his correct title.
—I uphold the point of order.
—I accept that the Prime Minister is not `right'. I will go along with Senator Troeth on that. I withdraw any imputation that his title included the word `right' because you know, Chair—I shouldn't tempt you; but we know—that he is wrong. I am glad Senator Troeth picked me up on that. What I was saying is that he is never so wrong as when he puts at stake this nation's ability to protect its own environment. He is never so wrong when, moreover, he brings into this place legislation which says that for any future responsible minister or government to do so will involve hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers' money.
The question I was putting to the Prime Minister's agent, the parliamentary secretary in here, Senator Troeth, who is in charge of this legislation, is a simple one: what is the compensation figure that is involved in this legislation? Are we really going to blindly give support to a compensation clause without knowing what that means, without knowing what the liability is? Of course we can't. So Senator Troeth is about to tell the committee the liability she sees and what the government's estimates are for this compensation clause. To do otherwise, or to fail to do that, is to fail in the responsibility that she and Prime Minister John Howard's government have to the people of Australia.
—The question is that the amendment be agreed to.
Motion (by Senator Troeth) proposed:
That the sitting of the committee be suspended till 8 o'clock.
—I will agree to that because it will give Senator Troeth a whole hour to get those figures for us.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-09-02,"—I thought the parliamentary secretary Senator Troeth might be on her feet at this stage, because before the dinner break I asked her to give an evaluation of Australia's forests that are targeted for destruction by this piece of legislation. I think the area could be as great as 13 million hectares, but it is certainly millions of hectares. The great beneficiaries—because, as a rule of thumb, they are going to get 90 per cent of these forests—will be the big woodchip corporations, like North, the biggest woodchipper in the Southern Hemisphere; Amcor; Wesfarmers, who own Bunnings; Boral; and others.
We have here this extraordinary compensation clause—clause 7—of the Regional Forest Agreements Bill which says that any action by the Commonwealth in the future to protect the forests that these marauding companies are targeting will result in the payment of compensation by the people of Australia. The only thing that can be returned to this parliament in terms of review of this legislation and its enormous impact on the forests of, say, Tasmania in the next 20 years will be a compensation bill for the woodchip corporations.
Whatever one might think about woodchipping—and Senator Troeth has made it clear that she is in favour of it in the most sensitive native forests that I have been talking about, including world heritage value forest in Tasmania and rainforests and forest in the Otways in her own region—one has to say that if a government acts in a way that makes 
 the public purse liable like this, then it ought to know what that liability is going to be. No insurance company, for example, would accept a clause like this one without knowing what the liability could be.
There is no liability, of course, for actions committed by the woodchip corporations. For example, in Tasmania each year thousands of hectares of prime forests and plantation forests are burned to a cinder by Forestry Tasmania. It comes in, firebombing forests late in the summer as part of its `log, then firebomb, then poison' process, which the Hon. John Howard says is ecologically sustainable logging. Inevitably, when it drops its incendiaries or lights its land based fires to burn to a cinder any remaining morsel in these wild forests that it is attacking, some of the fires get away; for example, in the Mathinna forest reserve in north-east Tasmania. If you walk in towards the Mathinna Falls, you will wonder why the forest is blackened. It is because Forestry Tasmania, ignoring weather forecasts last year, lit a match to one of the areas it had overseen the destruction of. The fire got away, and thousands of hectares of plantation and other forests were burned.
Where is the compensation clause for that sort of activity in this legislation? That is done on behalf of the woodchip corporations who make donations to the Liberal Party and to the Labor Party. Where is the compensation clause for them to pay when, through negligence or inability to control their own activities, they cost the public millions of dollars in loss of an asset? There is none here, and I will tell you why: it is because this clause is written by the woodchip corporations. I challenged Senator Troeth—who is having a hard time of this debate because she does not know much about it—earlier in this debate to get up and say that the woodchip corporations had not written this clause in this legislation. I challenged her to say, for example, that none of the barristers or legal people involved with Daishowa—which has its headquarters in Tokyo—drew up this clause, handed it to the government and had it inserted as the last piece of this legislation. If silence is consent, then Senator Troeth and the government of John Howard—the honour 
 able Prime Minister—have consented to that supposition that I have put to this chamber. What can you think of that? Senator Forshaw might be able to clarify the situation and give an assurance that that is not the case, but I do not think he will.
—Don't say anything.
—We didn't draft the bill, for a start. We certainly didn't consult with the woodchip industry.
—Senator Forshaw says that Labor did not draft the bill, and Senator Troeth advises him not to say anything under these circumstances. So I am left with the supposition—as is anyone who is going to read Hansard —
—I think you are talking to yourself. You are answering your own questions.
—Senator Forshaw, I am making very serious allegations here.
—Spurious.
—And they are to be debated. That is what this forum is for.
—Ignored.
—You say that they are to be ignored.
—They are outrageous.
—And that they are outrageous. They are outrageous. These actions are outrageous, if they are the case. But it ought to be for a government that has put so much effort into a clause like this to get up and say that is not so. It ought to be that a government can get up and say, `This is the liability on the public purse,' but it does not even know that.
I move on to the miners. Under the Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreement—and you can crinkle your brow about this on the government benches—the compensation goes to the mining corporations as well. If an area of forest is protected by any future government activity in Tasmania in the interests of this nation as a national park or a world heritage area—in the Tarkine or the Great Western Tiers or the Tasmanian Peninsula, for that matter, where Senator Troeth has been;  there is world heritage value forest there 
 which ought to be protected in that way—under the Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreement the mining corporations can put their hands out and demand compensation. I ask the government to say what  liability there is.
The mining corporations have successfully tweaked the ears of the Labor Party of Jim Bacon, the now Premier of Tasmania, to get this compensation up for them and to prevent national park or world heritage status—for example, for large tracts of the Tarkine wilderness in north-west Tasmania. They have successfully got the Prime Minister on side. This is the Hon. John Howard that Senator Troeth does not want me to call `The Rt Hon. John Howard', who flew to Perth in Tasmania the year before last and signed the document giving the miners compensation should any future minister want to protect forests in Tasmania on behalf of the nation. And yet I do not think for one minute that he or his representative in this chamber tonight is able to give any sort of idea of what liability that puts on the public purse. What we do know is that, as far as the miners and the loggers are concerned, there is no limit to the compensation they can get by simply being prevented at some future time from taking in the drills or the chainsaws to some of the most spectacular and wonderful wilderness on the face of this planet. That is what we are dealing with here tonight.
We are dealing with a government in silence and on the run over this legislation, a government which has no answers and which is unable to engage in debate—and, not least, we are dealing with an absent minister for the environment, Robert Hill, who does not have the gumption to come into this place and debate the matter, because he sold out on this nation's forest heritage. That is the same minister we had in here today clucking about the fact that there is going to be some United Nations Earth Day ceremony in Australia next year, as if that is a measure of environmental excellence. I have no doubt environmentalists will be keen to hear about that, but there would not be one in this country, of the 80 per cent of people who do not want the forests destroyed, who would not prefer him to use his powers and his responsibility under 
 the Westminster system to move to protect these forests instead of to line the pockets of a woodchip corporation or a mining corporation which in the future might be prevented from destroying wilderness by some more enlightened minister for the environment.
While I know the government will not be able to answer as to what the liability is that they are putting on the taxpayers of Australia should they go to protect the national heritage in the future, the government has had legal advice about the matter of Tasmanian miners getting this privilege but not miners in other regional forest agreement areas. On the face of it, that is a breach of section 99 of the Constitution, which says that the Australian government will not treat one part of the Commonwealth—one state or one region—differently from another. On 24 February, the Australian Government Solicitor wrote:
It is arguable that the undertaking to pay compensation in clause 95 of the Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreement in its application to mining and mining products is given by the Commonwealth under its constitutional power in section 51(i) of the Constitution.
But there is no mention of section 99. You can tear up Australia's environment, you can offer compensation without knowing how much—without having done the prudent work that is involved in that—and, if my argument here is correct, you can trample across the Constitution, all in the interests of big corporations in this country and all against the interests of the majority of people in this country.
I am speaking to government benches where there is the bare minimum of senators here tonight to defend the indefensible. I challenge either of those two to get up and respond to the challenges I have just made to them. I challenge Senator Troeth to get up and give the figures and facts I have asked for. After all, we have these regional forest agreements, we are told, because the scientific work has been done, the economic analysis has been done and this is a balanced document as far as treatment of future forests is concerned. We have none of those things. Instead we have a sell-out to the woodchip corporations and we have a government which has been found in this committee to be totally 
 unable to defend that sell-out, which knows it is indefensible and is frightened to even try to mount a defence of this document which is against the interests of the majority of Australians.

I note that I was not even able to get Democrat support for a division on the previous very important amendment. This second amendment is to amend the clause so that it has the effect I have been arguing for: that compensation ought not be a matter for the woodchip corporations.
As regards the argument we have just been having, I am quite well aware that I will get no more support on this amendment than I had on the earlier one. I am not going to delay this committee by going over the same arguments. I simply point out again that we have a silent government here, and this matter is extraordinarily important. When the time comes and we are back in this house determining how much compensation should be paid out to one of the woodchip or mining corporations which make these big payments into the election coffers of the big parties, I will draw the attention of the house to this moment, when a ministerial representative failed to get up to give justification to this compensatory clause against the interests, as I have said two or three times earlier, of the Australian people and their purse.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1999-09-02,"—by leave—I move opposition amendments (10) to (13):
(10)	 Heading to clause 7, page 4 (line 28), after ""breach "", insert "", amendment or termination "".
(11)	 Clause 7, page 4 (line 29), after ""compensation"", insert ""in relation to actual losses arising from the loss of legally exercisable rights"".
(12)	 Clause 7, page 5 (line 1), after ""RFA"", insert ""for a breach, amendment or termination of an RFA"".
(13)	 Clause 7, page 5 (after line 8), after subclause (2), insert:
	 (2A)	 The Commonwealth is not liable to pay compensation except in accordance with subsection (1) or (2).
These amendments deal with the issue of compensation, and the purpose behind them is to tighten up the compensation provisions. We do not disagree that compensation may be required to be paid in certain circumstances, but we wish to clarify that and place certain limitations on situations in which compensation would be payable. It is best if I refer particularly to amendments (11) and (12), which are the substantive amendments.
Amendment (11) seeks to restrict the Commonwealth's potential liability to pay compensation to actions that cause actual losses arising from parties being prevented from exercising their legally exercisable rights. The government's bill states that the Commonwealth is liable to pay any compensation that the Commonwealth is required to pay to a state in accordance with the compensation provisions of an RFA. The compensation provisions in individual RFAs are quite extensive and somewhat complex. In the Central Highlands RFA, for example, the relevant clauses take up about one-quarter of the entire regional forest agreement. That particular regional forest agreement imposes a compensation liability where the Commonwealth takes action to protect the environment and heritage values that has the effect of preventing or substantially limiting forestry and mining operations, the construction of roads for the transport of forest products, the sale or commercial use of forest products or the first sale or first commercial use of mining products. In the case of forestry and forest products, the liability only applies to action impacting on land outside the RFA 
 reserve system. In the case of mining operations, the liability also applies to parts of the reserve system, excluding only dedicated reserves in which mineral exploration and mining is prohibited. The compensation liability is not extinguished simply because an RFA expires or is terminated.
Compensation is payable to the state government concerned, which is responsible then for passing it on to the firm or firms that were adversely affected, and arbitration procedures are to be used to resolve disputes between parties. Our amendments seek to restrict the Commonwealth's compensation liability to actual losses arising from legally exercisable rights that were curtailed as a result of the Commonwealth action. We propose this because we believe that the existing wording is too open ended. For example, the Central Highlands RFA lists as relevant evidence for a compensation claim not just signed contracts but also documentation of management history or other records establishing clear intent to do something. In our view, such an approach exposes the taxpayers to an unacceptable risk.
If the parliament does not more clearly define the compensation provisions by leaving the issue to the negotiation of individual RFAs, it would then be possible for more generous arrangements to apply in one state or region compared to others. There is no sound policy reason for this to be so and it would indeed be inequitable.
I turn to amendment No. 12. This amendment clarifies the circumstances in which compensation is payable to encompass the amendment, termination or breach of an RFA on the Commonwealth's part. In our view, the government's bill does not properly define the circumstances in which compensation is payable, leaving this to be resolved as part of the negotiation of individual RFAs. As I said earlier, such an approach exposes taxpayers to unacceptable risks. The argument for compensation is based on the concept of breach of contract. That is why we propose that compensation be payable where the Commonwealth action entails a breach, amendment or termination of an RFA. They 
 are the words, of course, that we have included in our amendment No. 12.
In our view, the Commonwealth should not have to compensate firms for action that was quite lawful for it to take and which did not conflict with the strict terms of an RFA. Further, we are concerned that, unless these provisions in the act are amended to refer only to actual losses arising from the loss of legally exercisable rights and for actions that entail a breach, amendment or termination of an RFA, if those limitations are not included, it is quite possible that compensation claims would be brought in respect of claims for anticipated or future losses at some substantial period of time into the future. Whilst these matters could ultimately be resolved through the courts, in our view it is not appropriate to provide for a situation where, for instance, if an amendment to an RFA is made and if there is no actual loss incurred by a firm, a claim by that firm that in 15 or 20 years time it may well have received some benefit or income is given credence under this clause. As we have said, whilst we believe there is a clear case for compensation to be payable, in our view that should be based upon a demonstration of actual losses arising from the loss of legally exercisable rights. We have moved amendments Nos 10, 11, 12 and 13 together to give effect to the principles that I have just outlined in support of these amendments.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,1999-09-02,"—The government will be opposing these amendments because we believe that their purpose and effect are confused. On the one hand they seem to attempt to restrict compensation to actual losses incurred, and on the other hand they appear to extend coverage to amendment and termination of an RFA whether or not that amendment or termination is made in accordance with the provisions of the RFA. In regard to the latter, the opposition amendments appear to be based on a major misunderstanding of RFA compensation arrangements. Compensation is payable if the Commonwealth breaches an RFA, not if an RFA is amended or terminated within the provisions allowed by that RFA. The govern 
 ment strongly believes that compensation provisions should be as provided in each RFA itself. The Commonwealth will offer the same compensation provisions for each RFA, subject to any minor changes necessary to accommodate different state conditions—that is, use of particular mediation or arbitration mechanisms.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-09-02,"—I will be supporting all those amendments, although they do not fix the problem that these clauses are an absolute and astonishing affront to proper governance. They put the public of Australia, which owns the forests, in the position of having to pay compensation to the woodchip corporations, which have never paid a red cent for those forests. Let me give you an example of what might happen if the public determined through the parliament that it wanted to protect part of the forests. There are world heritage values in the Styx Valley in Tasmania, where the tallest living trees in the Southern Hemisphere and the tallest hardwood trees on the face of the planet are not protected under this regional forest agreement, and if some future government moved to protect those trees and the woodchip corporation said, `World heritage value or not, we were going to log them,' would this open the way for a compensation claim by that woodchip corporation under the provisions? Could Senator Troeth tell us that?
—The question is that Democrat amendment No. 13 be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-09-02,"—I just cannot allow the minister's lack of a response to pass as I have asked a very specific question about world heritage value forests in Tasmania. If a future government gets the guts to act on behalf of the Australian people to protect those forests or just feels that it has a responsibility under the international world heritage convention to fulfil the spirit of that convention, it would be impelled to protect those forests. I have asked the government a question that really goes through to the Prime Minister, who signed the document which puts these compensation provisions in; it was not anybody else. The question is: in those circumstances will the people of Australia have to pay the woodchip corporations millions of dollars in compensation simply to leave their chainsaws at home?
I put that question again: if world heritage value forests in the Styx Valley with all their wildlife and intact ecosystems, the Huon Valley forests or the Tarkine wilderness rainforests are to be protected by some future responsible government, will compensation under this clause therefore flow to the woodchip corporations simply by them having to leave their chainsaws at home? That question, Mr Temporary Chairman, I am putting directly to the government. I am giving Senator Troeth, on behalf of the Prime Minister, the opportunity to answer that question.
I have cited the circumstances in Canada, where a central government paid $105 million to the British Columbian government to stop the chainsaws being sent into the South Moresby Islands, which are now world heritage areas. This is a directly analogous situation. I put it to Senator Troeth: are you not saying that North—the woodchip corporation which, by the way, puts hundreds of thousands of dollars into the electoral fighting funds of the big political parties—would be able to claim compensation simply for not destroying those world heritage value forests in Tasmania?
Mr Temporary Chairman, we are going to have a period of silence here, I suspect, because this process is so repugnant, so anti-public, so against the interests of this nation and such a travesty of good governance that 
 this government representative, who is effectively the Prime Minister sitting in that seat, cannot get up and defend it. The silence coming from that seat is the consent to what I am saying. I cannot do anything about that except record here my utter protest at what is going on and at the fact that the opposition supports it with some minor amendments which make no difference to the central premise. I find this whole process appalling beyond belief.
—Well, why are you prolonging it?
—I find that comment from Senator Troeth just an appendage to the appalling performance that we are hearing here tonight. She cannot get up and answer a question of the magnitude of this, but says in effect, `We want to go home; we don't want this debate prolonged.' Nor do the woodchip companies, but 80 per cent of Australians think differently, according to the opinion polls over the last decade.

(7)	 Clause 7, page 4 (line 29), omit ""The Commonwealth"", substitute ""Subject to subsection (4), the Commonwealth"".
(8)	 Clause 7, page 5 (after line 13), at the end of the clause, add:
	 (4)	 The Commonwealth is not liable to pay any compensation to a State for breach of an RFA by the Commonwealth where the conduct by the Commonwealth that constitutes a breach of the RFA:
		 (a)	 is necessary to ensure compliance with Australia's international obligations to protect listed threatened species and ecological communities; and
		 (b)	 is undertaken after the Environment Minister decides, on the advice of the 
 Director of National Parks or the Scientific Committee that it is necessary to amend an RFA because of new or revised scientific knowledge that indicates there is a serious and imminent threat to the long term viability of that listed threatened species or ecological community in an RFA region.
	 (5)	 In subsection (4):
 Director of National Parks  has the meaning given by section 514A of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 .
 Environment Minister  means the Minister who administers the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 .
 listed threatened ecological community  has the meaning given in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 .
 listed threatened species  has the meaning given in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 .
 Scientific Committee  means the Threatened Species Scientific Committee established by section 502 of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 .
These amendments are designed to limit compensation claims so that there is no liability for compensation if regional forest agreements are changed due to environmental reasons. There are two instances where this works: firstly, with respect to any changes needed to be made to ensure our compliance with international obligations on the environment—a very reasonable amendment—and, secondly, where the environment minister makes a decision that it is necessary to amend an RFA because of new or revised scientific knowledge that indicates there is a serious and imminent threat to the long-term viability of a listed threatened species or ecological community in a regional forest agreement region.
We accept, though we believe the chamber is wrong, that the chamber has disagreed with us to oppose unlimited liability in all cases. Now we put to you the case that the chamber should not be party to a 20-year mechanism to pit protection of the environment against the threat of compensation. We do not want a golden sledgehammer to be the excuse for losing the habitat of threatened species.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,1999-09-02,"—The government opposes these amendments because RFAs provide the basis on which the Commonwealth is liable to pay compensation. The RFAs also spell out how such issues as the treatment of threatened species and additional world heritage areas are to be dealt with during the term of each RFA should new or revised scientific knowledge become available.
It is most unlikely that the Commonwealth would have to breach an RFA to ensure compliance with international environmental obligations. However, if the Commonwealth does breach the RFA in order to protect the environmental and heritage values in native forests and if such action has the foreseeable and probable consequence of preventing or substantially limiting certain land use or the sale of certain wood based products specified in the RFA then, quite rightly, the Commonwealth should be liable to pay compensation. Such compensation provisions are necessary to provide potential investors with the level of security required to facilitate what is quite often long-term and high cost investment in the forest and wood products sector. The proposed amendments would severely undermine that certainty.
Further, the Democrat amendments try to coopt arrangements applying to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. As I have stated before, arrangements under that act are not to apply to regions covered by an RFA so their inclusion in this bill is not appropriate.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1999-09-02,"—The opposition opposes these amendments as well. We believe that the compensation provisions included in the bill along with the amendments that were carried a moment ago, which limit the compensation for losses incurred, are appropriate. There is a fundamental reason we cannot support this proposition. It conflicts with an inherent principle of not only the Constitution but also the legal system. If the Commonwealth, in having regard to or in implementing the obligations Australia has under an internation 
 al agreement—and I recall in one of your amendments there was a reference to international law—infringes the legitimate and legal rights and entitlements of a person or a company then, as a matter of legal principle, the latter is entitled to at least pursue compensation for losses incurred.
The fact that the infringement of the rights of such an individual or such a company is brought about by what could be seen to be a noble purpose and a bona fide purpose—that is, to implement the provisions of an international obligation under some environmental convention or whatever—does not mean that that other person's rights are in any way lessened or of less value. They still have legal rights. As the parliamentary secretary said, they may be rights that have arisen under some contract.
To suggest that you can just use an international convention on the environment as a basis to take away other people's legal rights and in a blanket fashion say in those circumstances they are not going to have a right to compensation is attacking the fundamental principle of the law. It does not matter whether it relates to the Commonwealth exercising its authority to comply with an international convention or obligation or to building a road or an airport or engaging in some other legitimate Commonwealth activity that gives rise to people's property rights or other rights being infringed and due compensation being payable. We cannot support these amendments because we see them as inequitable and based upon a false principle.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-09-02,"—What an extraordinary proposition coming from the Labor Party which was an arbiter of economic rationalism and which entered into a whole range of agreements to cut down barriers and take away markets, for example, for businesses all over this country. There was no compensation there, was there? It is the woodchippers who get the compensation here.
Senator Forshaw interjecting—
—Double standards is what this is about. What about the indigenous people of this country who, in the last term of this parliament, had their negotiating rights 
 over their property taken away by government actions? Who is compensating them? No, they are not woodchip corporations. What about the rights of the indigenous people in Tasmania over their lands?
Senator Calvert interjecting—
—Senator Calvert might grump about that. They are not even being compensated. This is land rights for the woodchip corporations right around this country. It is very specifically for those big corporations because they have influence over the political system.
It is specious to get up and say, `We are following some consistent legal principle.' This is not legal principle; there is no principle in this at all. It is feathering the nests of a few big corporations, against the interests of the many. Under `compensation', the Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreement says that it is:
To protect the environment and heritage values in native forests and in connection therewith the protection of (a) CAR values or (b) old-growth forests or (c) wilderness or (d) any priority species—
that is, endangered species—
or (e) any endangered forest community or (f) national estate values or (g) World Heritage values or (h) wild rivers.
For any of those things, the woodchip corporations will get compensation. Let me tell you this: the tourism industry, which depends more on forests for jobs than all of the native forest loggers in Tasmania put together—hundreds more jobs these days—does not get a penny of compensation under these provisions.
That puts the lie to this other claim, `We're interested in jobs,' because the forest destruction process under this legislation is destroying jobs in the hospitality and tourism industry in my home state and elsewhere around this country. It is going to do so for 20 years and there is not one penny of compensation in here. So, legal principle, my foot! This is favour and largesse to a handful of big woodchip corporations, which have extraordinary power over the political set-up in this country. I will not go through that list of donations again. 
I will support any minor amendment to reduce the liability that is involved here, but I will not put up with this nonsense about this parliament or this chamber having an obligation to put through this legislation to give corporate favour where it is totally out of kilter with all practice that has been going on in this parliament for the last decades.
I say to both the Labor Party and to Senator Troeth, who has brought up the issue of jobs: if this was a compensation clause which required those same corporations to reskill and compensate the hundreds of people they are putting out of work, then I would support it. The Greens have called for that all the way down the line, and neither the government nor the opposition has backed it. I cannot understand why the unions who represent the workers, or the Forest Protection Society, that paid front which works on millions of dollars from the big woodchip corporations, are not fighting for a compensation clause in here for real Australians whose jobs are going to go down the gurgler in the wake of these regional forest agreements. There it is, Mr Temporary Chairman: there is not an argument or a leg upon which the government or the opposition can stand on as far as this compensation clause is concerned.

"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,1999-09-02,"—The Democrats oppose the compensation clause, clause 7, of the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998 . The Democrats believe this sets up a case for unlimited liability—to literally have a blank cheque signed for the native forest logging industry to hold hostage. This is not responsible government behaviour. The native forest logging industry is already in decline. Jobs are going; the industry is in trouble. We believe this sets up an out for the government—indeed, sets in place a mechanism whereby conservation goals will always be held hostage to the threat of unlimited conservation claims.
What will the government do in several years time, when the situation will surely arise that RFAs need to be adjusted to protect more of the environment? I predict they will say, against any evidence to the contrary, that 
 their hands are tied because they are worried about compensation.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1999-09-02,"—The opposition will be opposing the amendment as well, particularly given that we have required that the RFA details be referred to in the Gazette  and they will be readily obtainable. To suggest that it should be published in two local newspapers circulating generally in the area—another noble objective from Senator Brown—is totally unrealistic.
I have a copy of the North East Regional Forest Agreement, which runs to about 50-odd A4 pages. I am not sure how big the newspapers are in the regions that Senator Brown is talking about, but if they are anything like the local newspapers circulating in my area there is no way they could ever fit that into their normal publication. Maybe what Senator Brown is proposing is pandering to the interests of the woodchip companies.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-09-02,"—No. Senator Forshaw is quite wrong about this. The amendment follows the clause that is in the bill. It simply says that when the minister publishes a note in the Gazette  stating that an RFA has been entered into, and giving details of the region and the date when that RFA came into force, that should be put in the newspapers. There is nothing about the 54 pages of the RFA at all. Mind you, I then go on to say in a foreshadowed amendment that the details should be in the Gazette  so 
 that people can find out what they are and they are not left secret, like they are now. It is proper government practice to put notices in newspapers when there are government activities affecting local people. So much for the big parties saying this is good for regional and rural Australia. As soon as it comes to informing people about what is going on in the simplest terms both the big parties say, `No, we won't do it.'",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech

	 ; and (c)	 incorporating the text of the RFA.
(15)	 Clause 8, page 5 (after line 24), at the end of the clause, add:
	 (3)	 In this section:
 RFA  includes an amendment to an existing RFA.
These amendments are also related to the issue of publication of RFA information. Amendment (14) would add, in clause 8, a new paragraph (c) to subclause 1. The words are `incorporating the text of the RFA'. Amendment (15) seeks to add the words `in this section RFA includes an amendment to an existing RFA'.
The first amendment would amend clause 8 so that the minister is required to gazette the text of an RFA in addition to the other matters listed in the bill. We believe that this improves this clause of the bill. We recognise that the text of an RFA is lengthy, as I have already referred to in respect of the earlier proposal from Senator Brown. Nevertheless, we consider it reasonable that such text could be published in the Commonwealth government Gazette. They are not short documents, by any means. It is a recognised practice that the Commonwealth government Gazette can, as required, print similar documentation, even if it is in a lengthy form.
In respect of amendment (15) we are also concerned to ensure that the text of any 
 amendment to an RFA should also be gazetted. I think the reasoning for that is self-evident. Even though the amendment may happen to be by mutual agreement between the parties and, following our amendment, after interested parties or stakeholders have been consulted, we still think it is reasonable that such amendment to an existing RFA is published in the Gazette. Of course, in such a situation the changes to the original text would be what would be gazetted rather than some requirement to publish the full text again. I seek the chamber's support.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,1999-09-02,"—The government will not be supporting these amendments. The text of completed RFAs, which may run to over 100 pages, are already available on the Internet and hard copies are also available free of charge to interested persons. So the government considers that sufficient to ensure that details of the RFA are in the public domain.

This is a small amendment. It may be seen as a pedantic one by some, but we believe it is very important.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-09-02,"—I support that and, of course, I support these Labor amendments because they are exactly the same as the Greens' amendments. Once again, we have, however, the government resistant to putting details of documents signed by the Prime Minister into the proper government documents, the Gazettes , where records are kept of what governments are doing. But I guess this government, and certainly the Prime Minister himself, opposes 
 this measure simply because they do not want it to go down on the record what they are doing here. I cannot blame Senator Troeth or the Prime Minister for that, but it is not the right thing to do. They should be agreeing to this amendment.

	 The Governor-General may make regulations prescribing matters:
		 (a)	 required or permitted by this Act to be prescribed; or
		 (b)	 necessary or convenient to be prescribed for carrying out or giving effect to this Act.
By amendment (1), which proposes a new clause 9, the government wishes to establish a Forest Products Advisory Council. The majority report of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee recommended the passage of the bill without amendment. It also recommended, in part, that a wood and paper industry council should be established. Noting that recommendation, the Minister for Forestry and Conservation, the 
 Hon. Wilson Tuckey MP, publicly stated on 25 February 1999 that the government supported the establishment of an appropriate and representative stakeholder consultative body. However, Mr Tuckey believed that the final form would be considered by the government in the context of the industry action agenda that has been initiated with the wood and paper products industry sector.
After further consideration, the government is proposing an amendment which provides for the establishment of a Forest Products Advisory Council with its functions and constitutions to be established by regulation. This amendment will ensure all stakeholders of the government's commitment to establishing such a council, while leaving scope for the actual functions and constitution to be fleshed out by regulations following consideration under the action agenda process. Such regulations would, of course, be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. I commend the amendments to the committee.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1999-09-02,"—The opposition will be opposing these amendments. The reason is that we have proposed amendments, particularly opposition amendment (16), which would, if carried, establish a wood and paper industry council under the specific terms of this legislation. The government's proposal is, in our view, insubstantial and weak. Senator Troeth has referred to the fact that the majority report of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee proposed the establishment of a wood and paper industry council. That is correct. It was also proposed by the minority report issued by Labor senators, but in our minority report we specifically indicated that, to give a wood and paper industry council substance and the necessary level of support and recognition, it was vitally important that such a body be established under this legislation and that the functions, objectives, composition, et cetera, of such a council be detailed in the legislation.
We believe that the Regional Forest Agreements Bill is very important legislation. It emanates from the national forest policy statement and brings to a pinnacle all the work that has been done and we hope will be 
 done over ensuing years to bring that process of regional forest agreements to reality. An essential part of that is to ensure that we promote and develop a wood and paper industry in this country; that we give impetus to such things as value adding and to meaningful employment; that we do try to give impetus to measures which will seek to deal with some of the problems that have been pointed out by Senator Brown and Senator Greig—that is, the parlous state of the industry in economic terms; and that we provide a mechanism whereby we can turn around that significant balance of trade deficit in our timber industry.
The national forest policy statement encompasses more than just resource security and conservation matters; it also encompasses, as an equally important factor, industry development. There are specific undertakings about the efficient use of wood products, about value adding, about structural adjustment and about international competitiveness.
It was the former Labor government, after consulting key stakeholders about the development of the wood and paper industry strategy, that actually established a wood and paper industry council. However, when the coalition government were elected in 1996, one of the first things they did was abolish that council. That showed you how much interest or enthusiasm they had in promoting a timber and paper industry in this country. They replaced it with a low-key Wood and Paper Industry Forum. Even the minister himself, Mr Tuckey, has admitted that this body has met on only two occasions during the last parliamentary term of this government.
What sort of a body was that if it could meet on only two occasions? It is a body that the industry had no confidence in and has no confidence in today. The workers have no confidence in it; the trade unions have no confidence in it. What the industry seeks, and what the workers and the trade unions seek, is a proper wood and paper industry council, one that has real teeth, one that has real substance, not some body that can be established at the whim of the minister and abolished at the whim of the minister. Given the 
 attitude of this current minister, who, whenever he comes across anyone who does not agree with his viewpoint, goes to war with them, we believe it is vitally necessary for this council to be established under legislation.
I have to say, as we know, that the government's proposal was never in the original legislation. It is quite clear that, if it were not for the Senate legislation committee, where all of the senators, certainly from the government and the opposition, saw the importance of such a council, we would not even have this government amendment. The government would not even have been proposing, as they are in their proposition, a Forest Products Advisory Council. Of course, the emphasis that I put on the word `advisory' is the correct one. It would really be there just at the whim of the minister, and one can imagine how little notice he would take of any such advice that was forthcoming if it did not agree with his rather extreme views.
Whilst I have been on my feet I have enunciated the reasons in principle as to why we believe there has to be a wood and paper industry council but said that it needs to be specifically established pursuant to this legislation. I have outlined those reasons and we will be moving that amendment in due course. On that basis we will be opposing the government's proposed Forest Products Advisory Council.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,1999-09-02,"—The Australian Democrats will be opposing this amendment by the government for the creation of a Forest Products Advisory Council because it is to us the antithesis of what we believe we should be doing with our forests. The promotion of a Forest Products Advisory Council perpetuates the notion that our native forests should be plundered, that they should be felled for timber and that they should be pulped for paper. That is repugnant to the policy and philosophy of the Democrats. As we have argued repeatedly for 22 years, paper and timber must come from sources other than our ancient forests. For the reasons I have outlined, we cannot and will not support this proposal by the government.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-09-02,"—I oppose this move by the government simply to featherbed further the industry. If the government think that the Australian Greens would be party to establishing a council like this, which we leave to future regulation set up by the Prime Minister, they must think we have the sort of inconsistency that they do—that is, that we would oppose regional forest agreements but set up a council of lackeys of the woodchip corporations to oversee the whole thing. We will not have a bar of it.

29  Regulations
	 The Governor-General may make regulations, not inconsistent with this Act, prescribing all matters:
		 (a)	 required or permitted by this Act to be prescribed; or
		 (b)	 necessary or convenient to be prescribed in carrying out or giving effect to this Act.
This amendment, as I have just pointed out in considering the government's amendment, will establish a wood and paper industry council under this legislation. I will not take the time of the chamber by reading out the quite detailed provisions that are set out in amendment (16), but I will quickly refer to them. Firstly, it establishes a number of objectives of such a council. It also explains the functions of the council in quite a detailed fashion. It provides that the powers of the council are:
. . . to do all things that are necessary or convenient to be done for, or in connection with, the performance of its functions.
It provides for industry conferences that may be convened from time to time. It provides for the publication of council reports, which would be provided to the minister, and then such reports would be tabled in each house of parliament. The constitution of the council is an important section of the proposal. We propose that it be constituted by the following:
		 (a)	 a person representing the Commonwealth;
		 (b)	 a person nominated by each of those States which have entered into RFAs under this Act; 

		 (c)	 2 persons nominated by the Australian Council of Trade Unions;
		 (d)	 a person representing persons having an interest in the protection of forest environments and ecosystems;
		 (e)	 a person representing the interests of the hardwood sawmilling sector;
		 (f)	 a person representing the interests of the softwood sawmilling sector;
		 (g)	 a person representing the interests of the pulp and paper sector;
		 (h)	 a person representing the interests of the timber furniture sector
		 (i)	 a person representing the interests of the reconstituted wood products sector;
		 (j)	 a person representing the interests of merchandisers and retailers of timber products;
		 (k)	 such other persons (if any) as represent such other bodies or organisations connected with the industry as are specified by the Minister in the instrument of appointment.
That council will clearly be a very representative body of industry representatives, persons representing employees and persons representing the interests of the environment movement. The various states will also be represented along with the Commonwealth.
Provisions are also set out to reflect the responsibilities of the chairperson, deputy chairperson and other members of the council. There is a range of other provisions which provide for the method of termination of appointment, for disclosure of interests, for the holding and conduct of meetings and for the payment of any remuneration or allowances as prescribed. There are provisions for staff of the council, provisions relating to the appointment of consultants and to the appropriation of money for the purposes of the running of the council, and also provisions relating to the necessity to provide an annual report. The final section is the provision with respect to the making of regulations in regard thereto.
It is a very detailed clause that we are proposing. I have outlined the reasons we believe it is necessary and why we believe it is important to have it spelled out in detail in the legislation. This aspect of the whole process is too important, as I said, to just 
 leave it to the whims of the minister or the government of the day and to the vagaries of the political process. We see that it completes the entire regional forest agreement process. As I said earlier, the RFA process is not only about conservation. It is not only about such things as resource security. It is also about developing a viable timber products industry or wood and paper industry in this country into the future. We ask the chamber to support the proposed council.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,1999-09-02,"—I hope the chamber will take note of the fact that it took Senator Forshaw some five minutes to read through the proposed functions and membership of the council. It is a very detailed prescription. The government considers it far too prescriptive. It goes well beyond the Forest Products Advisory Council which the government was proposing. Our Forest Products Advisory Council, by contrast, would allow consultation with all the stakeholders but not in such a prescriptive way that it would become a straitjacket type prescriptiveness. We believe it can only lead to problems and therefore we are opposing this amendment.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech

I thank the chamber for its cooperation in this regard. This raft of amendments proposed by the Australian Democrats is to do a range of things. I do not propose to go into those in detail. However, at its core, it tries to bring a 
 sense of balance to the proposal by the ALP for a wood and paper industry council. For example, we are proposing that such a council, if it were to be constituted, should be called the Regional Forestry Agreements Forest Management Council. As I said earlier on a similar matter, our argument from the beginning has been that our approach to forests should be one of forest management in terms of looking after the ecology and biodiversity of the forest, not in terms of plundering it for timber or woodchipping it for paper.
In that sense, we propose to go much, much further than both the coalition and the Labor Party with their proposals for such councils. With the council, we want to bring a much greater focus to, for example, ecologically sustainable notions of forest management. We would like to see the council have the jurisdiction of increasing the areas available for conservation purposes, protecting threatened species and wetland areas and also looking at employment opportunities in Australia's forests and forest product industries outside of native forests.
With this raft of amendments, we also propose to involve a much greater range of representatives, to bring a genuine sense of balance to the council—representatives such as those who represent the interests of threatened species, of water catchment areas, of recreational users of the forests, of tourism and so on.
We would go further still and involve greater consultation and liaison with conservation councils such as exist in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania and Western Australia. At its core, we are arguing that, if such a council should exist at all, it must be balanced and that its focus must not be simply on how best to completely exhaust native forests of what they have to offer us in terms of what industry wants but how to best maximise the use of our forests in terms of what the people want.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-09-02,"—I will support the Democrat amendments. I would like some indication from the Labor Party, before we go much further, as to whether it will be supporting the Democrat 
 amendments as well—any or all of them—because, if they are not, I am aware that we are then left with the Labor amendment, and I would like to make some very minor amendments to that to make it more acceptable for my support.
—At the moment, Senator Brown, we are simply dealing with the Democrat amendments.
—Yes, but to do that we have to look at the Labor proposition for this council, because that is what the Democrat amendment alters. The Democrat amendment, of course, is to bring this council into the balance that Senator Troeth has been fighting for all the way down the line and failing to give. It looks at the terms of reference of the council and also at the representation on the council.
The Minister for the Environment and Heritage is with us. So, at last, we might get some account from the minister, Robert Hill. Maybe he will be able to give us a definition, because it is important to this particular amendment, of `ecologically sustainable' when it comes to the logging practices that his legislation here is supporting.
I come back to my request for an early indication from Senator Forshaw. I will present him and the rest of the committee with my proposed amendment, but it does depend on what Labor's response to the Democrats is going to be.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1999-09-02,"—I am happy to oblige Senator Brown. We will not be supporting the Democrat amendments. I will just say this: we have tried to find some measure of agreement with their proposals. I can say on this occasion that this is one of those times that we actually have had the opportunity to talk to the Democrats about their proposals. But, unfortunately, we were not able to do so. On that basis, we will be sticking with our proposed amendment and cannot support the Democrat proposals.
—The question is that Democrat amendments Nos 15 to 40 be agreed to.
Amendments not agreed to.
—The question now is that the amendment moved by the opposition be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-09-02,"—I do not like the look of this council very much. It is just loaded with loggers and people who have all sorts of anti-environmental credentials. It is really important. There is one person listed here—one person out of 14—who is going to have some ecological interest. Of course, under this legislation that will be determined by the minister. I am not sure whether that is the Hon. Wilson Tuckey or the Hon. Robert Hill—Senator Hill is here; he could tell us—but I do know that there is very loose terminology that needs to be tightened up.
I would find myself attracted to giving some support to this council if it had one other person, a person representing the tourist industry. Because in my state more people are employed in the tourist industry dependent on forests than are employed in the logging industry. Almost 10 times as many people are involved in the tourist industry dependent on forests as are employed in the woodchip industry dependent on forests. Obviously, if we are looking at forest industries it is critical that we include tourism. Indeed, the Labor Party does that in this very amendment when in its lead-up to the establishment of the council it cites tourism as being an important part of the business of looking after forests. The second amendment that I have here is to tighten up the words:
(d)	 a person representing persons having an interest in the protection of forest environments and ecosystems;
Goodness gracious, Minister Wilson Tuckey has the word `conservation' stuck after his name in describing his portfolio, so he could be this person. I just think that is totally unsatisfactory. The Labor proposal is to constitute a council made up of persons representing a whole range of logging interests but, as you will see under their clause 15(1), which establishes the council and its representation, part (c) states:
(c)	 2 persons nominated by the Australian Council of Trade Unions; 

I am proposing here that we change part (d) from:
(d)	 a person representing persons having an interest in the protection of forest environments and ecosystems;
which could even be a person interested in destroying them, to:
(d)	 a person nominated by the Australian Conservation Foundation;
I think that is a pretty easy amendment. I propose that and, as I said, I propose adding a person representing the tourist industry. That would be at the discretion of the minister.

Although we will support the amendments, we will be voting against the establishment of the council as a whole. So in that sense it is possibly a trifle academic but 
 it is appropriate to put on the record our support for Senator Brown's amendments.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-09-02,"—I move Greens amendment No. 1 on sheet 1483:
Page 5 (after line 24), at the end of the Bill, add:
9  Amendment of the  Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999
	 Division 4 of Part 4 of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999  is repealed.
This is an amendment which affects the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill which went through this house in June. A very strong criticism that the Greens had of that legislation was that it effectively embodied the regional forest agreement into law. The pertinent section—division 4—gives effect to regional forest agreements. That part of the environment bill that has already gone through and that is awaiting enactment takes away the power of the minister for the environment to intervene to protect forests for 20 years. It echoes this piece of legislation.
The great problem with this is that it is already effectively in law. It is there in law because the Democrats supported it. In this parliament in June I very carefully outlined the problems with doing that. By supporting that bill back then the Democrats were effectively sounding the death knell for forests all over this country. I very carefully went through the reasons for that because the environment bill removed the powers of the Commonwealth to intervene on behalf of the millions of hectares of unprotected forests that are in regional forest agreements.
Yet, and despite knowing that, the Democrats voted for it, and it is now coming into law. Senator Greig, who is taking carriage of this legislation, was not here when that 
 happened, but it is one of the most remarkable things I have seen since being in this parliament. The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill was a matter of secret negotiation between the government and the Democrats. It was dumped on the Senate, and some 400 amendments which they had cobbled together were effectively guillotined through here without debate and without having gone out into the public arena to be discussed. And that is the face of the Democrats in 1999.
Tonight we have seen a series of amendments to try to go back to the old `we stand for the environment' situation, but the Democrats knew that that would not work—the numbers were not here—and they knew that in June. But to get a piece of the power that they are able to get through communications with the Prime Minister's office, they were prepared to sacrifice the forest environment of this country. And that is what they did.
Senator Harradine interjecting—
—They are a bad lot, Senator Harradine, because this was a very bad deal. I do not know why at that stage in a very big bill—I am talking about four pages out of more than 500—they did not negotiate with Senator Hill and Prime Minister Howard to remove this component of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill. That is what I am trying to undo, at least in part, through this amendment.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-09-02,"—One probably would not realise it from the previous contribution, but the Democrats support this amendment. Indeed, it is identical to an amendment that the Democrats had circulated as well to achieve the same aim, which is to repeal the part of the environment act which excludes RFA legislation from it. As the chamber will remember, during the debate on that legislation the Democrats moved to ensure that forests were included for the purposes of the legislation. There is a significant ongoing flaw in that legislation, despite some of the many other positive improvements that were achieved with that amended legislation. As the Democrats said at the time and have continued to say since, there is certainly a hell of a lot of 
 room for improvement still in relation to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act at the federal level, and this is one of those fundamental areas where significant improvement still needs to be made. Unfortunately, at that time the government and the ALP voted together to keep forests out of that environment legislation, which at the time was clearly an ideological decision. Hopefully, in the two months since that time parties have had time to ponder it in a less heated environment, in the cold light of day, and realised the mistake. We hope they will support the Democrats in improving the federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act further by passing this amendment.
It is important as well to correct the misinterpretation that Senator Brown has put forward that somehow or other the component of the environment act that excluded forests was a loss of power that the environment minister otherwise had that has now been taken away. Whilst the Democrats said strongly at the time and will continue to say that it is an area that the environment minister should have power over, and responsibility to exercise that power, it is not one where the power was there at the time. If he did have the power and the responsibility to protect our forests, we would not have the repeated incidences, highlighted in this chamber over many years and including during this debate by the Democrats and Senator Brown, to his credit, continually highlighting the ongoing destruction of our native forests. That has been able to occur because that protection has not been there in legislation. It was not there before and it is not there now under the new act.
The Democrats strongly believe it should be. We were not prepared to sacrifice some of the other positive gains that were made with the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act as amended because we were not able to achieve that gain as well, but it is nonetheless clearly a significant problem. Of course, that was the reason that a number of conservation groups, though realising some of the attacks they would put themselves under, also supported the amended Environ 
 ment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. They knew that, whilst it did not achieve everything that needed to be done, it did make significant forward movement. Indeed, the Tasmanian Conservation Trust, an organisation which has spent many years fighting against the destruction of Tasmania's native forests, also supported the amended Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act because it realised it was a step forward. Nonetheless, as much as anyone I continue to highlight that there are serious inadequacies still in that act as amended, despite its improvement over the existing federal legislation. One of those serious inadequacies is that it does not provide protection for our forests, obviously the major area of Australia's biodiversity. It is a significant flaw, and there is an opportunity now for that flaw to be rectified. I do urge the committee to support this amendment.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,1999-09-02,"—I must point out that division 4 of part 4 of the EPBC Act recognises the fact that the RFA process is to, among other things, satisfy the purposes of that act. As we know, the RFA process provides for management of native forests in line with an agreed national policy which replaces the previous ad hoc system where decisions were made coupe by coupe, licence by licence and business by business. RFAs are intended to provide certainty—both resources for industry and protection for areas of conservation or heritage value. The RFA Bill is intended to underscore this certainty.
That certainty is achieved in part by excusing forestry operations from procedures that duplicate the processes that have already occurred during the negotiation of an RFA, which are the conduct of a comprehensive regional assessment looking at environmental heritage values and economic and social values, assessment under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act and protection of the environment through Commonwealth-state agreements. Senator Brown's proposed amendment, if passed, would undermine the purposes of the whole RFA process, including the RFA Bill, and 
 therefore it is not acceptable to the government.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1999-09-02,"—We will not be supporting this amendment. I have to say that what is notable, at almost 10 p.m. this night, is the contribution from the Democrats on this proposal. How can one forget that it was the Democrats who did a deal with the government whereby the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act was rushed through this chamber with hundreds of amendments, with very little time allowed for debate? The bill was effectively guillotined through. There was really no opportunity for consideration by the opposition or minor parties of the huge number of amendments and the range of matters that were covered by the deal between the Democrats and the government. Yet, having done that, the Democrats come along here tonight and propose that in this Regional Forest Agreements Bill we should repeal division 4 of part 4 of that Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act.
I suppose one point is to recognise the blunder they have made. But the deal they did on that bill is a bigger blunder than just this one. To now try to use this legislation to repeal that division, we suggest, is disingenuous. This a complex issue, the RFA legislation is complex and the parliament has at least had an opportunity to debate it in full; that is why we have been here for the last few days and why the legislation has been before the parliament since last year. Indeed, the amendments proposed by the opposition have been well known to all of the parties in the parliament for some time, so people have been given ample opportunity. That opportunity was denied to us in respect of that environment legislation and to now try to seek to cure some problem by this means is inappropriate.
The other point we would wish to make is that, even if division 4 of part 4 of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act were repealed, it would not really solve the problem with what they did that the Democrats obviously now see, because there is a whole range of mechanisms available to 
 the minister to exempt forestry operations from that act. So the issue is far more complex than what is evident from this amendment.
This amendment will not do what the Democrats or indeed what Senator Brown would seek to do. But I at least take note of this: despite what disagreements we may have had through this debate with Senator Brown, we appreciate his support for the Wood and Paper Industry Council, notwithstanding his professed views about the industry. Secondly, I note that he recognised that the deal between the government and the Democrats on the environment legislation was a disgrace. We are not prepared to support this amendment; the issue is far more complex than just seeking to do what is contained in this amendment.
Furthermore, I point out that earlier we carried amendments to this bill which tighten up the exemption legislation, particularly in respect of ensuring that obligations under international conventions are still relevant and are still applicable, notwithstanding the other provisions of clause 5 of the legislation. For those reasons we will not support the amendment.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-09-02,"—I will respond briefly to those comments. It is true, given the hour and the length of this debate, that the chamber does not want to revisit the debate on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill. But I would point out, firstly, that it was not the Democrats' idea to sit through the night talking about forests so, given that Labor and the coalition agreed to do so, you can listen to this. I did not pick the environment bill but you have decided on it, so you are going to have to listen to comments about it.
It is important to respond to the comments of Senator Forshaw. People listening afresh to his contribution may have taken the interpretation, which may or may not be what his intention was, that somehow or other the Democrats made an agreement with the government on the environment bill—which we obviously did and we were quite public about—and that we forgot about this bit and 
 are now going, `Whoops, that was a mistake. We've got to try to fix it up.' Clearly we did not forget about it—we moved an amendment at the time to try to address it, and, of course, the Labor Party did not support that amendment. As I said in my previous contribution, we believe that is a major flaw in the bill; nevertheless we did not want to sacrifice the overall positive net gain that we had achieved because that flaw was still there.
Perhaps, reading between the lines of Senator Forshaw's contribution, he was saying that, because there were so many amendments and the bill was guillotined through in a short space of time, they did not get a chance to examine it properly. Now they have a chance. They have had a couple of months. They have had a clear expression of concern—both from supporters of the bill and from those that strongly oppose it—that this is an ongoing problem, so they certainly cannot use the excuse this time that it was all done in a rush and that they did not get to have a look at it. The issue has been around now for a significant period of time. You should have voted for the amendment at that time; now here is your other opportunity.
I would also have to say in relation to the issue of doing deals—as I have said on previous legislation in this place today—that I have no problem with doing deals or reaching agreements, whatever terminology you wish to use, with anybody as long as there are overall positive gains. Obviously, you do not agree to something unless you believe, after a strong assessment, that it is an overall positive gain, even if you do not get everything that you want. You always have to wonder whether, if you had held out longer, you would have gained more.
Of course you never know, you hear other people's criticism and you think: experienced people like the ALP know how to do deals, they have been doing them for years, maybe they do not know what they are talking about and maybe they are master negotiators. I suppose one of the positives of the youth wages debacle this morning is that I can see that, if that is the sort of deal that the ALP are capable of—where they come out with a situation that is actually worse than the 
 existing situation and enables youth wages to be extended further—I certainly now know I do not need any advice from the ALP about how best to reach agreements and where best to draw a line as to how far to go.
I will not revisit the whole debate over the environment bill unless I am provoked by further contributions whereupon I need to correct the record. It will suffice to re-emphasise that this is an important issue. Indeed the whole issue of forests—despite the hour and the length of the debate, which can lead to a slightly jaded sense of the mind—is still an important one and it is appropriate to emphasise the significance of it.
Forests are not just a nice little boutique issue to examine on the side occasionally when you have nothing else to look at. The future of our native forests is fundamental to a whole range of issues—economic, environmental, social, biodiversity and so on. This amendment goes to the heart of that as well. It is one of a number of core issues that we have tried to examine through the course of this debate. It is another opportunity to correct one of the still existing flaws in the environment protection act. It does sound like the ALP are yet to follow up what appeared to be their new conversion to environmentalism as expressed by their outrage over the environment protection act. This would have been an opportunity for them to demonstrate that that was more than just an opportunity to gain some political points but clearly that is all that it was and they have reverted true to type when it comes to actually being able to make a positive improvement.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-09-02,"—I can hardly stand listening to that. I can hardly stand the perfidy on Australia's forests that the Democrats have committed. When this sell out of the forests by the Democrats was proceeding in this place before—and we are now trying to undo it—it was perfectly clear that the Greens and the Labor Party, from  different points of view, were going to be consistent. The Democrats knew when they voted to remove Commonwealth powers to protect forests in June that this position would arise with this bill now. Senator Bartlett says it is a mistake.
—No, I didn't.
—He did not say it was a mistake so he stands by the June vote. There is no excusing what the Democrats did then. For months they had been negotiating that legislation. They knew that they were removing federal powers to protect forests when they did it. I pointed out to them that there was no undoing their actions in June. They had been the ones negotiating with the government. They had all the leverage because the government desperately wanted this legislation to come through to remove four pages out of 500 and they did not.
I will tell you why they did not. They felt that sitting at the table with the Prime Minister was more important than sitting at the table of consistency and commitment to the nation's environment. They sold out the nation's environment. They sold out the forests. They sold out 50 per cent of the species of this country that live in those forests. I for one will never let them forget it.
It is easy to wash your hands of critical components of the nation's heritage to get a quick inside run on a legislative enactment of 500 pages which promised all sorts of bilateral agreements on the environment but specified nothing, except for one matter. That was to give the woodchippers what they wanted as far as the forests are concerned. The Democrats voted for that and they knew it. They deliberated on it. They were part of the plan to do it.
They come in here tonight and say, `Oh, well we will try to undo it now.' They have done a 180-degree turnaround. They know the Labor Party is going to be consistent. I will give the Labor Party this: at least it is consistent in this matter. It is a better thing for the environment than the Democrats who sold out the forests in Western Australia, Victoria, Tasmania, Queensland and New South Wales with their cheap purchase of some power and some time at the Prime Minister's table just a couple of months ago.
If they think that is all going to disappear into the air as the trees keep falling down, they are not going to get away with it. The chainsaws in those forests have the hand of the Democrats on them. They knew when 
 they did this in June that they were committed to that action and it could not be undone. Even if this legislation did get through it is not, according to the minister Wilson Tuckey, going to get through the other place. The Democrats knew that but they sold the forests out for a quick gain for themselves.
We are in this situation where this effort to undo the damage by the Greens bringing forward this amendment is going to fail because the Democrats sold it out six weeks ago. We must try. We are going to spend 20 years trying to recover from these two months. That is what Senator Meg Lees, the Leader of the Democrats, did and that is what every other Democrat did in June. I stood in this place and named each one of them at that time and said, `If you do this, you are selling out the forests.' All seven of them went across and voted with the government to sell out the forests with their eyes wide open. Senator Bartlett said, `And we made no mistake.' Let that be on the record. It is not going to help the forests.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-09-02,"—I said when we were debating the environment protection act that I was sure the government and the opposition had better things to do than listen to Senator Brown and me disagree all night long, but there you go. I feel it appropriate to correct the record for, hopefully, the final time in relation to this matter. It is part of a consistent ongoing effort by many to completely misrepresent the content of the environment protection act. That is a shame because there are a lot of positive things in that act. It would be good for them to be further explored rather than demonised and misrepresented.
Simply to correct the record, and given that the proceedings are being broadcast—and I am sure there are thousands around the country, as always, listening in—the Democrats did not vote to remove federal powers to protect forests, and the environment act that went through did not remove federal powers. Federal powers were not there before, and they are still not there. We wish they were. We moved an amendment to put them there which was not supported, and we brought forward an amendment again tonight 
 to try to do that. Clearly it again will not be supported, but that will not stop us from being consistent.
The Democrats' consistent approach on environmental issues—as it has been since we entered federal parliament more than 20 years ago—is to work to ensure overall positive environmental outcomes. We do not walk away from agreements that will ensure positive environmental outcomes, even if they are not perfect and even if they still contain flaws that need to be addressed. That is why, quite clearly, we voted the way we did—with our eyes wide open and by not washing our hands. We were quite clearly saying that we knew what we were doing, that we stand by what we did then and we are still standing by it now. Because of the extent of misinformation that is put forward in relation to that, I think it is appropriate each time to put it on the record that there was not and has not been any winding back of federal powers to protect forests. They have always been inadequate; they remain inadequate. The Democrats will continue to work to improve them.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-09-02,"—It is appalling to hear that from a Democrat. The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act specifically lists all the environmental powers that have been removed. That is what the Democrats negotiated and voted for. The section that we are now trying to remove but will not be able to, and which the Democrats voted for, is on page 62 of that bill. It specifically says:
Approval is not needed for forestry operations permitted by RFAs.
For the millions of hectares of forest in Australia, there is no approval required by the Commonwealth. There is no approval required from the relevant minister. That is a removal of the powers.
Senator Bartlett is trying to confuse the inactivity of recent ministers or the current Minister for the Environment and Heritage with powerlessness. The minister has enormous powers. The fact that they have not been exercised is a political matter; it is not a matter of law. But it is a matter of law that the Democrats have removed the power of that minister to act in the future—for the next 
 20 years—as far as the forests are concerned. They did say `with their eyes open', and they stand indicted on that score.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-09-02,"—I move:
Page 5, (after line 24), at the end of the bill, add:
9  Amendment of the  Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999
	 Subdivision B of Division 4 of Part 4 of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999  is repealed.
We are still trying to rescue something out of the Democrats fire, which is involved in this environment act which exempts forestry operations in eight nominated regions around Australia—in New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia and so on—from Commonwealth environmental scrutiny. They do just the thing that Senator Bartlett says they do not do.
This Greens amendment deletes this exemption. It does not, however, affect the exemptions for regions where there is already a regional forest agreement in force. The amendment should be supported because, if no regional forest agreement is in force, there is no justification for an exemption from Commonwealth environment laws. Despite the heading of subdivision B—that is, regions subject to a process of negotiating a regional forest agreement—the environment protection act does not require a regional forest agreement to be under negotiation to gain an exemption.
Finally, the environment protection act exemption already applies to regions where an RFA is being prepared, so there is no incentive to complete it. I am aware of the numbers against this amendment, and therefore I will leave it at that.

(11)	 Page 5 (after line 24), at the end of the Bill, add:
10  Expiration of Act
	 This Act ceases to be in force at the end of 3 years after the day on which it commences.
This amendment deals with a sunset clause for the whole of the act. The Democrats believe that 20 years of native forest clearing and woodchipping is too long. We think that any government policy or program could do with review after a few years. There is much scientific evidence that decisions made so far are problematic—indeed, I cite the case of Western Australia, where the changes were made to the RFAs within weeks of them being signed. It is a reasonable request to have the sunset clauses so as to review the process, and I believe that a three-year period from the date of assent to this legislation is a more than reasonable period to bring this legislation before the Commonwealth parliament for review.

Clause 1, page 1 (lines 5 and 6), omit ""Regional Forest Agreements Act 1998 "", substitute ""Forest Destruction and Woodchippers' Subsidy Act 1999 "".
This is my honesty clause. This is to do with the name of this bill, which will become an act. Its title will become the Regional Forest Agreements Act 1998. My amendment would a clear description of what it is, and not just a euphonious name. We would therefore substitute the name `Regional Forest Agreements Act 1998' with the descriptive name `Forest Destruction and Woodchippers Subsidy Act 1999'. I think that sums it all up.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1999-09-02,"—I move the opposition amendment on sheet 1530:
At the end of clause 4B, add:
	 (10)	 Proposed amendments to an RFA are subject to section 4A and this section. A reference in these sections to a proposed RFA includes a reference to proposed amendments to an RFA.
This would add a new paragraph (10) to the provisions that we inserted into clause 4 by our earlier amendment dealing with parliamentary scrutiny of draft RFAs. It will be recalled that, earlier on in the debate, we were addressing some of the issues with respect to parliamentary scrutiny. As a result of further examination, we are proposing an additional paragraph that would read:
Proposed amendments to an RFA are subject to section 4A and this section. A reference in these sections to a proposed RFA includes a reference to proposed amendments to an RFA.
What that means in shorthand is that we currently have—by virtue of the amendments that were passed—a process for public and parliamentary scrutiny of draft RFAs. Having gone through that process, if an RFA is then entered into and signed off by the federal and state governments it becomes operative. If at some later time there is a proposed amendment to that RFA, we are providing that such a proposed amendment would be subject to the same system of public and parliamentary scrutiny that is already in place for the RFA itself when it is first entered into. It would be the proposed amendments that would come back for that process of scrutiny, not the entire RFA. We believe that that is an appropriate course to adopt. The principle is the same.

Clause 2A, omit subclause (1), substitute:
	 (1)	 The object of this Act is to ensure that Regional Forest Agreements between the Commonwealth and the States are consistent with the National Forest Policy Statement 1992.
Earlier in this debate the opposition moved an amendment which resulted in subclause 2A(1). We now seek to omit that clause and replace it with point (1) which would read:
The object of this Act is to ensure that Regional Forest Agreements between the Commonwealth and the States are consistent with the National Forest Policy Statement 1992.
We see that as eminently reasonable and self-explanatory.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1999-09-02,"—I indicate on behalf of the opposition that we will be formally opposing this amendment. When this was circulated earlier tonight—but not that much earlier—we noticed that the game was up; that the Democrats were not going to support our proposal for a wood and paper industry council and the detailed provisions that we sought to have included in the bill to give effect to that council.
This amendment would remove from the objects of the act, which we had inserted into the act by an earlier amendment, the reference to the establishment of a wood and paper industry council. It could, no doubt, be argued by the Democrats that this is a consequential amendment as a result of the defeat of our 
 earlier amendment this evening. But it is more than that. It is another sell-out by the Democrats—this time on the side of the government—of the interests of the workers and of the interests of the industry. I won't go over the debate again, but we see the wood and paper industry council as an integral part of the RFA process. The industry is not opposed to that. The workers in the industry are very strongly supportive of it. It is necessary. Time will demonstrate that we are right and that the Democrats are wrong.
I note that at the outset of this debate, a couple of days ago, when the first amendment moved by the opposition was debated, the Democrats supported it. They supported the objects clause that we were putting into the bill, which was twofold. Firstly, it was `to ensure that regional forest agreements between the Commonwealth and the states are consistent with the National Forest Policy Statement of 1992'. The second objective was to establish a wood and paper industry council. The Democrats supported the amendment. That is why it was carried—with their support. They never said at the time that they were opposed to the council. We know that their amendments sought to restructure it, if you like, or create a different structure for the council that we had put up. They wanted to turn it into a council which was made up of environmental representatives and make a whole lot of other changes which would have negated the purpose of the council—that is, industry development, employment generation, value-adding and downstream processing. They tried that mechanism to destroy the integrity, if you like, of the wood and paper industry council.
We would not agree to their amendments so they opposed our proposal, even though they had earlier voted to support the concept by supporting the objects. It just demonstrates again that the Democrats are all over the place. There is no consistency in their position. They will do a deal with the government at the drop of a hat. This is another occasion.

The PRESIDENT,N/A,1999-09-02,"—On 9 September of this year, Mr Pasquale Gagliardi will have been working for the Joint House Department for 25 years. He was the ACT Outstanding Apprentice of the Year in 1968, commenced work with the department as a temporary painter on 9 September 1974 and has worked for the department ever since. He has progressed through the maintenance services area to a point where he is now a works supervisor, overseeing works projects in Parliament House. He has always been a very committed worker, serving the parliament to the very best of his ability. He has those characteristics very necessary for someone in a service 
 industry: he is open, helpful and cheerful. It is hard to imagine how many paintbrushes he must have used in the time he has been here when you contemplate the painting of the Old Parliament House and now this new one, but he is one of the people who enable it all to happen for the rest of us who come here as senators and members. On behalf of senators, I would say to him, `Thank you for your 25 years service.'
