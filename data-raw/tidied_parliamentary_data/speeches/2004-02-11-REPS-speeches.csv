"Andrews, Kevin, MP",LP,2004-02-11,"—I thank all members for their contributions to the debate on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002 [No. 2]. As I said when reintroducing the bill, the government firmly believes that a more unified national workplace relations system means less complexity, lower costs and more jobs for all Australians. This bill also provides special relief for small businesses confronted with unfair dismissal claims and will also further streamline the handling of claims generally in the federal arena. Most significantly, this bill will increase the coverage of federal unfair dismissal laws from about 50 per cent to 85 per cent of all Australian employees. Other workers, including contractors, will continue to have access to relevant state laws and protections.
Members need no reminding that this parliament has debated unfair dismissal laws since the Keating government first legislated for an unfair and unworkable set of arrangements in 1993. That government's partial and untidy retreat from those laws left Australia with seven sets of unfair dismissal regimes, including a national law still regarded with deep suspicion by businesses both small and large. Since 1996 the present government has sought to provide a fairer go all round for employees and employers, while simplifying the means for handling unfair dismissal claims. Progress has been slower than the community and the government would have liked, and every year Australian industrial tribunals still deal with 16,000 to 17,000 unfair dismissal claims. Currently, approximately 40 per cent of these claims are lodged with the Australian Industrial Relations Commission.
Passage of this bill would break the institutional gridlock that makes the handling of unfair dismissals in Australia complex and costly for employers and employees alike. I remind the House that independent research by the Melbourne University Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research shows that one-third of Australian businesses do not know whether their workplace relations are covered by state or federal law. For small businesses, the current unfair dismissal arrangements comprising the federal system and five separate state systems add $1.3 billion annually to business expenses. 
The primary purpose of this bill is to expand the operation of the federal unfair dismissal system. It removes the conditions that an employee of a constitutional corporation must also be covered by a federal award. The deletion of the federal award criterion means that company employees working under a state award would approach the Australian Industrial Relations Commission for remedies against unfair dismissal. When this bill first came before the House my predecessor, the honourable member for Warringah, said:
Maintaining six separate industrial jurisdictions makes as much sense as keeping six separate railway gauges. 
The former shadow minister, the honourable member for Barton, echoed this sentiment when he said at the time:
... it is silly, quite frankly, to have six disparate industrial relations systems, and the Labor Party recognises that.
That sentiment has been echoed by other ALP speakers throughout the course of the debate on this bill. The Australian Democrats workplace relations spokesperson, Senator Andrew Murray, has likewise expressed strong support for one national industrial relations system including a single set of unfair dismissal laws. It is a pity, then, that constructive proposals to get a better system of workplace relations are repeatedly impeded by short-sighted attempts to hang onto existing privileges or protect special or sectional interests. Realistically, there is little prospect of achieving this goal in a sensible time frame by way of referendum or by a referral of power from all the states. If there is to be a uniform system of workplace relations regulation, it must be under a federal law.
With this bill the Commonwealth has demonstrated that it is prepared to use the powers given to it under the Constitution to achieve greater uniformity. The government will be putting this bill forward to the Senate for a second time in just over three months because it believes that the case for reform is overwhelming and should not be further delayed or frustrated.
This government has overseen the creation of 1.3 million jobs in Australia since coming to office, higher wages for workers and historic lower levels of industrial disputation. That has come about because of not only the good economic management of the government but also the reforms that we have made to the workplace relations system. We are committed to those reforms that will mean more jobs and higher wages for Australians. I commend the bill to the House.
 (Mr Jenkins)—The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Rankin has moved as an amendment that all words after `That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The immediate question is that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question.
Question agreed to.

"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2004-02-11,"—Every time this government introduce an industrial relations bill and utter the word `flexibility', we know that Australian working families are about to take a hit. That is what we know about this government. On every occasion that they have introduced an industrial relations bill this term, with the exception of the bill on voluntary service while fully and gainfully employed, this government have attempted to diminish the entitlements and the rights of ordinary, hardworking Australian families. The Workplace Relations Amendment (Choice in Award Coverage) Bill 2002 unfortunately is no different.
This bill, again, is targeted solely and squarely at those employees who find themselves employed by a company with fewer than 20 employees. Like the Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002 [No. 2] that we just voted upon, which unfortunately was passed in this place, this bill, if it were to be made law, would unfairly disadvantage employees in small organisations. An employee who was employed by an organisation of 20 or more employees would be assured of having federal award coverage, provided that the process under the Australian Industrial Relations Commission was properly effected. They would be safe, while those who were employed in an organisation of fewer than 20 employees would not. So this government is about dividing the Australian work force into two groups.
Anyone who has been observing the way in which the federal award system has been going in the last eight years would notice that the federal award minimum conditions are moving further and further away from the actual rates and conditions of most Australian working people. What has in effect happened over the last eight years is that the minimum entitlements afforded to Australian working families in the federal system have become, indeed, just that: the lowest that they could possibly be. There are also, of course, increasingly more people in collective arrangements, mostly through section 170LJ agreements—that is, agreements between the employees, their union or unions and the employer—or collective arrangements between the employer and employees, where you will find that people in most instances would get above and beyond the entitlements, conditions and rates of the award to which they are attached. So, at the moment, we have a federal award system which is, in effect, a safety net system for those people who are not in a position to bargain collectively beyond that entitlement, those who are at the very lowest levels of employment conditions in this country.
This bill seeks to allow a significant number of employees—in effect, millions of employees—to be without that safety net. That safety net has diminished over eight years and now the government wants to tear a hole in the net and allow some employers to opt out of the system that was providing that net for those workers. There is no clearer example, in my view, of the government's intention to hurt those at the lower end of the wage scale than this bill, which provides the opportunity for small businesses to avoid paying minimum entitlements to employees in this country. That is the first thing I think should be clearly noted today.
This bill, like many other workplace relations bills introduced by this government, has a rather innocuous, deceptive title: `Choice in award coverage'. But choice for whom, Mr Deputy Speaker? There is no choice for the employees who will be subject to conditions lower than the minimum entitlements now afforded to them if this law is passed. There is no capacity in this legislation for those employees to bargain or to have their say in whether they will be paid pursuant to entitlements under the federal award system. The whole notion of choice in award coverage is solely at the prerogative of the employer in an organisation with fewer than 20 employees. This shows, again, that this government has no even-handed approach to this issue. As I said last night in the debate on the unfair termination bill, there are thousands of small businesses that would employ fewer than 20 employees. But there is a number that greatly exceeds that, and that is the number of employees who work for those businesses. So if this government were about looking after the battlers—as the Prime Minister likes to pretend he does—and if this government were about being even-handed in looking after ordinary Australian families, why would the Prime Minister allow his government to enact legislation that will diminish the entitlements for many millions of employees in this country?
It is also important to note that this does not just potentially punish those employees; this also punishes those small businesses where the number of employees exceeds 19. You could have a situation where two organisations, one employing 25 people and another employing 19, might be in the same competitive field; they might be competing in the same marketplace with the same goods or services. This would allow the employer who employs fewer people to get an unfair advantage over those companies that exceed the 19-employee threshold. So it would be unfair on that basis. It would be unfair to those small to middle sized companies that would in fact still be attached to the federal award system in this country.
Another group of employers it would unfairly affect are those employers who have union members in their workplace. This bill effectively suggests that those people who have fewer than 20 employees and no union members at the workplace will have an advantage. In other words, if you are a small business employer who is not so ideologically predisposed to hating unions or indeed you tolerate and accept the fact that workers have the right to be represented by employee organisations in this country, you are at a disadvantage because you cannot opt out of the system. So it is another attempt to dog whistle to the community in this sector by saying: `You have to make sure you are de-unionised. You must make sure that you do not have one employee in a registered organisation of employees, in order to escape the safety net conditions of employment in this country.'
In effect, because this government is so blinded in its enmity towards ordinary working families working for small businesses, it is quite happy to punish other small and middle sized companies who would not be able to opt out, who have just slightly in excess of 19 employees, and it will punish those employers who employ anyone who is a member of a registered organisation of employees pursuant to the Workplace Relations Act. Again, it shows that this government is willing to cut off its nose to spite its face in this area, having no regard for those employers who do the right thing or those employers who may employ just over the 19-person threshold. We have to question the logic and the fairness of a bill that would potentially punish millions of employees as well as many thousands of employers. I think that is something that this government has yet to properly explain to the business community and to those companies who employ either unionised labour or more than 19 people.
At its heart this bill is about tearing away a system that has worked in this country for almost a century. It is fair to say the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, enacted in 1904, very early on in the last century, brought about a situation where industrial disputes—many of which occurred in the 1890s, as most people would know—could be resolved as peaceably and as effectively as possible in this country. We have been world leaders in working out a system whereby the people at the lower end are treated fairly and given a fair go, and at the same time that system is orderly and actually works.
Every tory government, every conservative government up until the Howard government, has supported the federal award system. We may have had different views about the way things happened, but Robert Menzies, when Prime Minister, supported the federal awards system, as did Malcolm Fraser and other conservative governments. That is where this Prime Minister and this government set themselves apart, not only from the Labor Party on this side of the chamber today but from conservative parties with a history of supporting the industrial relations system because it was fair and it had a fair application.
We needed some changes. There is no doubt that, whilst it was hard and it was difficult, we needed some changes to the system so we could compete, develop the capacity for flexibility in the workplace and empower employees and employers to negotiate change in the workplace. But that was not introduced by this government. The change that enabled the decentralisation of the system to allow flexibility with protection—not flexibility one way and an attack on workers the other way—was introduced by a Labor government.
In doing that we were mindful of the fact that you must protect the weakest in the workplace, and there were protections afforded to them. What has happened since is that this government has embraced the decentralised process and gone further but has stripped away the protections that were provided to the most vulnerable workers in this country. This bill is about continuing that agenda to diminish the entitlements of hardworking Australians and therefore it should be opposed. 
Against the backdrop of the history of the federal award system it seems quite clear that since 1996 this government is about wrecking it, as it is about wrecking Medicare and superannuation—those things that are overwhelmingly supported by the Australian citizenry. This government is about wrecking the industrial relations system, opening up a chaotic, anarchic system where the most vulnerable will suffer. Whilst on the one hand it is doing that, on the other hand it is going into the areas where workers are strongest and act most collectively, and is looking to find ways to punish them for being able to successfully and effectively negotiate their wages. This government is quite happy to regulate in certain areas. Indeed, the royal commission into the building industry was as much about taking on a union and a work force that negotiated collectively and effectively as anything else.
Of course, in those areas where there are no collective arrangements and very little capacity for people to bargain in that sense, there has been an effort by this government to deregulate. So again you see this hypocritical position of the government in deregulating areas which will hurt those most vulnerable in the work force and hamper and restrict those employees who are effectively negotiating collectively. That has really become apparent in the last eight years and is apparent again today.
It is impossible for us to support this bill, because, as I say, there is no logic to it. It treats some employers differently from other employers; it treats some employees differently from other employees. In terms of the way it goes about applying award coverage, it seeks to deny the most vulnerable in the workplace a safety net. It is important for members to remember that in the first term of this government the then minister, Peter Reith, and the Prime Minister set about diminishing the content of federal awards. As most people who have taken any interest at all would know, section 89A of the Workplace Relations Act brought about a diminution of award conditions, effectively removing long-held entitlements unilaterally without any rights to negotiate from the award system. This government narrowed the content of those awards and now it seeks to narrow the application of the award system in this country. It is a consistent effort by this government to make it harder and harder for those working families to make ends meet.
I think it important to note—it is not said often enough in this place and it is certainly not said by those on the other side—that the Australian work force is, first and foremost, the most important element in our productive society. If we were to look to what makes us a successful economy, there are a myriad of reasons—that is true. Indeed, innovative managers and very strong and effective business people should be commended for their abilities to propel the economy and provide economic growth and, as a result, to employ many people. That should be acknowledged.
First and foremost, however, there are millions of Australians who get up in the morning, see their kids to school if they have school aged children, and then head off to work. They might work during the day, in the evening, on night shifts, on weekends and, increasingly, they work what would now be seen to be out of ordinary hours. They do that every day and at least five days a week or more in many instances. They should be the first ones commended for the success of this economy. I think too little is said by this government about Australian working families.
I know the government likes to talk about small businesses. Small business is a very important sector—that should be acknowledged and I think it is fair to make that obvious to all and sundry—but I have never heard the Prime Minister utter that it is Australian working families that provide the most important element to a successful economy. I think this Prime Minister should start considering their contribution in light of what is going on. Instead of taking credit himself for any upsides to the economy, maybe—it might be a little humble for the Prime Minister, although we know he likes to do his Uriah Heep act as often as possible because he is ever so humble—it would be nice for a change for him to actually acknowledge that it is the Australian work force that provides the most important element to a productive and successful economy. I have not heard it out of the mouth of the Prime Minister and I think it is about time we did.
In conclusion, we cannot support this bill—it is unfair. It is unfair against some employers and some employees. It is about wrecking a system that has evolved over 100 years, by tearing a hole in the safety net and allowing people to fall below it. This bill should be called the `Race to the Bottom Bill'. It is about trying to have employers seek to cut conditions and chase each other to the lowest end of the wage scale in this country, and it should not be supported by any member of this House. The Labor Party opposes it and will no doubt oppose it again in the other place.",REPS,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (CHOICE IN AWARD COVERAGE) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,6,1,speech
"Elson, Kay, MP",LP,2004-02-11,"—The Workplace Relations Amendment (Choice in Award Coverage) Bill 2002 is about small businesses, their employees and the log of claim processes. It is about protecting both small business employers and their employees from unfair and generally unrealised results of decisions of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Once again, this bill is about the Howard government's commonsense approach to looking after our people and our economy because we want, and Australians really need, our economy to thrive.
This bill makes just two amendments. It adds two new subsections to section 101 of the Workplace Relations Act 1996. It has been kept nice and simple so the opposition can understand it because if Labor can understand the content they will hopefully realise its benefits and the fact that it threatens neither employers nor unions. Wouldn't it be wonderful if the opposition could work with the government on this bill to safeguard our jobs and the economy instead of routinely disputing them because the union bosses tell them that is what Labor members are supposed to do.
The first section of this bill, the new section 101A, says that the commission must not make any findings unless some pretty basic conditions regarding the information content and timing of logs of claims have been met. The second section, 101B, limits the commission's capacity to make any dispute findings for employers with fewer than 20 employees unless at least one of these employees is a member of a disputing organisation. There are just two simple amendments contained in this bill, but these reforms are important to the survival of small businesses, to the health of our economy and, therefore, to the employment levels in Australia. Let us look at the reasons why.
As the then Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, the Hon. Tony Abbott MP, said in his second reading speech, there are approximately 1,122,000 non-agricultural small businesses in Australia and these small businesses account for over 96 per cent of businesses. Let me repeat that: these small businesses—the local corner store, the fish and chip shop, the TV repair man and the hairdresser—account for 96 per cent of all businesses in Australia. As the then minister said, they are the `engine rooms for job growth in our economy,' so it is in the public interest to ease the pressure of excessive industrial relations to allow them to grasp opportunities, to grow and thereby increase employment opportunities in their community.
I think I can safely say that all members of the House would like to see unemployment reduce. No-one wants to see high employment or the repercussions of those wanting work being unable to find it. But how do you increase the number of jobs available to the unemployed? We all know that you cannot wave a magic wand and that it is no use creating temporary government jobs when we need real jobs. So when you look past miracles and fantasy and look at who currently employs people, and at what is preventing them from employing more people, you come back to small businesses in our communities. It is not that we need to encourage small businesses to employ more people but that we need to minimise the obstacles to them doing so.
If these small businesses are stymied by regulations which their owners may not understand or they are stifled by the uncertainty and fear of suddenly, without notice, being roped into award conditions they cannot afford then they are not going to increase the number of their employees. It is quite the opposite: they may have to decrease the number because they cannot afford the wages at the end of the month or, worse still, they may even go out of businesses altogether. And what does that do for employees? What flow-on effect does it have on employment levels in Australia if a significant number of businesses are affected? The maths are not difficult, and nor is the answer.
We are not talking here about big businesses which have available to them the knowledge and advice of industrial relations experts, both on staff and in employer associations to which they belong; neither are we talking about leaving employees unprotected or taking advantage of them—not at all. With this bill we are simply trying to improve the process so that small businesses, which are often not members of registered employer organisations and therefore are not represented in the commission hearings, have the information and stipulated time in which to respond to a log of claims before they go before the commission. Surely anyone in this House would believe that it is fair to ask for that. That also helps them resist being roped into federal awards without any input when they do not employ any union members. This happened to thousands of retailers earlier this year. I will come back to that aspect shortly.
This is not about trying to give small businesses an unfair advantage; it is about balance. If we allow businesses to thrive by being discerning in regulation and not putting unnecessary obstacles in their way then of course their employment capacity also thrives. We all know that you do not have to motivate people or businesses to succeed: factors such as profit and success quite naturally motivate them. Government needs to be careful not to put unnecessary regulatory obstacles in the way of that business because success has a strong bearing on the health of our economy and on our level of employment. It is a matter of balance between ensuring the rights of the employees and the health of the sector that employs them.
The problem under the current legislation is that a section 101 claim to the commission may be determined without the employer being aware that their business is to become a respondent to a federal award. Let me repeat that: a small business operator can currently be roped into a federal award without even knowing that it is happening; they can be roped into a federal award without knowing they should plan for any resulting cost increases for employee entitlements under that award. That is not a fair or balanced system.
Let us look at exactly how this bill is trying to bring more balance to that process. A log of claims is a registered letter containing a list of claims for working conditions sent to an employer or employers by a union. It is the first step in bringing a claim into the jurisdiction of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and is used as a trigger mechanism which leads to the employer or employers and the union being bound by the terms of federal awards which set minimum conditions for their employees. The first step is the log of claims; the second is when the employer does not agree to the claims and the union notifies the commission that there is a dispute. Currently there is no minimum time allowance for the employer to consider the claim before the union notifies the commission of that dispute.
Section 101A, inserted by this bill, says that the commission must make findings under section 101 unless certain that very reasonable conditions are met. These include the condition that the log of claims must be accompanied by a notice giving the employer prescribed information about the claim. This information includes the employer's rights and the processes involved in roping in claims. After the log of claims is delivered, there must be at least 28 days delay before the union notifies the commission of the dispute, ensuring that the employer has some time to consider the matter, agree, disagree or make a counterclaim before it comes under the jurisdiction of the commission. Once the dispute goes to the commission, the union must give the employer involved at least 28 days notice of the time and place fixed for the proceedings. So section 101A means that an employer must be told what the claim means and what the process is, and then be given time to consider the matter before it goes before the commission. If it still goes to the commission, the employer must be given 28 days notice of the hearing and must be told where it will be held. I defy anyone to tell me that any of these new conditions are either unfair or unreasonable. They are simple, fair and commonsense steps to be taken before the commission can rule on a log of claims. I am sure we would all agree that they bring about some balance to this process.
While section 101A deals with the processes before the commission's hearing, the new section 101B adds some steps to the process during the commission's investigation. These amendments are designed to restrain the ability of unions to rope small businesses which employ no union members into a federal jurisdiction, and require that the commission inquires into the views of unrepresented small businesses potentially affected by a roping in claim. This amendment means that, before making any findings, the commission must write to each employer involved, asking them to advise within a specific time frame as to whether or not, on the date the claim was served, they were employing fewer than 20 people. If the commission is satisfied that the employer did have fewer than 20 employees then it cannot make a finding regarding that employer. It cannot rope that employer into a federal award unless at least one of the employees is a member of a union lodging the claim. Let me put it more simply: this amendment means that the commission cannot make a determination on a claim against a small business which employs no-one belonging to a union. Surely this is a reasonable amendment.
The necessity of this amendment is dramatically illustrated by the claim brought by the Shop Distributive and Allied Employees Association to rope in tens of thousands of small Victorian retail businesses into a federal award. That is right: not one business, not 100 businesses, but roping in tens of thousands of businesses. Most businesses covered by the SDA claim are not members of a registered employer organisation. They are unrepresented in the commission and would not have known what to make of the log of claims. Although this is a particularly large illustration of roping-in claims, even smaller scale ones are bewildering to the small businesses involved and businesses are currently often not aware that they have been roped into this federal award. It is estimated that only about six per cent of these small businesses employ a union member.
This bill is aimed at protecting small businesses, those employing fewer than 20 people—none of whom is a union member—from being roped in to a federal award. We are not talking about big business here; we are talking about the likes of our local plumber, our suburban hardware, florist or coffee shop. These are ordinary people who often work very long hours and have little experience of, or access to, industrial relations knowledge. But they employ between one and 19 non-union people in our community. Each time one of these employers says, `It's too hard, we are closing up,' between one and 19 people in that community, besides the employer, have to find another job. If the community is small, then that can be particularly difficult on the local community.
These amendments are not about protecting small businesses at the expense of their employees. This legislation has nothing to do with employees negotiating directly with their employer for benefits or going through their union. It has nothing to do with state awards. It is not about, as the member for Burke stated, union bashing or this side hating unions. It is nothing to do with that. It is all about preventing unions demanding that small businesses be roped into federal awards with or without their knowledge or input—even those businesses that do not employ union members.
We are a country that prides itself on fair play, and this is definitely not fair play. More than that, it is not economic good sense. Small business is crucial to both our employment capacity and our economy. We need balance in our Workplace Relations Act so that these businesses can be confident that they will not unnecessarily or unknowingly be penalised for employing people. As I said in the beginning, this bill is about the Howard government's commonsense approach to looking after our people and our economy, because we want to both thrive and survive. We want small businesses in our community to have the confidence and the incentive to grow their businesses and the number of people they employ. I commend this bill to the House.",REPS,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (CHOICE IN AWARD COVERAGE) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,6,1,speech
"Organ, Michael, MP",AG,2004-02-11,"—The Workplace Relations Amendment (Choice in Award Coverage) Bill 2002 is yet another attempt by the Howard coalition government to erode the influence of trade unions in this country, to the detriment of workers' wages and conditions of employment. It derives from the hypocritically titled Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (More Jobs, Better Pay) Bill 1999, which was rejected in the Senate. This bill achieves none of its expressed aims, as it complicates workplace regulations for both employers and employees. It places conditions on the service of logs of claims, including content and notice requirements, and it limits the capacity of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to make any dispute findings for employers with fewer than 20 employees unless an employee is a member of the disputing organisation. This bill is discriminatory and divisive, and its effects will be felt in a number of ways. It will reduce union right of entry for the purposes of having discussions with employees, as that right is conditional upon an award being in place. It will also create delay and red tape by requiring the Industrial Relations Commission to administer or perhaps smother trade unions that attempt to utilise its powers.
By installing these onerous requirements, it will be more difficult for the Industrial Relations Commission to make awards that prescribe minimum employment standards for workers. In fact, this bill creates another layer of bureaucratic burden upon workers and their representatives. This is achieved by requiring unions to comply with notice requirements and restricting the types of demands that unions can validly make upon employers. The second reading speech of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer is mute on the importance of reducing red tape for trade unions and their members.  Nonetheless, it is more than curious to note that the very first paragraph of the second reading speech to this bill promotes the importance of reducing `workplace relations red tape for small business'.
This bill also creates red tape for employers, which is surely an outcome that we have heard runs contrary to both government policy and to the second reading speech itself. In fact, all employers caught by the net of this legislation will be required to go through the process of checking their payroll to ensure that they inform the Industrial Relations Commission of how many employees they had working for them on a particular day when a trade union serves notice on them of a dispute. Given the eternally and usually rightfully slow wheels of justice, combined with the notice requirements contained in the bill itself, it is entirely likely that the day in question occurred months previously. This means that thousands of small business owners throughout my electorate of Cunningham and beyond could be forced to tramp out the back, into the garage or the shed or to the accountant's office—for a fee, of course—to rummage through records to confirm the precise number of staff they employed on a particular day, as I said, perhaps many months previously. Surely, the minister would agree that small business operators throughout Australia have got better things to do with their time than that.
From my own experience working in large businesses such as a steelworks and a brick plant and, more specifically, a small meat works and an art gallery, small business owners always have better things to do than to simply comply with bureaucratic meddling from this ideologically driven government—things like serving customers day in and day out, working harmoniously with employees without complaint, mopping the floor, maintaining turnover at a healthy rate or even just staying afloat. Yet here we have a government that spins itself into a lather at every opportunity as being the champion of small business and also making life and business itself more complicated via this bill, all so that it can punish trade unions. This bill is a waste of everyone's time and achieves nothing but stress for both workers and small business owners. It is a classic case of ideology over reason, with the results being bad for workers and small business owners.
The bill will also make it harder for trade unions to obtain better outcomes for their members and for the broader work force. Perversely, these are results that the minister and his predecessors are proud of. These are results that the minister expects the Australian community to embrace wholeheartedly, without a whimper of dissent. This is a bill which undoubtedly attacks the working poor of this country. I would remind the House that, according to the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the minimum wage in Australia is an undeniably modest $23,400 per year. Compare that figure to executive salaries and golden handshakes that routinely reach into the millions of dollars.
This legislation proves that this government is keen to keep working people's salaries and conditions of employment suppressed, even though there is no evidence to suggest that lower wages mean more employment. This government refuses to accept and support the important role of trade unions in assisting workers and employers to deal with industrial matters at a workplace level. Apart from the contradictory flaws contained in this bill, it will specifically discriminate between people who work in small businesses and people who work in even smaller businesses. That is right, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins. If you work in a shop with 19 people, you will be treated differently from your neighbour who works in a shop with 20 or more staff. As the ACTU secretary has asked: why should employees have fewer legal rights and protections just because they work in a small business? For those people who work in a business of 19 staff or fewer, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission will not have the jurisdiction to make awards where there are no union members. Why would the government want to do that? Surely any Australian government should be concerned with raising wages and improving the quality of life of ordinary Australians, not with keeping wages low and trampling over workers' conditions.
This bill will make it harder for workers to have awards or minimum standards of employment, and this is disgraceful. This government will sell out ordinary Australians to its rich mates via legislation such as that which is before the House at the moment and via the US free trade agreement, which will undoubtedly impact upon jobs and employment in this country. The Australian Greens believe in a more logical, robust and democratic industrial relations system that can survive scrutiny and not create a burden on employees or employers. The Greens hold safe, socially useful and productive work as being more important than the mere pursuit of profitability and efficiency. Profitability and efficiency must not occur at the expense of the quality of life of ordinary Australians.
The Greens also believe that the arbitration system should be maintained in the interests of the workers and the public and that there must be effective consultation between government, employers, unions and workers on all aspects of industrial relations. The Australian Greens hold that all workers should have the right to be involved in the development of flexible and democratic workplace patterns and structures, and we encourage employee owned or managed businesses or businesses with significant employee ownership or control.
We support a national system of industrial relations that will facilitate the provision of more flexible working arrangements and hours of work that are not at the expense of work satisfaction, workers' income or their family life. We would seek to extend the system of equal opportunity throughout the work force and establish processes which ensure the participation of women in industrial negotiations. We also believe it is important that opportunities are given to workers to receive education and training appropriate for the achievement of these goals.
Ultimately, though, there must be a wider role for the Australian Industrial Relations Commission as an arbiter in industrial disputes, to consider the social and environmental implications regarding a dispute. The Greens aim to facilitate the continued effective and democratic functioning of unions and also to ensure that resources are provided to organisations of the unemployed to give them an effective voice in society. This bill achieves none of these aims. The so-called simple changes to section 101 represent an attack on the working people of Australia. Accordingly, the Greens condemn this bill and cannot support it.",REPS,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (CHOICE IN AWARD COVERAGE) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,6,1,speech
"Hartsuyker, Luke, MP",NATS,2004-02-11,"—I rise in the House today to speak on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Choice in Award Coverage) Bill 2002. I note that this government has always been focused on a more flexible industrial relations system. Under this government there has been a shift from a highly regulated, highly constricted industrial relations system to a much more flexible enterprise based system—a system based on the needs of employers and employees. Through responsible economic management and a more flexible industrial relations system, this government has been able to create over a million jobs, resulting in a reduction in the unemployment rate from 10.9 per cent to less than six per cent. That is an outstanding achievement. A major element of that is increased flexibility for employers and employees to come up with workplace arrangements that meet their needs.
This government has also been highly focused on small business. There are over 1.2 million small businesses in Australia, employing countless millions of Australians. Over the past 10 years, the number of small businesses has been increasing at a rate of about 3.5 per cent. That sector is now contributing around 30 per cent of GDP. Small businesses generated 70 per cent of jobs growth over the last decade. This government sees that it is vital to support small business. It is vital that small business has the flexibility that it needs to create more jobs.
This bill amends the Workplace Relations Act 1996 to amend the provisions that allow employers to be roped into federal award coverage. The bill will help businesses, particularly small businesses, respond to the claims being made against them. In introducing this bill, the government is demonstrating its commitment to making the workplace relations system better meet the needs and circumstances of business—particularly small business. The bill is directed toward requiring unions to provide more information to businesses about their rights in relation to claims, where those businesses receive roping-in claims, and toward increasing the ability of small businesses that do not employ union members to resist union attempts to rope them into the federal jurisdiction—to rope those businesses into a jurisdiction which they do not want and which, in most cases, their employees do not want—by requiring the AIRC to inquire into the views of small businesses which receive a roping-in claim.
Why are the changes that this bill will implement necessary? The changes introduced in the Workplace Relations Act 1996 significantly improved the workplace relations system for small businesses, employers and employees. However, further reform is required to maximise the opportunities for small business growth and to drive the unemployment rate even lower. This will create more opportunity for Australians, particularly Australians seeking jobs for the first time, for instance. We want a lower unemployment rate and we think that the more flexible industrial relations system is the way to do it. Many small businesses are not members of registered employer organisations. Consequently, they are not represented in AIRC hearings and cases. Their voice is not heard. In many cases they do not have the resources or the opportunity to influence proceedings in the AIRC.
What about this roping-in process? Federal awards apply only to those employers who are listed as respondents to the award. The intention of a roping-in claim is to extend the coverage of a federal award to employers who are not presently covered—to extend the tentacles of that award to a business where the employer and the employee may not want such coverage. Most Australians would agree that that just is not fair. Roping-in claims are made by federal unions serving on employers a log of claims which demand that the employers provide certain conditions of employment to their employees. Those conditions may not suit the particular enterprise involved.
It is a very important point that the flexibility in the labour system has created a lot of jobs. Causing businesses to provide conditions which are not suitable to that enterprise must have the reverse effect. It flows—it is commonsense. If the business does not agree to the demands in the log of claims, the union notifies the AIRC of an industrial dispute under section 99 of the Workplace Relations Act. The AIRC then makes a finding about whether it is an industrial dispute under section 101 of the Workplace Relations Act. If it finds that there is a dispute, it may extend an existing award to cover a named business or businesses, or it may make a new award. Small businesses should have the right and the freedom to negotiate arrangements with their employees which best suit that entity—arrangements which best create the opportunity for that business to grow and prosper and which best create the opportunity for employees to advance and earn more money working in that business. Businesses that are seeking to not be covered by a federal award in such instances should be free to operate in a way which suits their employees and themselves, without the dead hand of union interference.
What will the bill do? This bill contains amendments that will enhance the ability of small business to resist attempts to rope them into federal awards and resist attempts to impose conditions that are not suitable to the employer or, in many cases, the employee. In a roping-in or log of claims process, a dispute with an employer with fewer than 20 employees will only be taken to exist where the union demonstrates that it has a member employed by the employer. The identity of such individual union members, however, will be kept confidential.
Where an alleged dispute is notified for any business on the ground that the employer has not agreed to the demands set out in a log of claims, the AIRC will be required not to make any finding of dispute unless it is satisfied: firstly, that the log of claims, when served, was accompanied by a notice containing prescribed information intended to explain the status of the log of claims and to explain the employer's rights in relation to the log of claims; secondly, that the alleged dispute was not notified until at least 28 days after service of the log; thirdly, that the party notifying the alleged dispute had given the employer at least 28 days notice of the time and place of the hearing of the dispute notification; and, fourthly, that the log of claims did not include any demand requiring conduct or provisions contrary to the freedom of association provisions of the Workplace Relations Act or outside the scope of the employment relationship.
The bill will also require the AIRC to inquire into the views of identified small business employers affected by the making of an award, rather than only taking into account the views of the employers who go to hearings. The bill also proposes to deny a union the ability to rope in a small business where, firstly, the small business has given appropriate notice to the AIRC that it is a small business and, secondly, the small business does not employ a member of the union serving the log of claims. That is a very important point. A business which does not have a person employed in a particular union may be the subject of an action by a union which does not represent anyone within that entity. Most people would agree that it is just unAustralian that that could happen in this country.
The measures contained in this bill will enhance the capacity of business, including small business, to understand the log of claims process under the Workplace Relations Act and to make better choices about what form of industrial instrument is best for their businesses. This bill demonstrates that the government is serious about reducing unjustified third-party interference and the dead hand of union interference in the relationship between employers and employees. Certainly, freeing up small business to do what it does best—generating jobs and generating wealth in this nation—is something that we should always subscribe to.
Members opposite always go for political expediency over good policy. They always support big unions over the interests of employers and employees. Despite all the gloss, froth and bubble, they are still old Labor underneath. Despite the digitally enhanced plasma TV screen image of the member for Werriwa, deep down it is still old Labor there, looking at policies that were basically designed through the rear-vision mirror, trawling the archives for inspiration for policy initiatives. If members opposite were serious about a more flexible industrial relations system, if they were serious about creating jobs and if they were serious about the fact that negotiating the relationship between employees and employers within an enterprise is the best way to go forward, they would support this bill. Members are leaving the trade union movement in droves, because they see trade unions as not relevant to either the current industrial relations system or the needs of modern Australia. But still the mindless opposition follow their big union masters and continue down the road of endless Labor dogma.
We have again seen mindless Labor opposition in relation to the free trade agreement—an agreement that is good for Australia. It is something that most industry sectors support wholeheartedly. It is something that they should be supporting, but once again there is mindless opposition. There is mindless opposition in the area of workplace relations and in the field of free trade. When are we going to see some progressive policies from members opposite? When are we going to see them supporting the men and women of Australia?",REPS,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (CHOICE IN AWARD COVERAGE) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,6,1,speech
"Andrews, Kevin, MP",LP,2004-02-11,"—in reply—This bill proposes to introduce into the log of claims process requirements that will help businesses, particularly small businesses, respond to the claims being made against them. The bill will ensure that a log of claims does not include a demand that would contravene other key sections of the Workplace Relations Act. This is an important cost saving measure because, firstly, businesses will be reading only what may be ultimately included in an award; secondly, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission is not hearing argument about matters that could not form part of an award; and, thirdly, parties are encouraged to frame their log of claims so that only matters that may reasonably form part of an award are included. The bill will give small business the opportunity to have a say by allowing small business employers to make written comments on the proposed award. This measure will give regional businesses an opportunity to be heard also.
The bill will stop a union roping in a small business where the small business has given appropriate notice to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission that it is a small business and the small business does not employ a member of the union serving the log of claims. The registrar will be able to issue a certificate that a business has an employee who is a member of a union; this will protect the identity of union members. The measures contained in the bill will enhance the capacity of all business, particularly small business, to understand the log of claims process and make better choices as to what industrial instrument is best for individual businesses.
In response to a couple of the contributors to the debate, in particular the member for Rankin, I point out that this bill will not cover common law awards in Victoria under the proposed amendments or common rule awards in the ACT or the Northern Territory. The bill only deals with the findings of an industrial dispute and the parties to that dispute; common rule awards do not depend on the existence of an industrial dispute for their application. The government is focused on giving choice to both employees and employers. A small business roped into a federal award has no choice. The bill aims to provide more information to all employers about the log of claims process and to reduce unrequested and unnecessary third-party intervention by unions. If an employee chooses to join a union, that will allow an award to apply to his or her small business workplace.
Secondly, in response to a number of matters raised by the member for Blaxland, I indicate to the House that the bill will encourage choice about the industrial instrument that is best suited to businesses, particularly small businesses. It is a choice that is in all respects shared between the employer and the employee. Any proposed agreement, like an Australian workplace agreement, is arrived at through consent; it is not imposed. The bill does not forbid the Australian Industrial Relations Commission from playing a part in determining conditions in small businesses. The bill restricts the capacity of a union, a third party to the relationship between the employer and the employee, to rope in a small business to an award if there are no employees in that business who are members of that union. If there is a union member in that workplace, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission will still have to ask any business that has notified the Australian Industrial Relations Commission that it is a small business about its comments on the proposed award. I commend the bill to the House.

"Gillard, Julia, MP",ALP,2004-02-11,"—Mr Deputy Speaker Mossfield, as you may recall, on the final Friday of the last sitting before we adjourned for the Christmas period, I was in the highly envied position of speaking on the Health Legislation Amendment (Private Health Insurance Reform) Bill 2003. My contribution to the debate was adjourned to enable the House to finalise matters coming back from the Senate and to actually finally call a day a day, or a week a week, or a session a session. Having started the contribution so long back, I will recap briefly on the points I made, and then outline a second reading amendment which I will be moving to this bill on behalf of the opposition. 
As I indicated in the debate late last year, Labor does support this bill, in the interests of good management of the private health insurance sector by government, the fair treatment of consumers and the creation of better mechanisms for investigating and acting on any problems in the private health insurance industry. This bill seeks to amend the National Health Act 1953 and the Private Health Insurance Incentives Act 1998. We may recall that on 11 September 2002 the then Minister for Health and Ageing, Senator Patterson, announced a package of reforms designed to streamline the regulation of the private health insurance industry and provide consumers with better value for money for their private health insurance. This bill gives effect to some of those measures. 
At present, registered health benefits organisations are required to submit details of all rule changes that they make—no matter how insignificant—to the government for approval. Obviously, this creates a high administrative burden on the health benefits industry for little gain, in a regulatory sense, in terms of government being able to monitor what is happening in the industry. Part 1 of schedule 1 of this bill amends the National Health Act and the Private Health Insurance Incentives Act by removing this onerous rule change assessment process and replacing it with a far more streamlined system of monitoring and compliance. This will remove the inefficiencies associated with the existing process and allow registered health benefits organisations to be more responsive to the needs of their members. Obviously, when there is a high administrative burden to have rule changes ticked off, it is less likely that registered health benefits organisations will make timely rule changes. This bill rectifies that problem. 
To make sure that the government—in the absence of having each and every rule changed filed with it—can effectively monitor the performance of registered health benefits organisations, part 1 of schedule 1 of the bill also establishes a sets of indicators for monitoring the performance of registered health benefits organisations. These indicators will be used to identify organisations that breach the National Health Act and to alert the Minister for Health and Ageing to practices that may be contrary to national health policy. They will be particularly important for monitoring whether or not registered health benefits organisations continue to fulfil their community rating obligations, which are designed to ensure that private health insurance is affordable for all Australians. The bill also establishes a broader range of investigatory powers and administrative sanctions that the minister may use when a registered health benefits organisation is found to be in breach of the National Health Act or is failing to meet government objectives. 
Part 2 of schedule 1 of the bill will amend the National Health Act to increase consumer protection within the private health insurance industry. The bill provides the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman with increased powers to investigate and resolve disputes and complaints. Registered health benefits organisations will now have to respond to a request for information or a recommendation from the ombudsman within a specified time frame. The ombudsman will also have the power to report the outcomes of an investigation to the minister and make recommendations on ways of dealing with specific issues arising from an investigation. 
Part 3 of schedule 1 of the bill provides for the production of an annual `state of the health funds' report by the ombudsman. That report obviously will be key information in the public domain, enabling members of the public, members of health funds and those in the health sector who are interested in the policy debate to be able to assess whether their fund is performing well or badly and whether or not they are getting value for money for the decisions that they have made about their private health insurance. Registered health benefits organisations will obviously be required to make information about this report available to members so that they are aware of its existence. 
Lastly, part 4 of schedule 1 of this bill will amend the National Health Act to make a number of minor improvements to the Lifetime Health Cover regulations. These include establishing the equivalent of the `horses' birthday' that we have in the racing industry; so instead of individual birth dates being of relevance, there will be a notional annual birth date of 1 July for the purposes of Lifetime Health Cover. That will streamline the system. There are also changes to ensure that there is recognition of the cover provided by the Department of Veterans' Affairs gold card as counting towards hospital cover for the purposes of calculating a Lifetime Health Cover loading. There are arrangements to provide new migrants who are over the age of 30 with a period of 12 months to take out the relevant hospital cover without being penalised under the Lifetime Health Cover system. Obviously when people first migrate, they need some time to establish themselves and establish the new rules and regulations applying to them and to comply with them. There is also a 12-month period of grace extended to Australian citizens who are overseas on their notional 31st birthday and there is a provision ensuring that Australian citizens who have hospital cover and go overseas for periods greater than 12 months will not have that time overseas counted towards any potential Lifetime Health Cover loading. 
As I said at the outset, and indeed at the end of last year, Labor does support these changes, as necessary streamlining of the health insurance system. Having said that—and I will at the end of my contribution be moving a second reading amendment dealing with the issue—whilst the issue of private health insurance is before this parliament we ask that it be noted that what the government has promised to do on a series of occasions about the question of value for money for private health insurance holders remains undone.
In 1996 John Howard said—and I think his words were very clear:
What I can give is an absolute guarantee that any change—
in private health insurance premiums—
in future will be as a result of a decision taken at a political level in a way and in circumstances where we are satisfied that the rise is completely justified.
He went on talking about private health insurance, particularly in the 2001 election campaign. So we have his 1996 statement and we obviously have a more recent commitment in the 2001 election campaign, where the Prime Minister committed himself and his government to a strategy that they said would put downward pressure on premiums so that the holding of private health insurance would be more affordable and attractive to consumers. The Prime Minister also said that the Howard government's policies would lead to reduced premiums.
Against these statements I think we need to engage in a bit of a reality check, because, for every promise and guarantee that the Prime Minister made, we now know that there is a broken promise and a shattered guarantee lying on the ground. The reality is that the cost of private health insurance continues to escalate. As we saw very clearly at the start of this year, the present Minister for Health and Ageing has a laissez-faire attitude to applications for private health insurance premium increases. His attitude, when questioned about the most recent applications for premium increases—which are generally understood to be in the order of seven or eight per cent—was: `C'est la vie; such is life. That is what happens. Prices go up.'
On this side of the House, we think that that approach is completely negligent of the duties that the health minister and, indeed, the government overall ought to be undertaking in relation to the private health insurance industry. After all, we have a system where private health insurers are required to submit their bids for premium increases above CPI. We have that system for a reason. The reason we have that system is that the government—most particularly, the minister for health—is supposed to use the opportunity when applications come in to vigorously assess whether or not the applications are justified. That is what the Prime Minister promised to do in 1996 and that is what the whole system is designed for. If you are not going to exercise that kind of rigorous scrutiny, why have a system where private health insurers have to come to the government and make applications for premium rises? If you are not going to exercise any scrutiny about those premium rises, why not have a system where they can just put up premiums whenever they take it into their heads to do so, without any form of government scrutiny or regulation? We have the system because the government is supposed to focus on and analyse whether or not claimed premium rises are justifiable.
What we know, from the period between the adjournment of the last parliament and the commencement of this session of parliament—that is, the Christmas-New Year period—is that the current minister for health has made it crystal clear that, in relation to the forthcoming round of premium increases, the last thing in the world he intends to do is scrutinise them. The last thing in the world he intends to do is bring a critical assessment as to whether or not they are justified. He is just going to watch them come into his in-tray with a shrug of his shoulders—`C'est la vie; such is life'—and he is going to sign them off and put them in the out-tray. That was the clear import of what he said to the media when applications were filed. When Australian private health insurance consumers—people who have private health insurance and who spend hard-earned dollars on their private health insurance—are asked later this year, in April, to start spending even more of those hard-earned dollars on private health insurance, they might want to reflect at that point on whether they think the current minister for health is doing a satisfactory job when he has not even taken the opportunity to be critical, searching and questioning about whether or not those increases are justified.
On the topic of the government's relations with private health insurance, from much of the rhetoric that comes from the government we would think that they are the biggest defenders of private health insurance. Indeed, it is often put that it is the one thing that the government care about in the health sector. They do not care much about Medicare and we know they do not care about the public hospital system, because they were prepared to take $1 billion out of public hospitals in the recent health care agreement rounds. The vaunted claim of this government is: `We are supporters of private health insurance.' Private health insurance is at the core of their health strategy—it is the absolute bedrock and the thing they say they believe in. Yet, against that rhetoric, what do we find? We find that, behind closed doors in the health department and the minister's office, this government—the government of private health insurance, the government that says it stands for private health insurance—is actually undermining the value of people's private health insurance in a series of ways. Because these ways are technical and involve mind-numbing government regulation, I think they often slip through in the public debate. People, particularly private health insurance holders, might not quite understand what has happened with changes in the value for money of the private health insurance product.
I can say that there is a series of changes that the government is contemplating or actively supporting which do undermine the value of private health insurance. The first, of course, involves the central reason that people have private health insurance. Why do people pay all of that money to have private health insurance? They pay all of that money because they want the reassurance that, if they are unwell, they will be able to go to a hospital of their choosing and have the doctor of their choice. That is the central, core reason that people have private health insurance. Through a series of technical arrangements known as changes to the second tier default benefit, the government—the government that stands its whole health policy on the bedrock of private health insurance—is actually ensuring that that central promise of private health insurance will no longer be true. The system as designed by this government will be that, if you are a private health insurance holder, you will be able to go only to the hospitals that your private health insurance company has a contract with. There will be some minor changes to that in regional areas, but that will be true for the vast majority of private health insurance holders in Australia.
If at the moment you are sitting in your home in a suburb of Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide, Hobart or Darwin—though you probably would not be looking for a private hospital in Darwin—thinking, `If something happens to me and I get sick, I will be able to go the private hospital down the road and see Dr Fred or Dr Suzie who I have seen all my life,' well, think again. Because of the changes to the second tier default benefit arrangement, if you hold a private health insurance product with a company that does not have a contract with that hospital, then you will not be able to go there. That is happening because of regulatory changes entered into; a scheme designed by this government—the government that has founded its whole health strategy on private health insurance.
There is undermining of the value for money of private health insurance because we have a laissez-faire minister who says, `Where do I sign?' When a private health insurer puts in a premium increase the only question he asks is: `Where do I sign?' And there are regulatory changes—changes that this government is committed to—which mean the central promise of private health insurance that you are able to go to a hospital of your choosing and a doctor of your choice will no longer be the case over time.
In addition, as the opposition indicated in question time towards the end of last year, there is a series of arrangements being contemplated between private health insurers and the government to deal with the cost of medical devices—artificial hips, artificial knees and the sorts of medical devices that are implanted to help people overcome illnesses and injuries. There is a scheme in contemplation by this government which the opposition helped bring into the public domain. Until we did so, it was all happening behind closed doors, because the Howard government would not want Australian voters knowing the truth about what it is doing with private health insurance. Those closed-door negotiations were about limiting the range of devices of which the full cost would be covered by private health insurance.
I do not want to be heard to say that there is no issue about the cost of medical devices in our health sector; there is an issue about the cost of medical devices in our health sector—I accept that. In terms of containing costs in our health sector it is an issue that needs to be addressed. But what I object to is a government which says, `Our whole health policy is about private health insurance. Our whole pitch to the community about health is: get on board; get private health insurance; we believe in private health insurance; we are supporting private health insurance; we love private health insurance.' I object to a government that has that mantra making changes, along with the private health insurance industry, behind closed doors which could affect the nature of a medical device that someone has access to—or at least has access to fully paid for by their private health insurer. If the government is going to do that, it should do that with private health insurance consumers at the centre of the decision-making process; it should not lock them out on the other side of the door. It should be honest with Australians who hold private health insurance that that is what it is doing. We have not seen that level of disclosure from the government.
I conclude by saying that the bill before the House does deal with a series of technical changes which the opposition are prepared to support. But we believe that in the private health insurance area there is so much more that needs to be done if this government is to pass the standard it set for itself—not the standard we set for it, but the standard it set for itself. In 1996 the Prime Minister set that standard when he said that this government would always be scrutinising, putting pressure on and trying to make sure that there were not premium increases. In the 2001 election campaign the Prime Minister set that standard when he said that the government would ensure that there was downward pressure on premiums. So I am asking that this government clears the high-jump bar it set for itself in the private health insurance area by living up to the promises it made to the Australian community, because we know that those promises are not being lived up to at this point. At this point I move the second reading amendment that stands in my name, namely:
That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
“whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the Govern-ment for:
(1)	repeatedly claiming during the last federal election that there would be `downward pressure' on premiums and that private health insurance would be `more affordable and attractive' to consumers';
(2)	saying that the Howard Government's policies would `lead to reduced premiums';
(3)	allowing private health insurance funds to increase their premiums by the CPI without the need to seek Government approval; and
(4)	allowing such increases to be instituted without legislative scrutiny”.

"Wakelin, Barry, MP",LP,2004-02-11,"—I rise to speak on the Health Legislation Amendment (Private Health Insurance Reform) Bill 2003. I was interested in the member for Lalor's contribution. What we have to be very careful about here is what was not said. We heard a lot in the last 10 minutes about the Prime Minister and things that were said in 1996, but what was not said is the key issue here. What would have been much more acceptable to Australians, I think, was if the member for Lalor, the ALP's spokeswoman on health matters, had said that Labor will give an irrevocable commitment to the 30 per cent rebate for private health insurance. It is not to do with what was said—in the normal political attack points in this place—it is much more to do with what was not said.
There has been a very interesting report on the private health insurance rebate released in the last week. The Murphy-Harper study reaffirms the findings of earlier research by Mr Ian Harper that every dollar spent on the 30 per cent rebate saves $2 in Australian government and state health spending. The report, called Easing the pressure: the intergenerational report on private health insurance, was commissioned by Medibank Private and released on 4 February. The study concluded that if the government's policies:
... were not introduced or reversed in the future, private health insurance coverage would fall to unprecedented low levels, making it potentially unviable.
Hence my challenge to the member for Lalor: why will you not come out and give an unequivocal commitment to the 30 per cent rebate and private health insurance? The study goes on to report to the Australian community that the cost would be that millions of Australians would be deprived of affordable access to genuine health care choice, huge pressure would be put back on the public hospital system, to a great extent the private hospital infrastructure and expensive technology would be neglected and underused, and, further, billions more of Australians' tax dollars would need to be substituted for people's personal investments in their own health care.
Other comments from the member for Lalor which I found very interesting included the suggestion that this government has private health insurance as its main focus of health policy and the rather ill-informed comment about value for money et cetera. What is always omitted in this issue from the other side, from our opponents and the ALP, is that no-one wants to talk about the $42 billion that the Australian government distributes to the states and territories in the Australian health care agreements every five years. No-one wants to talk about the 29 per cent increase in the previous five-year plan or the 28 per cent increase in the current five-year plan. No-one wants to remind this House or the Australian people about the GST revenue, of which every dollar goes to the states. No-one wants to talk about that. So to say that the main platform of the coalition health policy is private health insurance is just so much humbug. The simple fact is that the Commonwealth taxpayer funds the states and territories to the tune of $42 billion over five years with that 28 per cent increase. I understand it is something like a 17 per cent real increase. Certain states are now documented. It is always difficult getting these numbers but, in the previous five-year plan, my own state of South Australia actually had a reduction of 22 per cent from their own outlays in hospital care in that state, whilst this Australian Commonwealth government has been able to provide a 29 per cent increase in that five-year period.
With respect to the bill, the issues have been well stated by the member for Lalor, and I do not intend to repeat them and take unnecessary time of the House. But it is just worth a reminder, I think, that the reforms and the ongoing continuing improvement in the health care of Australians—and the leadership of this government, this minister and this Prime Minister—are something that Australians can be well proud of. It is said that our health system is amongst the best, if not the best, in the world. For that we should be proud. In the hurly-burly of this place when we want to score points, and when you watch the media headlines, you could be forgiven for sometimes wondering whether that is indeed the case. But that is the case: our health care system in Australia is amongst the best in the world. That is due, in no small way, to the leadership of this parliament. I give credit to the other side for their contributions, because it is an important issue: the care and health of all Australians. We should give ourselves—and those professionals who work in our health care system—a little credit when it is due. I confess to a vested interest in having a wife and a daughter who are both nurses and still actively practising their profession.
With respect to product deregulation and monitoring of health fund performance, I thought it might be worth adding just what that might mean. We intend to try and free things up and give greater authority to the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman so that he might give a better outcome to consumers. With respect to the possible role of the ombudsman in the future, it is worth mentioning a few dot points from the department's submission to the Senate inquiry into the bill. Things that the ombudsman would be looking at perhaps more comprehensively might include further measuring the complaints to the ombudsman's service, changes in premiums paid by age cohort, changes in the number of persons insured in each age cohort, changes in the number of episodes and episodes per one hundred members in each age cohort, changes in the nature of episodes and changes in the benefits paid per member per episode in each age cohort. It is worth getting a glimpse of where those who have a long experience in these matters thought that the ombudsman might look a little more closely.
My final point is really to do with Lifetime Health Cover. I think it is worth acknowledging that many Australians—and I am a parent of four children, all of whom love to travel overseas and some of whom live and work for some considerable time overseas—do welcome this idea that, if you were overseas as an Australian on your 31st birthday, you will be offered a 12-month period of grace to take out private health insurance. The common birth date is a practical outcome, so I welcome that as well. The issues around allowing greater flexibility in Lifetime Health Cover for veterans, immigrants and Australians who live overseas, as we were saying, are important. Just getting down to the micro level, legislation sometimes overlooks issues where things are quite unfair for certain individuals—although such legislation is in the minority. I, for one, am always delighted when legislation is able to recognise that smaller group of people—in this case, those people who should, in simple fairness, be able to access the benefits of this Lifetime Health Cover.
I welcome the bill. There are many challenges ahead of us in the legislative program around the general debate on Medicare and health care issues generally, but there is no doubt in my mind that the coalition government can hold its head high in terms of its contribution to health in its time on the Treasury benches.",REPS,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE REFORM) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Miscellaneous,7,1,speech
"Jackson, Sharryn, MP",ALP,2004-02-11,"—As indicated by the shadow minister for health and as indicated in the Senate last year, we intend to support the Health Legislation Amendment (Private Health Insurance Reform) Bill 2003. I rise both to speak on that today and to indicate my support for the second reading amendment that was moved by the member for Lalor this morning with respect to the government's record on private health insurance. Firstly, I recognise that the purpose behind the legislation is something of a cleaning up exercise—a number of technical changes are required in legislation to deliver the series of reforms announced by the then health minister some time ago—and to that extent I have no difficulty in supporting those changes, particularly those that go to an improved administrative arrangement and indeed changes to the regulatory burden. So I will certainly be keeping an eye on whether there are increased complaints from private health insurance consumers as a result of those changes. I think it is something we need to monitor.
As I understand it, the administration costs in the private health insurance industry are somewhere around 11 per cent. Compare that to Medicare, our public health scheme. Its administration costs are somewhere around three per cent. All of us who in some way contribute to the private health insurance industry, either as consumers paying premiums or as taxpayers who pay their share of their 30 per cent rebate, would want to see a substantial decline in administrative costs in such a way that those efficiencies could be passed on to private health insurance consumers and indeed enjoyed by the rest of us as taxpayers who now contribute to the 30 per cent rebate.
To that extent, I will certainly be watching with some interest the measures that are contained in the bill concerning the powers of the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman and their ability to investigate complaints and resolve disputes in a timely and efficient fashion. Indeed, a quick traversing of the ACCC site will indicate that there have been numerous court cases involving private health insurance funds and companies, and it is my hope that perhaps these changes may in some way begin to reduce the potential for litigation or complaints and disputes in that area. We will watch and monitor that situation with some interest.
The third part of the changes goes to the proper implementation of the Lifetime Health Cover legislation to pick up groups that have been forgotten and to include our new common Lifetime Health Cover birthday. I noted the shadow minister's comments about horses' birthdays as well.
I have no difficulty with those changes and indeed I support them, but as someone who has spent considerable time, in the break we had in parliament, out in my outer metropolitan electorate in Perth, I do want to raise a number of matters that go to the issue of private health insurance generally and, in particular, its cost. When this legislation was introduced in this House by the member for Parramatta, he repeated the comments of the then health minister that this was a series of reforms—in which were included the 30 per cent rebate, the Lifetime Health Cover and the no-gap scheme—that were designed to make private health insurance a more attractive and affordable option for all Australians. I have to say that in the first area, concerning the question of affordability, those constituents I have discussed this issue with are seeing a decline in the affordability of private health insurance.
Indeed, only last week when I was out in Gosnells in an area that has quite a substantial number of the population over 60 years of age and in many cases dependent on pensions, I was repeatedly told that the increase in the costs of their private health insurance was such that they were often now required to contemplate whether to continue to pay their private health premiums and do without other things in their day-to-day budget. For example, one family, who talked about very basic private health cover that was purchased some four or five years ago for $380, indicated to me that the last bill has seen the similar cover—there were no substantial differences—increase over that period of time to over $800. It had simply become out of reach for that family.
I think it is also of some concern in areas like Maddington and Kenwick in my electorate, where a number of families made the decision to take up private health insurance prior to July 2000, when many of the reforms took effect. We did see a substantial increase at that time in the number of people who were members of private health insurance—I think from 30-odd per cent prior to July 2000 to 45 per cent shortly after the introduction of those changes. That family indicated to me that increasingly the choice was between basic household necessities and private health insurance, and they were frankly frightened about what would happen to them if they had to allow their private health insurance to drop or had to decline it because it was simply unaffordable. This was also a common complaint from a special group that I have come across in my electorate: independent retirees—people who in many respects see that they have done the right thing, that they have properly provided for their own retirement, as they did not want to be what was in their opinion a burden on the state for their post-working years. These kinds of people—people who are on fixed incomes or who are on incomes such as theirs—are really being hit by the increases in private health insurance.
I have previously spoken in this place about the absolute guarantee, as I recall it, from the government—even prior to the election—that they were going to introduce a series of reforms that were designed to put downward pressure on private health insurance premiums. I think it is fair to say that now, as we examine what is happening in the private health insurance industry, the current strategies do not appear to be working. I do not think we are the only ones who have noticed that. Surely this is being reported to members in their own electorates. A regular increase of between seven and eight per cent is what we are seeing each year in respect of private health insurance costs in premiums. In dollar terms that means $50 to $100 a year. That is a substantial increase in those premiums and that is to say nothing of the exponential impact that that is having with respect to the taxpayers' contribution of the 30 per cent rebate. The estimations were done by our then shadow minister for health, Stephen Smith, in September a couple of years ago when the government, if you recall, snuck out an announcement during the commemoration of the horrific events in the United States on September 11. It was during the commemoration 12 months later that, on 4 p.m. that day, the Prime Minister slipped out a little announcement that contrary to—
—Hang on, do not get too fancy.
—Well, that is what he did. At four o'clock on 11 September he slipped out an announcement that indicated that, contrary to the promises and the absolute guarantees given before the election, they had an authorised change of procedure that would ensure that private health insurance premiums could be increased on an automatic annual basis in accordance with the CPI. At the time, Stephen Smith said:
The effect, if you take the current annual CPI of 2.8, is that next year Australian families can expect that their family private health insurance will increase in the order of $50 to $100. And as far as the taxpayers are concerned, their contribution to the 30 per cent—which is the taxpayers' contribution to the cost of private health insurance premiums—will increase in the order of $250 million to $260 million over the next four years.
That has transpired to be true. Prior to the election, we had a commitment that the government would put private health insurance funds under significant scrutiny, that they would not allow increases without that kind of scrutiny, that it would be a political decision and that the government would ensure that they kept a close eye on that. Of course, what we have seen, in a very short period of time, is a turn around from that position and substantial increases in private health insurance premiums.
—And you are going to take away the 30 per cent rebate.
—I will come to that in a moment because it is something that the member for Grey touched on as well. I respect the fact that the member for Flinders was not in the chamber when the shadow minister for health put the Labor Party position with respect to the 30 per cent rebate. I think it is clearly out there in the public domain now and has been reaffirmed on many occasions that we have given a commitment to retain the rebate. Frankly, from my point of view, I have supported that for this very reason: after door knocking in my electorate and meeting families who are struggling to meet their daily living requirements, taking the 30 per cent rebate off them would cause immediate financial pressure. And that is not something that the Labor Party has ever been about. I cannot say the same for those on the other side but, can I say that, if you introduce a series of reforms which you say to the Australian people will be in their best interests, will improve and take pressure off public hospitals, will keep downward pressure on private health premiums and that is somehow going to answer the concerns that we have in the health industry, two or three years down the track when you see your policy is not working, it seems to me you have a public policy responsibility to review it and to make the necessary changes.
I am not just making this up. I took the time to visit the web site in the last couple of days to actually look at what is happening to the membership of private health insurance funds. It was very clear. We saw a substantial increase by the end of the June quarter of 2000. We saw private health coverage in terms of the percentage of the population increase after the March quarter of 2000, when it was sitting at 34.4 per cent. Following the government's campaign, if you recall—I hesitate to call it a scare campaign, but there were certainly a large number of people who felt that they had better run along and get themselves covered at that time or else private health insurance was never going to be within the realms of possibility for them—we saw membership jump to 43.3 per cent and, indeed, continue to rise for some time and it reached its peak some time during 2001. Since 2001, we have seen a steady decline, albeit, at this stage, not at the same rate of rapid decline and downward spiral that we have seen with bulk-billing rates around the country, but it was a substantial decline. Now of course we have seen it drop off some two per cent from that high, and we have seen a downward trend in every quarter since at least September 2001. For over two years, we have seen a steady reduction in the number of Australians who have private health insurance cover.
What is of even more concern than the decline—because you could say that 43 per cent, which is what it is now, is better than 34 per cent, so some of the policies are working—is the issue behind the figures. My concern is who, in terms of age groups, is coming in and out of private health insurance. Indeed, again from the Private Health Insurance Administration Council's web site, it is clear that people under the age of 55 are dropping out of private health insurance cover. This means that increasingly, again, we are seeing the older population group maintaining their private health insurance premiums. My great concern is that this is going to put additional pressure on private health insurance funds because, frankly, the older your membership base are in a private health insurance fund the more likely they are to be ill and the more likely they are to claim funds back from the private health insurance fund. All of that means that, predictably, we are going to see a decline in the number of people who have private health insurance cover, we are going to see an increase in the call on the funds, and together that will put pressure on for increases in premiums. So the policy is not working and we need to examine that and see how we can deal with it.
In the few minutes I have left, I want to briefly address what the member for Grey said. He took us through what he says are the substantial improvements in terms of the Commonwealth government's current investment in the Australian public health system through the Australian health care agreement, and he talked about how that was increasing in real terms. I simply say to the member for Grey that, in my state of Western Australia, the Commonwealth's contribution to WA health spending has in fact declined by some seven per cent in terms of the overall proportion of what is spent in health care in Western Australia. In closing, I say your health strategy is not working; you are not defending Medicare; you are not maintaining bulk-billing; you are not putting downward pressure on private health premiums; and the number of people with private health insurance is falling.
 (Mr Lindsay)—Order! The member for Hasluck will note that the use of the word `you' is not appropriate.
—I beg your pardon, Mr Deputy Speaker. The Howard government is not defending Medicare; the Howard government is not maintaining bulk-billing; the Howard government is not putting downward pressure on private health premiums; and certainly the number of people in private health insurance schemes is falling. The policy is not working. Let us try and fix the system and look at some appropriate changes to do that.",REPS,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE REFORM) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Miscellaneous,7,1,speech
"Hunt, Gregory, MP",LP,2004-02-11,"—In rising to speak on the Health Legislation Amendment (Private Health Insurance Reform) Bill 2003 I start with a very simple proposition: I support clearly, squarely and absolutely the notion of private health insurance, and I support private health insurance as being a fundamental pillar of the health system within Australia. I do this for two reasons: firstly, because it gives individuals choice, flexibility and a chance to design a health system which best suits them and their needs; secondly—and here I take head on some of the material which has been presented by our amiable friends in the opposition—
—Amiable?
—I use the term loosely. Every dollar being spent on the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate—which is perhaps the cornerstone of the government's policy to encourage private health insurance membership—produces a $2 saving for the public purse. This is perhaps one of the key elements that is not understood in this debate in Australia, or it is wilfully misinterpreted. The reason why is very simple and it goes to the heart of not just health but our whole philosophy as a mixed economy: where possible, people should be carrying out their own choices to provide for themselves and the government should be assisting them to do that. Interestingly, the benefit to the national economy and the capacity to provide other services is enhanced as the level of people taking out private health insurance increases.
A Murphy-Harper study, researched by Ian Harper, produced a report for Medibank Private, called Easing the pressure: the intergenerational report and private health insurance, which was released on 4 February 2004. That study showed that for every dollar spent on the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate, $2 is saved for the system. So if you talk about every billion dollars spent, $2 billion is saved, and that money can go directly to the national health system in order to assist with hospitals, schools, kidney machines and specialists—things which have a practical and real impact on our day-to-day lives. That rebate and the notion of private health insurance reform was opposed at the outset, as the previous speaker, the member for Hasluck, pointed out.
Since its introduction that scheme has seen a rise in the number of Australians with private health insurance, from 34 per cent to a current rate of approximately 43 per cent. That is a one-third increase in the total number of Australians with private health insurance. The consequence of that is a massive saving of money which would otherwise have been spent, and the result is that that saving could be hypothecated, as I said, into areas of real need and real services, whether that is hospitals, schools, kidney machines—myriad different things. That is why this system matters, yet the system was opposed at the outset by the opposition and the system's existence has been called into jeopardy throughout its existence, and it still remains in jeopardy. In that context I am delighted to support the Health Legislation Amendment (Private Health Insurance Reform) Bill 2003 because, firstly, it has an impact on Australian families by making private health insurance more affordable; secondly, it helps to provide additional choice; and, thirdly, it has an impact on the health sector. It does that by making the health sector not only more efficient but also more flexible so that new products can be introduced more rapidly.
The concept behind the guts of this bill is simple. It is the idea that by allowing private health insurance firms to tailor their products, to develop their products, to bring them into being more quickly and with less need for taking them through bureaucratic hoops they can adapt to the market and people's needs and meet what people want. In so doing, it is more efficient for the consumers, the providers and for the national system as a whole. That is why this bill is important: it has a real impact on our capacity to see an efficient health system.
One of the challenges that Australia faces is that we have made enormous strides in our efficiencies in areas such as waterfront reform and manufacturing and, increasingly, in many of the service sectors on the financial services front and, of course, in the agricultural sector, where our agricultural producers have worked wonders. But the two areas where we have not made the great efficiency reforms necessary, and which account for an extraordinary percentage of our national economy, are education and health. There is a myth that any reforms are necessarily bad. If we make these sectors more efficient, that will mean we can ultimately provide—and this is the definition of efficiency—more with less. It is an increase in the ratio of resources to outputs.
In that situation, this bill plays an important role. It builds on a series of reforms which have resulted in making private health insurance more attractive and affordable to all Australians. First, and most importantly, there is the 30 per cent rebate. This rebate applies to 41,000 adults and 16,500 children—57,500 people—in my electorate of Flinders. So in towns like Rosebud, Hastings, Dromana, Rye, Koo Wee Rup, Blairgowrie, Grantville, Lang Lang and Cowes there is, on average, 44.5 per cent of the population with private health insurance. This bill works to improve both the quality of what is offered and, ultimately, the efficiency, which means the costs in their pockets. That is why the bill is important. The second great reform we have undertaken is the introduction of Lifetime Health Cover so as to provide an incentive for young people not to wait but to get in and look at the intergenerational benefits for both the country and themselves. Thirdly, the no gaps scheme has been introduced and, fourthly, there is a levy or penalty for high-income earners who do not take out private health insurance. I think that is fair, reasonable and appropriate, and it is a very powerful incentive. In all of those situations, the consequence of that set of reforms is an increase from 34 per cent to 43 per cent in the number of people taking up private health insurance.
Before moving on to the bill as a whole—and I want to briefly address the background and the importance of the provisions of the bill—I want to address a serious health issue relating to the distinction between public and private in my electorate of Flinders. The Premier of Victoria made a statement last week which was an insult to the people of Phillip Island. It was an insult because Phillip Island has a magnificent bush nursing hospital. That hospital is Warley Hospital. Warley was built on the funding and through the work of the local community. It is not a private hospital for profit; it is a community hospital for non profit built by community funds and run and managed by the community. It has a professional executive which has accepted salary rates which would be considerably higher if it went to being a for-profit private hospital. That hospital currently receives $1.3 million annually from the federal government in aged care funding because it carries out three tasks. It carries out aged care, it carries out acute services and it has an accident and emergency service which sees thousands of people each year, 80 per cent of whom are non-resident to the island. Warley Hospital receives $1.3 million from the Commonwealth each year. 
In addition to that, it is set to receive another $1.5 million which will rise over time to a total annual Commonwealth contribution of nearly $3 million or nearly $30 million over the coming decade. The state government provides $50,000 annually. To be precise, it provides $48,000 annually. Warley Hospital, which services so many people from off the island, is facing a funding shortfall of just greater than $100,000 on its accident and emergency service. That service is at risk of being closed. The response of the Premier of Victoria, when the Commonwealth is giving $1.3 million and is going to increase that to $2.8 million very shortly, was to say, `We give $50,000. It is a private hospital; it is not our business.' That was an insult to the islanders who helped build Warley Hospital, to the staff, who work at rates which are less than they would receive if they sought to work in the private sector, and to the general community which knows that this is a community resource that is a not-for-profit resource and which has an extraordinary impact. When you consider the disparity in funding, which will soon be $2.8 million compared to $50,000, and that the accident and emergency department is a community resource serving people from throughout Victoria, you realise that the Premier must (a) withdraw the insult that it is a private hospital and the implication that it is for-profit and (b) provide the additional $100,000 to ensure that this public service continues. It is very simple; it is very clear. 
The background to this bill is very simple. It comes on top of the reforms which this government has introduced in previous years, as I mentioned. Those reforms were the 30 per cent rebate, Lifetime Health Cover, the no gap scheme and the additional contribution for high-income earners who failed to take out private health insurance. Against that background, the importance of the bill is sevenfold. First, the bill ensures the availability of a more affordable private health insurance system to Australian consumers so individuals will benefit. Families, which currently save on average about $750 per year on their private health insurance costs, will benefit additionally from this bill. It helps prevent further rises and it helps build in additional savings.
Second, it allows the health funds to be more innovative and responsive to members' needs. This goes to the quality of the product. Third, the importance of the bill is that it increases competition within the private health insurance market. That is a very important step, because having that competition works to prevent monopoly, duopoly or oligopoly pricing and to ensure that there is a genuine choice for consumers. Fourth, the bill reduces the administrative burden and compliance costs to the government and health funds. That is an important, simple efficiency necessary both to sustain the effectiveness of the system and to ensure that other players are tempted in. Fifth, the bill allows consumers to have greater information over the longer term, and that is very important. Sixth, it increases consumer confidence—because it is very important for people to believe in the stability of both the system and the pricing. Seventh, it increases the awareness and effectiveness of the lifetime health cover system, by promoting and establishing greater public understanding. All of those things together make this an important bill and an important set of reforms.
Within that, there are a couple of key provisions I wish to highlight. In particular, item 10 of schedule 1 establishes the principles of community rating as conditions of registration. That is very important because it allows for a very clear set of principles to be laid down. In addition, item 20 of schedule 1 substitutes a new division—division 5, headed `Enforcement and remedies'—which will result in increased regulatory flexibility. This allows activities to be tested via performance indicators rather than via the assessment of rules, so we look at outcomes rather than formal compliance. That is very important.
Ultimately, this bill is about two simple concepts: making private health insurance more flexible and making it more efficient. The consequence of that for the Australian system as a whole is that it adds to the government's package and set of initiatives which have increased the level of private health insurance membership from 34 per cent to 43 per cent. Those reforms were, for the most part, opposed by the alternative government of Australia. If the reforms had not come in, private health insurance membership would now be somewhere below 30 per cent and the impact on the national budget would be enormous.
Let me finish where I started by pointing out that for every dollar spent on the private health insurance rebate—which brings people into the private health insurance system—the independent assessment is that that saves the country $2 of Commonwealth contribution. That money can in turn be hypothecated and used on the basic health resources. Whether it is in community areas, in hospitals or in relation to medical equipment or pharmaceutical benefits, that money is available for the community in their health system. Ultimately, I am delighted to support the Health Legislation Amendment (Private Health Insurance Reform) Bill 2003. I express my commitment to the principles of private health insurance as part of a mixed system which gives people choice and saves money for use in other areas of the health system. I commend the bill to the House and I urge all members of the House to support it. I urge all members of the House to give their full commitment to the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate.",REPS,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE REFORM) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Miscellaneous,7,1,speech
"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,2004-02-11,"—Well might the member for Flinders say that he supports private health insurance, because his government do and they want to destroy Medicare and make all Australians take private health insurance. That is the plan, that is the policy and that is what they are pursuing and the direction in which they are going. The Prime Minister has been pursuing that all his political life. Fortunately, they have some problems in that the people of Australia feel very warmly towards Medicare and they do not want it to be what the government has termed a `safety net'. As the leader of the Labor Party has said, `You only need a safety net if you are on a tightrope,' and many Australians are on a tightrope.
The Health Legislation Amendment (Private Health Insurance Reform) Bill 2003 puts in place reform packages that are supposed to streamline the regulations of the private health insurance industry and provide people with better value for money from their private health insurance. I am sure many Australians will be looking forward to that. The bill is also supposed to provide consumer protection and ensure that private health funds fulfil the community rating obligations that are designed to ensure that private health insurance is affordable for all Australians.
Although it might alleviate some of the minor problems the government has and has identified, this bill does nothing to help consumers and their wish to have a choice about their health provider, doctor or hospital. It also does not go any way to helping Medicare to survive, as it does not address any of the fundamental shortfalls in the funding for Medicare. In fact, it is undermining what private health insurance is all about, which was well spelled out by the shadow minister for health in this debate this morning.
I had an email this morning which covers a number of issues of concern that have been raised by my constituents. It referred to changes to Medicare which are proposed in another bill that is shortly coming up for debate, but it applies equally to this one. The woman who wrote the email says:
The amendments they propose have the potential to send people like me into greater debt and depression due to out of control medical and pharmacy bills.
The writer says she is a 54-year-old widow working four days a week and earning in the middle income range. She pays rent, as she has never been able to afford to buy a home. She has some debts, which she is paying back, and she drives a small car. The rest of her money is spent on medical and pharmaceutical expenses and day-to-day living. She last had a holiday—for two weeks—five years ago, so she is not somebody who is rolling in money and wasting her income. She has a number of health problems, which are causing these extra costs. She pays a lot for full private health insurance, which she says she cannot afford not to have. This is typical of many women in my electorate aged 50 and over, some with husbands and some without.
This writer explained that: 
The current Medicare safety net is $319.00. Medicare calculates for each person/family on accounts paid the 15% Medicare fee and when these amounts reach $319 in a calendar year, all accounts thereafter in that are refunded by Medicare at 100%. The PBS is around $703.
She argues:
... if this Government succeeds in increasing to $1000 the Medicare Safety Net, I and thousands like me would be in a dreadful position.
She said further that, if the expenses became much higher, she would have to consider stopping work and applying for a disability pension. Why? Just to obtain the medical and pharmaceutical benefits that allow her to have a reasonable life. But she would much prefer to continue in her employment. This is an uncaring government, putting people in this sort of position. By putting Medicare under these huge pressures to prop up private health insurance, we are starting to have people moving out of the work environment because they simply cannot afford to stay there. Wages are not keeping up with medical costs. Older people do have to access health care more regularly—it is a normal progression in life. But why, having paid their Medicare levy and now their private health insurance—and I still say that is a double whammy—are they having to leave their employment as well, to try and get assistance?
Private health insurance really is out of the reach of many of the people who may have been able to use it in the past. There are still huge gaps to be paid and some things that are on the list are not paid in full. I constantly have constituents raise those points with me when there seems to have been a dropping off of what they have been entitled to over the years. The premiums, of course, have continued to increase. In fact, the survey that I undertook last year in my electorate found that one of the highest concerns was the affordability of and access to health care. Some of the feedback that I received in that survey included:
Due to the extra $15 for doctors, I cannot afford to keep visiting the doctor. I have a lot of medical problems but being on a pension I cannot afford to go.
We are a low income family that has enough trouble paying for basic living expenses.
... cost of visiting my GP has stopped us from going to the Doctor when we really should have gone. It is a big problem.
So there is a real issue of affordability for ordinary Australians out there making decisions about whether or not they visit the doctor. We know we have these other problems, and they also occur in my electorate. In my electorate, for example, I have a lot of outer metropolitan areas, and people drive from them into the casualty wards of hospitals, putting pressure on the public hospital system. The interesting thing about the survey in my electorate was the number of male respondents to it. Previously, in other petitions, males have been generally more reluctant to respond to any petition or survey. This issue of affordability and access to health care seems to be one that is certainly drawing males to participate in trying to remedy it as well.
Many of the medical practices in the Lyons electorate have stopped bulk-billing altogether, which is, as I said, leading to people heading to hospitals, trying to keep their medical expenses down in that way. With the drop in bulk-billing and the rise in private health insurance premiums, many people are heading for hospitals, to try and get some relief from the crushing medical bills that they have been getting. It is often better to have an accident and get an ambulance to a hospital than to try and wait—to be put on a waiting list for an operation for a chronic but not life-threatening condition. What choice is that?
It is vital that the federal government takes more responsibility for the funding of Medicare and for its whole ability to help struggling families. Labor is committed to doing that and will continue to seek a better deal. There is a responsibility on this government to do so.
 (Mr Lindsay)—Order! I gently suggest to the member for Lyons that for the last five minutes he has not been discussing the Health Legislation Amendment (Private Health Insurance Reform) Bill 2003. I ask him to come back to the bill.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, thank you for raising that point. I believe that I am dealing with the health issues of Australia. Private health care and Medicare are two of the big components of the health system of Australia, but I will do my best as I go on to comply with your wishes.
—I thank the member for Lyons.
—There have been so many broken promises to do with private health insurance. Before the last election we were told that there would be downward pressure on premiums—that was the rhetoric of the time: that private health insurance would be more affordable and attractive to consumers, leading to a reduction in premiums. We are still waiting for the premiums to go down—they certainly do not seem to be, and I see that there is another application to raise the fees for private health insurance; there seems to be one at every opportunity.
Young people and fitter middle-aged people are leaving private health insurance, as they do not see the value in it. They are paying for the sick by themselves. In fact, the so-called X generation are quite worried: they see that the burden of tax and health is being left to them, without any contingency plans being put in place and they see that they are going to end up carrying a bigger load than the present generation. Who will ultimately end up paying the health bill in Australia? If we stick to this model, older citizens and maybe the younger generation that is coming on will pay it, because the government have priced everyone else out of possible contributions. It has to be a more extensive system to spread the load more equitably, without dividing the nation into first-class and second-class citizens. I despair for Australia when I hear of the disasters in health that are occurring around our country. Many people are going without, because they cannot afford it, and examples of this are coming into my electorate office on a regular basis.
How can private health insurance, a profit making body, support and care for those on low incomes? A national scheme has to be developed to allow health access for all and, if Medicare in its current mode is not the vehicle, then it should be developed, improved and refunded to allow it to be. But it should not be scrapped. It is our system, and people want it to exist and they want it to be improved. My constituents in Lyons have told me that they want Medicare—that it is the only scheme in existence at the moment that will allow them access to health care and private health insurance is not the answer for them. They are starting to use `access to illness care'. We use the word `health' instead of `illness'. We have ministers for health, but they are really ministers for illness, because we spend all our money on illnesses and not on prevention. Even if there are checks and balances in the system, as suggested in this bill, they will not overcome the problem that private health insurance is there to make a profit and therefore any dispute of a claim will always err in favour of the company and the consumer will not be properly covered. That is my experience to date, and I will keep watching for a change.
From my survey, I believe the Liberal government's attempt to force everybody to hold private health insurance has failed. Only 45 per cent of the respondents within my electorate of Lyons currently hold any private health insurance, and a large number of those are re-evaluating their position as the cost of private health insurance continues to climb beyond what the average wage earner can afford. Of those respondents, 71 per cent feel that they do not receive value for money from their insurance provider; 71 per cent said that. If the private insurance industry is looking at its members and taking anything from them, that concern must be showing up.
There is a real concern in the electorate that Australia is following in the steps of the United States, where medical assistance is so expensive that many common medical procedures are too costly for many low- and middle-income earners, so people do not get their medical problems sorted out, because they cannot afford to do so. In fact, companies are using medical insurance in their salary packages to attract workers to their companies and to their industries. Heaven forbid that we get to that level here, so that one of the things that draws you to a job is getting enough health insurance cover as part of your salary package.
People are really annoyed that, after the initial incentives to encourage people into private health insurance, the 30 per cent rebate has been well and truly absorbed by private health fund providers and no longer benefits Australians in any way. That 30 per cent is one hell of a lot of money. But, because they are so frightened it is going to cost so much more the next time they are forced to apply for it, people are struggling to keep their premiums going. Yet we were promised that the cost of premiums would fall and downward pressure would keep them down. We have been blackmailed into taking up health insurance, and people are feeling that they are being ripped off. I doubt whether this or any other legislation will make the slightest bit of difference to that sort of thought out there among the general public.
I believe the amendment shows exactly what is happening to private health insurance, as it condemns the government on their handling of the private health insurance system. I do believe they have a lot to answer for. My survey certainly bears that out, so it is not an idle comment on my part. I have certainly surveyed my electorate, and it was very interesting to get that survey back. It was a very big survey, and it took us a long time to put it together into a readable form.
In today's world, we really need reality policies that keep us thinking about what is happening. We have policy makers who come up with policies that have no real reality checks in them. The policies are put together, but they do not take in what is actually happening out there in the real world. I think the opposition leader, Mark Latham, has made that perfectly plain in his approach to policy making: have a look at what is happening, test the water, see what people are doing and feeling and then start thinking about how to deal with the problems in a practical sense—how to solve them and make policy decisions that will really have some effect in assisting the people of Australia.
Private health insurance is one area where we need to reconstruct the principles to see how they can work a lot better and how we can have some rigour in the system. Private health insurance should be about keeping people fit and healthy. I do not see those in the industry working on that area at all. Those people that own the gymnasiums should be the people talking about diets and exercise. Those in the industry should be the ones that are promoting goodwill by getting 30 per cent out of taxpayers for their premiums. There should have had much more rigour put on them from the government to assist our country in that way. I think they are very poor at being innovative in that area. The private health insurance industry has really fallen down and let down Australia in not being innovative and not being positive about health and trying to lead the way in that area. I think private health insurance should be tying all those things together. It is too easy for them. They have been able to run down other avenues and get conservative health ministers to give them 30 per cent rebates to try and work out a conservative agenda to knock over Medicare in this country.
Medicare is loved by Australians. It is fully supported by Australians. The government and the Prime Minister have spoken of gutting Medicare on many occasions. Medicare is very dear to me and to the Australian Labor Party. It was our child in other forms, as well as in its present form. It can certainly do with reform. It is not perfect, but it is one of the best schemes anywhere in the world that I have looked at, and it needs to be given strong support. The Labor Party will do that. We are committed to it and will continue to give it our full support in the future.

"Gambaro, Teresa, MP",LP,2004-02-11,"—It is always very good to follow on from the member for Lyons. When I first came down here to the chamber I was not quite sure if I was speaking on the same bill as the member for Lyons, because he was talking about Medicare and out-of-pocket expenses. I thought we were here to talk about the Health Legislation Amendment (Private Health Insurance Reform) Bill 2003. If the Labor Party were serious about out-of-pocket expenses, the member for Lyons and his colleagues would vote for the MedicarePlus package. There are some very good measures in it that deal with alleviating out-of-pocket expenses. But it was very good to hear him come back to the actual bill that we are here talking about today, and that is the Health Legislation Amendment (Private Health Insurance Reform) Bill. While he was speaking about his survey and the great failings of the health insurance system, he also spoke about out-of-pockets. A couple of weeks ago I had the misfortune of having a minor operation. It was really quite an experience to know in going into hospital exactly what my out-of-pockets were going to be for the accommodation. That is what this bill is about: knowing with certainty what your out-of-pocket expenses are going to be and knowing how much the bill is. That is something that never happened under the previous Labor government.
We have a situation at the moment where four out of five in-patients visit a private hospital and have no gap. There has been significant improvement since the days when Labor were in government where they had a zero-rating situation. I remember joining the government in 1996, not so long ago, when young people never joined a health fund. Young people get sick, but they think they are infallible and that they are never going to get sick. None of them joined a health fund. Older people were joining a health fund and, unfortunately, younger people never took part in contributing to a health fund. That is an unhealthy situation.
The member for Lyons has an elderly population in his electorate, as do I in my electorate of Petrie. He would know that they have a greater demand for health services and that they require things such as hip replacements. I hope I never have to have a hip operation, but many of my constituents do. Technology has moved along in those areas. The cost of a hip—and they are developing every year with newer and more innovative biotechs in these particular areas—is very expensive. That is what health insurance funds pay for. They pay for those expensive pieces of equipment.
When people go into hospital they now have greater flexibility. They can move between funds. There has always been a system. I do agree with the member for Lyons on some things. There is a place for private health insurance and there is a place for a public health system as well, but the people that can afford private health insurance should take advantage of that. There have been many instances in my electorate where people who should have been in private health insurance have been putting pressure on the public hospital system. Those situations should not be allowed to occur, because the people who do need to access public hospitals and health services should be at the top of the list, not people who can afford to be in private health insurance.
This bill is a way forward. It allows people to have a better choice as to how they spend the dollar within one of the most important investments that any of us will ever make. Our health is the most important investment that anyone in this world can make. Having the right health insurance is very important. The fact that nearly half of all Australians are already opting to hold private health insurance demonstrates their belief. I think it is much more than half in my electorate. They believe that the government has put in a private health insurance industry in this country that is a good investment. When you look at private and public health systems in many countries in the world, there is no denying that we are top class. We have private and public health systems in this country that are second to none in the world. 
The bill is also being introduced to increase competition and will therefore benefit health fund customers. The government, through these reforms, has made sure that people do have the widest possible choice of funds. Those funds and what they have to offer are very important as well. This bill amends two acts, the National Health Act 1953 and the Private Health Insurance Incentives Act 1997. We recognise that it is important to have reforms that make choice accessible and also make that choice secure for health consumers.
One of the best things that this government did was bring in the 30 per cent rebate. It encouraged a number of families and individuals to go into Lifetime Health Cover and no-gaps schemes, which presented a great improvement on options that previously were available to people. As I said earlier, the number of private in-patient visits has increased and that is a good thing. Gap insurance is available to people who visit private hospitals, which is a terrific improvement. Out-of-hospital services, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy, can cost thousands of dollars. Recently someone from my electorate who had breast cancer came to see me. People in this situation can require a number of long visits, sometimes over a period of two or three months. Their out-of-pocket expenses can be $3,000 or $4,000. Under this government, those expenses are now capped at around $1,000. 
These reforms demonstrate the government's commitment to a wider and more secure choice of private health insurance products. That has strengthened Medicare; it has not, as the member for Lyons claimed earlier, diluted Medicare. We have taken a further step towards a more innovative, responsive and efficient system through these reforms. This bill does three things in particular. It decreases a lot of the dreadful red tape on health fund products which many of us have experienced. It also reduces the amount of time that health funds used to have to spend in applying to the health department to get approval for changes to rules and products and then waiting to get answers. That was really cumbersome. The end user—the consumer—did not benefit from that, because of the long time it took to get approval. When there is a whole lot of red tape, it reduces competition and does not lead to efficiencies. The bill benefits both consumers and providers by streamlining existing regulations, making them much more responsive to members' needs. The assessment process is something that never really happened before. 
The bill will be offset by a wider range of sanctions and wider ministerial discretion to allow flexible and proportionate responses to breaches of the act. There will be closer government monitoring of fund performance to ensure that policy requirements and community ratings are maintained, that there is an acceptable performance level and that higher risk members are not discriminated against. I spoke earlier about some of those higher risk patients—the elderly and people who require more intensive treatment and more medical products and services. This is a non-discriminatory bill and that is a very good thing. 
This bill provides enhancements. It secures consumer confidence in private health insurance and it makes sure that the industry performs to the optimum levels that are required within the economy. The bill also has some important measures in it that will ensure that consumers get more meaningful and transparent information so that they know a lot more about health products and the rules governing health products and health insurance companies. 
Another important aspect of the bill is that it enhances the powers of the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman. The ombudsman already investigates complaints and disputes. The bill establishes an annual `state of the health funds' report, which will provide consumers with information on the performance of the various funds. Consumers will be able to see how their funds have performed, whether they have provided all of the services that they have said that they would provide and whether those services have been provided in a timely and efficient financial manner. 
Lastly, the bill improves on some of the aspects of the Lifetime Health Cover legislation to ensure that there are high levels of membership in private health insurance. A single Lifetime Health Cover birthday will be established, which will increase the effectiveness of health fund promotions and ensure that consumers take out private health hospital cover before incurring a Lifetime Health Cover loading. The amendments in this bill ensure that Australians who have been living overseas for periods of more than one year—perhaps people who have had to travel overseas for work reasons—and veterans who lose entitlement to a Department of Veterans' Affairs gold card are not unfairly penalised under the Lifetime Health Cover scheme. Another important measure is the 12-month grace period that will allow Australians living overseas on their 31st birthday, and those migrants who have entered Australia after the introduction of Lifetime Health Cover, to take up private health insurance without incurring any penalty whatsoever. 
All in all, this bill contains very balanced reforms. It will drive competition. It will make sure that consumers have a better chance of making much more informed decisions. The industry will be more efficient and more accountable. The bill will ensure that private health insurance remains affordable and well within the reach of many Australians. Consumers will be offered much more choice in funds and, if they want to move between funds, they will not lose any of those very valuable rights and they will not have to complete a new waiting period. That is a very important thing. I support this bill. It ensures that we will have increased competition, we will be much more innovative, we will have less red tape and the industry will be much more responsive.",REPS,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE REFORM) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Miscellaneous,7,1,speech
"Lawrence, Dr Carmen, MP",ALP,2004-02-11,"—I have spoken in this House before about the long-term strategy of the Howard government to undermine Medicare. Although the Health Legislation Amendment (Private Health Insurance Reform) Bill 2003 improves some private health insurance products and makes some minor changes to improve the monitoring of private health insurance products, it is really part of that general strategy. I think we need to go back and have a look at the Prime Minister's form on this. I am going to keep saying this because I think it is something that Australians are coming to understand: the government really does not believe in the universal value of Medicare and it never has.
One of the Prime Minister's first acts when he became a member of parliament was to vote against Medibank, the precursor of Medicare, in the joint sitting of parliament that was called following the double dissolution that had been brought on in part by the conservatives' refusal to pass the original Medibank legislation. That was one of his first acts. Then, when he was Treasurer in the Fraser government, he systematically dismantled Medibank. It really was chaos at the time. When challenged with this history about his real intentions before the 1996 election, he denied the obvious and, implausibly, using the formulation which I think is now familiar to a lot of Australians, he said:
A lot of people will say that changes Fraser made did not amount to dismantling Medicare.
Actually, a lot of people were saying exactly the opposite as we went through Medibank 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7—I think there were finally eight series of changes which finally dismantled Medibank. A lot of the people who voted for him, and a lot of expert commentators, said that they did actually think that the government had form on this. They remembered the fact that there were two million Australians who were not classed as poor or disadvantaged but who did not have any hospital or medical cover, that free access to hospitals was then restricted to the very disadvantaged and that the Commonwealth flat rate medical benefit was set at 30 per cent and the rest came out of the patient's pocket. People did remember that when Howard came back. They had in the meantime embraced the success of Medibank and Medicare.
The Age editorial of the time—that is, when Howard, or should I say the Prime Minister, was Treasurer for the first time—put it pretty bluntly. It said:
Their real purpose appears to be to satisfy the Government's ideological preconception to placate the medical profession and to ease the Government's budgetary difficulties. Their main effect will be to shift some of the burden of health care costs from the public to the private sector, from higher to lower income earners and from those in good health to those who are sick.
It sounds familiar. The government has form, and plenty of it. The Prime Minister was very careful, of course, when challenged in 1996 and since, to reassure the Australian public that his intentions really were benign, that he had come to love Medicare—indeed, he was a fan—and that his party had never, ever had any intention of abolishing, dismantling or diminishing it in any way. He complained, when he was pushed by a journalist:
I don't accept for a moment that we went to the last election—
that is, in 1993—
as Paul Keating alleges promising to abolish Medicare, that is wrong, we didn't. We didn't promise to abolish Medicare at the last election; we promised to make changes but not to abolish it. But our commitment to keep it is absolute; it is a guarantee, and we are also going to keep community rating and we are also going to retain bulk billing.
The evidence, I think, suggests otherwise. He well knew that one of the reasons they lost the election in 1993 was their promised assault on Medicare—remember Fightback? He was not prepared even then—that is, in 1993—to concede that an assault had ever been one of his objectives and, indeed, that it would be again. He had to pretend then, and he has since, that he always supported Medicare and only nasty people like Paul Keating would dare draw any attention to the fact that a very explicit and public assault was contained in Fightback. He hoped, I think, that the Australian people and the media would not remember that the coalition was going to keep the name `Medicare' but that was about all.
In Fightback, if we go back to that, we can see all of the elements that are now appearing in the government's policy and have done since 1996: Medicare for pensioners and cardholders only—that is still on the agenda; a Medicare levy surcharge for high-income earners who do not take up private health insurance—that has been done; the abolition of bulk-billing except for welfare recipients—they are still trying on that one; refundable tax credits to provide ongoing assistance to income earners below $30,000 who take out private health insurance—that has been done in spades with the 30 per cent rebate; gap insurance for medical and hospital bills—that is pretty much done; the reduction of the rebate from 85 per cent to 75 per cent of the Medicare schedule—that was effectively achieved by stealth by failing to put up the rebate for doctors. That is why bulk-billing has disappeared. The government has undermined bulk-billing by GPs by setting the schedule fee at an unrealistically low level. No wonder they will not bulk-bill. In my own seat this has caused the bulk-billing rate to drop by 13 per cent—and it is slightly more now—since 2000.
I note that these market-distorting private health insurance measures would not be tolerated in any other industry sector. I have made this observation before and I think it needs to be made again. We are propping up an expensive and inefficient product with very high administrative costs. Just to make the obvious comparison: in 2000 private health insurance administration expenses averaged around 11.8 per cent—I have not seen any more recent figures—of the contribution income compared with Medicare's, of around three per cent. I think that is an extraordinary difference. This means that, at that time, $240 million of the taxpayer-funded $2 billion private health insurance rebate was actually consumed in administrative expenses. If the $2 billion had gone into Medicare, on the other hand, the administration would have been only $60 million. So this is not a very efficient product that people are being asked to sign up to.
As the authors of those particular figures and others have demonstrated, this has always been an ideologically driven exercise. It is not taking pressure off the public health system as has been claimed. I will talk a bit more about that. The demand for public hospital services has continued to rise, indeed. It is well over 10 per cent in some states, with even higher increases in emergency departments. So it is not substituting private for public. The greater activity in the private hospital sector is largely due to an increase in elective and less serious surgical procedures as people dragooned into getting private health insurance try to get their money's worth. Some of the packages, of course, have had to be removed because they were so ridiculous.
The former chief executive officer of the Commonwealth health department and now professor of health policy at La Trobe University, Stephen Duckett, has suggested, and I agree with him, that Howard's legacy, one of which Howard would probably be secretly proud, is likely to be—
—Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The member is consistently referring to the Prime Minister by his surname. Previous occupiers of your chair have been quick to pull members into line. Could I suggest that the member observe the standing orders.
 (Hon. L.R.S. Price)—I thank the member for Mitchell. The honourable member for Fremantle should address members by their title.
—I was actually quoting another writer, but I can insert `Prime Minister'. The Prime Minister, Mr Howard, would probably be secretly proud of his legacy, the destruction of Medicare. Knowing that the Australian people are still very supportive of Medicare, however, he has adopted a very underhand strategy: speak softly and prosper. He knows that a secure, affordable health system is just as important to the Australian people as protection from terrorist attacks, so he would not dare to reveal his deep antipathy to what he used to call an `inappropriate socialist dogma'.
As Stephen Duckett has pointed out, the Prime Minister has undertaken a very audacious attempt to rewrite history, most recently in his attempts to claim that Medicare was only ever intended as a safety net for the disadvantaged—something that his minister has taken up. On the contrary, Medicare was designed as a universal scheme providing access to health care for all Australians. He never did understand that, and clearly still does not. The coalition has consistently resisted the idea that Medicare is a contract with the Australian people designed to ensure that everybody gets quality care, regardless of their wealth. It was deliberately designed so that no-one need have private health insurance unless they chose to. It was clearly based on the principle that, through the progressive tax system, where the rich pay more—at least in theory—and a higher Medicare levy, we would create a system that all Australians could share in. Health, after all, is not a commodity where your income should determine how much and what quality you can obtain—at least, that is what we have always believed in the Labor Party.
The government, when they started to change Medicare, liked to point to the fact that over the last 20 years the proportion of the Australian population with private health insurance dropped dramatically, especially after the introduction of Medicare. Of course it did—that was what it was designed to do. The government claimed that that was why they had to intervene: to reverse the trend of decline in private health insurance coverage. A lot of the evidence shows that that decline was not due to any increase in the cost of private health insurance premiums, although they did increase, but was due to the success of Medicare—again, something the government have never understood.
The decline in private health insurance coverage, as one person put it, `reflects a rational choice by Australian consumers reflecting confidence in the publicly funded Medicare program.' That is what it was designed to do. The government has systematically tried to undermine this confidence, including through very expensive advertising depicting Medicare as inadequate. Remember those umbrellas sheltering the poor patients from the rain, the rain presumably symbolising the public hospital system?
Through the initial incentive scheme in 1997 which failed and the 30 per cent rebate the government obviously hoped to entice more people into private health insurance and private health usage. Those two measures failed to have any substantial effect initially: $1½ billion went largely to existing members; they hardly recruited any new takers at all; and over the first year of operation of the 30 per cent rebate the percentage of private health insurance increased from 30 per cent to only 30.1 per cent of the population. It was only when the government introduced lifetime health insurance and tried to scare the pants off young people that their care would otherwise be inadequate that the numbers moved to over 40 per cent. The cost of the rebate is no longer $1.5 billion—because it is effectively uncapped—but $2.6 billion and growing with every premium rise.
In those circumstances it is not unreasonable to ask: has the policy produced the claimed benefits, particularly that of taking pressure off the public system? While there was some evidence of an initial decline in public hospital usage in 1999-2000 when the 30 per cent rebate and lifetime insurance were introduced and a corresponding rise in private hospital admissions, that effect has not been sustained. In fact, it was described by one researcher as a one-hit wonder. The latest data show public hospital growth is almost back to where it was before the private health insurance rebate. It certainly does not justify the cuts to the states for hospital funding which were inflicted on them in the last round of the Medicare agreements. Yet the government has continued to use these arguments about substitution.
What is more, young people are leaving private health insurance in droves, worsening the age profile and placing further pressure on premiums. In 2002-03 there was a decline of four per cent in private health insurance coverage by all age groups in the 30 to 59 band and a six per cent increase in those over 60. The most recent figures show that the number of insured people aged 30 to 54 has plunged by 256,000 since September 2000, while those in the over 65 group increased by 9.9 per cent. The age profile is worsening every month. It has been estimated that to keep the average age of those insured at today's rates in 2010, 75 per cent of the then 30 to 39 year olds will need to be insured—I suggest that that is a very unlikely outcome. Perhaps we can expect another scare campaign.
The elderly, of course, is the group with greatest need and the highest use of expensive health services. Inevitably it is driving up the cost of health insurance—surprise, surprise!—and the cost to the taxpayer. It has added 5.5 per cent to average health benefit payouts by funds already. Premiums are now set to rise again at great cost to the taxpayer, as I said, as well as through private health insurance premiums that people are paying. Estimates are that, on average, premiums will rise by seven to eight per cent in April. But for many the increases will be much higher—some probably as high as 20 per cent. It needs to be said that the government seem complacent about this. They are basically saying that this is reasonable. They have already given them inflation without question, and it looks like they are going to allow these to go through as well.
Despite the increase in the percentage of people with private health insurance, it should be pointed out that the 30 per cent rebate favours high income earners compared to low income earners—although we certainly have more low income earners in there now. It is particularly illustrated with respect to dental care, where the government axed a program and withdrew subsidised dental care for the least well-off to the tune of about $100 million a year, whereas the 30 per cent rebate subsidises those who are better off to the tune of $300 million to $400 million a year—their teeth are okay, thank you very much!
As I said earlier, underlying the government's obsessions with increasing private health insurance is the claim that the public and private systems are perfect substitutes for one another. So, if you can move people out of the public system into the private system, all will be well. The trouble is that it does not actually work that way. The argument has a number of weaknesses—mainly in the evidence, as it turns out. First of all, there are substantial differences between the mix of patients seen in the public and private sectors; there is a lot of evidence now to show that the private sector still focuses more on elective surgery. Indeed that is how private insurance was marketed and continues to be marketed—namely, that private insurance allows you to bypass public sector waiting lists for elective surgery. The private sector does not provide services in a range of areas, particularly in complex medical and surgical cases. If you are really in trouble, you go to a public hospital. Even in the area of elective surgery, the extent of substitution is questionable. As one researcher argues:
There is a strong argument in the health economics literature that suppliers/providers can, in certain circumstances, create their own demand and this is particularly the case where the provider is rewarded on a fee for service basis for service provision.
If you look at some of the endoscopies and the increasing rates of those investigations, you would have to say that it looks as if there is a pretty good market there. It is less likely, of course, in the public sector, where the incentives for demand creation are not so great.
I think it is reasonable to conclude from the evidence that not all private hospital activity could be seen, in any case, as a substitute for public hospital activity. Even in those areas where it might be said that services are perfect substitutes, and there are obviously some, the public policy question should be: is the public subsidy to private activity economically beneficial? In other words, for the same procedure, is the private sector cheaper or more efficient? The evidence available suggests that that is not the case. Indeed, evidence suggests that there may be substantial costs to the public in expanding private hospital sector use. This is very important, in that an increased proportion of activity in the private sector contributes to increased waiting times in the public sector. In other words, the specialists work in the private sector, get their fee for service and are not then available in the public sector. Recent research shows very clearly that the more activity there is in the private sector, for some areas of surgery, the longer the waiting times in public hospitals—and that should not come as a surprise. Many specialists prefer to operate in the relatively lucrative environment of the private sector and are not then available for public hospital employment. So we are subsidising people to have care in the private system, allegedly to take the pressure off the public system; the surgeons and others then go to the private system and are not available for the public system; and the waiting lists grow. The public system then is further undermined.
We have to ask the question, I think reasonably: why should governments subsidise the private sector when those subsidies further exacerbate public policy problems in the public sector, particularly through increased waiting times, while enabling some privileged consumers then to bypass the public sector constraints, which have been created, at least in part, by siphoning money from the public to the private system? The additional funds that have been provided for the private health insurance rebate came directly from reduced funds available through the Medicare agreements and direct funding to the states. I think it is fair to say that, over time, since these rebates have been introduced, we have not seen any improvement in the general health and wellbeing of the Australian community above and beyond what you would expect from a properly subsidised, public and universal Medicare system.
As I said earlier, it should not come as any surprise to Australians that we have seen Medicare systematically dismantled and the substitution of a relatively inefficient private health insurance system with a very large rebate. We now have the significant problem in Australia of a two-tiered system. It is not about to happen; it is happening right now. The taxpayers of Australia, including those with very few means of their own, are actually subsidising a system which means that many people are getting privileged access to care while those who need care are waiting for longer times in our public hospital system. Frankly, this is unconscionable, and the Howard government should be held to account for this significant deterioration.
—Order! Before calling the honourable member for Mitchell, I advise him that I will take great note of how he refers to members in the House.",REPS,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE REFORM) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Miscellaneous,7,1,speech
"Cadman, Alan, MP",LP,2004-02-11,"—Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I will follow your injunction with care. I was listening for some time, from my room, to the previous member and was aware of her transgressing the standing order that I know you are going to enforce.
The Health Legislation Amendment (Private Health Insurance Reform) Bill 2003 before the House is part of a total approach that the government has adopted to improve the health care services of Australia. About one-third of the total federal budget is involved in health or health related expenses. If you include the Tough on Drugs program and the medical research programs, over one-third of all funds raised by the Commonwealth in some way or another find their way into health related expenses. This is a massive commitment by the Commonwealth. In addition, you will be aware that the state governments have the responsibility for the delivery of medical services. As such, it is their role to make sure that the regulation of doctors working within states and the operation of public hospitals are properly carried out and that they provide the service they are designed to give to people requiring health services, and also that the inspection and maintenance of standards for health care providers are maintained at appropriate levels.
It has been a concern to successive governments that the cost of health and medical procedures rises much more quickly than inflation. Covering the cost of medical services—because Australians want and need the best possible services—has been difficult to deal with for successive governments. This government has adopted an approach which I believe is the only sensible approach—that is, to encourage people to self-insure. Not everybody needs a system provided by the taxpayer and, where possible, people should insure to protect their health needs and to cover their health payments. That means that they can purchase packages of insurance that suit their particular family. It means they can make decisions about what scale of support they need. It also means that health services become more responsive to actual patient and client needs, rather than being based on some calculation performed by governments. So the government's role since coming to office, I think, has been very sensible and has had a high degree of success in encouraging people to insure for their health services. The legislation before the House today goes further in a number of areas.
It has been drawn to my attention that we are in the process of celebrating 20 years of Medicare, and the minister has supplied me with some details of what Medicare has done. In 20 years, Medicare has processed 3.5 billion services and paid $103 billion in benefits, successfully delivering one of the largest health payment systems in the world. These are fascinating statistics. Seventy-five per cent of the 3.5 billion services have been bulk-billed. The bulk-bill rate in 1984-85 was 45 per cent; in 2003-04, it was 68 per cent. Twenty-seven per cent of the population is younger than Medicare. Sixteen million Australians went to a GP last year.
The addition that this legislation starts to put in place with MedicarePlus is a $2.4 billion program which will strengthen and protect Medicare. The Health Legislation Amendment (Private Health Insurance Reform) Bill 2003, which we are looking at today, is designed to strengthen the process of Medicare and to provide better access for certain individuals and also to provide a safety net for many others. Coinciding with Medicare's 20th birthday—coming in at the same time in the same period—is the introduction of a major plank of the reform: an additional $5 for every bulk-billed service provided to Commonwealth concession card holders and all children under the age of 16. That is a conjunction of two events: 20 years of Medicare and the introduction of MedicarePlus with the additional $5 for the medical services provided to concession card holders and all children aged under 16. That means that families and low-income earners are automatically bulk-billed and doctors are encouraged to provide bulk-billing services. There are additional parts of the package that relate to rural and outer suburban areas and access to Medicare, nursing and nursing homes and those sorts of additional provisions.
I note that the Senate committee inquiry into the MedicarePlus package is due to report today, when senators will prepare to debate the legislation. I understand that the member for Lalor, who is the spokesman for the Australian Labor Party on health matters, said Labor would oppose the legislation, leaving—as we see it from this perspective—its fate in the hands of four Independent senators. I think that is a strange way of making health policy. The Australian Labor Party needs to consider whether it is going to be part of the solution or part of the problem and to be seen as such.
There are exciting changes being proposed in this legislation. To begin the process, we look at the main provisions of the health legislation amendment bill and first of all look at the product changes—that is, the introduction of the new way in which the product changes can be made, which was previously done by applying to the secretary but which is now done in a way which gives more freedom. Also, while there is more freedom on the part of the industry—and we need a bit of imagination in the way health insurance is provided in Australia—the changes toughen the role of the minister and his capacity to investigate and to apply some sort of discipline to any organisations that play games. So the sanctions under the national health agreement are strengthened by this legislation.
In relation to product changes, health funds are required to provide 60 days notice to the secretary—I was in error previously—where the minister is of the opinion that a change might result in a breach of the act or conditions of registration of the organisation, impose an unreasonable and inequitable condition affecting the rights of any contributor, or, having regard to the advice of the council—which I will refer to later—adversely affect the financial stability of a health benefit fund. The minister may disallow the change. So the minister may disallow the increasing of premiums if he or she is of the opinion that the change would be contrary to the public interest. So that provision is there. The government, at the end of the day, can make a commitment that changes such as increased charges are unnecessary and should not go ahead. The Private Health Insurance Ombudsman also has a role in this: to investigate whether changes are necessary or not.
In regard to the sanctions for breaches of the act, the minister must be satisfied there has been a breach. He can take the following action. He can request an enforceable undertaking. He can enforce a commitment that he requires a fund to make. He can give a direction to a health fund. He can impose a further condition of registration on the fund. The minister may revoke the status of the health fund to offer a 30 per cent private health insurance rebate as a premium reduction. He can apply to the Federal Court for an order or he can take action to appoint an inspector, place a health fund under administration or seek the winding up of a health fund.
Both the minister's investigative powers and his powers to apply sanctions have increased. I think this is a very sensible way of proceeding, giving more freedom to the industry and some capacity to be more imaginative and to better tailor packages that will suit the health needs of the community. Alongside that are greater powers for the minister to intervene should the funds or any part of the industry contravene the best interests of Australian health seekers or taxpayers. Other actions open to the minister—where there has not been a breach but where the minister considers the performance of the fund could be improved—would be to request an enforceable undertaking, give a direction to the health fund or impose a further condition of registration on the fund. So the minister can intervene not only when there are breaches but also when a fund appears to be failing in its duty to the Australian community.
There are proposals in this legislation to expand the powers of the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman. The office of the ombudsman is a statutory body and its main role is to provide an independent complaint and advisory service to private health insurance contributors. The powers of this organisation will be increased so that it might deal with complaints, publish aggregated information on complaints, conduct investigations and make recommendations about regulatory practices and industry practices that affect health insurance funds. In the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman we have someone that the public can appeal to. The minister has a capacity to intervene and even prevent rises or changes that are not in the best interests of the Australian community. It is a loosening up of the funds and the capacity for the types of services or health packages that they may want to submit for consideration by the Australian public.
One of the most significant features of the changes introduced by the government, which has been mentioned by previous speakers in this debate, is the Lifetime Health Cover. That was introduced in July 2000, and I think that has had more impact than the 30 per cent rebate as people realise there is an imperative—provided they have an income of $50,000 or more—to get into the system: if they do not, penalties will start. The introduction of Lifetime Health Cover means that health funds are able to charge a premium on contributions if a person fails to take up private hospital cover. Since July 2000, those who delayed taking up hospital cover pay a two per cent loading on top of their premium for every year they are aged over 30 when they first take out hospital cover. I have an example here from a Parliamentary Library paper. A 50-year-old taking out cover in April 2001 would pay 40 per cent more for cover than if they had taken it out a year earlier.
Private hospital cover is not compulsory, but a person earning over $50,000 must pay a premium and is required to pay an annual 1.5 per cent Medicare surcharge. I think this has been one of the most successful processes in encouraging people to join funds. With further changes and a bulk-billing safety net I believe we will have a system that will serve Australians extremely well. In response to concerns that it is difficult for funds to advertise or run marketing campaigns based on Lifetime Health Cover, this legislation seeks to make the birthday of all Lifetime Health Cover the same day. That is a sensible thing. I know there are other fields where the same process is used. It will make administration and advertising much simpler and much more easily followed by the Australian public.
The MedicarePlus program, as it develops, will continue to maintain the three basic pillars of Medicare: that all Australians are eligible for bulk-billing and receive the medical benefit rebate, that they receive free public hospital care and that they receive subsidies through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme—something that has been in the news over the last week or so as Australia negotiated the free trade agreement with the US. The government has stuck by the need to maintain the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. This legislation deals with other aspects of Medicare. It is easy for all Australians to see that the maintenance of the pillars of Medicare—access to bulk-billing, free public hospital care and subsidised medicines through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme—has been complemented by the 30 per cent rebate for private health insurance.
The introduction of MedicarePlus will create additional capacity for bulk-billing, particularly for children and concession card holders. Another aspect of this legislation is a new safety net to cover all Australians for high or unexpected medical costs. That is traumatic cover, something that I think will be welcomed by all Australians. It will cover car accidents and accidents of all types, whether industrial or home based. Heart failure, cancer and those sorts of traumatic things are covered under the new MedicarePlus safety net.
Whether people's health suffers through an accident or a serious illness and whether they need X-rays, specialist consultants, psychiatry, CT scans, MRIs, radiation or oncology, all of those things are going to be covered by MedicarePlus. Here we have a package that gives more flexibility, greater supervisory powers to the minister and additional powers to the ombudsman, all backing up the framework under which MedicarePlus is coming into being, and all the time we have the Australian Labor Party saying, `We won't support it.' I think that that is an irresponsible position and I know the people of Australia will think so too when they understand the benefits that can flow from these changes.
It is almost as though the Australian Labor Party, without coming to government, want to run the show. They would be far better off letting the government do its job. If the government fails they can then target the government and successfully criticise it for its failures. But criticising the government for the failure of a program that has not been introduced and that the Labor party wants to change really does not get traction out there in the community. We have had a most successful change to health services, unlike the New South Wales government. There is trauma and chaos right across south Sydney, with dreadful situations in the public health system.

"McFarlane, Jann, MP",ALP,2004-02-11,"—I am pleased to talk on the Health Legislation Amendment (Medicare and Private Health Insurance) Bill 2003 because, to take up the point made by the member for Mitchell, health is very important in people's lives—for individuals and for families—wherever people live. Medicare is particularly important. I have always viewed Medicare as the daughter of Medibank, an invention of the Whitlam Labor government in the seventies and probably one of the most important and far-reaching programs of its day. As you know, Labor rebuilt the program under the Hawke and Keating governments, and Labor still today supports strong universal benefits—Medicare. It must be universal and it must be accessible to all. The Health Legislation Amendment (Medicare and Private Health Insurance) Bill 2003 is extremely important. I am also pleased to note that the Senate select committee that examined this bill has reported to the Senate.
Why is health so important to people? We all want to live a long life. Some of us will live until 100 and others will live until about 80. I intend to be one of those who live until 100. Like many of my constituents, I can see that I can do that only if I have a good, strong public health system and a good, strong, universally accessible Medicare system.
What are the strengths of this bill? Like all bills, this bill has strengths. I will deal with them first and then I will deal with its weaknesses. One strength is that it makes some real changes to the regulation of registered health benefit organisations. Over time, situations change and there comes a need to make amendments. Under this bill there will be a set of indicators established to ensure that the government retains the ability to effectively monitor the performance of registered health benefit organisations, including any breaches of the National Health Act. My constituents and many other people are very keen for health funds to be monitored, because concerns are often raised with me and with many of my colleagues about what people sometimes see as unfairness in how the health funds operate. They also raise concerns about fees, which have risen dramatically over the last 18 months or two years. 
The additional strengths in the regulations are seen as a good thing. Also, the minister will have a broader range of investigatory powers and administrative sanctions that can be used when a registered health benefit organisation is found to be in breach of the NHA or has failed to meet government objectives and has breached community obligations. Again, these changes have come about because people across Australia as well as medical professionals have raised their concerns about some behaviours or events that have negatively impacted on people's lives. Probably one of the most important strengths that will come in via this bill is that the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman will be given increased powers to protect consumers by investigating complaints and resolving disputes.
The whole issue of consumer protection is becoming increasingly important. People feel at times that government is distanced and that it does not really understand what happens in their lives. Anything that protects consumers, particularly people accessing the health system, is a good thing, and the government is to be commended on that. The Private Health Insurance Ombudsman will have the power to report to the minister on the outcomes of an investigation and to make recommendations on ways of dealing with specific issues arising from an investigation. Health benefit organisations will be required to respond to requests for information or a recommendation from the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman within a specified time frame. Again, it makes it relevant, timely and efficient, and that is a good thing. It makes people pleased not only when they feel that they are taken seriously but also when they get a timely answer. As well, the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman will be required to produce an annual report on the state of the health funds, providing important information for government and consumers on how the registered health benefit organisations are performing and how well they are serving their members.
A constituent rang me the other day. He was very unhappy about his health fund and the gap and the way in which some of his inquiries were handled. He felt that the health funds see that their primary role is to make profit for shareholders, which he had no problem with—he works in private business; he has to make a profit—but he was concerned about consumer protection and the treatment of consumers. He felt that perhaps health funds should consider how they are handling their members, who help to make a profit for the shareholders. It was quite problematic. When I related back to him that the bill was coming back to the House and that Labor very much supports these aspects of it, he was very pleased and wanted to commend all of us on our work. People like to commend us when we do bipartisan work, particularly through Senate select committees, to strengthen our health system and make it work better for them as well as for us.
There are other strengths in the bill but I want to move on to the problematic effects of the bill, because that is what I am here for: to raise the voices of the people, families, groups, health professionals and services of Stirling and point out some things that people are unhappy about.
One of these problems is the issue of bulk-billing. I am not just talking about my electorate of Stirling, which, as you know, is a lovely northern suburbs leafy garden electorate. People have concerns, and I have concerns, about what is happening in rural and remote areas. People in my area have family up there; I have family up there. I hear many reports of what has happened and, if you get outside Perth and travel up to the north-west of Western Australia, there is pretty well not a doctor there, apparently, who still bulk-bills. This has been a very difficult situation for people who live in rural areas. It has impacted in other ways that were not considered, but these impacts are felt in country towns, where non-Indigenous people are increasingly accessing the Aboriginal medical services to get their treatment for free or for a bulk-billing rate because they are the only services that bulk-bill.
Again, health is a very complex matter. I am aware that the government and this parliament have inquired into Indigenous health, but this is one aspect that surfaces occasionally but that has not really been effectively dealt with because the funding for Aboriginal medical services falls in one area and funding for other services falls in other areas. But what does it mean if you cannot find a doctor who bulk-bills? It is all very fine that we in the parliament are looking at the issue of a copayment, and I, on a personal level, and many of my constituents support the fact that under this bill doctors will be able to electronically claim for people under Medicare. That is a good thing and a modern thing, and it makes life for the doctors and their staff much better and assists with profits because they are not spending so much time filling out forms and posting letters and so on. What does it mean if you are in an area, particularly a rural or remote area, where your doctor does not bulk-bill? The benefits in this bill for those people are negligible. If you are in a country town, the cost of going to see your GP is much higher than the cost in a city area.
What have I done to help my constituents and their families in Stirling? Eighteen months ago I put out a guide on bulk-billing for my area. At first I just made it available in my office, but increasingly people would ring up requesting it—and people would call from other electorates and from country towns. It was not much help to them because it only listed the 42 doctors or medical practices in Stirling that bulk-billed, but I would send it to them anyway because I believed I should encourage these people to take this guide to their own local member and ask them to produce one like it to help in those areas.
I then decided that, due to the increasing requests, the bulk-billing guide needed to be made more generally available. I mailed it out with a letter to 35,000 households in Stirling, and what was the untoward effect of this? It put enormous pressure on those bulk-billing doctors to service the many extra people who came to them for medical treatment and assistance. Every time I put out this brochure I reprint it after three months. As a result of this pressure, the number of doctors who bulk-billed has dropped to 31, then 28, then 26 and currently it is 20. That means that, in my area, I will probably soon end up with no doctors who bulk-bill. This is an untoward effect. In being helpful to people and letting them know where there was a doctor who bulk-billed, it ended up putting pressure on those doctors, so some of them have closed their books to new patients and are only servicing their existing patients.
What does this mean for people when they come to me and complain about the copayment? That is now the current thing: people are coming in and complaining about the copayment. This bill makes the copayment an element in supposedly helping the doctors and attracting doctors back to bulk-billing. People are coming to me and they are paying $5 or $10 for the copayment, but that is only because they can secure an appointment with the doctor and they are an existing patient. But there is also some concern about why they are making this copayment. People do not seem to understand that there have been some changes because of our work here in the parliament and that that is why they are paying the copayment.
People's concerns about these matters are not really being addressed by this bill, and it is quite problematic. If Labor oppose the bill and the copayment, we are also then opposing the bringing in of practice nurses, which is something we support—we think practice nurses are a very good mechanism, providing services particularly to medical centres or rural areas where there is not necessarily an accessible doctor. So we are between the devil and the deep blue sea: in looking at this bill and deciding whether to support it, there are elements we like and think are positive, and there are elements we do not like. What I do understand is that the community has not caught up with what we are doing in here. I do my best to educate them but I am only one lone member in the northern suburbs of Perth who has taken this approach, so I am sharing it with my colleagues in the House because, as I said, our constituents and their families like it when we work together in a bipartisan manner to come up with practical solutions to problems in their lives.
The other issue I want to raise is that I thought this legislation was meant to strengthen the position of pensioners and Commonwealth concession card holders, but still in my electorate—and I have raised this in the House before—there are some GPs and specialists who do not accept or recognise the veterans' gold card and are charging them for services. I do not see how the proposed changes are going to overcome that resistance by GPs and specialists who are refusing to accept the gold card. In no way have I been able to assuage the concerns of veterans in my electorate, keeping in mind that I have five RSL sub-branches in my electorate, a very active veterans' community and a number of other groups—for instance, Vietnam veterans, Gulf War veterans and people who served in East Timor and elsewhere on policing missions—who are unhappy about what they see as a reduction in the value of their gold card and, in fact, a breach of a strong government promise that they will always be looked after and that that is why they were given the gold card. This legislation, I think, does not in any way address their concerns, nor will it overcome this problem. It is not just in my electorate. When I talk to my colleagues, many of them tell me that in their area the gold card for veterans is not accepted by many GPs and specialists.
I will turn to other aspects of this bill. The parliamentary secretary's second reading speech says:
The bill provides a new safety net whereby the government covers 80 per cent of out-of-pocket expenses to pensioners and Commonwealth concession card holders when their cumulative out-of-pocket expenses for Medicare services are in excess of $500 in a calendar year.
The Labor view is that this is not really practical. What people want is something that really addresses their issues. A lot of people cannot afford those extra costs. We have an expression in Australia now, `the working poor'. Even though the mother and father in a family might be working, sometimes families are overall on a very low income, especially if they are in lower paid jobs—that is, if they are bus drivers, factory workers, cleaners or workers in the retail services industry or hospitality. These families may appear to be all right because both parents are working, but in actual fact their income levels are very low, and some of these people struggle to stay in their private health funds. They have a belief that, somehow, they will be looked after for health and when they go and get treatment their expenses, their ancillary medical costs, will be covered. It is a problem when they are not, and having a threshold of $500 or $1,000 is, in many people's view—including mine and that of many of my colleagues—not really a practical approach to take. We do not see how it will really solve the problem.
Another issue goes to the people who have struggled to stay in private health funds, many of whom are also pensioners. There is a real problem for people, especially if they are doing seasonal or sessional contract work, when they do not get any work for a couple of weeks or months. What do they do when they want to maintain their private health cover? If they drop out, their belief is that they will be penalised by the age clauses and that, when they try to drop back in, they will find themselves having to pay a higher amount. Where is the provision for these people? Some health funds have provision for suspending a membership without penalty, but people have to actually write and ask for that. We are in a society that is moving towards 1300 phone number systems, so people will ring and think that they have done the right thing and that they are going to be covered by a suspension, then find out four months later that they are not when they go to continue paying their membership. There are all these kinds of things—it is about the pattern of people's lives.
When people come to me and ask whether I think they should drop out of their private health fund, I cannot say yes and I cannot say no. The best I can do is send them up the road to the council—the City of Stirling runs a wonderful financial counselling service—and get them to go through their budget and their probable future income over the next 12 months. They have to really look at their household expenses and how they are running their lives to not just make a decision on how they can reorder their spending priorities or organise their lives differently but really examine the future safety and security of their job or their possibilities of getting contract work. They need to be guided by the budget the counselling service draws up and by how affordable private health insurance is. I can never bring myself to say to people, `Drop out; it'll probably be the best thing.'
I am not in a private health fund. I am a strong believer in a strong public health system, and I have often said to people when they approach me with the dilemma they are facing about whether to stay in or stay out that, at the end of the day, if you get run over by a bus on Scarborough Beach Road or have an accident on the beach, the ambulance will take you to the hospital and you will be cared for. We have a good health system here, and I have never seen a case of a person turning up in casualty and being told, `You're not in a private health fund, so therefore we won't operate on your broken leg.' If you go into our public health system, you get looked after. So I feel there is a lot of urban myth and misunderstanding out there about what people think they are buying through a private health fund.
With this legislation, the government take the view that Medicare safety nets are a priority. They call this package MedicarePlus. We have examined it, and we are calling it `MedicareMinus'. That is not a very popular view, but that is what we are calling it because we see problems with it, whether they be the supposed protection of families from out-of-pocket expenses or how it is framed or things such as the regulations which allow the $5 copayment for bulk-billed consultations to take place.
That is another thing that I will touch on lightly. Attaching the issue of the copayment to people eligible for family tax assistance is very problematic. A lot of people do not get it. A lot of people will never apply for it. There are a lot of people who are eligible but who have heard horror stories, and we all know how it is for people lining up at Centrelink. It can take two or three weeks to get an appointment and two or three hours in a queue. A lot of people just find that too onerous and difficult, what with looking after children and running their lives, so they do not go and put themselves on a benefit. This means they are denied some other assistance here because they have not gone and filled out the paperwork and gone through this onerous process there. The whole issue of staffing at Centrelink is problematic also—but that is not an issue for this speech. On the one hand, I support what the government is trying to do. But the greatest flaw with this bill is that it takes away the universality of Medicare.

"Hull, Kay, MP",NATS,2004-02-11,"—I rise to support the Health Legislation Amendment (Private Health Insurance Reform) Bill 2003 and the reforms to private health insurance, which continue this government's efforts to encourage people of all ages to take up health insurance. Basically, I am a great supporter of the private health system, as this government is, because I believe that to be reliant on the state Labor run public health systems now is nothing short of playing Russian roulette. Whilst the staff are generally beyond reproach and deal with a significant amount of work in the best possible way, the system falls dramatically short in resources. And it is so nice to see that the member for Banks is not having so much difficulty with his nodding head just at the moment. It is a long day and a long night for him.
This bill is of paramount importance with regard to ensuring that people recognise what the private health system really offers. I have taken on board the comments of the member for Stirling that the community has not caught up with what we are setting out to achieve. Perhaps I need to provide some substantial evidence in educating the people in my electorate of the Riverina on the benefits they receive from a private hospital system, purely because there is a private health system, so that they can gain an income from that system, in order to run the services right across the region.
My electorate of Riverina is home to just one private hospital. This private hospital continues to provide all the private hospital services which are available to my entire electorate. From Cootamundra right through to Hay, Calvary Private Hospital is responsible for the provision of private hospital services, although many other health services provide necessary care to the people right across that region. Calvary Hospital is a private charitable hospital owned and conducted by the Sisters of the Little Company of Mary. 
Calvary Health Care at Riverina has been providing health services to the Riverina region since 1926 and could not possibly do so if it did not cater for private health insurance patients. It boasts a range of services including a maternity wing, surgical and medical wards, a sleep disorder unit, a high dependency unit and operating theatres. A Department of Veterans' Affairs care coordinator is on staff to ensure that Veterans' Affairs patients receive the highest level of care during their time at Calvary Private Hospital.
Private hospitals see rural and regional areas attracting much needed specialist services. Without those specialist services being able to operate in a private health system, such as that offered by Calvary Private Hospital, we would not attract those specialist services. We in rural and regional areas would again fall far short of our requirements, simply because operating time in public hospitals is now almost non-existent. If people are relying totally on a public health system and they live in a rural or regional area where private hospitals are unavailable to them, the likelihood is that they will be on a waiting list for three, four or five years for a simple hip replacement, knee replacement or significant surgery. They can be assured that they will be waiting for that length of time. 
The private hospital system is filling a much needed and sincere service in all of these areas. As I said, it has attracted all of those specialist services. If specialists wanted to come in and operate in the public hospital system, they could not do it. Operating times have been cut so dramatically by the state Labor governments that there is no ability for specialists to earn an income, so naturally they will stay in the cities where they can do so. But if they have a private hospital which is primarily propped up because of the fact that we have private health insurance, then they will come; they will stay and they will offer rural and regional people the type of health care that they are entitled to. 
One such service I have in mind is the Riverina Cardiovascular and Physiology Centre, which provides state-of-the-art diagnostic and therapeutic services, including digital subtraction, angiography, cardiac catheterisation and vascular imaging services—something that we did not previously have. This is the only unit of its kind in rural Australia. It was brought to the Riverina, to Calvary Private Hospital, by Dr Gerard Carroll, the consulting physician in Wagga Wagga. He is an absolute asset and I cannot praise him highly enough for his determined commitment. He is a Sydney born boy who came out to Wagga Wagga 20-odd years ago, who has delivered technology far in advance of any other centre in Australia. He is delivering that technology in Calvary Private Hospital simply because he has a private hospital in which to deliver it. Thus we in rural and regional Australia are able to access the type of treatment that can be accessed by people who live in the city areas. This is because of the commitment and dedication of one physician, Gerard Carroll, who is absolutely devoted to ensuring the delivery of all health services in rural and regional Australia, and particularly in the Riverina.
Riverina Medical Imaging provides all general radiology services, including ultrasound, CT scanning, MRIs and bone mineral density investigations. These are all done in conjunction with Calvary Private Hospital. The resources of Calvary Private Hospital are able to be utilised because there is a private health system which is viable and has been considered by this government to be of utmost importance. Before Riverina Medical Imaging was set up, my constituents had to travel to Sydney. If the people of the Riverina electorate wanted to have an MRI scan, they booked it six months in advance and had to make the excruciating journey to Sydney by car or by bus. A person with an amazing back condition, or a really difficult problem, went to Sydney. I think the first facility was in Edgecliff and, 10 or 15 years ago, people headed to Sydney, but there were supreme difficulties involved in getting there. Now, in conjunction with the private hospital service, and in conjunction with a positive health service, all these facilities are available in rural and regional Australia. But, without the availability of the infrastructure, it would not be possible to provide these services.
There is a pathology laboratory and collection centre also situated in the grounds of the Calvary Private Hospital. This centre provides pathology services for inpatients and is also a central collection centre for the general community. Two years ago we saw the people of the Riverina go forth with an amazing campaign. They raised over $3 million in order that their own Riverina cancer care centre could be built. That centre is currently in operation, again in the grounds of the Calvary Private Hospital. People right across the region, and into Canberra, can get first-class chemotherapy and radiotherapy at that centre. We have Canberra patients coming in to access treatment. As I said, this centre was established with huge community support and fundraising efforts. I will be eternally grateful to this government for the provision of the health program grant funding to enable this to take place. At the same time, we are raising money for Lilya Lodge, to accommodate all of the people who, unfortunately, have to come into the area to utilise this service. We have the support of the Calvary Private Hospital. This could not be done in a public hospital centre and can I reiterate that it could not be done without a viable private health system.
We also have very great difficulty in attracting GPs. I heard the previous speaker talk about bulk-billing. In my electorate bulk-billing has never been available. In Wagga Wagga we do not have bulk-billing; it just does not take place. In Wagga Wagga we had one doctor per 3,300 patients. That is a significant workload. We had no after-hours support teams. But again, through this government, with a grant of $450,000 we were able to set up an after-hours GP clinic. That was established in the hospital grounds by the Riverina Division of General Practice. We were able to establish that clinic to provide after-hours services so that doctors could get a break and so that we would not lose our GPs because of overwork. That meant that we were able to have doctors working in a practice, hopefully getting privately funded people—private medical benefit funded people—out of the emergency system at the Wagga Wagga Base Hospital. 
Privately funded people were jamming up the public hospital system for people who, as the member for Stirling indicated, cannot afford to pay for private health insurance. They jammed up that public hospital system because there was nobody to go to after hours. Now we can move those privately funded people to a user pays system and get them out of that public system—out of accident and emergency and out of casualty—move them over to this practice in the grounds of the private hospital and relieve the pressure on the state system. It is amazing what you can do with a little bit of forethought, a little bit of vision and a little bit of positiveness about the great benefits that you can provide by ensuring that you have a viable private health system.
—You need to put a little bit of moolah into the public health system.
—Yes, it does take money and, yes, we do spend our money on it. But let us face it: what in life is there that you get for nothing? In this scenario we might find that everybody gets a little bit of nothing because nobody wants to pay for anything. If you have a health system that relies totally on everybody getting a little bit of everything for nothing, you have nothing substantial at all. That is what we would see if the opposition were to put in their health system. I think that the majority of the Australian people recognise this.
Again, as a result of the infrastructure available in a private hospital due to private health insurance, we have O'Connor House, which provides programs for both alcohol detoxification and illicit drug rehabilitation. We have all of those facilities available to us. Peppers, the illicit drug program, is funded under the National Illicit Drugs Strategy and provides a supportive environment for those who want to learn to live drug free. But it is not there for private health insurance patients; it is there for the general community—the general public—so that they in turn get another benefit from having a viable private health system. Calvary Health Care also provides breast screening assessment services for women in southwest New South Wales and north-eastern Victoria—Griffith and Albury. We provide a huge number of important services on the back of a private hospital and a private health system. 
I think we should be proud of Calvary Hospital, which has been ranked the top hospital in Australia, in comparison to hospitals of similar bed size, both public and private. The Calvary Day Procedure Centre has recently been rated in the top 25 per cent of private facilities and in the top 21 per cent of all national facilities. Calvary Hospital was successful late last year in obtaining funding under the bush nursing, small communities and regional private hospitals program for a number of projects. One of these projects was to provide Riverina people with a palliative care consultancy service. Calvary will now move forward and continue to provide its services to patients throughout the region, regardless of whether they are private patients or public patients. That is the spin-off; that is the benefit. That is the benefit of a viable private health system.
The maternity wing at Calvary Hospital services a huge region, with many women travelling up to three hours to deliver their babies in this private hospital, with their private health insurance taking away the stress and strain of the public system when it comes to deliveries and obstetrics. In fact, we had a problem just a year ago when we thought that due to the indemnity crisis Calvary Hospital would shut down and thus shut down its obstetrics services. Is it any wonder that I was absolutely freaking out? If they shut down its delivery services, the state health system could not cope with the extra 800 deliveries from one town a year. It just could not do it. Wagga Wagga Base Hospital could not possibly do it; it could not provide those services and it could not physically cope.
If that happened, we would have to airlift women to Sydney to have a normal delivery. We would have to make up reasons as to why a woman had to be taken from a perfectly reasonable country centre to Sydney to have a perfectly normal birth. I think that is a critical state. We were able to rectify that problem. But if you took away the obstetrics unit at Calvary you would put in jeopardy all of these other services that I have been talking about that have come about purely because of a viable private health system. I would be retracting and pulling services from right across the electorate and from other people's electorates because they are the sorts of services that have come from a very viable private health system. Is it any wonder I stand in this House and continue to say that the private health system—and this government's initiatives in and focus on it—are of paramount importance to the Riverina and me?
I am also continuing to work towards establishing a rural obstetrics training network for the Riverina region—the Riverina-Murray region, in fact—with the assistance of local obstetricians, specialist midwives and health professionals. We do not sit back and wait for it to happen. We actually get up and deliver. We determine what we want and we make it happen. This is a partnership with community, a partnership with doctors, specialists and universities. We put forward viable programs to the minister. Minister Abbott looks at them, sees the valuable role that they would play and in his wisdom says that they are valuable opportunities for us to resolve some of those problems. Again I thank the minister. I think he has made an incredible contribution since he has been the health minister. I think the idea to establish a rural obstetric training network in the region, as I said, came about following my concerns over the possibility of Calvary closing down and no longer being able to provide obstetric services and thus withdrawing all of these other services. 
I decided that we would put together a program aimed at training and delivering rural obstetricians and midwives to see whether we could change the way we practise midwifery and obstetrics in rural communities. That program has been given a lot of credibility. The government has looked at it, accepted it and respected it and it has said, `With New South Wales state health, we will put your plan into practice to see whether it is able to deliver some very good and valuable outcomes'—and I am sure that it will.
Basically, the rural network of communities, doctors and state based public hospitals requires a viable private health system. Without such a system, these private hospitals could not provide services over and beyond what they are funded to provide. These things would not be in existence and available if we did not have a private health insurance system. 
Since being elected in 1996, the Howard-Anderson government has introduced a number of measures to support and encourage the adoption of private health insurance in Australia. Gap cover, Lifetime Health Cover and the 30 per cent health insurance rebate have all gone into play to improve our existence in the Riverina and beyond. If you were to replicate over and over what private hospitals across Australia provide and attract into our communities, you would see the benefit of private health insurance. No opposition member could deny that it is imperative that we continue to support private health insurance in order that these ancillary programs, services and benefits are delivered, particularly in rural and regional areas.
By encouraging the adoption of private health insurance, we can assist in reducing the burden on the public health system—that underresourced and overoperated public health system that we are currently experiencing, particularly in New South Wales. If we continue to encourage people to adopt private health insurance, we will relieve that burden. If Australians utilise private health services for their range of needs, we will ensure that the public health system, resoundingly and warmly welcomed on the opposite side of the House, will be better equipped to assist those who need it most. But to do that, those opposite will have to come a little bit our way in deciding that health services and health systems are absolutely advantaged by the viable private health system that this government is advocating and has put in place in its time in office.",REPS,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE REFORM) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Miscellaneous,7,1,speech
"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2004-02-11,"—Mr Deputy Speaker, you must forgive me for making this initial comment. The previous speaker, the member for Riverina, and I have a totally different understanding of the way the health system works within Australia. She has spoken of the HowardAnderson government's initiative to make Australians accept and adopt private health insurance. I have news for her: people in Australia have been forced to take out private health insurance because of the total failure of the HowardAnderson government to provide adequate health care and services for the people of Australia. 
 (Hon. L.R.S. Price)—Order! The member will not interject while leaving the chamber. 
—Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The previous speaker said that private health insurance is essential for rural and regional areas—and I suspect that she means remote areas also. I have news for the previous speaker, who represents a rural electorate in this parliament: people who live in rural electorates do not have private health insurance; they rely on the public system. To me, that demonstrates that the previous speaker lacks an understanding of the health issues that exist within Australia today.
I found it very interesting to listen to what she had to say. Her underlying philosophy is `you don't get anything for nothing'. She perceives that accessing health care through Medicare is getting something for nothing. Once again I think the previous speaker has drawn that conclusion based upon false assumptions. People pay a Medicare levy and tax; people throughout their lives have contributed to the provision of health care. I believe that one of the things Australians value most is our Medicare system—being able to go to a doctor when you are sick and know that you will get good quality health care and not being put in the position of having to make a decision based on affordability: either going to the doctor or putting food on the table.
Unfortunately under the HowardAnder-son government things have changed somewhat. Medicare as it was when handed to the HowardAnderson government has changed somewhat. It has moved more towards a twotiered system such as the one that exists in the United States: if you have money, you can get the best possible care available; if you have not got money, you are in a very poor position and have to accept a second-class service. I think this is the way the HowardAnderson government would like us to go. To back up what I am saying, I will use the words of the Prime Minister. He has never been committed to Medicare, he is philosophically opposed to Medicare and he has over time said that, unless you are very poor, you should have to pay to go and see a doctor. If you are very poor, the assumption is that you will have access to an inferior health care system—and in listening to the previous speaker you can observe her commitment to and the vigour with which she supports the private system.
The Prime Minister has on many occasions expressed his hatred and dislike of Medicare. When he was the opposition leader in the 1980s he said that Medicare was `miserable', `a cruel fraud', `a scandal', `a total and complete failure', `a quagmire', `a total disaster', `a financial monster' and `a human nightmare'. That is the way the Prime Minister has described Medicare in the past. That is the way he thinks of Medicare. He threatened to pull Medicare apart and get rid of the bulk-billing system. I would argue pretty strongly that that is what he has been doing over the last few years.
The legislation that we are looking at today has resulted from the review of the rules and regulations governing private health insurance. Forgive me if you thought I was speaking about Medicare and the previous speaker's commitment to private health insurance; I am speaking about changes to the private health insurance regulations. It is my understanding that there has been an ongoing review and that further legislation in the future will implement some of the results of the review. This legislation cannot be considered in isolation. We need to look at the overall health system—the way our health system works, the mix of our system and the relationship between public and private.
As I have already demonstrated, this government is philosophically committed to the private health insurance industry, and that has been verified by the contribution of the previous speaker. It poured $2.6 billion into the industry—$2.6 billion that could have been used to deliver health services to Australian people—but, in the last budget, it withdrew $918 million from public hospitals in Australia. 
This government has allowed bulk-billing rates to plummet—the Shortland electorate, which I represent, now has a bulk-billing rate of 51.3 per cent—which is causing great hardship for a number of people. The Shortland electorate is the 10th oldest electorate in Australia, which means that we have a lot of elderly people who need to be able to see a doctor when they are sick. There is an average gap of $10 between what the doctor charges and what the pensioner is required to pay. This is really hurting people. These are real people that have to look at whether they can afford to go to the doctor. In the last three years there has been a decline of over 30 per cent in the bulk-billing rate in the Shortland electorate. In the adjoining electorate of Dobell on the Central Coast, there has been a decline of 34.2 per cent—their bulk-billing rate is now down to 58.2 per cent.
This is not good enough. People are finding it harder and harder to see a doctor; they just cannot afford it. There is also a chronic doctor shortage. Providing access to services through the private sector is not going to do anything to encourage doctors to relocate to regional and rural areas where there is a shortage. On the Central Coast of New South Wales, people are waiting between seven and 14 days to get an appointment with their doctor. The changes that this government has made to the mix of the public and the private health system within Australia—changes to the Medicare system and ripping funds out of the public sector and directing them towards the private sector—have done nothing to correct this problem: we still have a decline in the bulk-billing rates and we still have sick people being unable to see their doctor when they need to.
This government pours dollar after dollar into the private health insurance industry, whilst, on the other hand, people who look to government for care and support are having their needs ignored. It is an absolute disgrace. I call on the government to put aside its philosophical commitment to private health insurance and its commitment to the private sector and to make a commitment to all Australian people. It should ensure that every Australian can afford to see and get an appointment with their doctor when they are sick. Until that happens, the government is failing the Australian people. It is failing to ensure that they get the health care they deserve when they are sick and that they have paid for over the time of their employment.
The decline in bulk-billing has caused enormous problems for the states. People are unable to see a doctor when they are sick because of the decline in bulk-billing and are forced to seek health care within the public hospital system. They are attending the accident emergency departments. We read in the papers over the Christmas period that people were being turned away from accident and emergency departments. Why? The answer is that they cannot afford to go and see a doctor because their doctor no longer bulk-bills, so they are forced to go along to their local hospital where they have to wait for up to five hours. An enormous workload has been pushed onto our public hospitals because of this federal government's failure to act in the interests of Australian people. The government stands condemned for its failure to look after the Australian people and to ensure that they  have adequate health care.

Does the Prime Minister acknowledge that the measure of a civilised society is how we look after our senior citizens, and in Australia right now they need a national dental program?

"Howard, John, MP",LP,2004-02-11,"—The issue raised by the Leader of the Opposition is a classic example of how, within the Australian federation at the present time, states are asserting rights but abdicating responsibilities. The Leader of the Opposition is very big on talking about the rights and responsibilities of all sorts of people in the community. I want to talk about both the rights and the responsibilities of states. In advancing this argument, I draw upon the words of the most recently successful Labor leader, Peter Beattie, when he said on the Sunday program that, courtesy of the GST—which he opposed—he had enough money to fund an early childhood education program. The sort of thing that the Leader of the Opposition is speaking about is historically and manifestly a state responsibility. In the GST, we established a method of providing the states with a growth source of revenue. It is the states' responsibility and, unless we are going to tear up the whole federal compact, it is about time the states of this country accepted their responsibility as well as asserting their rights.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Health: Dental Services</title>,Questions Without Notice,8,1,answer
"Mr HOWARD,MP",LP,2004-02-11,"—Mr Speaker, I seek the indulgence of the chair to add to an answer.
—The Prime Minister may proceed.
—The member for Lalor asked me a question about the minority report of the government members on the Senate inquiry into MedicarePlus. When the question was asked, I had not seen the report but, since then, I have had an opportunity of looking briefly at the government senators' dissenting report—it dissents in a number of areas. The thrust of the question asked by the member for Lalor was to imply in some way that the government members agreed with Labor's criticism of the safety net.
Opposition members interjecting—
—I can only repeat that that was the thrust of the question. Can I read something from the report, Mr Speaker?
—The Prime Minister has the call. The Prime Minister can add to the answer and that includes reading from the report. He cannot, of course, add to the argument.
—The report, in two sections, makes the point that I made a moment ago. It is talking here about the out-of-pocket expenses. It says:
The measure—
that is the safety net—
not only includes medical expenses of GPs and specialists but diagnostics expenses such as pathology, radiology, psychiatric, tissue biopsy, radiotherapy and pap smears.
It goes on to say:
Importantly, the expenses associated with these services have by far been responsible for the largest increases in costs to patients since 1984-85.
It then goes on to say:
Labor rejects such assistance. Its near obsessive concern with the bulk-billing rate overlooks the fact that, even if 100 per cent of general practitioners bulk-billed all their patients, those with chronic conditions or severe episodes of sickness would still be faced with high out-of-pocket costs which the government package is designed to address.

"Emerson, Craig, MP",ALP,2004-02-11,"—In the last few days, the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, the Minister for Trade and the Minister for Foreign Affairs have been lauding this trade deal with the United States as a great deal for Australia. They have been saying that this is a fantastic deal for Australia. It is a deal that runs to 500 pages, and this government expects the Australian Labor Party and the Australian people to give it a big tick on the basis of a 500-page document which we have not seen. The government is saying that we should give it the big tick on the basis of trust. Why would we trust a government that falsely and maliciously claimed that asylum seekers threw their children overboard? Why would we trust a government that claimed that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction? Why would we trust a government that said there would be no $100,000 university fees? Why would you trust a government that said that Medicare is for all of us? Why would you trust a Prime Minister who said he would never ever introduce a GST?
In the time I have today I want to go through some of the economic modelling behind this trade deal, because this government will not do it. Instead it relies on one study by the Centre for International Economics, a report that it commissioned, a report that government ministers time and time again have quoted, saying that this trade deal with the United States would be worth $4 billion to Australia. That is absolutely false. It is not even what the study claimed. What happened is that, under assumptions that were given to the Centre for International Economics by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the study came up with a figure of $A4 billion at the exchange rates at that time. The problem is that, with the exchange rate now at 78c, that $4 billion has disappeared down to just a little over $2 billion. Of course, that is with full free trade. But sugar alone is worth much of that $2 billion. And what is the situation in relation to sugar? Not one grain of sugar extra will be going into the United States—not even a grain! My colleague the shadow minister for agriculture will be following what I have to say in relation to sugar and the shame of completely excluding sugar from this deal.
Of course another large component of that $2 billion was beef, and now we have most of the liberalisation for the beef industry out in the never-never for up to 18 years. A third impact of the deal is that most of the benefit was estimated from Australia cutting its own tariffs. We do not need a trade deal with the United States to cut our own tariffs. Indeed, this government has already announced that automotive tariffs are going to fall. That itself reduces the $2 billion even further. So this figure of $4 billion, which the government in the Senate as late as yesterday was sticking by, is shonky.
We have heard from the Washington Post, which has already said that this deal is a win for protectionist sentiments in the United States. It is clear that we have done worse than the countries of Central America insofar as agriculture is concerned. But it is not just the Washington Post that we should rely upon. Have a look at this report, which is by ACIL Consulting. It was commissioned by a government agency. When I became aware that the government had commissioned this report, I asked for a copy through the Senate estimates processes and we were refused. We were refused access to that report until I went through the formal process of an FOI request and then the report was released. Why would the government, for months and months, suppress this report by ACIL Consulting? The answer is quite clear. If you read the report it comes to conclusions such as this, `That an FTA with the US, even if fully achieved, would leave Australians as a whole worse off.' So that is why you suppressed the report, Minister, because this report estimates that even a pure trade deal with the United States—a pure free trade deal, including all of agriculture—would leave Australians worse off. That is why this report was suppressed. One of the directors of ACIL Consulting, Mr David Trebeck, earlier this year argued that:
Australia would become a `laughing stock' if it signed up to a deal which appeared to have little benefit (and only over an extended period) and it should never be forgotten that the World Trade Organisation was the main game on trade policy. 
So the government has ignored all of that from ACIL and Mr Trebeck; in fact, the government has tried to suppress it.
Here is some more evidence that the government would not like to have had in the public domain, but it is out there, and it is evidence by the Productivity Commission—the government's own main economic agency. It produced a staff working paper, Trade and investment effects of preferential trading arrangements—Old and new evidence. It says that of the 18 recent trade agreements examined in detail, 12 have diverted more trade from non-members than they have created among members. That is what the Productivity Commission concluded. Of course, the government never refers to that report. There is a further report from the Productivity Commission and that was a submission to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on Australia's approach to forthcoming trade negotiations. That report contained the reference that, as it enters a new round of multilateral trade negotiations, Australia needs to guard against entering preferential trade deals that contain extensive exclusions for sensitive sectors for the following reasons. One of the reasons given by the Productivity Commission is, `They would likely not be in our economic interests.' The key advisory agency to the government on trade and economic matters, the Productivity Commission, said that these preferential trade deals would likely not be in our economic interest. What modelling has the government done? The answer of course, when the minister responds, will be zero. The minister is saying, `Take us on trust, because we have a 500-page document, we have signed it and the Australian people and the Australian Labor Party should take this government on trust.' They have done no independent economic modelling. If they have, I challenge the minister to table the results of that modelling in the parliament today. I now want to move on to Professor Ross Garnaut.
—Hawke's economic adviser.
—The foreign minister laughs about Professor Ross Garnaut's expertise. But of course that puts him completely at odds with the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister said of Professor Ross Garnaut—a former ambassador to China and also author of the seminal report, Australia and North East Asian Ascendancy—in relation to another matter, `I saw Mr Garnaut's comments and I have a lot of respect for Ross Garnaut.' Has the Prime Minister seen Professor Garnaut's comments yesterday on the trade deal with the United States where Professor Garnaut described the deal as `poor' and Australia's trade problems as `dreadful'? Professor Garnaut also makes this crucial point: `For the first time Australia has conceded the legitimacy of significant agricultural exclusions.' This is critical because this government has said that it is okay to sign preferential trade deals that exclude major sectors of agriculture. 
A funny thing happened on the way to Cancun in Mexico: we lost the leadership of the Cairns Group of fair trading nations. The Labor Party in government established the Cairns Group of fair trading nations in Port Douglas in 1986. I was there when John Dawkins did it. That has been a powerful third force in the global round of trade negotiations—the Uruguay round—and it can be and should be a powerful third force in the current negotiations for the Doha round. But we have lost the leadership of the Cairns Group. Not only that but we have lost credibility in the Cairns Group. Why? Because we have cut a side deal with the United States to the exclusion of the Cairns Group because they are not part of that deal. How can we be taken seriously when the Australian government says to the Cairns Group, `We want to negotiate a good deal with the World Trade Organisation in the Doha round,' when we have cut a separate preferential deal with the United States?
Professor Garnaut further warned in December 2002:
The end result of continuing naively down the paths upon which Australia and, with more reluctance, China have carelessly trod, would be eventually membership of different trading blocs, within a greatly weakened multilateral trading system.
What Professor Garnaut is warning about is that the Chinese have observed our appetite for preferential trade deals. They do not want to be left out, so they are now entering into preferential trade deals with the countries of ASEAN, and they have already started the negotiations. Crucially, they have agreed to early harvest giving preferential access to its markets for agricultural products from the ASEAN countries. This is a devastating blow to Australia, a blow that is essentially unreported; and a blow that this minister seems to be proud of.
The minister needs to explain why he has entered into these preferential deals, leaving us in such a vulnerable position that ultimately could create a trading bloc in East Asia, to which we will not be entrants. We will not be partners in that trading bloc in East Asia, and we will have to go to the United States—on terms determined by the United States, Canada and Mexico—to seek to form a trading bloc with the United States. That would be a horrendous outcome for Australian trade. 
We had a short debate about the IMF report. The minister said, `Yes, but there is some saving clause in relation to investment.' Let us give the IMF the last word, and to give them the last word we should go to the last page of the report, which says:
... and finally benefits to FTA participants could be substantially reduced if sensitive sectors such as agriculture are excluded from bilateral liberalisation. Where there is insufficient complementarity in trade structure between FTA partners, such exclusions could ultimately result in overall welfare losses.
Here is the IMF warning Australia that we could be entering a deal that, if it has exclusions, could result in overall lower living standards for the Australian people. It already had estimated the impact on Australia of a trade deal that included full liberalisation of agriculture, and it concluded that it was a small negative—that is, it would result in a small reduction in Australian living standards. But once you start excluding major agricultural products like sugar and once the liberalisation in relation to beef and dairy is so weak and paltry, then of course that small negative can become a very large negative. But this government says the IMF is the fount of all wisdom in relation to Australia, except when a report is produced by the IMF that raises the very real spectre that this deal would be bad for Australia.
The government says that criticism of the trade deal with the United States is protectionist and anti-American. Are the authors of these reports a bunch of protectionists? Are they anti-American? ACIL Consulting produced the first report to which I referred, and David Trebeck is a director of ACIL Consulting. Is the Productivity Commission a bunch of protectionists? Are they anti-American? Is Professor Ross Garnaut a protectionist? Is Professor Ross Garnaut anti-American? And is the International Monetary Fund protectionist? Is it anti-American? The answer of course is no, but this government is trying to pin on the Labor Party and anyone who dares to criticise a trade deal running to 500 pages, that we are supposed to agree to sight unseen, as anti-American and protectionist. That criticism is completely unfounded. There has been no objective government assessment of the net benefit or the net costs of this trade deal. The government has signed it anyway. It is done like a dinner in relation to agriculture, as pointed out by the Washington Post.
Remember that the United States has said that the signing of the farm bill a couple of years ago was essential to give it fast-track authority to do these preferential trade deals with countries like Australia. So we have a farm bill that is heavily protectionist, but it was said that that was a necessary evil so that we can have this trade deal with the United States, which excludes major agricultural products. It also said at the time, `We need to impose steel tariffs on Australia and other countries so that the President can get fast-track authority.' That hurt Australia too, and all for what? A deal that respected economists and the IMF are suggesting may well produce a reduction in Australian living standards. That is an extremely high price to pay for a deal that could be costly for Australians.
Is it any wonder then that this Minister for Trade has presided over 20 successive trade deficits? Is it any wonder that the minister has presided over a decline in exports in each of the last three years—a feat not even achieved in the Great Depression? Is it any wonder that he has presided over a contraction in Australia's market share in Asia and Europe, that he has presided over the worst trade deficit on record, that he has presided over the worst current account on record, and that he has presided over the worst foreign debt on record, which has doubled in just eight years? With the Aussie dollar at US78c and in the complete absence of a trade strategy, there is no end in sight to this succession of trade deficits. The minister has betrayed Australian farmers, he has shattered Australia's free trade credentials, he has lost all credibility in arguing in the World Trade Organisation for reductions in European and Japanese agricultural trade barriers, and he has lost all credibility in the Cairns Group. Instead of boasting about his humiliation, the minister should hang his head in shame. Finally, this minister has achieved one more record: the worst trade minister in Australia's history.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Trade: Free Trade Agreement</title>,Matters of Public Importance,13,1,speech
"Vaile, Mark, MP",NATS,2004-02-11,"—In responding to this matter of public importance today—and it is a matter of public importance—all Australians should recognise the opportunities that are now being presented to them as a result of the negotiation of the free trade agreement with the United States. That goes without question. The more average Australians on the street see the reality of the benefits that are being presented to them with the agreement the more they will realise and understand the importance of what the government has been about by pursuing the trade policy that we have pursued in the multilateral arena, and by seeking shorter term benefits up-front that we need in our community in bilateral negotiations. It is a great philosophical argument that the member for Rankin has just run but that argument is not delivering benefits and opportunities to Australian exporters.
I remind the member for Rankin that this government was elected to office in 1996. In 1996 Australia's exports totalled $99 billion. Two years ago that reached $154 billion. It is a long way from $99 billion in 1996 to where it stands today. He was complaining about some of the economic credentials of this government. This government has delivered the lowest levels of unemployment for decades—a far cry from the 11 per cent that was presided over by the Labor Party, when they had their 13 years in office. You will also remember the greatest legacy that the Australian Labor Party in government left the Australian people: the highest interest rates this country ever had to endure. And that was not as a result of fate; it was the result of the policies and management of the Labor Party in government. So the member for Rankin need not criticise this government's economic credentials—and he does that with a great deal of hide—when many Australians can still remember exactly what the former Hawke and Keating governments did in terms of the impact on the Australian economy from high interest rates and higher levels of unemployment.
—The member for Corio interjects. Six per cent is a long way from 11 per cent. The member for Rankin bases his argument on the long-held policy viewpoint that we should put all our eggs in the multilateral basket and wait for it to happen, and for a long time Australia has done that. For a long time many other countries that have deeply engaged in achieving an outcome in the multilateral system have done exactly the same thing. We have not given up and it remains this government's No. 1 trade policy objective to achieve an outcome in the multilateral arena. But should we in this country stand by and tell our exporters, `You're going to have to wait for the next five or 10 years until we get a result in the multilateral system before you can improve your position in different markets of the world'? Should we stand by and let other countries negotiate bilateral agreements with major economies like America, China and the South-East Asian economies? Should we stand by and let other countries negotiate those agreements and get faster and deeper access into those markets ahead of our exporters? Our view is that we should not.
It goes back to the disappointment of the outcome of the Seattle meeting of the WTO when we did not successfully launch a round of multilateral trade negotiations. Many countries were disappointed at that, and many countries discussed then the opportunities of using bilateral negotiations to inject momentum and competitiveness into the overall trading system. It was at that point that we took the decision that we would engage a number of our major trading partners in South-East Asia, and we did that. We completed an agreement with Singapore, and we engaged with and completed an agreement with Thailand. The Australian Labor Party is not objecting to those agreements that we completed. The same policy principles that were applied to those negotiations can be applied to the negotiations we have undertaken with the United States of America.
We have engaged comprehensively with the United States of America. We have achieved significant gains with this agreement in what we can provide. We have achieved market access for the manufactured goods sector and the elimination of tariffs across so many areas. We have achieved it in the services sector and we have achieved it in the area of government procurement. Just out of interest, the member for Rankin referred to quite a few econometric studies and reports that have thrown up all sorts of figures and, to my knowledge, none of them has included access to the government procurement market in the United States in their analysis. We have designated country status out of this agreement to a market worth $200 billion a year. I know it was not in the CIE report—the report that the government refers to often. We need to take all of those issues into account when assessing the balance of benefits that are presented to Australia as a nation and as an economy and when we make our decision about this agreement that we have negotiated.
It is interesting to note that the member for Rankin also referred to a Productivity Commission report. The Productivity Commission produced a report and recommendation to government that we should abolish a whole range of what they called nuisance tariffs. This is going back a few years, but there was a whole range of tariffs and the government had not implemented that recommendation. If we had abolished them then on the advice and recommendation of the Productivity Commission, we would not have had them to negotiate away and get a better deal now. We did that; we used them to buy a better deal for our manufacturing industry's access to the biggest and most dynamic market in the world. We have done that for a broad range of manufacturing industries in Australia—for the automotive sector, the manufacturing sector, chemical goods and the like.
The member for Rankin made the standard comments with regard to agriculture. I repeat again that, on entry into force, 66 per cent of the tariff lines on agriculture will be reduced to zero. We did not achieve the outcome we would have liked on sugar. We have been up front and honest about that. We could not convince the Americans on that. The government was faced with a very difficult decision. It will be interesting to hear from the next speaker who will say that they—they being the Labor Party—would be prepared to deny the beef industry, the dairy industry, the horticultural industry, the automotive sector and the services sector up front and open access to a market worth billions of dollars because it was not complete and because they wanted to stand on that policy principle.
The member for Rankin made comments about the Cairns Group and exclusions. I think that if he made a close analysis of a number of the countries in the Cairns Group that have participated in bilateral and regional trade agreements he would find that a lot of those have exclusions. CAFTA excluded agricultural products. With NAFTA, the Canadians completely excluded the dairy industry. You will find that right across the Cairns Group. It does not diminish or weaken our resolve for the multilateral system. Nor does it weaken the resolve of any of the countries who are members of the Cairns Group, who have the same aims and objectives of pursuing the three pillars in the multilateral system of cracking open market access in the highly protected markets of the world, particularly the US, Japan and the European Union, of significantly reducing with a view to abolishing the distorting aspect of domestic support—the member for Rankin referred to the farm bill—and, of course, of export subsidies, the worst distortion of all that is levelled at the free trading agricultural producing countries of the world, mostly by the European Union. We still hold those objectives very strongly. 
There is a Cairns Group meeting in two weeks that I will be chairing—we are still the chair of the Cairns Group, so the member for Rankin need not worry about that—and we will be laying that down very clearly when we have other members of the WTO come to participate in that discussion. The Director-General of the WTO will be there, as will Ambassador Zoellick from the United States, and we will deliver that very clear message. We have actually launched the next round of the WTO negotiations. We achieved that in Doha. That is still alive; that is still going. We have the opportunity to deal with a lot of these issues multilaterally now if we are to conclude these negotiations in the given time frame. 
The member for Rankin ran the usual line that, by doing a deal with the United States and negotiating with them, somehow that was going to diminish our ability to do business in Asia and that it was going to diminish our opportunities with China. Far from being the truth, it is exactly the opposite. We have negotiated an agreement with Singapore, with Thailand, and the ASEANs in complete—that was the CEP agreement with the 10 ASEAN countries. When the President of China was here at the end of last year, we announced that we were going to embark upon a scoping study to negotiate a free trade agreement with China. China engaged Australia at that level knowing full well that we were negotiating this deal with the United States of America.
I think it is a bit rich that the Labor Party get up and make claims in this debate this afternoon, particularly on the basis that this deal is not in the national interest. There is no doubt that this deal is overwhelmingly in the national interest. I know that it could have been better—we are the first to admit that—but just remember that when I went to Washington to negotiate this deal I had a very clear mandate from the government and the industries that wanted an outcome. I also had a very clear mandate in terms of public comment on a number of areas to defend as far as the Australian people and public policy were concerned. We came home with all of those areas intact, such as the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, the audiovisual sector, labour, the environment and the STEs—one of the most important areas. I might add that the Labor Party, in their positional statement on this, did not even say that STEs had to be protected. Yet the member for Corio will get up and make large about the fact they have not been absolutely protected. Well, they have in this agreement, because I sat there as we negotiated that. The Labor Party did not have the state trading enterprises on their wish list. We certainly did and we had to stare the Americans down on that.
The other area that the Labor Party made a great play about is the noninclusion of the investor-state dispute settlement mechanism, which has been a feature of American free trade agreements in the past. It was one of the Americans' objectives in this negotiation to have the investor-state dispute settlement mechanism as part of this agreement. It is one thing that we would not agree on. In our broad consultation with them prior to embarking upon this negotiation, every single state government—all Labor governments—said, `We can't have this in the agreement. We won't accept this agreement if the investor-state dispute settlement mechanism is in there.' Guess what. We defended that position as well. It is not in there. The member for Rankin needs to recognise that negotiations in trade agreements are a two-way street. There are offensive positions and defensive positions and you have to act on both when you are engaged in negotiations.
We say that this will deliver enormous benefits over time to the Australian economy. This is an opportunity for the Australian economy to be in lock step with the largest and most dynamic economy in the world. It is one that is developing the high-value services sector, the IT sector, the ICT sector and the intellectual property sector. That is what we need to do with our economy at the same time. We need to put our agricultural industries on a growth path that they can work to so that they can increase their opportunities. The shadow spokesman criticised the deal on beef by saying that it was going to take 18 years to get any benefit. That is absolutely incorrect. As I said in question time, $22 million worth of tariffs come off on day one of entry into force of the agreement. Then the quota is increased on a sliding scale, ahead of Australia's ability to fill that quota. On rare occasions, as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, we already send 378,000 tonnes of beef to the United States. In this new arrangement we will continue to increase the quota above that to ensure that there is growing capacity for the Australian beef industry. We have an enormous lift in market access opportunities for the dairy industry in the first year on entry into force of the agreement.
It is interesting to note that the Labor Party, in comments in the media, have set out a number of tests for this agreement before they will support it. They are interesting to run through. The first one: is it in the national interest? Overwhelmingly, of course it is in the national interest because of the benefits that are on offer today and the advantage it will give to the Australian economy. Will it deliver significant and comprehensive benefits to agriculture? The answer is yes: billions of dollars worth of growth into the US market over time. Will it deliver significant employment and investment gains for manufacturing and service industries? Of course it will, in absolute terms, with the 97 per cent removal of tariffs on both sides. Will it not undermine essential health and education, including the PBS? We have protected them in this agreement.
—You wait till you get an opportunity in JSCOT to scrutinise the document. They next asked: will it not undermine the capacity to protect the future delivery of local content? Absolutely. That is what we have achieved in this agreement. Will it not undermine sovereignty and expose us to legal challenge by US firms? Absolutely not. The investor-state dispute settlement mechanism is not in this agreement. Will it undermine Australia's position in the WTO and APEC? Of course it will not. We will continue to lead the Cairns Group of countries in the WTO.

"O'Connor, Gavan, MP",ALP,2004-02-11,"—The ink is hardly dry on this so-called free trade agreement with the US and key industries in the rural sector are coming to understand that they have been dudded by the Howard government in this agreement. The Prime Minister told this nation that this agreement was `a once in a decade chance to collar some real trading gains in the national interest'. The Prime Minister has defined Australia's national interest without including one of Australia's great rural industries, the sugar industry. Every cane grower in the states of Queensland, New South Wales and Western Australia ought to understand that the Prime Minister of this country defines the national interest without them being included.
The unseemly haste to stitch up this deal has confirmed what we on this side of the House, and many other Australians, already know about the Howard government. The Howard government is led by a Prime Minister who is now known as `Bonsai John', the member for Bennelong. In the second row, we have two great pillars of support for the Prime Minister: the Deputy Prime Minister and the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party. The former Labor Prime Minister got it right when he said that they are two shivers waiting for spines to run up. Following the signing of this deal, the Minister for Trade and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry have joined the conga line. I thought it was going to end there, but when the Minister for Foreign Affairs entered the debate today in question time, with that fawning sycophancy, I came to know that there are now three people who have joined the conga line.
Since the announcement of this free trade agreement, in the sugar industry, in rural Queensland, there is dismay and a deep sense of betrayal because the Howard government has dropped this industry off the table. Members might recall that the Prime Minister of this country, in talking about Medicare—and I use the Prime Minister's words—said that he was going to `stab Medicare in the stomach'. I will now use the words of the member for Kennedy, who said `the Prime Minister has stabbed the sugar industry in the back'. The Prime Minister has become the Judas Iscariot of the Australian sugar industry. He talks about a new compensation package for the industry and he naively believes that, by holding out 30 pieces of silver to the sugar industry, canegrowers will forget the terrible betrayal that has been visited upon them by this government. Canegrowers have been thrown off the negotiating table not because it is in Australia's interests but because it is in the political interests of the current American president.
The member for Rankin has explained how this particular agreement fails some very significant trading tests. This agreement does represent a failure of the government's agriculture trading strategy. This is not a free trade agreement, because it is not comprehensive. It contains substantial exclusions and does not remove quotas and tariffs. The deal does undermine Australia's position in the Doha round.
Our opponents in these multilateral negotiations have always argued that agriculture is a special product in international trade. We have always resisted that argument from the high moral ground of consistency in our policy approach. By the trade minister agreeing with the US that agriculture is a special product, the minister and this government have undermined our international trading position on agriculture in multilateral negotiations in the future, they have weakened our leadership of the Cairns Group, and they have squandered hard-fought-for trading capital built up by farmers over a long period for the sake of a political deal to save the neck of the American president. The minister and this government have strengthened the hands of the Japanese and the Europeans, as they seek to maintain protection for their agricultural sectors.
Australian farmers in big industries, such as wheat, beef, dairy, sugar and wool, know that the big gains across the board come only when breakthroughs are made in multilateral trade forums. They now know that this Prime Minister and his government, in a sell out of their economic interests to preserve the American president's political interests, have greatly diminished their future chances to stitch up a multilateral deal that meets their overall need for market access.
What did the Prime Minister, government ministers and members say publicly about this deal? The Prime Minister insisted that the government was interested only in a comprehensive free trade agreement. We now know that that was a deception on Australian agriculture. He then said bluntly—this is the doozey of them all—that, without free access for Australian farmers to American markets such as sugar, beef and dairy, the deal did not stack up. That was another deception. The Deputy Prime Minister said that it would be `un-Australian' to stitch up a deal without sugar. That was his deception. The member for Lindsay—
 (Hon. I.R. Causley)—The member for Lowe is out of his place and is therefore disorderly!
—said `it is either a deal on sugar or it is no deal'. The member for Leichhardt said, when talking about the trade minister:
Given Mark's very, very strong stated position on this issue I think they—the sugar growers—can take heart that the Australian government is totally behind them.
It was behind them all right—with the knife—ready to slip it into their backs at the first opportunity, when the first shots were fired in this debate. The trade minister said:
We've always said that we are pursuing a comprehensive agreement here with the US that covers all sectors and within sectors, particularly within the agricultural sector on sugar, beef and dairy.
What a deception that was. You can always tell when you have done a good deal by the reaction of your opponents across the table. If they squeal like stuck pigs, then you know you have secured something substantial for your own producers. The National Milk Producers Federation said—
—The member for Corangamite!
—that the pact with Australia preserves most of the existing dairy tariff structure. They said:
We did achieve an important goal, which was no reduction in US high-tier, above quota, tariffs.
That is what milk producers had to say. The representative for US sugar producers praised the US negotiators for their handling of the sugar aspect in the agreement. She said:
It clearly demonstrates that an FTA can be successfully concluded without market access provisions on sugar and should serve as a template for all future FTA negotiations.
That is a great free-trading nation! But this is the doozey: you might have seen the agriculture minister get up here lauding the fact that, in avocados, we gained a 4,000 tonne access. This is what the manager of SP Exports, Andrew Philip, had to say:
It appears the 4,000 tonne avocado quota was specific to certain times of the year, when district growers had no fruit on their trees.
Please clarify that! The one on tomatoes is even better. They had this to say: `Access for tomatoes had already been negotiated before the talks in Washington took place.' They had been negotiated before it took place! I hope the avocados are on the tree when they get the 4,000-tonne access. You have betrayed wheat growers on the single desk. You know it, and the wheat growers of Australia know it.

"Hunt, Gregory, MP",LP,2004-02-11,"—A half-century ago the Australian Labor Party opposed the JapanAustralia trade agreement when then Deputy Prime Minister McEwen negotiated it on Australia's behalf. A half-century later we see that that folly has been repeated. We would not have believed that they would have taken the same step. This free trade agreement with the United States—the US FTA—is about three things: jobs for Australian workers, income for Australians and living standards for Australian families. Families benefit, both as income earners because of the additional amount that they can bring in and as consumers due to their additional capacity to purchase goods.
In looking at those things, we see an Australian Labor Party which is turning its back on all of those benefits. The extraordinary argument that they put is that even though there are all of these benefits we should turn our back on them. They say we should turn our back on Australian producers, on Australian workers and on Australian farmers. They will not accept one of these benefits, because they think it is a poor agreement. That is what they say.
So we see that with a multibillion dollar benefit to the beef industry over the next 18 years, with a multibillion dollar annual benefit to the Australian economy, with arguably the biggest advance in Australia's agricultural and manufacturing exports to a single market in Australian history, their response is to say, `No, we do not support this; we do not support these benefits to the Australian economy.'
Two great questions were posed to the Leader of the Opposition on the response that he and the Labor Party would make in relation to the US free trade agreement: what is their general approach to opposition, and what are their beliefs? The question on the approach was a simple one: would they adopt a constructive or a destructive approach? What we have seen is the approach of a destructive wrecker. I had hoped genuinely, as had many others, that this agreement would be welcomed because it means jobs for Australian families: jobs for workers in the horticultural, agricultural, mining, manufacturing and service sectors—real jobs, real income and real benefits to Australia. But they chose to take the position of the destructive wrecker. That is the position that they have taken.
Secondly, the great test for the Leader of the Opposition is: what are his beliefs? Does he believe in an open Australia or a closed Australia? This was the first real test, and the decision taken by the Leader of the Opposition was for a closed Australia. He preached a philosophy, before becoming Leader of the Opposition, of economic growth and of benefit. And then on the first occasion at which he is called to account he chooses to pursue a closed Australia and says that an excellent agreement, because it does not contain some things, should be thrown out.
There are three conclusions from that. Firstly, the Labor Party say, `No new jobs in the auto sector.' They turn their backs on jobs in the auto sector for component manufacturers and jobs for steel makers in areas such as Hastings and Somerville who work at BlueScope Steel. They say, `No new jobs in the lamb and sheep sectors.' Yet all of these sectors benefit. They say, `No new jobs in horticulture.'
Secondly, there is ludicrous logic here. The logic is this: even though the trade agreement brings enormous benefits over time in dairy, beef, steel, wine and horticulture—all of these different sectors—because it does not do so in sugar we will not take any of the jobs. The logic here is extraordinary. `Because it does not go as far as we would ultimately like, we will reject it all out of hand. We will beggar the communities who rely on each of those exports. We will hurt those industries.'
The third conclusion is that I do not believe they believe in what they are doing. I do not believe for a moment that they believe in the honesty of this position. I will make this prediction today: before the year is out the Labor Party will have been forced to reverse their position and will support the free trade agreement. I predict that by the time of the election the Labor Party will be supporting—albeit with hand-wringing angst—the free trade agreement, because their position is illogical, unsustainable and fails to stack up to the test of national interest.
We also hear from them about the question of multilateralism versus bilateralism. I offer three very simple examples: firstly, the $30 billion trade deal for gas with China, with a potential additional $25 billion deal to be considered; secondly, the free trade agreement with Singapore—so much for being unable to deal with Asia; and thirdly, the free trade agreement with Thailand. In addition to those, there are the potential framework agreements with China and Japan.
So what are the practical benefits as well as the protections that this free trade agreement brings? For our manufacturers, it means that over 97 per cent of our exports to the United States, worth $5.8 billion a year, will be duty free from day one. That will have an enormous impact. Secondly, we will have access to the US federal government procurement market, something which was never calculated or expected. That still has to be added into the benefits that the Australian economy and Australian workers and families will receive. The US government procurement market is worth $270 billion a year.
Thirdly, the 25 per cent tariff on light commercial vehicles that previously kept Australian utes out of the US market will be removed immediately. What that means is jobs, jobs and jobs for workers in the automotive, component and steel sectors. For BlueScope Steel, it helps secure their future both as a supplier to Australian auto makers and also as a supplier directly into the US system because of the removal of threats under section 201. In addition, our auto parts exports, worth $310 million in 2002, will have tariffs eliminated immediately. The 50 per cent tariff barrier in relation to ship repairs will be gone: gone, gone, gone. Again, that was something we had not expected. It had not been calculated. For our farmers and for our food processors, twothirds of Australian agricultural tariffs will go to zero immediately.
The Leader of the Opposition—in the national interest—would turn his back on the twothirds of the agricultural sector which will benefit overnight. In four years the tariffs of an additional nine per cent will go to zero. So three-quarters of the Australian agriculture export sector will benefit—and those opposite say no to jobs in those three-quarters and jobs in each of those sectors. Do you really believe in what you are doing? I do not think so. I do not think for a moment that if our positions were reversed you would say no to these things. I just do not think it is credible. I do not think those opposite believe in the position they are taking and I believe that they will have to reverse it.
The beef quota, currently at 378,000 tonnes, will be substantially increased, growing by 18½ per cent over 18 years. That will have a real impact; there will be benefits immediately. In addition, lamb and sheep meat producers will have most tariffs reduced to zero immediately. So for manufacturers and abattoir companies, such as Tabro Meats at Lance Creek, there are real jobs and real workers who will benefit from this. I challenge the member for Rankin: go to workers at Tabro Meats, who will benefit from this, and say `Sorry, we're rejecting the benefits.' This is my challenge for the member for Corio, the member for Rankin and the Leader of the Opposition: go to the workers at Tabro Meats and BlueScope Steel and go to the winemakers on the Mornington Peninsula; go to any one of them and say that you are going to reject the benefits that would flow to them. 
—The member for Corio was heard in silence and I expect the same courtesy to be extended to the member who is speaking now.
—As for the sugar industry, the point is very simple.
—If the member for Corio ignores the chair, he will be put out of the chamber.
—Of course we would have liked to have included them. We got an extraordinary amount in, but the fact that we did not get that in does not mean that you turn your back on all of those things. Whether it is meat processing, farming, horticulture or steel making, your message to the workers in each of those sectors is `Go to hell.' That is your message to workers in those sectors. You should be ashamed of yourselves, because you do not believe what you are saying.
—The member will refer to other members by their seats.
—The member for Corio, the member for Rankin and the Leader of the Opposition genuinely do not for one moment believe in what they are saying. Ultimately this is a deal which half a century on, like the Japan-Australia trade agreement, will be looked upon as a great step forward. It will be a step forward for Australian producers; it will also be a step forward for Australian producers, for Australian workers because it will create jobs and for Australian families because it will create benefits in terms of living standards and incomes. For those reasons, we reject the motion and we endorse the free trade agreement.

"Katter, Bob, MP",IND,2004-02-11,"—I rise to speak on this matter of public importance. Soon after hearing that this free trade deal did not include sugar, I was rung by the ABC's Steve Austin. He asked, `Mr Katter, would you like to comment upon the fact that Mr Vaile has constantly said that sugar was a non-negotiable item?' So I think it is important to record in Hansard that on 24 January 2004, as reported in the Courier-Mail, Acting Prime Minister John Anderson responded to a question by saying:
... it would be un-Australian to accept any free trade deal without sugar being included.
On 30 January, on the eve of the Queensland state election, Mr Vaile in a doorstop interview said:
... and that means, as we've always said, that sugar must be part of the deal.
On 23 January Mr Vaile, in a doorstop interview at Sydney airport, said:
We've said that sugar must be part of the deal and we're not conceding that.
On 28 January Mr Vaile said, again in a doorstop interview:
As we've always said, sugar must be part of the deal.
Then on 15 January Mr Vaile said:
We've continued to maintain that sugar must be part of this package.'
So please excuse the electors of Queensland for believing that sugar would be part of the package. I personally put a proposition to the electors of Queensland that they should not vote for a party on the left or the right parties that believe in competition policy but for people that do not believe in competition policy. The electors did not listen to me and, throughout all of the sugar areas, they moved in their masses back to their old allegiance with my old party, The Nationals. On Saturday they put their faith, hope and trust in the party of their old allegiance; on Saturday they did that in their droves.
The only glory that The Nationals had that night was in my old state electorate, where I had in fact worked for The Nationals candidate very hard, and the two sugar seats. That was the only joy they had that night. People put their faith, hope and trust in them. On Monday those people woke up to find that they had been stabbed in the back last week. Constantly and continuously throughout that campaign, waved in front of them was the flag of hope. And I do not blame a lot of The Nationals' people. Like me, they probably watched Mark Vaile on the television and thought, `He can't dodge and duck out of this one.'
 (Hon. I.R. Causley)—The member for Kennedy will refer to other members by their seats or their title.
—I am sorry, Mr Deputy Speaker. There was no doubt in my mind that this trade deal would include sugar. It may not have been as good as I would have liked it to have been, but there was no doubt that that was going to happen. I felt that, if we got the state government to agree to electricity generation, maybe we could get through. I am very closely associated with and big supporter of the sugar reform committee in Queensland, but unlike many of its members who were disparaging the deal and believing that it would never happen, I did not; I am on record continuously as backing Mr Vaile and the government on their endeavours.
—The member for Kennedy.
—I am sorry, Mr Deputy Speaker. I also represent a very large dairy area in Queensland. We got $55 million. That sounds good, except if you are aware that the Australian dairy industry is a $10,000 million a year industry. If you are aware of that, you burst out laughing. Then there is the beef industry. This document—and I do not mean to be disrespectful; I am sure that people worked hard on it—said that we can get 4,000 tonnes of avocado into the United States. So I rang up the head of my fruit and vegetable growers on the Atherton Tableland and said, `Is this good, Joe?' He said, `Well, it's good if we could get in there, but we're not allowed under the current protocols.' The gentleman I was speaking to then said, `We can get mangoes in now, Bob; you'll be pleased with that.' And I said, `No, we can't; we've been trying for 15 years. Quarantine restrictions will not allow our mangoes in.' And he said, `Well, you got peanuts.'
—You've got peanuts all right!
—I didn't laugh at him, to take the irony of the peanuts. We did though—we got 500 tonnes. I have a lot of growers that grow 500 tonnes. 
—The member for Corio seems to forget that he has been warned!
—They said, `You've done well in wool.' I said, `Oh yes, what have we got there?' He said, `There is a benefit of $1 million a year.' I said, `It is a $3,000 million a year industry.' He said, `Yes, but there is $1½ million with the lamb trade as well.' I do not think they were doing this to crack jokes. We then turned back to the subject of beef. My cattle are going to be pretty damn old by the time they get into the American market. 
—The member for Rankin has also been warned!
—I do not think they will be fit for domestic consumption by the time we get into the American market. So where is the benefit? The previous speaker, the member for Flinders, said that it was in manufacturing. We should sell out the sugar industry. It is a fairly light dismissal—just let them go to the wall; they are the fourth biggest agricultural industry in the country. The entire Queensland coastline north of Nambour, with the exception of Rockhampton, depends on the economy of the sugar industry, and we are writing off the whole industry. We are going to give some compensation to 4,000 or 5,000 farmers and that will probably move across into cattle. What happens to the 40,000 workers in that industry? Is it `Ta-ta; goodbye to you—you are on the scrapheap'? If you want to know how good compensation packages are, I will take you up for some discussions with my dairy farmers. However, if you are representing the government position, I strongly suggest that you bring your flak jacket with you if you suggest that they came out of that deal well and that was the best deal ever given.
Let me return to manufacturing because, ironically enough, the manufacturers from Melbourne come into my office all the time because apparently I am one of the few that sees their point of view. The proposition being put forward by the previous speaker—and I am sure he spoke with sincerity—is that we are going to successfully compete against the greatest industrial giant on earth whose economies of scale are set under NAFTA to a home market of 300 million people—and we are going beat them into the ground. The massive technology of the greatest technologically advanced country on earth is standing behind them—the whole military-industrial establishment technology flowing into these companies for free—and we are going to do them. Good luck, mate! It is like Julia Creek Firsts playing against Penrith. I should not be laughing; I should be crying.
—What about steel exports?
—That is a good question. If I were you, I would have kept my mouth shut because if there is one great success story in this country, it is what John Button did for the steel industry, which was exactly the same as John McEwen did for every industry in this country. John Button turned us from 80 tonnes per producer to 720 tonnes per producer. Our industry has currently been alienated by BHP Billiton because it feels that in the long run it is not going to be able to compete. That is not me—that is what BHP Billiton is saying.
If you seriously think that your steel industry is going to successfully compete against the American steel industry, once again I say to you, `Good luck, my friend, and I most certainly hope that you are correct. But if I were a betting a man, I know what odds the bookmaker would be giving you.'
What is very serious for us in the sugar industry is that we only have two lifelines. We cannot produce sugar for under $300 a tonne. Every person in the industry knows that. We have not seen $300 a tonne effectively for five years. We cannot go any longer. This whole industry is collapsing and everybody knows it. The only glove that was laid on the Premier during the whole election campaign was laid by the sugar reform committee and, I might say, by me. When the Premier lost his temper, he said, `All of this industry has gone, except Ayr.' You do not have to be Albert Einstein to know that the Premier of Queensland is saying that the fourth greatest agricultural industry in the country has gone.
Every intelligent commentator knows that, unless we get ethanol or this deal, we are dead in the water. We have been on our bended knees to the government on the ethanol issue. We just hope that members of the opposition come around and see the sense of looking after their city constituencies on the matter of toxic tailpipe emissions—the same as every other country. That is all we really need. One of our lifelines was cut and people went to the polls on the belief that it was not. Please deliver on the other.

"Neville, Paul, MP",NATS,2004-02-11,"—What a performance we have had this afternoon from the three members opposite—tortured economics, a desperately poor knowledge of Australia's place in trade, a revival of the Keatingesque trading policy that trade can only occur through multilateral negotiations and, to overlay all this, the member for Corio has this colourful rhetoric about knives and stabbing and he dressed it all up with a few distorted biblical analogies. The member for Kennedy then trivialised Australian industry and denied a huge step forward for the national interest. He did not have one constructive suggestion of what might help Queensland cane growers.
Let me go through some of the benefits for Australia. The first is free and open access to the US market for Australian exports of nearly all manufactured goods—97 per cent in fact—and services. The manufacturing sector is worth $5.8 billion a year. There is substantial improved access for the Australian agricultural sector, including the number of products which my colleague from Melbourne has outlined in some detail—butter, cheese, milk powder, seafood, wine, lamb, beef, peanuts and so on. There will be a 66 per cent immediate removal of tariffs—and another nine per cent over time. That is three-quarters of the tariff.
Australia has been screaming out against the unfairness of tariffs for years—back through not only the Howard years but also the Keating, Hawke, Fraser years and beyond we have been doing so. The first time we pull down three-quarters of them in the biggest market in the world, what do we get from the other side? Trivialisation.
The member for Kennedy spoke about the then leader of the Country Party, John McEwen. John McEwen did an enormously brave thing: in the aftermath of the Second World War, when there was a lot of sensitivity about any form of contact with Japan, he established a historic trading pact. But—and this is the whole point—it did not stop there: it has been built upon by successive governments and successive Queensland governments of both political colours, because we went in with a foundation. The member for Kennedy served in the government of Queensland when we exploited that in a huge way with coal sales. If we did not have central Queensland coal sales the Queensland economy would not be anything like what it is today. We would not have all the new powerhouses that we have, we would not have the cheapest coal fired power in the world and we would not have an aluminium industry in Gladstone. We would not have any of that. It all started with John McEwen and his trade.
—This is the exact opposite!
—This, as the Minister for Trade has said, is the foundation of a new relationship. It comes on top of relationships with Thailand and Singapore, which apparently the member of Rankin was not aware of when he expressed his idea that somehow we were going to be shut out of Asia. The exact opposite is the case, because we are engaging with Asia in a whole range of areas.
But on top of that let us look at some of the things that really worried the Australian community. For example, if we look at the worry that our quarantine system might be at risk, we see that it has been guaranteed under this agreement that our quarantine system will stand. The PBS will not be interfered with—that stands. Ensuring that local content of Australian broadcasting and audio visual content stood was a big worry to the acting and production communities, and that has been guaranteed. The one thing that most of the state trading entities wanted was the guarantee of the single desk—that is also guaranteed, for sugar, for rice and so on.
No-one seriously suggests that the trade minister went to Washington without the greatest effort to get sugar through. I believe he gave it 110 per cent; I have never doubted his ability to do that. At the end of the day, the American lobby was bloody-minded. That negotiation has gone on for 12 months, and sugar has been part of it for 12 months. The last round was 13 days straight until the early hours of the morning. Contrary to what the member for Kennedy and the Queensland premier said—that this was held back from the Queensland public until after the election—that negotiation was still going on on Sunday morning Australian time, which gives the lie to that little sideshow that was going on after the Queensland election.
—No-one will believe you, Paul.
—I never thought the member for Kennedy would be an apologist for the Beattie government. Having said all that, we gave this our best shot for sugar. But there would only have been one thing worse—
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I claim to have been misrepresented. The honourable member said that I had been an apologist for Beattie—
 (Mr Jenkins)—Order! There is no—
—In fact, I said just the opposite.
—There is no point of order.
—There is a point of order. I said just the opposite. I said I was the only one that laid a glove on him in the election campaign.
—The honourable member for Kennedy will resume his seat. If he claims to have been misrepresented, there are other forums in the House through which to pursue it, rather than pursuing it through a point of order.
—When you have a trade negotiation like this you go in with all your guns blazing all the time. You do not give up until at the very last stage of negotiation all the pluses are on one table and all the minuses are on another. Then you make a judgment in the national interest and ask what is best for Australia. That is what you do at that stage of negotiation. To say that the sugar industry was stabbed in the back is not confirmed by what the sugar industry itself is saying. Ian Ballantyne, who is the general manager of the Canegrowers, said: 
... but at no stage did we adopt a dog-in-the-manger, `if not sugar, then no one' approach to negotiations. We accept that, on balance, the FTA will deliver economic benefit to the nation.
That is from the Canegrowers.
What follows from that is huge disappointment in the industry. I am both angry at the American sugar lobby and bitterly disappointed for my canegrowers and their families. This would have been a great morale booster, if we could have got it through. But there would have been only one thing worse than not achieving the sugar deal, and that would have been to achieve a token one. We currently get only 87,000 tonnes of sugar into the American market, and that is worth $40 million. Let us say the Americans had given us, very generously, a 50 per cent increase. That would have meant $20 million a year. Sure, it would have been a morale booster and, sure, it would have been helpful. But it would have been a drop in the ocean.
The problems of the Queensland sugar industry are not just in the free trade agreement and they are not just in this debate about deregulation and regulation. The problems of the Queensland sugar industry are that it needs massive restructuring and massive support. The Queensland government has treated this industry abysmally. In the previous sugar package of three years ago, the Commonwealth put up $80 million and the Queensland government put up $10 million. Of that $10 million, only $60,000 was ever accessed—an outrage. Now, they have got $30 million on the table and, in defiance of what the industry wants—which is to have an arbiter of last resort between the miller and the grower and to have some defence of the domestic desk—the Queensland government has stood in stark contravention of the wishes of the canegrowers, and they paid for that last Saturday.
I am calling today on the federal government to dissolve the memorandum of understanding with the Queensland government. I suggest that as a federal government we should go it alone and we should substantially increase the sugar package in light of the American attitude. Not less than $100 million needs to be added to that package so that we can do something substantial, long term and beneficial for the industry. I am all about positive attitude in taking the industry forward. I want no more of this negativity.

"Hardgrave, Gary, MP",LP,2004-02-11,"—I move:
That the amendments be agreed to.
The Migration Legislation Amendment (Identification and Authentication) Bill 2003 amends the Migration Act to provide a framework for the collection of personal identifiers such as photographs, signatures and fingerprints from certain non-citizens at key points in the immigration process. In essence, these amendments will enhance the government's ability to accurately identify persons who seek to enter and remain in Australia, while factoring in safeguards such as privacy considerations. As such, the amendments will significantly help the government to combat identity and document fraud in the immigration context as well as to reduce delays in immigration processing.
The Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee recommended that the bill be agreed to, subject to six recommendations being implemented. In moving the current amendments, the government has adequately addressed the committee's major concerns. Passage of this bill will ensure that the government's ongoing ability to combat identity fraud is not compromised. It will reduce the risk of Australia being seen as a soft target by terrorists, people smugglers, forum shoppers and other non-citizens of concern. These amendments will ensure that Australia will be able to fully participate in combating immigration fraud, using current and new biometric technology on an international level.
The bill also endorses fully the standing of those who have migrated to Australia through the range of visas which this country issues—through the system if you like. It endorses the status of those people in this country. I know that in my own electorate—the most culturally diverse electorate in the great state of Queensland—we have refugee entrants from the Horn of Africa in suburbs like Moorooka, Yeronga and Tarragindi through to the very strongly contributive business migrants and others who have come through the family reunion stream from Hong Kong and Singapore to join the Chinese and Taiwanese communities in places like Sunnybank, Sunnybank Hills, Calamvale and Stretton. I know that each one of those people would welcome the government's ongoing efforts to ensure that each of them is rightfully identified as being lawfully—and greatly welcomed—in this country.
I add that, on this day at Sunnybank High School, the Taiwan Women's League are celebrating their 10th anniversary. I wish them very well and thank them for their contribution. I am very happy to see these amendments agreed to by the House.",REPS,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Smith, Stephen, MP",ALP,2004-02-11,"—The opposition supports the motion. The Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs has fairly outlined the substance of the Migration Legislation Amendment (Identification and Authentication) Bill 2003 and the process which has seen the government, and I expect in a few moments the House, arrive at this outcome. When the House first considered this bill, the opposition made it quite clear that we strongly and firmly support the principle of the legislation, which is to ensure the high standard of rigour so far as combating identity fraud was concerned, but that we wanted to have the benefit of the Senate legislation committee report. The minister is quite right in indicating that, of the six amendments suggested by the Senate committee, five have been taken up either in whole or in substantive part. That has actually been a good example of how one of the parliament's committees can assist the parliament generally in the detail of a piece of legislation and make it better and, I suspect, more workable in the future.
What underlies the rationale of the legislation is that the Australian community has to have confidence in our immigration system. The only way they will have confidence in our immigration system is if they are absolutely satisfied in the first instance that the procedures and the processes that we undertake are rigorous. Whilst it is the case that most people who come to this country or seek to come to this country, in whatever category or capacity, do so honestly and with the best of intentions, there are a small number who seek to come here inappropriately, improperly and not with the best of intentions and the measures in this legislation to combat such attempts at identity fraud will advance the cause of the Commonwealth generally in ensuring that our processes are rigorous.
It is also the case that, if the community is to have confidence in our immigration system, people who go through the system—again, in whatever visa category or capacity, whether it is a tourist visa, a student visa, business migration or an application for protection under the refugee convention—have to believe they have been dealt with fairly and quickly. The personal identifier measures—the biometric measures—which the legislation now contains will certainly assist in that process as well. So the amendments improve the legislation. Much more detail is now contained in the legislation rather than by regulation, as initially outlined by the bill as introduced. The amendments also contain the capacity for a review of the legislation after three years. I am sure that review will, in due course, add to our working knowledge and further refinement and improvement in this area of migration legislation and administration. Like the minister, I commend the amendments and the bill to the House.

"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2004-02-11,"—I rise to strongly support the second reading amendment moved to the Health Legislation Amendment (Private Health Insurance Reform) Bill 2003 by the shadow minister for health. In doing so, I acknowledge that this legislation has been introduced by the government. It aims to remove inefficiencies associated with the existing process for rural changes. I have some concerns about this. This legislation is looking at a prescribed period of advanced notice which will apply only to wills that affect deals with premiums. In addition, a current requirement is that contributors be informed of changes before they take effect. That will apply only to changes that are or could be detrimental to the interests of any of the contributors. Who makes this decision, on what grounds and how transparent is it? That goes to my whole concerns about the transparency of the process. I tend to share some of the concerns of the Australian Consumer Association where it argued that the funds should be required to give policy holders more notice. As always, this government is a slave to its friends in the health insurance industry and tends to forget the real needs of Australian people, particularly in the area of health. I highlighted some of those needs before question time.
I would like to share with the House my concern about health insurance premiums. Since April 2002 health insurance premiums have increased across the board by nearly 15 per cent. I would like to put on the record that I believe that the government has betrayed the Australian people. It has betrayed the confidence that they have in the government and it has not delivered on its promise that putting in place the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate would ensure that the Australian people would pay less for their private health insurance; rather, there has been an upward spiral of the premiums. The government has once again deceived the Australian people and has failed to deliver what it promised. 
It is also interesting to look at whether or not private health insurance is providing value for money for the people that have it. I would argue that it is not, that a number of people are being deceived by the arguments put forward by the government. The initial increase in the number of people taking out private health insurance has now declined. I would like to refer to comments made by the member for Fremantle, who talked about the statistics on the take-up rate of private health insurance and other aspects of private health insurance. The 30 per cent rebate was supposed to make private health insurance more affordable for Australians. In the electorate that I represent in this parliament, people are really struggling to pay their private health insurance premiums. 
Public health outcomes are deteriorating because the government made a choice: it wanted to encourage private health insurance; it wanted to put money into private health insurance rather than into health services for all Australians. Rather than putting money into public hospitals and ensuring that doctors bulk-bill, this government made the definite decision to put money into private health insurance. In its last budget it ripped $918 million out of public hospitals. This has put enormous pressure on public hospitals. Today I was reading from a letter sent to me by a constituent in my electorate. This constituent said that the pressure that was being placed on public hospitals throughout Australia was an absolute disgrace. It all comes from this government refusing to put money into public health, into Medicare, and refusing to ensure that all Australians have quality health. This government is driven by its ideology, by its philosophy, and along the way it forgets the people that it is here to represent. 
Another issue that concerns me greatly about private health insurance—an issue that is constantly raised with me by constituents—is the gap that people are forced to pay between the account that they receive from their doctor and the amount that they receive back from their private health insurance fund. One in five services has a gap. Australia-wide last year that gap averaged $90.64. In New South Wales that gap averaged $115. A standard knee replacement has a gap of around $1,000. I was speaking to a constituent recently who was looking at paying a gap of $4,000 for a knee replacement. That is an enormous amount. The government has failed to address this issue. It has failed to come to terms with the real issues that relate to private health insurance and it has betrayed all those Australians who rely on Medicare to ensure that they have good quality health services. It has failed to ensure that we have a universal system of health care throughout Australia. It has failed all those people that have been going to a particular doctor for many years and who have now found that their doctor no longer bulk-bills. 
As I mentioned before question time, only 51.3 per cent of services are now bulk-billed in the Shortland electorate. There has been a decline of 34 per cent in bulk-billing since this government came to power. To be quite honest with you, I just do not think it is good enough. People should not have to make a decision about whether they go to the doctor or put food on the table. That is basically what this government is forcing them to do. 
What we need in Australia is a government that is committed to quality health care for all Australians, not a government that is committed to looking after its friends and promoting a two-tiered American type health system. The government stands condemned for its performance in the area of health and I am sure that the Australian people will deliver a very strong message to the government at the next election.

"Pearce, Christopher, MP",LP,2004-02-11,"—Before I start my remarks, I wish to comment on the ludicrous statements made by the member for Shortland. If you want to come into the House and wrap your subjective views around an issue and make a story out of it, at least use the facts. The facts of the matter are that this government has made a record investment into health. The other fact that the member for Shortland always forgets is the state Labor governments' appalling performance in relation to public health. 
The Health Legislation Amendment (Private Health Insurance Reform) Bill 2003 is about improving private health in Australia for the benefit of all Australians. The bill seeks to increase the level of private health insurance coverage by making it a more attractive option for all Australians. The benefits of the bill are an intertwined mix of principle and practical elements. I would like to start with the principle first.
A fundamental principle that this government supports is choice. Private health insurance policy and education funding policy are prime examples of choice in action under the coalition government—choice that benefits not just the individual but also the community more broadly. This bill is about improving that choice for all Australians, for their benefit. It is not just for those who take out private health insurance; it is about improving choice for every person.
Under Labor, of course, the private health system was driven into the ground. The member for Shortland forgets these facts. Despite all of their claims of what they will do, just remember what they actually did when they were last in government. When Labor were elected in 1983, almost 65 per cent of the community was covered by private health insurance. Over the next 13 years of Labor government, the number of Australians covered by private health insurance almost halved, to below 34 per cent. It went from 65 per cent to 34 per cent across 13 years. That was despite the warning in 1993 from former Labor health minister Graham Richardson that the entire health system would be in danger of collapsing if the coverage rate fell below 40 per cent.
When this government provided greater choice to Australians and their families by introducing the rebate in 1998, Labor called it such things as `madness', `shameful' and `unfair'. This example demonstrates vividly, I think, Labor's attitude toward Australian families—the attitude of utter contempt. Labor clearly believes that it is the Labor Party that knows what is best for Australian families. I and the people of my electorate of Aston subscribe to a different view. People in Aston believe that it is the families themselves that are in the best position to decide which health care options best suit their particular needs.
Recent media commentary on the latest policy adventures of the member for Werriwa notes that Labor seem to stand for `Big Brother government'—a government that tells you what is in your best interests. Let us make no mistake: if Labor got into government they would simply rip the guts out of the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate. In their draft 2004 national platform, Labor even admitted that they believed that the private health insurance industry, including the operation of the private health insurance rebate, needs to be reviewed. The rebate, of course, is currently received by over 8.6 million Australians. That is around 44 per cent of our population. The rebate has kept private health insurance more affordable and saves the typical family about $750 per year on the cost if the rebate did not exist. If Labor restricts the rebate to families earning less than $50,000, that would mean 4.3 million Australians would lose that support. Without the rebate, these Australians would face a 42 per cent increase in their premiums. This move would not only cost those individuals; importantly, it would also cost the community.
The increase in the take-up of private health insurance has taken pressure off Medicare and the public hospital system. Increasingly, more patients are able to be treated in private hospitals. While the government recognises that there is more to be done and is working hard and investing heavily in Medicare and the public health system, there is no doubt that Labor's plans for private health insurance would only increase the burden on public hospitals. This comment was substantiated and supported in a new report titled Easing the pressure: the intergenerational report and private health insurance. The report was prepared by economic consultants Econtech in association with Harper Associates and Philip Hagan. The report found that the government private health insurance policies were good value for money for taxpayers and will ensure a sustainable private sector for future generations.
The report also reaffirmed previous research which had found that every dollar spent on the 30 per cent rebate actually saves $2 in Australian government and state government health spending. The study concluded that, if the Howard government's policies were reversed in the future, private health insurance coverage would fall to unprecedented low levels, making it potentially unviable. According to the report, the costs to the Australian community would be that millions of Australians would be deprived of more affordable access to genuine health care choice, huge pressure would be put right back on the public hospital system, Australia's extensive private hospital infrastructure and expensive technology would be neglected and simply underused, and billions more of Australians' tax dollars would be needed to substitute for people's personal investments in their health care.
While private health care is of course important, the Howard government's investment in this area is in fact in addition to the massive amount already being spent by it on public hospitals. Private health insurance does not substitute money going into the public hospital system; it supplements it. This government is making a significant investment in public health. Figures released in Australian Institute of Health and Welfare studies last September showed that the Commonwealth spent more on Australia's public hospitals in 2001-02 than the states and territories did. In fact, those figures showed that Commonwealth spending was higher than total state and territory spending in each of the first four years of the last health care agreement.
A good example of this is that, despite this and despite the Victorian government receiving record levels of stamp duty, Victorians are still bearing the cost of Labor's mismanagement of the public health system. After four years of excuses, the June 2003 hospital services report in Victoria gave a clear demonstration of Labor's inability to deliver in health. Compared with June 1999 under the previous state government, the number of people waiting for treatment on hospital trolleys in emergency departments for more than 12 hours has more than doubled. The number of patients on waiting lists for urgent and semi-urgent elective surgery has also increased.
Another alarming statistic reported in the media last month was that, according to a Productivity Commission report, Victoria was the worst performing state in category 2 hospital admissions. In my local community, the Angliss Hospital faces problems, many of which have been reported in the local media. These facts all point to the need in Melbourne for a new public hospital in the outer east of Melbourne: the planned but unfortunately dumped Knox public hospital. The former drive-in site in Wantirna was purchased by the previous state government and earmarked for a public hospital. In a now all too familiar pattern, Labor in Victoria scrapped the project upon coming to office. Instead, Labor made some token promises to upgrade hospitals in surrounding areas. Just like on the Scoresby Freeway project, the local community has yet again been short-changed by Labor. Instead of only minor upgrades to hospitals, the people of Melbourne's outer east deserve to have the 300-bed tertiary hospital that was planned as the Knox public hospital. That is why I will continue to fight to see the Knox public hospital built.
There will always be more that could be done to improve our health system. But this government is making the tough decisions needed and providing the necessary investment to improve the system. The government has reformed private health insurance for the benefit of Australia and has proposed a MedicarePlus package which makes more improvements, yet again, to our health system. This bill is part of a wider effort in this regard, and it will further improve the private health insurance options available, including for the one million Australians earning less than $20,000 per annum who already have private health insurance. There is always more to be done and Australians can be sure that the coalition will continue, as it has since 1996, to reform and improve Australia's health system, both—and this is an important point—the public and the private health system, for the benefit of all Australians. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE REFORM) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"King, Catherine, MP",ALP,2004-02-11,"—It is always great to follow the member for Aston, who spent almost his entire contribution talking about what he thinks the Labor policy might be and not being able to show a single third-term agenda that the government has in terms of health policy. It is always very interesting to hear members of the Victorian Liberal Party actually talk about public hospitals. In Victoria most of us remember the former premier Jeff Kennett cut millions of dollars out of the public hospital system and absolutely decimated it. So it is always interesting to hear Victorian Liberals wax lyrical about the public hospital system in Victoria after they wrecked it. 
The Health Legislation Amendment (Private Health Insurance Reform) Bill 2003 that we are discussing in this House has the support of the Labor Party, as indicated last year. The private health insurance industry has been a massive beneficiary of government policy over the past few years, therefore it is only sensible that the scrutiny of government and the type of regulatory regime that it is required to operate under are enhanced. In September 2002 the then health minister, Senator Patterson, flagged a package of reforms designed to create a more efficient regulatory regime for private health insurers and to provide consumers with more safeguards and better value for money for private health insurance products. This bill gives effect to some of those measures. Labor supports the intent of the bill in that it introduces a better management system between government and private health insurers, fair treatment for consumers and better mechanisms for investigating and acting on any of the problems in the private health insurance industry.
The provisions of the bill go to a number of issues. This bill amends the National Health Act and the Private Health Insurance Incentives Act 1998. Under the current system, registered health benefits organisations need to submit all rule changes, no matter how minor, for government approval. Schedule 1 of this bill removes the rule change and assessment process and replaces it with a system of monitoring and compliance. This provision aims to make the system more efficient and health insurers more responsive to their members, therefore it is supported.
But with these changes it is vital that effective monitoring of the performance of registered health benefit organisations be undertaken. Schedule 1 of this bill introduces a set of indicators for monitoring performance. They are specifically designed to identify those organisations that breach the National Health Act and are to alert the minister to practices that are counter to health policy. They will be particularly important for monitoring whether registered health benefit organisations continue to fulfil their community rating obligations, which are designed to ensure that private health insurance is affordable for all Australians. Like any performance and monitoring system, it will only be as good as the data entered into the system and the capacity for enforcement. Whilst implementation of this system is in the hands of government and the department, it will be incumbent upon us in this parliament to ensure, through the audit process, that it is actually working and that the implementation of the system does what it is intended to do. I will certainly be interested to see how this system is rolled out.
The bill also increases the investigative powers and sanctions that the minister may impose on registered health benefit organisations found to be in breach of the National Health Act or failing to meet government objectives. Again, I support these provisions within the bill. Part 2 of schedule 1 of the bill amends the National Health Act to provide better consumer protection within the private health insurance market. The bill provides the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman with increased powers to investigate complaints and resolve disputes.
Whilst the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman has reported that there has been a decline in complaints over the last quarter, this has actually come off the back of a record high in complaints in March 2003. Over 700 problems, grievances and disputes were received by the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman in March 2003 compared to only 132 in the December quarter in 2003. If you look back over the annual reports of the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman—and I am sure that they are riveting reading for most people—you will see the rise in complaints since 1999. There were 1,745 in 1999. In 2003 just over 3,000 complaints were received by the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman. So I certainly hope that we will see a strengthened capacity for the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman to investigate complaints and to make recommendations to the government as to how those complaints may be handled.
The highest number of complaints appears to be in relation to the issues of cost—and I will be talking a little more about the cost of private health insurance shortly—and the benefits covered by the schemes themselves. Complaints have also covered the areas of waiting periods, lack of information, rule changes, disagreement about memberships and service issues. Whilst the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman reports a decline in the dispute numbers over the last quarter as a welcome trend, the report also states that this is not a trend shared by all funds, with some funds recording increases in both complaints and disputes. The provisions of the bill that expand the powers of the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman to investigate complaints are therefore welcome and supported.
Under the provisions of this bill, registered health benefit organisations will have to respond to requests for information from the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman within a set time frame. The ombudsman's powers will also be increased to allow the ombudsman to report to the minister the outcomes of an investigation and to recommend ways of dealing with issues arising out of an investigation. With the rise in complaints, I certainly think that that is a welcome provision within the bill.
The bill also provides for the production of an annual `state of the health funds' report, which will contain information on how health funds are performing and how well they are serving their members. That is an important provision, because what we are seeing at the moment within the private health insurance market is enormous confusion on the part of consumers about the products they are purchasing. I certainly hope that the `state of the health funds' report will allow broader provision of information to consumers about what is happening with those funds. The `state of the health funds' report will become an important tool for consumers in deciding between health insurance products. Health funds will be required to make this report widely available to members, and I trust that the department, in its implementation of the provisions contained within this legislation, will be making sure that those health funds are providing that report more widely. I also hope that the department will be making some recommendations and setting some guidelines about the sorts of mechanisms through which members may be provided with that `state of the health funds' report.
Finally, the bill includes a number of improvements to Lifetime Health Cover to remove some of the ambiguity and unintended consequences of the previous provisions. Those improvements include the establishment of a notional annual birth date of 1 July for the purposes of Lifetime Health Cover, recognising cover provided by the Department of Veterans' Affairs gold card as counting towards hospital cover for the purposes of calculating the Lifetime Health Cover loading, providing new migrants over the age of 30 with 12 months to take out hospital cover without being subject to the Lifetime Health Cover loading, ensuring that Australian citizens who are overseas on their notional 31st birthday have a similar 12-month grace period, and ensuring that Australian citizens who have hospital cover and go overseas for periods of greater than 12 months will not have that time overseas counted towards any potential Lifetime Health Cover loading.
The bill makes sensible changes to the regulatory regime under which the health insurance funds operate and, as such, the provisions are supported. The second reading amendment moved by the shadow minister goes to what the government said prior to the last election, and prior to the election before that, about what it was going to do with private health insurance. It goes not just to what the government was going to do about private health insurance but to the impact of those policy decisions on private health insurance. No legislation was required when the government took the unprecedented decision to allow health funds to increase their premiums by the CPI without the need to seek government approval. It and the subsequent massive increases in private health fund premiums fly in the face of what the Prime Minister told us in 1996 and prior to the last election. In 1996 John Howard said:
What I can give is an absolute guarantee—
and we know what they are worth—
that any change—
that is, in private health insurance premiums—
in future will be as a result of a decision taken at political level in a way and in circumstances where we—
the government; you know what they are like, saying, `We will decide'—
are satisfied that the rise is completely justified.
At the first available opportunity, they gave that responsibility away. Before the election, the Prime Minister claimed there would be downward pressure on premiums and private health insurance would be more affordable and attractive to consumers. The Prime Minister also claimed that the government's policies would lead to reduced premiums. Yet last year alone the Howard government approved an average increase of 7.4 per cent in private health insurance premiums, and that was on the back of a 6.9 per cent increase the previous year. Prior to the election in 1996 the government said there would be downward pressure on private health insurance premiums, but that is exactly the opposite of what has actually happened.
Many people, including people in my own electorate, were of course faced—and continue to be faced—with much higher premium increases. In one case I heard about recently, there was an increase of almost 25 per cent. The other thing that has happened is that we are seeing people beginning to drop out of private health insurance again. The policy objective was to get people into the private health insurance market. Certainly Lifetime Health Cover saw a huge rise in the number of people taking up private health insurance. But what we are seeing now is that the products that are being provided, and the premiums for those products, are resulting in a number of people beginning to drop out because of affordability issues. Also, we have seen that in some instances they do not believe that the products they are receiving actually offer them value for money.
I have seen cases in my office where, when premiums have become due, some plans disappear. Consumers have been attracted to the health fund in the first place because there is a plan that meets their particular needs. But what they have found when their premiums have become due is that in some cases that plan no longer exists and, in order to get the level of cover they were previously getting, they have had to go on to a plan with a higher premium. They have also had to pay, as part of doing that, for cover that they do not actually need. So we are also seeing a change in the types of products that private health insurers are providing, which is putting pressure on people's ability to access products that are affordable and/or in direct line with the sorts of needs that they have.
In my view the government is facing a steady unravelling of the effects of its private health insurance rebate and Lifetime Health Cover policies. In this debate the government members have tried to scaremonger and have made all sorts of accusations about Labor's position regarding the private health insurance rebate. We have categorically stated that of course we are reviewing the policy. It would be incumbent upon us to do so, because there are some real problems of policy failure that this government is not addressing and not doing anything about. So it is incumbent upon us, as good members of parliament, to actually review where there is policy failure. And there are clear signs of policy failure starting to emerge in this area.
Labor's position regarding the private health insurance rebate is that, as we have categorically stated, we will not do anything to the rebate that will adversely affect family budgets. For us, that is a really important bottom line that we are not going to move on. But not to explore the very real problems and real policy failures we are beginning to see emerging in the private health insurance rebate and Lifetime Health Cover would, frankly, be bad government. They would be bad members of parliament who decided not to do anything about it and decided not to look at it very seriously.
With premiums going up, the cost to consumers to obtain health insurance products and therefore the cost to the government has been steadily increasing. At the same time, we have seen instances of private health insurance funds refusing to renegotiate contracts with private hospitals, and many private hospitals, including those in my own electorate, are beginning to see signs of severe financial difficulty. That should definitely be worrying the government, but it appears not to be. This in turn has seen continued pressure on public hospitals. This, combined with the cuts to the public hospitals that occurred when the government did not honour projected increases in its own forward estimates in funding for the Australian health care agreements, has seen many public hospitals also under pressure. Recently in my own district we have seen a worrying trend where our public hospital has introduced a policy to attract more private patients in order to stay financially competitive. That is a worrying trend in my public hospital system.
The government's policy neglect in this area is coming home to roost, and the people affected are those in our community who can least afford it. The billions of dollars that are spent on private health insurance mean that the regulatory regime under which private health insurance operates, the performance of the funds and the capacity for consumers to complain and for the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman to investigate these complaints has to be strengthened. Whilst I support the bill because I believe we must have a better regulatory regime under which health funds operate, a regime which provides flexible services to members, the government has been hypocritical over private health insurance premiums, saying one thing before the election—that the policy was going to see downward pressures on premiums, that they were going to see huge improvements for consumers in terms of the costs associated with private health insurance premiums—while exactly the opposite has happened. I think that, whilst I support this bill, it would be negligent of me if I did not point that out.
What we are seeing with the private health insurance system is certainly a change in the types of products that are available to people and we have certainly seen massive increases in private health insurance premiums, which is exactly what the government said would not happen under their policy. If the government are not prepared to look at the cracks that are beginning to emerge in their policy and are not prepared to look at the beginning signs of policy failure in relation to this area and actually roll up their sleeves and do something about it, they really should be condemned for it.",REPS,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE REFORM) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Ciobo, Steven, MP",LP,2004-02-11,"—Having the opportunity to hear the member for Ballarat and the member for Shortland has reinforced my point of view that I never want to get into a game of poker with anybody from the ALP. How on earth the Labor Party can stand in this chamber and with a straight face make some of the comments that they make absolutely astounds me. They would have to be the best cardsharps on the planet! We heard all sorts of claims from the member for Shortland and the member for Ballarat. I have very little doubt that I would have heard the same sorts of comments made by other members of the Labor Party had I been in this chamber for the whole debate.
But perhaps the most amusing one to me was when the member for Ballarat, at the very commencement of her speech, said how bemused she is whenever she hears a Victorian Liberal talking about the public health system when the Victorian Liberals apparently ripped millions of dollars out of the Victorian health system. What astounds me is: why did Jeff Kennett do that? Let us think back for a moment. What we know is that the reason Jeff Kennett was forced to rip millions of dollars out of the Victorian hospital system was that the Kirner and Cain governments left Victoria $65 billion in debt. That is the reason money was ripped out of the public hospital system. I say to the ALP: do not come into this chamber and with a straight face try to pretend that the problems with the Victorian health system are because of the Victorian Liberal Party. What rubbish! Let the people realise—and they know this full well—the reason the Jeff Kennett government got Victoria back into the black was that they had to make the hard decisions that had to be made to ensure that the community could continue in a sustainable way into the future.
It is only because of good governments under the Liberal Party, both at a federal level and at a state level, that these kinds of important community services can continue. The Labor Party dance with fairies when they come into this chamber and try to talk about how they would like all these community services to continue. They talk about how they believe in strong hospitals and how they believe in the public health system. But do you know what? If they cannot fund it, they cannot deliver it. It astounds me that they all come in, one after another—a parade of straight-faced Labor members—talking about their great belief in and their great passion for these community services. But you never hear any mention about how they are going to pay for it. You never hear any real-world claims about how it can be done within the current environmental structure that we have when it comes to financial management. The fact is that the Labor Party are strong on rhetoric but weak on good government and weak on good economic management. We see it occurring time and time again and we see it occurring today. In each state across this country we see state Labor governments driving the public hospital system into the ground. They are driving it into the ground because they are such poor economic managers.
I say for my constituents on the Gold Coast that I am greatly saddened that the Queensland Labor government—and Peter Beattie is the man to blame—is driving the Gold Coast Hospital into the ground through a lack of funding. I recognise this funding comes about because of the fact that the Queensland Labor government has now run two deficit budgets and in fact would have run a third deficit budget last year but for the fact that the Premier had nearly a billion dollars worth of special dividends that came from government owned corporations. That is the only reason the last Queensland state budget was in surplus to the paltry amount of $23 million. What a stark contrast there is between the economic management of the federal Liberal coalition and the economic management of the state Labor government.
In addition to that, I heard the Labor Party claim that it was the Liberals in the chamber who were trying to scaremonger and threaten people about what would happen should a Labor government get elected. Nothing could be further from the truth. We know that we set out very clearly what we planned to do, and the reasons we could achieve it, based on the economic management of this government. That is in stark contrast to the Labor Party. For example, the member for Ballarat made a comment about how the Labor Party would review the 30 per cent health rebate. Apparently, they would review it on the basis of whether or not it would have an adverse effect on the family budget should the Labor Party decide to remove the 30 per cent rebate.
There has been some conjecture about what this Labor Party policy would mean. Let us say, for example, that Labor were to restrict the private health insurance rebate to families earning less than $50,000 a year. That would seem like a fairly reasonable proposition and one that the Labor Party is likely to follow. In reality, if the Labor Party restricted the rebate to those families earning $50,000 or less per annum, 4.3 million Australians would have the rebate taken off them. The Labor Party's plan—assuming it is the $50,000 threshold that we see floated from time to time—would be to remove the rebate, which is worth approximately $700 year to the average Australian family, from some 4.3 million Australians. So 42 per cent of those who receive the private health insurance rebate at the moment would have that taken off them. That is the Labor Party plan and that is what the people of the Gold Coast and the people of Australia want to know about. They want to know what this so-called opposition, the one that claims to be a viable alternative government, is planning to do when it comes to developing a health policy that it would seek to implement should it be elected.
In addition to that, I heard the member for Shortland in this chamber talking about how bad public hospital funding was and how it was all a consequence of the federal coalition. Again, I ask: how is it possible that the poor performance of our state public hospitals—and I think the member for Shortland actually described it as `disgraceful'—could be the consequence of federal government funding? The reality is that under the new Australian health care agreement, $31.7 billion will flow to the states and territories. This represents a real increase. Taking out the effects of inflation, that is an increase of more than 28 per cent over the previous Medicare agreement that Labor negotiated back in 1993. Part of this funding is as a result of the fact that we have also removed a lot of the workload from the public hospital system. Because there are now so many people in the private health insurance system compared to when Labor was in power, we have taken a lot of demand off the public hospital system, and we have transferred it into the private system.
In fact, the state Labor governments agreed that, should there be a high level of private health insurance take-up, the state governments would repay $3 billion in total back to the Commonwealth government to reflect the fact that there was less demand for the public hospital system. Despite this fact, the coalition—the Liberal and National parties—have said to all the state Labor governments: `That's okay. You keep that $3 billion. We recognise that you need it. We are happy for you to leave it.' We are not even requiring them to own up to the promise that they made. We are leaving that money with the state Labor governments. Despite that funding, despite record funding under the Australian health care agreement and despite the fact that that they have a record increase of 28 per cent in real terms, Labor members come into this chamber and try to claim that the 30 per cent rebate does not work. It does work, and I will tell you why it works. It works because 43 per cent of Gold Coast residents have taken up private health insurance.
In my electorate of Moncrieff, 42.2 per cent of people have private health insurance. Compare that to when the ALP was in power. When the ALP was first elected in 1983, private health insurance in the community was at a level of 65 per cent. Back then you did not see the sorts of problems we have now with the public hospital system because, back then, 65 per cent of people had private health insurance. After 13 years in power, Labor had virtually halved that amount. The level of private health insurance dropped to 34 per cent because Labor is fully prepared and, I believe, ideologically obsessed to rip the guts out of the private health insurance system. They do so because they are ideologically transfixed by this notion of a public health system which they believe everyone should be part of and where there should be no choice to go into the private system. That is the Labor Party ideal and, at the end of the day, that is what the Labor Party strives for.
In June 2000, private health insurance was at 32 per cent and that is when the Howard government took the decision that something radical needed to be done to ensure that we helped to take some of the stress off the public health system. Even Graham Richardson, when he was on the frontbench of the ALP, made the comment that if private health insurance dropped below the magic 40 per cent mark the whole system would be on the verge of collapse. That was acknowledged by the Labor Party, yet they did nothing. When the Howard government saw it drop to 32 per cent, we introduced the 30 per cent rebate because we wanted to make it affordable. In June 2000 the level was at 32 per cent, and the Australian average is now at 43.3 per cent. It is my desire and wish that this average continues to increase and I would like to see it back up to 65 per cent. That was the level it was at in 1983 when the Labor Party came to power and ripped the guts out of the private health insurance system—a problem we are still trying to fix today.
The consequence of those 13 years of neglect of the private health insurance system is the queues that we see forming in our public hospitals today. Those queues are directly attributable to the fact that so many Australians dropped their private health insurance because they thought: `What is the point of providing for ourselves when we know the government is going to provide for us? What is the point of providing for ourselves when we know that we are financially penalised for doing that?' The consequence is the queues we see today. 
In my electorate, the Gold Coast Hospital has some of the best staff on the entire eastern seaboard, yet they struggle with the meagre resources that they have. My concern is that, if the Queensland state Labor government continues to run deficit budget after deficit budget, those resources will become even more meagre. When you consider that last year alone the Beattie Labor government got $343 million of unexpected windfall under the GST, you start to scratch your head and wonder where all that money is going at a state government level. As a member of the federal government, I certainly wonder where these excess funds are going at a state government level. They just seem to be wasted and are not being spent where they are needed on things like education and hospitals.
But that was all by way of introductory comments. The purpose of the Health Legislation Amendment (Private Health Insurance Reform) Bill 2003 before the House today is to amend two acts—the National Health Act 1953 and the Private Health Insurance Incentives Act 1998—and it flows from recommendations that were made by a review announced on 2 April 2002 by the Minister for Health and Ageing. This review is ongoing and the rules and regulations governing private health insurance are the focus of this review.
The bill before the House today represents some of the recommendations that were made by this review in the first stage of the inquiry. It basically recognises that there are ways to improve the private health insurance system, including removing some of the inefficiencies associated with the administration of the registered health benefits organisations, increasing the powers available to the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman, and introducing a report that will detail the composition and the performance of the various health funds. They are the three principal limbs.
We know that the private health insurance industry was concerned with the administrative burden that was associated with changes to the rules of their products and the lack of flexibility that they had, in terms of developing and delivering new products to their members and to possible contributors. The purpose of this bill is to operate to address those concerns by removing the inefficiencies associated with the existing rule change process and allowing registered health benefits organisations to be more responsive to their members' needs. The current arrangements require that the RHBOs notify the Department of Health and Ageing of changes to their constitutions, articles of association, rules and products. All changes to private health insurance products and the rules governing such products, including increases in excesses and co-payments, additional restrictions on hospital benefits and premium changes et cetera, are subject to this broad requirement.
This bill proposes two substantial modifications to the existing regulation of private health insurance funds and their products. The first involves the issue of notification to the department. Under the bill, the RHBOs are only required to provide advance notice to the department if rule changes relate to premiums. Other rule changes only have to be notified before coming into effect. In addition, the current requirement that contributors be informed of any changes before they take effect will now only apply to changes that are or could be detrimental to the interests of all or any of its contributors. The second proposed modification replaces the current detailed examination of proposed rule changes under the National Health Act 1953 with a system of monitoring against performance indicators. These are yet to be developed but will most probably include measures of complaints to the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman; changes in premiums paid by age cohort; changes in the number of persons insured in each age cohort; changes in the number of episodes, and episodes per 100 members, in each age cohort; as well as changes in the nature of episodes and changes in benefits paid per member and episode in each age cohort.
On that point, I also recall that the member for Ballarat, as part of the justification of why she felt that the private health insurance rebate was not performing adequately, referred to the number of complaints with respect to health funds. I take this opportunity to highlight that of course the number of complaints with regard to private health insurance funds increases, because there has been a large increase in the number of people involved in private health insurance funds. The more meaningful analysis is to take the number of complaints as a percentage of those involved. But to come in here and say, `Look at the large increase in the number of complaints made against health insurance funds,' whilst not for one second even considering the number of people who are actually in the private health insurance funds, is to give a false measure. It once again gives me the opportunity to reiterate that the Labor Party are not concerned with factual information or with putting the truth out there so that the Australian people can have an informed point of view; rather, they would run around spreading half truths, hoping that it helps their case.
I come back to the core of the bill. It also expands powers available to the minister to investigate and impose sanctions on a fund that breaches the NHA. I will not go through all of those particular aspects. The second limb of the bill, as I indicated earlier, is to expand the powers available to the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman. Current functions for the PHIO include the ability to deal with complaints and publish aggregate information on complaints, conduct investigations, and make recommendations about regulatory practices and industry practices relative to registered health insurance funds. This bill expands the powers so the ombudsman will have greater authority in dealing with complaints and disputes. In particular, new sanctions are proposed for health funds that fail to comply with requests from the PHIO. The passage of this bill will mean that the PHIO can require reports from health funds, hospitals and doctors on action taken on recommendations made by it. So whilst the bill does not increase the power of the PHIO to make funds comply with recommendations made by the ombudsman, the power of the PHIO to report to the minister provides a very clear avenue for action to be taken subsequently.
The final limb is the establishment of an annual `state of the health funds' report. The aim of this report is to provide some comparative information on the performance of health funds. It is about providing information to the marketplace in a factual way so that it can make an informed decision. The report will be compiled by the PHIO, and negotiations about the format and content of the report are currently being negotiated between the ombudsman, the Private Health Insurance Administrative Council and the health funds. It is expected that the report will embrace three broad areas, including the financial status of funds, general service indicators and product information.
The final point is subsequent to the main provisions contained within the legislation. There are also some changes to the Lifetime Health Cover. Some concerns have been raised in the past that the LHC legislation, as drafted, unintentionally disadvantages certain people, including, for example, people who are overseas on their 31st birthday or those who have resided overseas for a long time, new migrants, veterans holding gold cards et cetera. The changes to ensure that these people are not disadvantaged are incorporated in this bill.
I am pleased that the ALP is supporting this bill, but I would reinforce the point to all Australians, and certainly to my constituents in Moncrieff on the Gold Coast, that the Labor Party, if elected to power, would certainly rip the guts out of the private health insurance system and the consequence will be an even longer wait when you go to a public hospital. In the same way that the state Labor Party in Victoria drove the Victorian health system into the ground, you will see that occurring across the country as tens of thousands of people transfer from private hospitals to public hospitals and public hospitals have to compete for even more resources than they currently need. This is a good bill, and the private insurance rebate is an important measure. I commend it to the House.",REPS,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE REFORM) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"George, Jennie, MP",ALP,2004-02-11,"—The measures outlined in the Health Legislation Amendment (Private Health Insurance Reform) Bill 2003 are not contentious and, as our shadow minister has indicated, have the support of members on this side of the chamber. One can only hope that the provisions will lead to better management practices in the private health industry sector. I am pleased that there will be indicators established for the monitoring of the performance of funds—something that is pretty well nonexistent at the moment—that there will be better mechanisms for investigating and acting on problems identified in the sector and that, very importantly, there will be better treatment for consumers by the provision of additional powers to the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman. Those parts of the bill are not contentious, and I want to concentrate my remarks in this debate in support of the second reading amendment moved by the member for Lalor.
On this side of the chamber, we believe that there are obvious failures in the government's policy position in the area of private health provision. Some of those obvious failures require the urgent attention of the government, and the Labor Party has certainly committed itself to a review of the effectiveness of the now quite considerable outlays to the private health insurance sector. This is an important issue of public policy because the outlays now being provided are over the $2 billion mark, so a quite sizeable contribution of taxpayers' funds is going into that sector. Ultimately, we are all accountable for deciding whether that money is being spent to achieve the best health outcomes in a way that is equitable and fair for all Australians.
We have to ask ourselves whether the nation's citizens are getting the best value and best quality of health care for this huge outlay and through the concessions that come with the 30 per cent rebate. We have to ask, for example, whether that rebate is delivering equitable and efficient outcomes. I think not. I do not think it is as good as it can be at the moment. That is why the shadow minister has indicated that we are involved in an ongoing review of the rebate, but not in the way that the member for Moncrieff pretends would be the outcome. There is no suggestion that we are going to deny people access to private health insurance if that is what they choose. But we are saying that it is a legitimate position to apply our collective minds to whether the outlays being put out there to the sector are having the impact and outcomes that are desirable for all. It is on that issue that we have a different policy approach to that taken by the government. Put simply, you can see that contest of ideas within the parameters of what we believe in: that is, the principle of universal provision funded on the principle of capacity to pay through the taxation system and then, on top of that, for those who choose to take out private insurance, that additional benefit—but not at the expense of the legitimate need for public outlays to provide the best possible public health services.
In contrast to that, and as we have just heard in the statement by the member for Moncrieff, is the emphasis from the other side on private provision, where market choice is supported by government provision and underpinned by the provision of safety nets for those deemed to be decidedly poor. Universality is Labor's way; private provision is really the centrepiece of the government's approach to the provision of health care. Historically, it has been Labor governments that have given effect to the principle of universality. Almost 30 years ago, when we first created Medibank, it was the conservative parties then, as now, who were intent on dismantling and wrecking universality of provision in favour of the centrality of private provision. We first saw it when Mr Fraser was the Prime Minister with his dismantling of Medibank, and now we see it—although not as overtly, but certainly the end result is the same in this government's strategy—in this government's attempts to dismantle Medicare as a universal health system. We see it in the debates in both chambers over bulk-billing becoming more selectively applied and we see it in the introduction of the government's safety net proposals. We consistently argue that safety nets apply when we concede that the main system is flawed and not working. We have seen it in this government's funding cuts to the public hospital system—a substantial cut in the forward estimates to the public hospitals in the last budget of almost $1 billion. Inevitably, we are going down the track of a two-tiered, Americanised system of health care.
What does that Americanised system provide for the average family? At the core of the system in America that the government seem so keen to replicate is the concept of private insurance—if you can afford it or if you are lucky enough to have coverage at your workplace. At the other end is Medicaid, their equivalent of the safety net that we are talking about. Medicaid is a system for the poor, except that in that country that means some 34 million people and `poor' means really poor—in many states Medicaid is provided only to people who are well below the poverty line. In the middle are languishing some 43 million Americans who do not have the capacity or the means to be privately insured. Two-thirds of those who languish in the nether land are people from working families on low to moderate incomes for whom insurance is either unaffordable or unavailable.
That is exactly where this government would have us head, despite the fact that it would be clearly against the interests of the majority of our families and our communities and clearly against what Australians have said very forcibly on numerous occasions: that is, that they wholeheartedly support Medicare and its universal provisions. In my experience and from what I hear from the people I talk to in my electorate, most people take out private health insurance for the sake of personal security, in case they get very ill and when they fear that access to a public hospital may be problematic. However, might not the $2.3 billion spent on the rebate be better allocated in a manner that relieves that insecurity?
At the moment, wealthier people are receiving substantial tax breaks for insurance cover that allows them to access all treatment except emergency hospital treatment more quickly than uninsured families on low incomes can. Of course, there are the low-income families and pensioners in my electorate and elsewhere who scrape together the means to purchase private health insurance for personal security. Yes, the rebate offers indirect financial benefits to families who are struggling to make ends meet and its loss would have some negative impacts for those families, but is the system as it is operating good public policy? Is the $2.3 billion being spent to provide the best health outcomes for all in this nation? I think there are genuine equity considerations at stake. ABS figures show us that 82 per cent of the top fifth income bracket families have private cover while less than 30 per cent of the bottom fifth are insured. Yet all taxpayers—including those who have no insurance, who are on low incomes—are subsidising benefits that are provided by the funds to those who can afford to be covered.
It is ironic that low-income families in my electorate who cannot afford private health insurance—and, indeed, who are often the people languishing on lengthy waiting lists for even basic dental attention—are cross-subsidising people who, up until now, have been able to claim returns on their gym shoes, yoga classes, golf clubs, aromatherapy and iridology. It was only Labor's consistent highlighting and exposure of these rorts that led to a tightening of the rules about concessions for those lifestyle benefits. At the moment the whole community is contributing to private health insurance for the less than half who have private cover.
It is timely that we put this government to the test and examine the arguments that they put forward in support of the $2.3 billion outlay on the private health rebate. The major argument that one hears from the government—and that one has just heard from the member for Moncrieff—goes along these lines: that we provide the rebate so that it will increase the number of Australians holding private health insurance and, as a result of greater numbers with private health insurance, we will take the pressure off the public hospital system. Does that assertion actually stand the test of any rigorous analysis? I believe that if the member for Moncrieff had examined some of the data and analysis he would not have come to the conclusion that it is the rebate that has been the main driver of the increase in private health membership.
Not too long ago there was a study done by the ANU which came to the conclusion that the rebate did initially lift private health coverage, but only by around two percentage points, from 30 to 32.2 per cent—a very marginal outcome for the cost involved. In fact, the study showed that it was the impact of the rather punitive lifetime health cover policy which really was the driver for the increase to what it is at the moment—about 43 per cent in private health funds. It is ironic, because it was the stick not the carrot that did the trick. What got people back into the private health insurance stream was the prospect of being locked into higher premiums if they took out insurance later in life. It was that policy change, the lifetime health cover policy—which in fact cost the government nothing—that drove larger and larger numbers of people into private health insurance.
A recent review commissioned by the government's own health department said it all, in these words:
... a government-funded reduction in premiums appears to have had a much more muted effect on private health insurance uptake than an unfunded announcement of an increase in premiums.
One could conclude that the government's goal of increasing private health insurance could have been achieved without any spending, let alone the expenditure of the huge amount of taxpayers' money that goes into the private health insurance rebate. One could only imagine what better health outcomes could have been achieved if these funds had been redirected to bolstering our public health system, say, or providing dental care for the half a million Australians who are languishing on waiting lists. So let us not get too carried away with the idea that it is the rebate that has driven the increase in private health fund membership. All the analysis points to the lifetime health cover—the stick—being the driver. Again, I pose the question others have posed: could the increase well have been achieved without the huge outlay that we have seen?
The government's lifetime health cover policy worked initially because it was punitive and coercive, but is it sustainable? As the report mentioned earlier points out, the current analysis shows that there has been in fact some deterioration in the membership profile of funds. The most recent figures, which analyse the period between September 2000 and June 2003, show that the proportion of the population in private funds has remained almost static at 43 per cent, but this masks a downward trend—in younger members exiting health insurance funds. People over 30 are in fact quitting in droves. Over 46,000 of those aged between 30 and 34 have dropped out—a decline of 8.5 per cent. The biggest fall in membership of funds has been in the 35- to 39-year old age group, with nearly 97,000 fewer members. In total, almost a quarter of a million Australians in the 30- to 54-year-old age group have dropped out of private health insurance since September 2000, despite the punitive coercive measures forcing people who do not join to pay higher premiums and the surcharge for those who do not have private coverage. Again I ask the question: is the rebate the driver? Even with a coercive policy, one has to explain why so many people are dropping out of the funds, saying they are not getting value for money.
But the real concern in terms of public policy is that the highest increases in membership growth are occurring in the 65 and over age groups—the people, like those in my electorate, who believe that taking out private health insurance is some form of personal protection. But it becomes a roundabout circle, because the more we rely on those aged 65 and over the more the premiums will rise, as an inevitable consequence, and the more the premiums rise the more people will say, as they do in my electorate, that they are not getting value for money.
The funds at the moment are failing to draw in new members when they turn 30. People aged 30 and over are quitting in droves and those aged 65 and over are accounting for the increases in fund membership. Obviously, older and sicker members will continue to drive up the cost of health insurance, and the more the premiums rise the more the rebate will cost all taxpayers, because there is no cap on it. The funds come along, the premiums increase, and the government is committed to a 30 per cent rebate. So the $2.3 billion outlay is inevitably going to increase. It is already double the figure estimated when the rebate was first introduced. Providing an open-ended cheque to the funds by way of a 30 per cent government subsidy for every premium rise is, in my view, hardly an invitation to the funds to do things better.
The second major argument that has been used by the government to support the rebate is that it would make private health insurance more affordable. Let us examine this assertion, because it is as shaky and flaky as the first. The Prime Minister promised that health insurance would become more affordable and private health insurance would become more attractive across the board, because it would ensure that, as more people joined, the premiums would be driven down. That is another broken promise, because that is not what is occurring. Premiums continue to rise by, on average, around seven per cent to 7½ per cent. Those figures are the on average rises, but many people, including some in my electorate, have had their premiums go up by 15 per cent. On average it is seven per cent, despite the fact that inflation has been around the three per cent mark. So premiums are not coming down; they are going up, and they will continue to rise as more and more people in that 30 to 50 age bracket leave those funds.
On top of that, of course, there is now no justification required for funds to seek an increase, providing it is within the ballpark figure of CPI increases. So the funds do not have to account to government: it is not a political decision that is made; it is just a big tick that comes, providing they are in line with CPI increases. There is an obvious lack of accountability, regulation and monitoring of the funds. The increases do not have to be justified against health outcomes and there is no pressure on those funds to contain their administrative costs. It is no wonder that in a survey I conducted in my electorate 62 per cent of my constituents said they were not receiving value for money from their private health funds.
Finally, the other argument that is used is that all this is going to relieve pressure on the public hospital system. No-one believes that any more. You only have to go to your local public hospital to understand the strains that they are operating under. So in terms of this debate our appeal to the government is not to run a scare campaign but to have a look at the arguments that they have used consistently to bolster a quite sizeable outlay of public funds on the private rebate. Equity and effectiveness have to be key considerations in that review. Good public policy demands no less than that, for ultimately we are accountable for the way we shape our health system and where we direct our financial resources.

"Tuckey, Wilson, MP",LP,2004-02-11,"—Let me say, in commencing my remarks, that I wish to record my support for the amendments which have been detailed by members as I have sat here and, of course, my commitment to the coalition policy as it relates to Medicare. Having said that, I am very interested in the comments of the member for Throsby in terms of the remarks I want to make that highlight many of the areas we might be able to look at were we ever—and I am not suggesting we will—to consider a more simple universal policy.
The member for Throsby has been at pains to raise the horror of the American system. She did not mention the huge effect on cost that the litigious nature of America imposes on their health system—not only in legal costs and financial settlements but in the fact that overservicing is rife, simply to insure against litigation. When your knowledge says that one test is necessary, you give 100 tests to a patient, for fear that you will be sued for not giving the other 99. It has been proved beyond doubt in America that, where some of those claims have been capped, the cost of providing medical services has dropped considerably.
The member for Throsby also chose to say that premiums were going up in the private sector and then gave the reason that, under the competing systems of Medicare and private health, there is always the incentive for the young and the healthy to take the risk on Medicare, because it will normally respond quite adequately to any emergency like being hit by a bus or having a premature heart attack. Of course, her elderly constituents know it is not much help if you want so-called elective surgery, for instance, on your arthritic hip which is preventing you from walking. As that is not going to kill you, you wait your turn to get into a public hospital and have Medicare provide the prosthesis.
These are the fundamentals of the system that we have and that I predict we will have for a long time. It is a bad system which is there by popular choice, but the realities of the member for Throsby's remarks—such as when she said, `These premium rises exceed inflation'—ignore the simple fact that, throughout the world, the cost of delivering health services always does exceed inflation. It is not a matter of inefficiencies: I mentioned the problem of an arthritic hip a minute ago, and the cure for an arthritic hip in my living memory was a walking stick, terrible as that might sound; today, of course, you are in hospital for about four days to get a hip joint replacement. We have heart bypass technology that is now almost routine. We have organ transplants. We have new and massively expensive machinery that contributes greatly to our longevity—and that in itself is another cost to the health services: people live longer and it is during their later years that they put the greatest demand on the health services provision. Typically, the cost of health is totally age related.
That is why it has been my argument certainly since 1988, when I was the shadow health minister, that Australia needs to look at the fundamentals of the way it provides the service, it needs to maintain the service at that level and better and it needs to try to find better ways to do it. I do not expect it. I do not present it to the House as some sort of policy initiative hidden away by the coalition, but I think it is my job, as it was back in 1988, to put some facts on the table. As I mentioned earlier, we have two competing systems. We have a government insurance system; that is what it is. It is called Medicare, and a premium is directly applied which is called the Medicare levy. There is an additional, very substantial burden on the taxpayer and, of course, membership is compulsory. As I said earlier, it provides a good service, provided you are prepared to wait.
A dame in New Zealand who got her honour for services to the health system in New Zealand attended a conference I was present at and made the point—and I wish I could quote her verbatim—that the way that you control the cost of public health services is to restrict them. She made no secret of that whatsoever. She said, `We will have waiting lists, because waiting lists keep our budget in shape.' That is when you have a government provider. On the other side, when you have a federal system and each government is involved in funding the system, we get cost shifting and blame shifting. Everybody hides behind another government, which is not good policy. There is no discipline for the provider of health services—which in the case of Medicare is typically state governments. They are not disciplined like the private sector. The private sector has the discipline of making budgets fit and if necessary paying profits to shareholders. That is the difference: the private sector has discipline. It was interesting to me all those years ago to compare the cost per bed day of a public hospital and that of a private hospital. The actual cost of the public hospital was approximately 50 per cent higher than the private hospital.
So we have a government system, and then we have a private system. As the member for Throsby quite clearly evidenced, the people who are going to make the fewest claims abandon the system on the grounds that they have a backstop and they do not need to pay. The fundamental of any insurance is to maximise the contributors and have a large body of non-claimants and a small group of claimants. So we all, for instance, pay $800, $900 or $1,000—or maybe less—to insure our houses, and we get cover for half a million dollars or whatever. Practically everybody insures their house, but people do not take the same view about their health, simply because they have paid through their taxes for the government backstop. Whilst the member for Throsby talks about a dual system in America, we have one in Australia. Each is bleeding the other of the ability to deliver a better service.
A long time ago in the United Kingdom the government of the day decided that there would be only one service. I think it was called British National Health. They conscripted the entire medical profession. They just said, `From henceforth, you will work for the government.' I had a niece working there for a short period when she was developing her skills as a gynaecologist. On her first day, a woman went crook at her because she had been waiting from three o'clock to five o'clock for her appointment, which had been nominated for three o'clock. My niece went out and said to the receptionist, `I got a nice old telling off there. What was that all about?' The receptionist said, `She was booked in at three o'clock.' My niece said, `How much time am I supposed to give to every patient?' And the receptionist said, `Five minutes.' Can you imagine: five minutes for a gynaecologist—a specialist! That is the way you make the system work: you minimise the service and you create waiting lists. All of that is evident in Australia. And the member for Throsby wonders why her elderly people, who understand that principle, take out private insurance, whether or not they can afford it. But many of them, as she admits, have not taken it up until the age when they are going to take more out than they put in. And you wonder why we have this escalation of premiums. In fact, the rebate, above all else, is of assistance to those elderly people and consequently has my support.
As a consequence of understanding that we really need to put all the available money into one system, and remembering that section 51 of the Australian Constitution forbids the commercial conscription of doctors, dentists and other such professionals—something oft forgotten when people talk about a universal bulk-billing system—there is no rebate that this parliament could impose on doctors for bulk-billing. It would be a breach of the Constitution. Consequently, you cannot implement the dream of the Labor Party, which is equivalent to British National Health where big brother tells you when you can go to hospital and when you can leave, because you cannot conscript the medical profession. So, if you are only going to have one system, the alternative must be private insurance.
I had the privilege of doing the numbers on that option with some of the best advice of actuaries and others in 1988. We discovered that we could implement a three-tier risk based premium structure and, through a premium subsidy system, provide free private insurance to every person under 19 and every pensioner on a fully-fledged pension of whatever sort and 80 per cent assistance on average to every other person of pensionable age. We could also refund the Medicare levy and end up with some hundreds of millions of dollars left over. In other words, we could have given everybody the privilege of private insurance and access on demand to the private and government hospital systems, which would not have been coming up here cap in hand, fighting and blaming, because their revenues would be at the front door, as it would have been for the private hospitals.
It is interesting to speculate on the issue of how that option would have worked out. We had to base our calculations on known bed day costs and all the other service fees and things involved. I thought that I had better look at this in the context of the hospitals that existed in my electorate. So I went and discussed it with them in groups and found that only one hospital, the very smallest, would have been worse off on that principle. All the others would have been better off getting paid per patient than having to fight once a year with the state or federal authorities for a lump sum of money.
Furthermore, there were some disciplines. When government provides a service, the rent seekers will stand up day after day demanding more for themselves in the name of the people they service. They have always done it; they always will. If you pick up the paper, day after day there is some government initiative from either of the parties in this place that is going to cut back on a particular service and the first people that you read about are those that are getting the wages to deliver it. It is never their problem. It is never that some of them are going to lose their jobs. They argue that the people they service are going to be greatly disadvantaged. They are rent seekers. Under my option, there would have been no reason for states to come to Canberra to get any money. The money would be paid to the individuals of Australia to buy their private health insurance—and they would not get it unless they did, obviously. It was a 100 per cent rebate, not a 30 per cent rebate. Once you aggregated all the funds on one side of the ledger, it actually cost less in that year of calculation than the provision of the same service by Medicare. There would have been no waiting lists and, of course, you would have had an excellent system.
I have said that I do not expect it to happen. At the time it was a policy for a short period of time. It was defeated by politics. Nobody was prepared to sit down. The numbers were all properly reviewed by independent categories. They are not all that difficult when one looks at the statistics available. But it is time that we asked ourselves if we can do it better. It should not be a case of, `Can I win a few votes by misrepresenting this situation?' The issue is primarily the cost. The cost can be identified. There are no secrets about it; we know it all. I do not think we want to necessarily save money, but I would like to think that, if we can find better ways of doing it, we would maximise the services.
I had an interview with a woman who was going blind from cataracts and could not get into a government hospital bed for six months. I think that is pretty tragic. She did not have the money to pay a full private insurance premium. Surely, she would have been better off with the government paying her premium and not funding government hospitals and other services through the back door. The government should fund them through the front door. So I put these matters on the record for what they are worth. Private insurance and private hospitals are complementary. Whatever you say, Mr Deputy Speaker, once you let private insurance sink to too low a level, private hospitals will not exist. We have exactly the same situation with private schools. If they are not assisted, they will all close down—as they nearly did in the Menzies era when we had the state aid debate. The reality would be that the state would have to find numerous more beds and numerous more school places.
These arguments are all about who provides the better service. The older people in the Throsby electorate are in no doubt about that, and the admission of the local member, who surveyed them, demonstrates that too. As soon as they start thinking that they are going to need hospital entry, they do not trust the state system. They immediately go and get private health insurance. Many of them could not do so if it were not for the Howard government's rebate, which is as compassionate as it is practical.
The reality is that it is an imbalanced system because people have a choice, and that erodes the fundamental principle of private insurance—or public insurance, for that matter. They are competing when they should be together as a single system. I might be the only person in this parliament who holds the view that the appropriate place—and it is universal—for government to provide assistance is to the individual by way of a premium subsidy relevant to their own capacity to pay. As I have already mentioned, my calculations gave a 100 per cent premium subsidy to a fully fledged age pensioner. We then calculated for a sliding scale, which we reckoned would be about 80 per cent of the premium cost for all other persons of pensionable age. We did not expect that Kerry Packer would get much. Why should he? Why should many of us in this room? 
The reality is that, under the present so-called universal system, you cannot target assistance and you cannot maximise it for those who need it most. That becomes so simple when one looks at a system of individual assistance. I would do it in education; I would do it in everything but, as I said, I might be one of the few who would make that comment. These are the questions I wanted to put to those in the House. They can say all sorts of things about it and they can raise what fear issues they like. But when I, with the assistance of some of the best qualified actuaries and other experts in Australia, sat down and costed a policy of direct premium subsidy, it delivered private health insurance to every Australian. Virtually the only ones who paid the full premium—and that was not much more than their Medicare levy, which they got back—were those aged between 19 and 65 who were in employment. 
A lot of these things have half happened. Lifetime Health Cover has been referred to as one of them. The member for Throsby talked about that as a coercive and punitive process. I do not think it is punitive; I just do not think it is fair at all. I stand here as someone who took out private health insurance, at my parents' insistence, at 16 years of age. I have paid for private health insurance ever since, and so has my family. We believe in it. We do not believe that, at our level of income, we need a great deal of assistance from the government. We are rather grateful for the 30 per cent rebate, but we would have had private insurance anyway. We do not think we should have had to pay only when we were ready to go to hospital, because that does not work. It is like saying that the only people who should insure their house are those who know it is going to burn down. The premiums would be somewhat equivalent to the cost of the house. We have to have all the people in the system. If anybody were to review the numbers I put together all those years ago they would find that it can be done, that it would be better and that we would not have a lot of the problems that arise from having the two-tiered system that we have today.

"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2004-02-11,"—I am pleased to be participating in this debate on the Health Legislation Amendment (Private Health Insurance Reform) Bill 2003. Perhaps I can enlighten members of the government on a number of issues which clearly have not been addressed. 
—Ha!
—I will not have any difficulty enlightening this bloke; he just needs a little tweak and perhaps the light will turn on. The honourable member opposite has recently been through my electorate. 
—The honourable member for North Sydney. 
—I beg your pardon: the honourable member for North Sydney has recently been through my electorate. I was pleased to have him in the electorate. He has been there a number of times. He is a jovial enough character—misguided, but jovial. He is certainly someone who is reasonable company, unlike some of his comrades. He is someone with whom I am prepared to sit down and have a natter and pass the time of day. I hope that in passing through the Northern Territory he actually learned something—not only about the train he was on, very important that it was, but about some of the issues that I am going to talk about this afternoon. 
We have just heard the member for O'Connor enlighten us as to the virtues of private health insurance. We have heard other speakers in this debate, and I took particular notice of the member for Riverina, who spoke this morning. In her contribution she was regaling us about a private hospital in her electorate; I think it was Calvary. In her discussion about this private hospital, which no doubt does very good work, she painted a picture of this hospital as providing access to private medical services for people right throughout her electorate. She said that people in rural and regional Australia were well served by having access to private medicine. Of course, nothing could be further from the truth. In the profitable area in which you live, Mr Deputy Speaker Hawker, there may be a number of private hospitals. If not, there would be reasonably easy access to some because, after all, you live in a part of Victoria which is quite close to other metropolitan centres. 
I wonder whether, as the member for North Sydney took the train through the Northern Territory last week, he pondered a number of questions. I wonder whether he thought about the access to private medical facilities that was available to the people he passed on the railway tracks, the people who were waving at the train as it went by, the people who cheered its arrival in Alice Springs, Tennant Creek, Katherine and Darwin and all places in between. I wonder whether he thought about whether they had access to good private health care. Had he asked himself that question, he would have discovered that, in the 1.4 million square kilometres that my electorate comprises, there is not one private hospital. The good residents, the citizens, of my electorate are in a position where they are required by law to take out private health insurance if they have sufficient income to do so. If they do not, they are penalised. 
We heard much of Lifetime Health Cover, which the previous speaker, the member for O'Connor, spoke about. This bill seeks to amend aspects of Lifetime Health Cover, which began in July 2000. It is important that we note what those proposals are. Part 4 of schedule 1 of this bill will amend the NHA to make a number of minor improvements to the Lifetime Health Cover regulations. These amendments will establish a notional annual birth date of 1 July for the purposes of Lifetime Health Cover. People between the ages of 30 and 65 who join a health fund before the next notional birth date will not incur a Lifetime Health Care cover loading for that year. The amendments will recognise cover provided by the Department of Veterans' Affairs gold card as counting towards hospital cover for the purposes of calculating LHC loading. They will provide new migrants over the age of 30 with 12 months to take out hospital cover without being subject to LHC loading. They will ensure that Australian citizens who are overseas on their notional 31st birthday have a similar 12-month grace period and that Australian citizens who have hospital cover and go overseas for periods of greater than 12 months will not have that time overseas counted towards any potential LHC loading.
I guess that is understandable if you are a supporter of Lifetime Health Cover. In my electorate, thousands of people were passed by the Ghan from Alice Springs to Darwin only in the last week or so. The member for North Sydney was sitting at the window, waving at the crowd as he sped by them in the train, along with his frontbench colleagues Senator Minchin and the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Do you think they would have contemplated the impact of this legislation on the people in those communities? Do you think they might have contemplated what this legislation means for them? Do you think they might have contemplated that the uptake of private health insurance for people in my electorate is something like 25 per cent lower than the national uptake? Do you think they would understand or know that only 32.6 per cent of Territorians have taken out private health care? Do you think they would understand that those figures would probably be distorted because of the Darwin population, who would be included in those figures and who do have access to a private hospital and, compared to the rest of the Northern Territory, which is sparsely populated, would probably be a lot higher in terms of the uptake of private health insurance? Do you think they would understand that? I am sure they do not.
If they did understand it—and they do not—what they would know is that these Territorians are massively disadvantaged as against the rest of the Australian population. If they earn over $50,000 a year and they do not take out private health insurance, of course they have to pay a 1.5 per cent Medicare surcharge. But for what do they pay this surcharge? As the member for North Sydney perambulates out of the chamber, you might just ask him as he leaves whether he understands any of these things and whether, when his ministerial and cabinet colleagues are contemplating the impact of their policies, they have one whit of understanding of what they mean for people who live in remote Australia—indeed, most importantly, what they mean for the people of the electorate of Lingiari.
You have to come a long way to pilfer from the pockets of the electors in my constituency in the way this government are doing. What are they returning to them? Not very much. The corollary of private health insurance, if you have access to private hospitals in the first place, is the question of access to public health and bulk-billing doctors. Up until the first week of February this year there were no bulk-billing private medical practices in the seat of Lingiari—not one. After the first week of February, one clinic in Alice Springs that used to be a bulk-billing clinic is taking advantage of MedicarePlus and will in fact bulk-bill cardholders and children of cardholders. But that is it. That is the access to bulk-billing practices for people in my electorate.
Not only are they paying the Medicare levy and expecting to have access to bulk-billing practices but also they are expected to cross-subsidise the private health care of other Australians who have access to private hospital care. What do they get in return? Not very much. Indeed, they are penalised because of who they are and where they live. This is a government that says to us that it is concerned about the needs of all Australians. It is clearly not. It is clearly abrogating its responsibility to those of us who live in rural and remote Australia. Despite what the member for Riverina thinks, she, like many of her colleagues, has no real understanding at all of what the position is in terms of access to health care for many people who live in rural and remote Australia, particularly in remote Australia. They are in a region, after all, and the government wants to talk about its impact upon regional Australia. I live in a region that is part of Australia—
—It's a beautiful region.
—It is a beautiful region, as you rightly point out, but I have to tell you that, in terms of access to health care services, we are very poorly done by. Indeed, it is worth making the point that, not only do we not have access to bulk-billing doctors, not only are we penalised by the private health care system that operates in this country and not only are we expected to cross-subsidise access to private medicine for Australians like those who live in Hunters Hill, Point Piper or, dare I say, Kirribilli House, who do have access to those private health care facilities, but also we have the absurd situation where rural Territorians, who face the highest GP costs in the country, are threatened and bullied through the Medicare surcharge to pay for private health insurance cover, as I pointed out. Is that fair? Is it reasonable? Is it equitable? I do not hear the government coming out and saying it is, because it clearly is not. But what is it doing to remedy the situation? The fact is that it is doing nothing.
It is worth reflecting for a moment on the urgency and extent of the health problems that face the Northern Territory, and particularly my own electorate of Lingiari, keeping in mind that almost 45 per cent of my constituents are Indigenous Australians. I quote from the Medical Journal of Australia, which editorialised on this issue on 6 October last year:
In quality of life measured by life expectancy, Australia ranks number two in the world, but in healthcare equality we rank number 17. If all Australians had the same health experience as Aborigines, we would rank number 140 in the world, alongside Bangladesh.
This is 45 per cent of my constituents. These are the people who are the most severely oppressed in this country. And what are we seeing from this government in terms of the requirements on them? What are we seeing in terms of the provision of access to medicine? What are we seeing in terms of affordability of access to medicine? The answer is: not very much. Indeed the only bright light—if there is a bright light—on the health care front is in Aboriginal health. Whilst the quote from the Medical Journal of Australia clearly demonstrates how bad the situation is and how well-off in relative terms the rest of the population is, there are changes. These changes are being brought about by the will and determination of Indigenous Australians forcing their views upon governments, not because governments through their largesse have said, `Look, we're going to fix this problem.' It has been a tremendous battle, and it is only being won—if it is being won—because of the way in which these Indigenous Australians have forced the issue.
Whilst people who live in my electorate do not have access to private practices which bulk-bill, it is fair to point out—and I have made the point—that there are a number of medical services funded by the government, community based health services, who do bulk-bill in the remote parts of Australia. But what we do know is that, apart from these community based health services which are scattered in various parts of the Northern Territory—some doing very well, some under pressure; all needing more assistance, all needing more resources—where the government has otherwise failed to provide health care to rural Territorians, another organisation has done extraordinary things to ensure that these people's needs are met.
As the parade got on the Ghan last week and travelled from Adelaide to Darwin, travelling the whole length from the south to the north of Australia in an unprecedented fashion, what they covered was a very sparsely populated area in relative terms. But what they also covered was the area serviced by the Royal Flying Doctor Service. Without the access to private health and unless you are fortunate enough to live in one of these small communities who have access to publicly funded community based health services, what we do know is that people would otherwise be denied access to medicine if it was not for the work of the Royal Flying Doctor Service. Without them and the clinics, the consultations and the evacuation services they provide, people simply would not be able to continue living in the Territory's remote areas.
—My father was a doctor with the Royal Flying Doctor Service.
—I am pleased to hear it. Well, he would understand the sacrifice, and you ought to too. Why haven't you influenced the people in your party room on this issue? Unlike the private health insurance industry, there is nothing inefficient about this operation. I could go on for ages about the inefficiencies of the private health industry, but we have heard enough about that today from other speakers. But I will say to the member opposite that he ought to take pride in the fact that his father worked for this organisation.
—I do. I take great pride in it.
—Take enough pride in it to be an advocate for the organisation in your party room and make sure it gets better funded. I have painted a fairly good picture of how people are disadvantaged in rural and remote Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory, by the way in which this government manages and administers health services. One little thing they could do, at not a great cost in the scheme of things, is provide additional resources to the Royal Flying Doctor Service. It would not take much, but it might actually start to indicate to the people who, as a result of legislation passed in chamber and then in the Senate, pay moneys out of their pocket and are penalised and made to take out private health insurance. You could at least ensure that the Royal Flying Doctor Service is properly resourced.
The Royal Flying Doctor Service base in Alice Springs have been looking to increase their fleet by one plane for the last 10 years. Yet, despite the clear need and demand for their services in the Territory, they are still trying to find the resources to do it. They are also fighting for additional government assistance that will ensure their medical staff are not working dangerously long hours. How can this government justify this situation? On the one hand, as I have said, Territorians' money is stripped from them through the Medicare surcharge to assist and cross-subsidise in effect those in cities who can afford private health cover and have access to private hospitals; yet, on the other hand, an organisation whose services they can access struggles to continue their operation without putting staff at risk.
For a number of reasons, the opposition is supporting this legislation, but let me make it very clear that I am not happy. I am not happy with the lack of services—the way in which this government is dealing with the health needs of people who live in my electorate. I am not happy at all, and I am damn sure they are not happy. It is about time this government, through advocates like the member opposite, who says he has some understanding of the Royal Flying Doctor Service, and through the advocacy of the member for North Sydney, the member for Mayo and Senator Minchin, who travelled through and traversed this electorate last week, understood where they were going through. Instead of just waving and saying, `We're having a great time travelling on the train,' perhaps they could understand what the needs of these communities are. Perhaps they could understand and do something reasonable about the provision of health care for these Australians.",REPS,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE REFORM) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Organ, Michael, MP",AG,2004-02-11,"—I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Health Legislation Amendment (Private Health Insurance Reform) Bill 2003 and must, at the outset, say that the Greens oppose this bill. If the government is to be believed, this bill merely decreases the regulatory burden that the private health insurance funds face by removing the existing regulatory regime and replacing it with strategic monitoring and enforcement arrangements. So out goes direct oversight and in comes strategic monitoring—whatever that precisely means.
The government would have us believe that this bill enhances consumer confidence and protection by providing consumers with more meaningful information about their health funds. Mother Teresa would be proud, until she stepped back and considered just why this otherwise hard-nosed government wants to undertake such a seemingly benevolent act. It is all about spin—something which we in this place may be used to but must never accept uncritically. The Greens realise that when the government speaks of a reduction in the regulatory burden for private health insurance companies it is actually code—or spin—for a reduction in the scrutiny of the health funds. Need I remind the House that the health funds receive over $2.3 billion of hard-earned taxpayers' dollars per annum via the 30 per cent private health care rebate, not to mention the additional $1.1 billion that the Australia Institute has estimated is lost in government taxation when high-income earners take out private health insurance to avoid the Medicare levy surcharge.
So what does $3.4 billion worth of taxpayer scrutiny buy? The answer, in brief, appears to be not a great deal and even less if this bill becomes law. This bill aims to make changes to the National Health Act 1953 and the Private Health Insurance Incentives Act 1998 and, as we have heard in the second reading speech by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer:
Funds will now be free to ... implement changes to products without detailed assessment.
Under current law, health funds are required to notify the Secretary to the Department of Health and Ageing of changes to their constitution, articles of association, rules and products. This seems to be quite a reasonable state of affairs—requirements that in similar circumstances would be expected of, say, a part-owned government enterprise, a statutory authority or a private corporation that receives $2.3 billion worth of taxpayer funds. Imagine if the heavily regulated Australian Broadcasting Corporation were to change the rules governing its board or if ATSIC were to suddenly change its structure. The government would have a fit. But not so with the health insurance corporations, the health funds, that are the recipients of substantial government moneys.
It would seem that the government does not need to know, as under this law the minister proposes to water down these requirements so that health funds will now be required only to advise the health department if they change their rules, not where they change their constitution or articles of association. Also, the current requirement that contributors will be informed of any changes before they take effect will now apply only to changes that are, or could be, detrimental to the interests of all or any of its contributors. This all sounds somewhat vague, if you ask me. And this decreasing regulatory supervision is despite the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman's January to March 2003 bulletin finding that the period of notice given to contributors of changes to fund rules has in the past been `inadequate and unreasonable'.
Let us assume for a moment that the private health insurance rebate is a good thing—something I do not believe. Where is the evidence that supports the government's proposal that the health insurance conglomerates deserve any loosening of the regulatory reins, which is what this bill does? Where is the evidence that taxpayers deserve less control over their $2.3 billion? Is the government seriously trying to assert that $2.3 billion of public health care moneys can be overscrutinised? I know of no evidence provided by the Minister for Health and Ageing to this parliament to support a case for lessening the regulatory scrutiny of Australian health funds. The silence from the minister is deafening. This is because there is no evidence that the health funds deserve or require less public scrutiny.
As I said, the Australian Greens do not support the private health insurance rebate. My colleagues in the other place, Senators Brown and Nettle, recently moved an amendment that would have abolished the rebate, thereby freeing up billions of dollars for Australia's public health care system. Of course, the market fundamentalists comprising the government did not support the amendment and neither did the opposition. Both the ALP and the government support the retention of the private health insurance rebate, though to varying degrees. As a result, our public health system is starved of funds. Sick and ailing, it is being sent off to the poverty ward. Yet the government seems to have its head in the sand in regard to this crisis and, like the poverty crisis facing this country, it is a crisis that the government will not recognise and adequately deal with.
People out there in my electorate of Cunningham know how sick Australia's health care system has become, especially since the coalition government came to power in 1996. They increasingly know what privatisation of the health care system means to them and they know, following the government's philosophy of user pays, that basic health care is becoming more expensive by the day and, in some cases, out of their reach, especially for the poor and those with no private health insurance. The previous speaker told us about issues in areas of regional Australia. It is happening throughout Australia, including in my electorate of Cunningham.
The Greens believe that the private health insurance rebate is a scandal because it wastes mountains of public money in an area where government spending, we are told, is so often stretched for resources. We have heard previous speakers point out that the private health care rebate may save the government money, but it is not serving the best interests of the Australian public. Nobody in Australia was convinced that the government's so-called MedicarePlus spin-doctor-ing was the best that the government could do for the public health care system. Conversely, though, everyone knows that $2.3 billion is a lot of money that could be spent on that same public health care system—a system which is at the heart of our ability to take care of our fellow Australians. This bill is merely another example of the government's abdication of its responsibilities in regard to health. It is also evidence of the government's market fundamentalist ideology.
In my electorate of Cunningham, the medical indemnity insurance meltdown recently resulted in the suspension of urology services at the Illawarra Private Hospital. It should be noted that the Illawarra Private Hospital is the only one in the Illawarra that can complete urology procedures for public patients. This debacle meant that, for a number of weeks, elderly cancer patients in my electorate had to be sent home because there was no indemnity cover for the doctors who were ready and prepared to operate on them. That is right: patients were sent home, to come back at an undetermined time later. Thankfully, following representations from me and general outrage in the community, I understand the health minister stepped in and the issue was resolved—for now, at least. But a number of patients had been severely inconvenienced due to yet another stuff-up in the health system, which is relying more and more upon private hospitals and associated services. This is just one example of the impact of this government's health care agenda.
Another is the MRI debacle. In my electorate of Cunningham, and in the Illawarra region generally, the only MRI or magnetic resonance imaging machine is in a small private clinic located across the road from the large teaching hospital at Wollongong. I am told that patients—public and private—requiring this important service are subject to a three-week wait. I am also told that hospitals in the Illawarra, including Wollongong public hospital, have difficulty using this small private facility during emergency situations. As a result of the urgent and pressing need, the New South Wales state government has recently made available $2.3 million for an MRI machine for Wollongong Hospital, and it should be in place by June of this year. Yet the federal health minister refuses to grant a licence to this important and necessary regional facility. Why? Frankly, I do not know.
Doesn't it seem strange to you, Mr Deputy Speaker Wilkie, that the major public and teaching hospital in the Illawarra region, serving a population of around 300,000, is denied access to an MRI licence by the federal government? With no licence, there is no Medicare rebate to public patients. This is disgraceful. People of the Illawarra will have to wait in line for approximately three weeks and pay more by going to the private clinic next door.
Significant delays in accessing an MRI machine clearly lead to a diminution in the standard of health care available to patients requiring this form of diagnostic assessment. It is a form of assessment that is becoming more and more heavily used by doctors throughout this country. So why does the minister refuse to license the public hospital system's MRI machine in the Illawarra? It seems that it is a simple case of this government protecting the market share of a private operator, despite demand outstripping supply and despite the real needs of the people of Cunningham and beyond—people who need, deserve and expect the highest standards of health care.
Just as we see a diminishing of the regulatory regime for private health care bodies within this bill, so the problems with MRI licences throughout this country and the medical indemnity insurance issue are symptomatic of a government which is too willing to let our health care system fall into the hands of the free market. It is a disgraceful state of affairs and will only get worse for every dollar the minister pours into the private health care system—money which should be going into the public system. The Greens reject this bill because it supports the framework of the private health insurance rebate and is another nail in the coffin of our public heath system and a further attack on Medicare.",REPS,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE REFORM) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Worth, Trish, MP",LP,2004-02-11,"—In summing up the debate on the Health Legislation Amendment (Private Health Insurance Reform) Bill 2003 I would like to thank all those who have contributed to it. I think some strayed somewhat from the actual legislation, and of course we do not agree with all the remarks from the opposition. In particular, the amendment moved by the member for Lalor was predictable, but I am happy to go through a few points which will make it quite clear why we do not agree with her amendment. She talked about the government talking about its policies and downward premiums, but let me give you a few of the facts. In 1985, average premiums rose by 14 per cent; in 1987 and 1988, by almost 20 per cent each year. Since 1996, average premiums have not risen by more than eight per cent in any one year. In 2001 and 2002, they hardly changed at all. Furthermore, when the 30 per cent rebate is taken into account, most members are paying less in real terms than they were before 1999. Surely this is a downward pressure on premiums, and the cost to the consumer of those premiums has been reduced.
The opposition is, as usual, whipping up a scare campaign about premiums. It is trying to say that any change in premiums is some sort of failure. The minister, when asked about this last month, was realistic. He simply observed that in the real world, in which prices change, the cost of services purchased by premiums change from time to time. Health care does not come cheaply. Health costs inflation is running at about twice the CPI—and that is about 7.2 per cent. He did not say that the government will rubber-stamp premium applications. That is misleading and wrong. As the shadow minister knows full well, funds are now required to have any applications signed off by actuaries, and the applications are then gone through just as rigorously by the department of health and the Private Health Insurance Administration Council before they are approved.
The amendment refers to private health insurance funds increasing their premiums by the CPI without the need to seek government approval. This is not the case. Every application is still scrutinised. All that has happened is that the government has streamlined the information required if the increase is less than the CPI. Funds have to demonstrate that even those small premium changes are necessary to keep them in the black. But nobody in any marketplace is going to raise prices just for the fun of it. Even if they have to, they will only do so to the extent necessary to protect their financial position and their ability to meet their obligations to consumers.
As for the comments a number of speakers opposite made about management expenses, most of these funds—in fact, 36 out of 41—are actually not-for-profit funds. They are run on a shoestring, and they keep their costs to a bare minimum, as their members would rightly demand. An average management health fund expense ratio of around 10 per cent is not only reasonable but low compared to many other comparable businesses, including general insurance. As for legislative scrutiny of those increases, there is nothing more to say. This industry is already subject to a very heavy burden of regulation, premium applications are rigorously evaluated whether or not they are over or under the CPI and there are no blank cheques for health funds.
This amendment is meaningless, it is posturing and it should not be supported. But why did the member for Lalor not have the courage to acknowledge the central importance of private health insurance to nine million Australians, including a million Australians on incomes of less than $20,000 a year? An amendment that had truly supported the importance of the 30 per cent rebate and Lifetime Health Cover, had supported the retention of the 30 per cent rebate in its entirety and had recognised that each dollar spent on the rebate saves $2 of federal and state health funding would have truly reflected the will of the Australian community. The Australian community know and appreciate the importance of those who make the decision to take out private health insurance and understand that the 30 per cent rebate helps them significantly. But it would have been an amendment that members opposite could never really have supported because they cannot or will not give that commitment. Instead, they promise to review the private health insurance industry and the private health insurance rebate when all they have to say is just one little sentence: `We will keep the 30 per cent rebate in its entirety.' 
The debate from both sides of this House over this bill has highlighted the differences between the Labor opposition and the government. We believe in a private-public mix; we understand and believe that both are important. It provides choice for the people of Australia, and it saves the public health system an awful lot. Labor cannot give that same commitment and that is why the amendment is quite meaningless. It would have been more courageous for the member for Lalor to say to the House, `We will keep the 30 per cent rebate in its entirety.' The people of Australia will make a judgment on this. I commend this bill to the House and, again, thank those who have taken part in the debate.
 (Mr Wilkie)—The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Lalor has moved as an amendment that all words after `That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The question now is that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question.
Question agreed to.

"Emerson, Craig, MP",ALP,2004-02-11,"—The R1603Workplace Relations Amendment (Simplifying Agreement-making) Bill 2002 was introduced to the House more than 18 months ago on 26 June 2002, and it has remained dormant for that lengthy period of time. Yesterday the government decided it needed to rush the bill into the House for debate today. That is quite curious, and I think it is worth spending a couple of moments pondering the reasons for the government's haste. We know when something like this happens that there are two possible explanations: a conspiracy or a stuff-up. Each is equally plausible in this case. Perhaps speakers from the government side who follow might care to enlighten us as to which of these two explanations is the correct one. The first possible explanation is that bringing a bill on for urgent debate that has been sitting dormant in the parliament for 18 months is a conspiracy. I think there is some evidence of that because this is the third workplace relations bill that we have debated in this House in the last two days. There are a lot of them. This is one of the dirty dozen bills sloshing around the parliament.
If we wish to embrace the conspiracy theory, it is that the government is becoming acutely aware that this is an election year and it wants to get all these bills through the House into the Senate, back into the House and then back into the Senate to create double dissolution triggers. Some weight is given to the conspiracy theory by the fact that the government today secured the passage, against the trenchant opposition of the Labor Party, of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002 [No. 2], which would take over the states' unfair dismissal systems and replace them with a weaker system. So the government is keen to get that back into the Senate because it has already been rejected once by the Senate. Now that it is headed back into the Senate, it is obviously headed towards a double dissolution trigger and there it will join an earlier bill, one of these many Orwellian-titled bills, the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002 [No. 2], which of course allows businesses with fewer than 20 staff to sack their employees unfairly. It is quite plausible that this bill, the Workplace Relations Amendment (Simplifying Agreement-making) Bill 2002, which is being debated on 11 February 2004, is headed in the same direction as one of those dirty dozen bills to go to the Senate, be rejected twice and be assembled in an array of industrial relations double dissolution triggers.
The alternative, of course, is the stuff-up and that is quite plausible too. Let us examine that as a possible explanation for this unseemly haste. I think the basis for this theory is that the government has no third-term agenda and is rushing bills through now, in the first two sitting days of the parliament, because it does not really have much else to do. It has had plenty of time to prepare for this. We have had a very lengthy break over the Christmas holiday period, and here we are back in the parliament and suddenly the government is rushing industrial relations bills into the House because it does not have any other bills to debate. That is also of significant concern if the stuff-up theory is correct, because it simply highlights the lack of a third-term agenda on the part of this government.
I have to point out that not only is this bill more than a year and a half old but it is the third time that the types of provisions contained in this bill have been tried by this government. The first time was in relation to the 1999 second wave of industrial relations legislation, which was that large bill—and again George Orwell was hard at work—called the Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (More Jobs, Better Pay) Bill. That was really designed to ensure that there was not better pay for low-paid workers and that they could fall through the basic safety net that has been assembled for low-paid workers in the Industrial Relations Commission by Labor governments for over 100 years. So it tried that back in 1999 in the second wave of industrial relations legislation, which was rejected by the Senate for very good reason: it was against the interests of the working men and women of this country. The Senate, in its wisdom, rejected that legislation.
But not deterred, the government, obsessed as it is in trying to weaken the capacity of working Australians to bargain collectively, tried again. It tried again with the Workplace Relations Amendment (Australian Workplace Agreements Procedures) Bill 2000, which contained the provisions in this bill that relate to Australian workplace agreements. That bill was one of four bills that were presented after the failure of the second wave legislation. The government hoped that no-one would notice that it had broken up the second wave into a series of bills—the dirty dozen bills. Each bill itself is quite nasty but collectively they present a huge setback to the interests of the working men and women of this country. No matter how much you bring them together or split them up, they are still objectionable and against the interests of working Australians. That is again why the Senate rejected them in their second form. And here the provisions are today, represented as a third bill.
It is worth us spending a little time examining exactly what the bill does. We know that the ideology driving the bill is the government's obsessive dislike of unions, its great love of Australian workplace agreements, its hatred of the very concept of collective bargaining, and its embrace of the concept of individual bargaining. The philosophic basis is the pitting of a single employee with little or no bargaining power against a large employer with plenty of bargaining power. Of course, that is how you make sure that the bargaining table is heavily tilted against the employee, which is essential in making sure that vulnerable Australians compete in the race to the bottom. I have previously referred to the race to the bottom of low skills and low wages. How do you enter Australians in a race to the bottom of low skills and low wages, competing against the countries of East Asia, and make sure they have no bargaining power? That is pretty well what this bill is about: making sure that working Australians, especially vulnerable Australians, have no bargaining power—that they are put in a position of having to accept Australian workplace agreements that are dictated by employers and handed to them on the basis that, if they do not accept them, they will not have jobs any more or they will not be able to take jobs in that particular enterprise.
The bill not only enshrines AWAs but it makes it even easier to make AWAs and non-union collective agreements. It would remove some of the few remaining protections and safeguards in respect of making AWAs and collective agreements. The first of those provisions is that this bill would make AWAs take effect on the date of signing rather than on the date of filing or their approval. This is a significant advantage to employers and a very substantial disadvantage to employees. The bill would change the current practice of AWAs taking effect for new employees only after the AWAs are filed with the Employment Advocate. For existing employees AWAs take effect only once they are approved by the Employment Advocate, but here, if the bill were passed, the government would make a big change such that AWAs would take effect as soon as they were signed.
—If the parties want it to. Be accurate.
—Let us examine the implications of that.
—Yes, a half truth.
 (Hon. I.R. Causley)—The member for Mitchell will be removed if he does not stop interjecting.
—He is a recidivist, Mr Deputy Speaker. If this bill were passed, with AWAs taking effect as soon as they were signed, there would be no scrutiny, no checking and no testing in relation to the no disadvantage test. If the employer said that an AWA was fine and could force an employee to sign it, then that is fine under this bill—that is how it would operate. So it is obvious what the caper is here: to allow an employer to make an AWA, dictate to an employee to sign it; the employee is then forced to sign it and it takes effect from the day of signing, making a farce of the so-called no disadvantage test that is supposed to be applied by the government appointed Employment Advocate—I really should say `employer advocate'.
Labor opposes this provision because it means that AWAs can operate before anyone even considers whether they satisfy that no disadvantage test. It is obviously unfair for the working Australians forced to accept these agreements, and we will oppose this bill. We will oppose it in the House of Representatives and we will oppose it in the Senate. We will do everything we can do within our power to convince the Democrats, the Greens and the Independents to oppose it because it is unfair. It is yet another attempt by the Prime Minister of this country and the Liberal government to strip away the wages and working conditions of vulnerable Australians.
The bill does propose that if the Employment Advocate finds that an AWA fails the no disadvantage test then the AWA stops operating, but in the meantime the employees are stuck with the AWA. We also acknowledge that the bill gives the Employment Advocate a new power to recover money that might be owed to employees as a result of AWAs that are not eventually approved. But surely this whole process just adds an extra layer of administration, uncertainty and anxiety for the employees who are put in a position of having to sign AWAs that could easily fail the no disadvantage test. They are not going to know that until it goes to the Employment Advocate, who probably does not have the resources and may not have the inclination at all to rigorously apply the no disadvantage test.
The annual report of the Office of the Employment Advocate reveals that, for 2002-03, of the 119,000 AWAs filed in that year, 16,530 were not approved. That is a smallish number, but 16,000 is still 16,000. Even the Employment Advocate, who may quite liberally be applying the no disadvantage test, has found cause to reject 16,530 AWAs. The same report tells us that the Employment Advocate aims to process AWAs within 23 days. So, if this bill passes, the scenario that could unfold is that around 16,000 employees who sign an AWA—immediately changing their working conditions and wages—would revert back to their old wages and conditions three weeks later. What a joke! What a farce! What is the point of this? When you look at its farcical nature, what is the point of this legislation other than to just improve the bargaining position for the employers even more and to weaken the bargaining position for the employee—to create a bit more uncertainty and unnecessary anxiety?
One further provision of this bill is that an AWA does not have to be offered on the same terms to comparable employees. That is a further change from the government's first wave of industrial relations legislation from 1996. The Workplace Relations Act 1996 requires that an employer must offer AWAs on the same terms to all comparable employees unless it is unfair or unreasonable not to do so. This provision is one of the few meagre protections attached to AWAs. There are not many, but this is one of the few meagre protections designed to prevent employers victimising employees or favouring one employee over another. Of course, the government wants employers to be able to victimise employees and to favour one employee over another and, therefore, to provide different terms and conditions for AWAs applying to employees in incomparable situations. There is no fairness there whatsoever, but of course this is industrial relations legislation Liberal style—it is the Liberal way. The current provision still allows different AWAs to be offered to similar employees but only where this is fair and reasonable, so we are going to take out `fair and reasonable'. How can the deletion of this very moderate provision be justified? The only basis for justification is that the Prime Minister wants it. He wants AWAs to be able to be used as a tool for discriminating amongst employees and favouring one employee over another. 
The bill goes on to make changes to certified agreements. It downgrades important processes that protect the integrity of collective agreements registered with the commission. These are the certified agreements to which I have just referred. An employer can vary an agreement within a 14-day consideration period. That means that, if this bill were to pass, there would be very substantial changes allowing an employer to vary an agreement. Currently, an employer has to give employees 14 days to consider a certified agreement before they vote on it. This would be substantially diluted if this bill passed and would allow employers to much more readily change the terms of a certified agreement within this 14-day period. Once again, this makes a farce of the whole point of giving employees 14 days to consider the deal. What is the point of employees having 14 days to consider a deal if the employer can change the deal in the meantime? This is pretty mean and tricky stuff. It certainly has not been drafted with the interests of working Australians at heart, it certainly has not been drafted with any sense of fairness in workplaces at heart and it certainly has not been drafted with any sense of harmony in workplaces. All this would do is create conflict and confrontation between employers and employees over certified agreements because the employer could vary the certified agreement within that 14-day period where the employee is supposed to be giving consideration to it.
The legislation would remove a requirement that a union that is party to a certified agreement must approve its variation, termination or extension. Here again we have a ridiculously unfair provision. At present, if employers want to change a certified agreement they have to get the approval of a majority of employees and the relevant union. This bill would remove the role of unions in this process. We should not be surprised about that because the Prime Minister wants to remove the role of unions in all processes. He boasted at a recent address to the Business Council of Australia that one of his proudest and greatest achievements was the deunionisation of the Australian work force, where 18 per cent of private sector employees are represented by trade unions. The Prime Minister does not tell us that that represents 1.8 million working Australians who are proud members of the trade union movement. But here we go—the Prime Minister, through this legislation, is seeking to remove the requirement of unions that are party to a certified agreement to approve variations, terminations or extensions. It is all part of his attempt to deunionise Australia and to take unions out of the bargaining process. There is no other basis for this logic other than Liberal logic.
How could any fair minded person justify excluding a party to a deal from changes to that deal? That is what this legislation would do if ever we had the misfortune of it passing the Senate. The government says in its second reading speech that this is to remove `unwarranted interference by third parties in agreement making'. That was said by the former Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations—a Sensitive New Age Guy who is now in the Health portfolio. Unions are not third parties. If they are party to making an agreement, they are not a third party; they are a party to the agreement. The government is saying that, in the case of unions, parties to the agreement cannot be involved in varying, terminating or extending the agreement. Unions are not third parties; they are representatives of the employees.
The fact is this: the main purpose of this bill is to make AWAs easier to formulate. After seven years of pushing ahead with AWAs, with the assistance of the Office of the Employment Advocate, AWAs still cover less than two per cent of the work force. In fact, they are strongly advocated by the Employment Advocate, including in schools. Late last year the Employment Advocate was writing to schools, encouraging young people to move on to AWAs when they took up employment. There is pretty clear evidence that AWAs are not very popular amongst employees. I could assert that most of the employees on AWAs are on them because they have no choice. This government talks about choice and flexibility, but choice and flexibility Liberal style means choice for employers and downward flexibility for working Australians. Certainly, the AWA is the government's favoured vehicle for achieving that. But the working men and women of Australia have been resisting that to the point where, after eight years now, AWAs still cover less than two per cent of the work force.
We know that AWAs reduce the bargaining power of working Australians. They reinforce an employer's capacity to refuse to bargain collectively. Let us appreciate that, in 1996, in the first wave of industrial relations legislation, this government greatly weakened the capacity of the working men and women of Australia to bargain collectively. This legislation would take that even further. Under this legislation employers are allowed—and in fact are encouraged by the Office of the Employment Advocate—to push ahead with AWAs. An employer is entitled to say to a new employee: `Everyone else employed at this workplace is covered by a collective agreement, but if you want this job you're going to have to accept this AWA.' AWAs allow employers to undermine collective bargaining and to set wages and conditions of employment unilaterally. That is the Liberal way.
AWAs are overwhelmingly used by large employers. Around 70 per cent of AWAs come from workplaces with more than 100 employees. Less than 10 per cent of employees on AWAs are working in small businesses. So we have the Prime Minister's dream of large employers with lots of bargaining power going up against individual employees with very weak bargaining power. AWAs are the primary vehicle in this government's quest for workplace choice and flexibility Liberal style—choice for employers and downward flexibility for vulnerable employees. It is strange, isn't it? The government talks about choice in superannuation and schooling. When it comes to choice in workplace relations it does not mean choice for employees; it means choice for employers. That is why the government opposes the measure that we announced in relation to the right of regular casuals to request a conversion to permanent employment after a particular period of time. The government hates that because it actually provides a choice for employees. All the government is interested in is providing choice for employers.
The current minister might be especially interested to know that when these provisions were proposed in 2000, one of the bodies that took issue with them was the Australian Catholic Commission for Employment Relations. The commission was concerned that provisions similar to those proposed in this bill would result in a situation where employers offered AWAs on a take it or leave it basis. The commission said:
... there does not appear to be adequate safeguards against such behaviour.
The Australian Catholic Commission for Employment Relations was also concerned that the operation of AWAs from the time of signing was `problematic'. The commission's overall concerns with these types of provisions was that they offend some of the core principles contained in Catholic social teaching. For example, the commission said:
... industrial legislation should not act to the exclusion of third parties in the employment relationship, whether those parties are unions, employer associations, private mediators, industrial tribunals or courts, or governments.
As I have pointed out, unions are not third parties. Unions represent employees and should be able to represent employees where the employees want them to. That is decent, that is fair and that is the Australian way, but it is not the Liberal way. This bill offends those basic principles by further restricting the role of unions and the Industrial Relations Commission in collective bargaining. It is unfair, it is unAustralian and it certainly contravenes the principles, the philosophy and the teachings of the Catholic Church—in this case represented by the Australian Catholic Commission for Employment Relations. The same commission regarded as objectionable another bill, the Workplace Relations Amendment (Protecting the Low Paid) Bill 2003, which, if passed, would make it much harder for the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to grant pay rises to the most lowly paid working men and women of this country.
The Workplace Relations Amendment (Simplifying Agreement-making) Bill 2002 offends all principles of decency and fairness. It tries to cut unions out of negotiations, even where the employees have formally asked the unions to be their representatives in those negotiations. It is completely unfair. It will not surprise you at all, Mr Speaker, that I am able to reveal to you that Labor will oppose this bill lock, stock and barrel, as we have opposed all of the other `dirty dozen' bills that this government has so nastily introduced.",REPS,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (SIMPLIFYING AGREEMENT-MAKING) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Jenkins, Harry, MP",ALP,2004-02-11,"—I wish to return to a subject that I have raised on a number of occasions in this place, and that is the inordinate pressure that is being placed on accident and emergency centres at public hospitals because of inappropriate attendances. I have highlighted in the past the pressures that are placed on the emergency and accident centre at the Northern Hospital in Epping, where the numbers of those attending who are classified in categories 4 and 5, which are categories that indicate that they could be best serviced and treated by general practitioners, have continued to grow. The last figures I think I quoted in this place showed that over 40 per cent of the attendances at the accident and emergency centre were in categories 4 and 5. The figures for the 2002-03 financial year show that categories 4 and 5 patients at the Northern Hospital emergency department accounted for 63 per cent of patient attendances.
We have to understand that there are clear reasons this occurs. One of them, of course, is that people are viewing attendance at the public hospital in the absence of bulk-billing doctors as being essential. Another is the chronic need for general practitioners in the area. The Age quoted figures from the Victorian Department of Human Services that indicated that on one calculation the number of GPs per 1,300 people in the city of Whittlesea was 0.52. The reason that 1,300 people is the number used is that the ideal set by the Commonwealth as an approximate minimum for the number of GPs is one per 1,300 people. This was the lowest ratio of any of the metropolitan areas that were tabulated in the Age in January of this year.
I have also put before the House the argument that there is a solution that can be achieved if we can just get cooperation between the state and Commonwealth governments. In this case, the state has done its part. The state government has built a purpose-built after-hours GP clinic in the grounds of Epping hospital. That has been completed for nearly 12 months, but it has not been used for the purpose for which it was built because the Commonwealth has reneged on putting moneys towards the recurring costs.
The other aspect of this debate that I have also put on record before is that the point of view of the person who is fronting at the hospital is that they want to see a seamless system. They are not worried about who is actually footing the bill. For a variety of reasons, they are forced into attending the accident centre. Because of the classification they get, they then wait for a long time. That builds tension. This could be solved if the clinic that has been built could be staffed and therefore used for the purpose for which it was built—as a general practice after-hours service for the region.
The Northern Hospital is a significant hospital. If we look at the electorates in this place that it services, something like 19,000 of the attendances at the emergency department were from the electorate of Scullin in the year 2003. Nearly 11,000 of the general admissions were from Scullin. Nearly 10,000 of the attendances at the emergency department and over 5,000 of the general admissions were from Batman. Something like 13,000 emergency attendances were from Calwell, as well as 6,300 general admissions. The other significant electorate that the hospital is important to is the electorate of McEwen: nearly 11,000 of the attendances at the emergency department were from the electorate of McEwen and something like 5,700 of the general admissions were from McEwen.
Mr Speaker, I do not expect you to remember this, but in a 30-second period I had one Friday in March of last year when the honourable member for McEwen was in this place I challenged her to take up this problem that the local general practice division had a solution for. Now the honourable member for McEwen is quoted as saying that the general practice division has missed the boat because there were four rounds of funding that they should have come forward to. The general practice division had meetings with the previous Minister for Health and Ageing, and this was not offered. There is a chronic need for the Commonwealth to come to the party and put in the $650,000 recurring funding that is required for the after-hours general practice clinic to go forward. As I said, under our federation sometimes we have things where people want to cost-shift. We do not want arguments about this. Because of the Commonwealth's control over general practice it has a clear responsibility to be involved in this project.

"Sawford, Rod, MP",ALP,2004-02-11,"—I received a request from a constituent, Ramon Beckoff of Woodville, to present a copy of all or part of a letter he has sent to the Prime Minister. He has written to the Prime Minister concerning the situation affecting ex-service men and women who receive a disability pension. It appears to him that the government is working to double standards. He states that a World War II veteran on a disability pension is not classified as receiving direct income, whereas a World War II ex-serviceman, such as himself, on a disability pension has his pension classified by Centrelink as direct income. I quote his letter:
Service personnel such as myself and others were required to remain on Australian soil to service aircraft, shipping and armoury to be sent to a war zone. Had we not done this (and I had volunteered for overseas service) the forward troops in the war zone would have no serviceable equipment to fight the war.
Mr Beckoff contacted the Clarke commission in Adelaide. He was advised that disability pensions were on the list for the inquiry to be reported to government. He waited months to obtain a copy of the relevant section and noted that Justice Clarke recommended to the government that ex-service men's and women's disability pensions not be treated as direct income. That is a significant change that may have legal ramifications. I quote again from Mr Beckoff's letter:
I am disappointed that the government has not yet responded to the Clarke Report. Why is that the case? When will the government respond? I am a 100 per cent disability serviceman with a 100 per cent disability pension and with further disabilities facing me—fully diseased arteries and blockages in both legs.
Mr Beckoff pointed out that if he applied for an extreme disability allowance through the Department of Veterans' Affairs and received a 150 per cent disability, he would lose over half of the extra money, as it would be classified as direct income by Centrelink. Surely that should not be an intended consequence. Further, he asks if the direct income situation will continue. That of course would make a mockery of the setting up of a commission of inquiry to travel the length and breadth of the country. Mr Beckoff said, `Surely the government would not disregard the commissioner's report.' We on this side of the House, and ex-servicemen like Mr Beckoff, will wait with interest for the government response on the Clarke report.
Another constituent, Arthur Davis of Seaton, suffers from damaged vertebrae in the lumbar region, resulting in spondylosis and arthritis in the damaged area. It is extremely painful and debilitating. Visits to doctors and expensive drugs have failed. His GP recommended a physiotherapist. Eventually hydrotherapy at a local swimming pool and specific exercises were recommended. It worked. Pain elimination was achieved. The cost was $3.60 a session at the pool twice a week, with the cost reimbursed by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. The weekly cost of $7.20 was by far cheaper than GPs, consultations and drugs. However, the veteran informed me last week that this subsidy for unsupervised hydrotherapy will cease as of 30 June this year. Who gave that instruction? Is the minister aware of this proposed action? The government likes to associate itself with what it gives to veterans but is remarkably silent about what it takes away—poor stewardship by the minister and the department, I would have thought.",REPS,<title>STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS</title>,<title>Veterans: Disability Pensions</title>,Statements by Members,24,1,speech
"Emerson, Craig, MP",ALP,2004-02-11,"—The National Measurement Amendment Bill 2003 combines a number of existing agencies into a single National Measurement Institute within the Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources. In principle that sounds like a good idea, and on that basis Labor is prepared to support this bill. The agencies being combined include the National Measurement Laboratory which at present is located within the CSIRO. That laboratory maintains and develops Australia's national standards of physical measurement for mass, area, length, volume, time, voltage and light. It sounds like it does a pretty good, and an important job, for Australia. They also include the National Standards Commission—which administers Australia's measurement system and provides testing and approval for the basic designs of measuring instruments for use in trade and commerce—and the Australian Government Analytical Laboratories, or AGAL, which is currently part of the Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources. AGAL provides chemical and biological measurement services, including support for police forensic work, the Customs Service, sports drug testing and food import standards.
The creation of the new institute was announced in the 2003-04 budget, at a cost of $3 million over the next two years. Labor does see positives, in principle, associated with this proposal, the main one, of course, being a one-stop shop for measurement that can offer efficiencies for government and for industry. We do have a few concerns which will be either accentuated or allayed in time, so it is better to support the legislation and see how it works in practice. I am sure that the government would understand that attitude.
Amongst our concerns is the taking away of part of the CSIRO, which could further weaken its funding base. This problem has been noted previously with concern by Senator Kim Carr. There is another possible concern: many of AGAL's functions are not directly related to the science of metrology. Part of its function is to do independent analysis for law enforcement purposes, which may arguably be better contained within a statutory authority. Instead, this bill retains AGAL's place as part of an executive department. I would not pretend that these are earth-shattering concerns at this stage but I thought that it was worth putting them on the record here in the parliament. When we assume government later in the year, we will take over the responsibility of ensuring that these sorts of concerns are allayed and that we do not have the sorts of problems to which I have referred as potential difficulties.
In that spirit, and in the spirit of speaking in the Main Committee, I am pleased on behalf of the opposition—soon to be government—in the House of Representatives to support this legislation. I speak with a reasonable amount of confidence when I say that Senator Kim Carr, as the shadow minister, might just support it in the Senate. 
This occasion does, however, give me the opportunity to make a few other remarks in relation to the government's management of science, technology and industry development in this country. We are in a very difficult phase in Australia's history in that in the public domain there is a lot of talk of prosperity and a lot of talk about how everyone is doing well. The fact is there is a lot of prosperity in Australia, but it is not being shared evenly. I will not go into great detail about the distribution of that prosperity on this occasion—I have on other occasions and I will again—but I want to talk about the sources of that prosperity and where we are going in the future, Mr Deputy Speaker.
—I remind the member for Rankin that the standing orders only allow for members to speak on the bill. This is not a wide-ranging debate.
—I understand that, and I am going to speak on the role of science and technology in the creation of future prosperity—
—It must be related to the bill.
—It is absolutely related to the bill, because I think the government would say that this is a small step—in fact, a tiptoe—along the path of improving our prosperity by achieving efficiencies within government and for industry in the arena of science and technology. I acknowledge that. I do not think it is a giant stride, I do not think it is a big step, I do not think it is a small step; I think it is a tiptoe. But a tiptoe is still progress and, on that basis, we support tiptoes if that is the best the government can do.
The fundamental problem is that the pre-existing sources of the creation of prosperity in this country have essentially been the restructuring of the Australian economy through the eighties and early 1990s. That has yielded productivity growth in this country over the last decade that is almost unsurpassed in our history, and certainly in our history of recording productivity growth. Much of that—most of it, I would assert—was as a result of the hard reforming work of the previous Hawke and Keating Labor governments.
We now know, and we knew then, that you cannot fundamentally restructure the economy twice, and so we got this one big surge of productivity growth as a result of the economic reform program of the previous Labor governments. We now need to look to the future, because there are disturbing signs of a slowing in productivity growth. The question needs to be asked: what are the sources of modern productivity growth around the world? It is agreed around the world that the main sources of productivity growth in the 21st century are skills, new ideas and infrastructure. It is the area of new ideas to which I turn in the remainder of my contribution to this debate.
—I would have to say to the member for Rankin that I am looking very closely at the bill and I can see where it talks about systems of units, units of measurement and industry scientific organisation utilisation of measurement. I do not see anything about productivity, which the member is trying to bring into it.
—Mr Deputy Speaker—
—I will not debate the issue; I am just saying that if the member does not come back to the bill I will sit him down.
—Of course. I am talking about the measurement of productivity, Mr Deputy Speaker.
—That is not in the bill.
—Productivity growth is slowing in this country. I will not continue at length, but I do want to make the point that productivity growth is slowing in this country. We do need big new investments in research and development in this country. If you look at the widening gap, the yawning gap, between private sector spending on research and development in this country as compared with the OECD countries, you will see that there is a very disturbing pattern. We do need a government which will invest in the future sources of productivity growth. I have found that over the last few years, and in terms of any agenda, little evidence that this government is interested in investing in those new sources of productivity growth. That is why we need a change of government. That is why at the next election the people of Australia will change the government. They will then have a government that will invest in skills formation in this country, that will invest in research and development and that will invest in infrastructure.
For these reasons and against this broad canvas that I have just painted, where this is—to use another analogy from former Prime Minister Keating; he was into the big picture—a fine brushstroke contributing to the big picture, we support this. But only Labor will create the new big picture for a modern Australia, for a prosperous Australia, for a fair, tolerant and compassionate Australia.",REPS,<title>NATIONAL MEASUREMENT AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1,speech
"Georgiou, Petro, MP",LP,2004-02-11,"—I would like to begin by thanking the member for Rankin for his contribution. It is nice to see that there is a capacity for bipartisanship and that, more particularly, even when there are some potential hesitations, the opposition is willing to take a `suck it and see' approach. I do welcome his contribution, although I am not sure about his attempt to extend the standing orders.
I would also like to commend the parliamentary secretary's sense of humour. In his second reading speech on the National Measurement Amendment Bill 2003 the member for Leichhardt, who is sitting next to me, noted:
The National Measurement Institute will be a significant milestone in the history of measurement in Australia...
It is unfortunate that the honourable member's radicalism in terms of his ties is not matched by an equal capacity to move forward in the use of colloquial English. We have, of course, moved from imperial to metric measurements in terms of distance. They are great ties, nonetheless.
The point remains that the establishment of the National Measurement Institute, which is provided for in this bill, is an important achievement in measurement in Australia. As announced in last year's budget, the institute
will establish, maintain and disseminate national measurement standards, provide pattern approvals and calibrate measuring devices. It will also develop chemical and biological reference standards as well as provide chemical and biological measurement services.
The National Measurement Institute will receive $3 million from the existing resources of the Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources for its establishment, and the existing funding of the organisations which will be incorporated into the institute will constitute ongoing funding for it.
When I first skimmed the bill I was a bit confused because I read it as establishing the position of Chief Meteorologist, which I understood to be something to do with the measurement of weather. One of my staff kindly advised me that, in fact, this legislation creates the position of Chief Metrologist. She also told me that I could not use my standard defence of having learnt English as a second language since both words were derived from Greek. As we all now know, metrology is the science of measurement and the chief metrologist will be a leading scientist with expertise in metrology. He or she will be responsible for Australia's measurement standards, supported by measurement scientists in the National Measurement Institute.
The National Measurement Act 1960 and its regulations define the units of measurements that Australians use in trade and legal transactions. Kilograms and metres spring readily to mind, but others include the second; the candela, which measures the intensely of light; the kelvin, which measures temperature; and the ampere, which measures electrical current. We do take for granted the importance of measurement of quantities in trade and commerce, and we do expect that the measurements that affect us daily in our personal lives or business will be accurate, including the amount of petrol, water and electricity we buy and sell. In trade and commerce, measurement also extends to ensuring consistency and quality of traded products. For example, food must be free of contamination, and in grain and coal moisture content is a significant issue.
Beyond trade and commerce, measurement is also essential to disease diagnosis and health care; the accuracy of speed cameras—which is something of an issue in Victoria—and breath analysers used by police; forensic science and detecting the use of drugs in sport; food safety and environmental monitoring; occupational health and safety; consumer confidence and protection; and in demonstrating compliance with international obligations, such as in greenhouse gas reductions. In all these areas it is important to emphasise that the accuracy of measurement requires calibration by reference to a source of measurement of known accuracy. The capacity to measure must be complemented by standards and conformance services to develop and maintain standards for goods and services, and provide certification accreditation for those responsible for quality and accuracy, analysis, testing and calibration.
Currently, responsibility at the national level for physical, chemical, biological and legal metrology is divided among three separate entities: the Australian Government Analytical Laboratories, the National Standards Commission and the National Measurement Laboratory, which is part of CSIRO. By amending the National Measurement Act 1960 and the Science and Industry Research Act 1949, this bill will centralise these responsibilities in a single organisation, the National Measurement Institute. 
The institute will be responsible for maintaining and developing national standards of physical, chemical and biological measurement, providing standards to government and industry, and ensuring, where appropriate that these conform to international standards. The institute will coordinate and implement Australia's legislated national legal metrology framework and contribute to developing and adhering to international standards and the international harmonisation of legal metrology standards.The National Measurement Institute will offer calibration services to government and industry across a broad range of standards at the highest level of accuracy available in Australia. They will provide traceability to international standard units of measurement. The institute will undertake research and development in measurement standards and techniques, and provide training and assistance to industry in the use of new standards and techniques. Finally, the National Measurement Institute will contribute to the removal of technical barriers to trade by, for example, negotiating agreements with other countries for mutual recognition of standards and testing regimes. 
As a specific example of its role, the National Measurement Institute will be responsible for maintaining and disseminating Australia's legal time scale, coordinated universal time Australia. It will continue researching ways to improve the accuracy of time measurement, which is essential to determining the accuracy of global positioning systems for exploration, shipping and defence.
The current diffusion of metrological responsibilities across three organisations has drawbacks which the creation of the National Measurement Institute will address. Already there are industries, such as the power industry, which require measurement services from more than one of the existing organisations. This, together with the growth in new technologies such as biotechnology and nanotechnology, exacerbates the inconvenience of having multiple entities with metrological responsibilities. With the establishment of the National Measurement Institute, industry will have a one-stop shop for measurement services. Existing Australian industries will no doubt appreciate this, and it will also add to Australia's attractiveness for new industry investment in Australia, including in budding industries such as biotechnology. On the introduction of the National Measurement Amendment Bill last year, the Canberra Times reported that:
Industry had been pushing for the agencies to be brought together so there was better coordination between them.
The new institute, according to its web site:
... will collaborate closely with industry clients to ensure its science base, its skills, its expertise and its services are responding to industry needs ... and are providing leadership in making technologically advanced standards and techniques available to industry.
The driving goal of the institute will be to keep Australia at the leading edge of innovation in all fields of measurement in support of national industry development and expansion of international markets for our goods and services.
As well as creating benefits for the users of national measurement services, the creation of the National Measurement Institute will have benefits for the organisations themselves. New technologies do not fit neatly into traditional disciplines. The amalgamation of measurement services in the National Measurement Institute will facilitate interdisciplinary work for new technologies. It will capitalise on synergies between the activities of the existing three organisations, and enhance its potential to win tenders for multidisciplinary research and consulting projects. Having a single national unit rather than three responsible entities will better enable a coordinated approach to the network of bilateral and multilateral international arrangements concerning measurement.
In 2000, Australia's Chief Scientist, Dr Robin Batterham, reported on the capabilities of science, engineering and technology to meet the needs of Australians in the 21st century. Dr Batterham observed that the National Measurement Laboratory:
... faces a constant challenge in developing and upgrading standards to meet the demands of industry and the community, in the context of the rapidly changing global knowledge base.
Noting the fragmentation of physical, chemical, biological and legal metrology across three organisations, the Chief Scientist observed:
Consolidation of these activities into one organisation would create critical mass and strengthen Australia's metrology infrastructure. This would have strong positive benefits in terms of the contribution metrology makes to the national interest.
Accordingly, he recommended:
That a national measurement institute be established to consolidate chemical, physical, biological and legal metrology into one organisation.
This bill would see the realisation of the Chief Scientist's recommendation, and I commend it to the House.",REPS,<title>NATIONAL MEASUREMENT AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1,speech
"Entsch, Warren, MP",LP,2004-02-11,"—in reply—Firstly, I thank the members who have contributed to the debate on the National Measurement Amendment Bill 2003. I certainly hope that the importance of creating a national measurement institute is well understood. I would particularly like to thank the member for Rankin, who certainly noted the positive aspects of the amalgamation of the National Measurement Laboratory, the National Standards Commission and the Australian Government Analytical Laboratories. He recognised the outstanding contribution that each of those agencies has made and also recognised the value of a one-stop shop. I would, however, like to reassure the honourable member for Rankin that the amalgamation will not weaken the CSIRO's funding base; in fact, it will have a zero sum effect on the CSIRO.
The member for Kooyong made an outstanding contribution. He highlighted his very in-depth understanding and appreciation of the value of measurement, standards and analytical services in this country. I do have to apologise for my faux pas and stand corrected. I think it should be noted that it was not a milestone that I was talking about; it was in fact a `kilometre stone'! I hope that satisfies the concerns of the honourable member for Kooyong. The honourable member also highlighted the benefits of a single national institute that will meet the needs of the business community and of our national scientific community. He also highlighted the fact that the operation of the National Measurement Institute is clear evidence of the government's commitment to advancing science and its support for innovation in industry.
The National Measurement Institute will provide a focus point for metrology in Australia and will be the premier source of advice and services to the government on measurement issues. It will represent Australia in international metrology organisations. Measurement underpins nearly every aspect of commerce, trade and industry, as was highlighted by our speakers. By bringing together the organisations concerned with measurement, we will strengthen our support for trade and investment and provide a more coordinated and effective approach to supporting manufacturing and service industries. The formation of the National Measurement Institute recognises the growing need for expertise in physical, chemical and biological measurement to support innovation in new technologies such as biotechnology and nanotechnology.
The bill creates a statutory role of Chief Metrologist to provide scientific leadership and to ensure that key measurement functions are the responsibility of a leading scientist. The institute will become an important part of the industry department, thus strengthening the links between measurement, science and government and industry policy.

"Cadman, Alan, MP",LP,2004-02-11,"—In Australia the number of marriages taking place per year has for the last 10 years been 110,000 to 115,000. The number of divorces which have also taken place over that 10-year period has gradually increased from about 42,000 to 49,000 in 2000. The number of divorces involving children is almost the total number: they nearly all involve children to some extent.
This inquiry into child custody arrangements of the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs exposed some intense hurt and pain from dreadful personal relationships that had soured and, in some instances, gone to violence, noncommunication and a sort of warfare between separated partners in which the children became involved and were one of the weapons used by parents against each other. Of the 597,000 families who had a child with a natural parent living elsewhere, 41 per cent received no child support, 42 per cent received cash child support and a further 16.3 per cent received only in-kind child support.
Whilst the statistics are interesting, it is really the interpersonal relationships that were the focus of the committee's attention. We have had representations, certainly on our side of the House, for a number of years now from fathers who do not have the custody or the care of their children about the unfairness of the system. Investigations have indicated that there are certainly strong elements to say that those fathers have good reason for their complaints. But, on the other hand, there are instances where fathers, or the non-custodial parent, have failed to live up to their obligations and made life excruciatingly difficult for the custodial parent.
The committee came to this issue and decided that there were two distinct areas that needed attention: existing cases where there are court orders and arrangements in place, and cases that are yet to come before the court or yet to be decided where change offers the greatest scope and prospect to get a new environment and ethos operating. So the two areas had to be dealt with. It would be no surprise to the House to hear me say that the prospective cases, where we could bring significant change, offered the greatest opportunities for us to try to ameliorate the problems.
Australia has a system where the court intervenes in family break-ups more specifically and with more detail than any other nation on earth. As far as I can make out, in Britain, the United States and Europe there is generally a more conciliatory attitude adopted by the family law acts. Around the world, parents are told by the courts and by the structure of family law in their country, `It is your problem, so you need to try to resolve it.' In Australia, however, the court is likely to intervene at a very early stage and people have access to the court at a very early stage. In some instances, the court seems to delight in taking early intervention. That is something that this committee believes should be changed.
Despite the best efforts of the parliament in 1995 to bring changes that reflect a more congenial approach, a better sharing by parents of responsibility for the future of their children, there is little evidence that that has had any impact on the courts or the outcomes whatsoever. But this committee is more serious about bringing change.
The Family Court of Australia has had an opportunity to try to implement those previous decisions of the parliament, and the parliament now has considered the issue and thinks that the court ought to be more strongly addressed in its responsibilities. Firstly, for existing cases we need to look at what the benefits are one way or the other. The complaints of the dads have been about their access to children. `Non-custodial parents' would be a better term because it does not matter whether they are male or female. There are no gender factors in this process whatsoever. I will use the term `dads' but it includes any non-custodial parent. Dads want better access to their children, access that is understandable and access that is provided as the courts lay down. The onerous payment of child support where there is more than one family involved is something that needs addressing. If a partner remarries that establishes two families for which they have financial responsibility: a former marriage and court based commitment, and a current marriage. Mums have complaints which are justified: non-compliance by fathers in payment and also hiding income and failing to live up to the responsibilities of a parent.
How do we resolve these? What the committee decided for existing cases was basically this: where there are breaches, they should be added up and there should be a cumulative approach to breaches. For instance, if a mother, for spurious reasons, fails to grant access—where there is a contrived process to keep fathers away from children for no good reason—then we believe that the meter should be turned on and, after the third breach within a pattern of deliberate defiance of court orders, consideration should be given to changing the parenting order, so that the father increases his access and increases opportunity, so there is a penalty for non-compliance. Currently there are no penalties; it is all subjective law. The families come before the courts and the judge makes a decision on what he considers may be in the best interest of the children. On property settlement and matters like that it is a very easy process because the court is dealing with factual information, but this is subjective law and the sooner we get away from it for the future the better. But for those in the current system there needs to be some discipline applied, and the court should retain the ultimate sanction of imprisonment. We believe that, harsh though that may seem, there are some people who deliberately flout the law and cause great hardship and trauma within their family. 
In the current system we believe that there should be a cap on the income paid by parents because there is a limit to how much money should be invested in a child. If there is a lifestyle maintenance factor in the payment of child benefits, that should be considered as part of the maintenance for the total family and not related to the care of children. So there should be a cap on the amount that is payable for the maintenance of children and we believe there should be an estimation made on the cost of raising children at various income levels so that benefits paid to custodial parents should be related to the actual cost of raising children.
The committee also believes that the deliberate link between the amount of child support and the time children spend with each parent under sections 47 and 49 should be removed. There is no doubt that the 109 nights syndrome is prevalent and greater access generally will not be given if mothers feel they are going to damage their income by granting more than 109 nights' access the way the scales work. We believe that that factor ought to be removed completely and it should be replaced with a new parenting payment to non-resident parents with above 10 per cent care. 
It is not only the cases which come before the courts that are affected by this 109-night regime, but also cases that do not. There is an 80/20 per cent rebuttable assumption already in the system. It is assumed by practically every male and every female in the nation, encouraged by their solicitors, that the male will have the children every second weekend and half of the school holidays. That is the 80/20 per cent rule that is currently in place. It is a regime that works throughout the system and, despite denials by the Family Court and other people, it is in place and that is the way in which the system is working. We have rejected that approach. Part of the rejection of that approach is to deal with the 109-night factor for residency and the linking of that to benefits and child payments.
We also recommend amending the determination of the payer's child support income. We recommend that it be determined by halving the formula for income earned by way of a second job—provided the first job is 38 hours or more—or overtime. Where there is a second family involved, people work extraordinarily hard and have huge commitments that they try to live up to. Some families break under this process and the male usually becomes unemployed. I believe that some people become unemployed deliberately, to avoid their responsibilities. When the payer becomes unemployed, the minimum payment of $5 a week comes into effect and that is the way the matter is resolved. We have tried, in this system, to toughen the rules applying to child support payments. So there is a requirement here that all sorts of measures to collect funds under the child support scheme should be applied by the child support agency. We do not believe that enough effort is made. We also believe that the minimum payment limit of $5 a week should be doubled. We believe that all decisions of the child support agency should be open to external review. That is what is proposed for existing cases, a substantial change. 
For new cases there is a new regime, a process of assuming that parents have equal say in the future of their children. It is not a rebuttable process but simply an assumption that the law will make sure that each parent has an equal say, and there will be no reasons for them to not have an equal say. From that will flow the concept of equal time spent with parents unless that proves impractical. The parenting plan for the future of the children—involving their education, religious training, type of lifestyle, sports and the friends they will associate with—needs to be developed from day one. Under these proposals, no payments are contemplated for six weeks until a parenting plan is in place. Social security benefits can be paid but there will be no payments or child support until the parents show a willingness to go to mediation and try to resolve their differences. Once that process starts, within the six-week period, payments can start to flow. So there is an incentive there for parents to try to resolve this issue, both for the dad and the mum, or the caring parent and the non-custodial parent, to be able to get together to establish a proper plan. Once that plan is in place it will be capable of variation because as children grow up changes need to be made, but it should be done by way of mediation, conciliation if necessary or, ultimately, arbitration through a tribunal without any support from the legal community. The only support of a legal type that the tribunal can bring is advice to the tribunal itself, where it will seek clarification on points of law. Only on a denial of natural justice should any cases go forward to the Family Court.
This process is enlightened and helpful. My heart goes out to those people currently trapped with court orders in the existing system. If both partners want to adopt the new system they may under our proposal—but the warfare that currently exists can be assisted by a number of techniques including supervised meetings between parents and other processes such as those adopted by Unifam.

"Tanner, Lindsay, MP",ALP,2004-02-11,"—It is with great pleasure that I rise to commend the member for Mitchell and all the other members, both Liberal and Labor, of the Family and Community Services Committee that has produced the report Every picture tells a story. In my view, this is possibly the most important parliamentary committee report that has been handed down in the time that I have been in the parliament. It is to the great credit of all members of the committee that they have come up with a set of proposals that really do offer the opportunity of having a bipartisan way forward to deal with an intractable, extremely difficult and very challenging set of issues that touch the lives of hundreds of thousands, indeed millions, of Australians—issues that for too long the parliament has swept under the carpet.
A division having been called in the House of Representatives—
Sitting suspended from 10.41 a.m. to 10.55 a.m.
—Other than a handful of honourable exceptions, such as the member for Chifley, we in this parliament have for far too long neglected the issues that are dealt with in this report, Every picture tells a story. There are a number of particular themes in this report that I want to comment on in commending the committee—both Liberal and Labor members—for its work and for the ideas and proposals that have been put forward in the report.
Something I am particularly pleased about is that a theme that I referred to in my book Crowded Lives has, quite independently of anything I have done, been picked up by the committee: that is, that the current system of child support, custodial arrangements and access issues is far too heavily focused on financial matters. Although those are clearly fundamental, there is a deficiency in the current system in that it does not deal anywhere near enough with the question of the right of children to have the love and nurturing and care of both parents, regardless of whether or not both parents are living with them under the same roof.
Clearly there will be circumstances where that is not possible; there will be circumstances where that is not desirable. But it is worth noting that there are something like 300,000 children in Australia who either do not see at all or only very occasionally see the parent who is not living in the same home with them. In some cases undoubtedly that will be a good thing, but in many cases it is a tragedy. It is something that can cause significant damage to the wellbeing of the child. It can cause children to grow up with feelings of resentment, of abandonment and of anger and can have a range of negative consequences for their futures as adults in our society.
I believe our society needs to send more signals to people who are in the position of non-custodial parents like me that just because you are no longer living under the same roof as your children does not mean that you no longer have responsibilities as a parent for their upbringing. And these responsibilities are not just financial responsibilities; in particular, fathers are more than wallets and they have responsibilities to their children which go well beyond the question of straight financial contribution. In turn, custodial parents—in most cases mothers—have a responsibility to ensure that the non-custodial parents have a reasonable opportunity to fulfil those responsibilities to their children.
I am pleased to see that the committee has not adopted the initial starting proposal that was put to it about rebuttable 50-50 joint custody, mainly because that is an unrealistic proposition. However much it may have been motivated by well meaning intentions, in the real world that we inhabit it would simply set the bar too high and create a situation where, the bar being set so high, the vast majority of people would not even try and jump. We want people to jump. By setting the bar too high, we create a disincentive to even bother trying.
The concept that the committee has come up with as an alternative is commendable. It is exactly the right kind of approach: the concept of joint responsibility, which means both a say in the upbringing of the child on the part of the non-custodial parent but also a set of responsibilities that go with that. It includes the concept of a parenting plan and a negotiated outcome between the two separating parents that will lead to a longer term set of arrangements designed to ensure that to the maximum extent possible both parents play a role in the lives of their children, both parents contribute to the upbringing of their children and both parents fulfil their responsibility of love and nurturing to their children, regardless of the fact that their relationship has broken down.
We should not be too naive about this. Obviously, every marital or family breakdown is unique and in many circumstances nothing will solve the problem. This is very tricky terrain for legislators because we are dealing with the most emotionally fraught and the most difficult issues that confront people. Nonetheless, we have to do better. We may not be able to solve all these problems for everybody but we have to do better than we have been doing in the past.
The second theme that I applaud in the committee's report is the proposed establishment of a new tribunal to deal with many of the disputes that emerge in family breakdown, separation and custody situations. This has been surprisingly controversial. I think that much of the attack on this proposal has been a little bit self-interested. To me the concept has enormous merit. Inevitably, there will need to be debate about the fine detail—there are some tricky issues to navigate here—but there is no doubt, from my experience dealing with constituents, both custodial and non-custodial parents, that one of the fundamental weaknesses in the existing system is people's inability to get quick, easy, cheap resolution of disputes. That is a fundamental problem. It is a fundamental problem for a custodial parent who is having payments withheld, payments cheated on or false statements made with respect to income. It is an equally fundamental problem for non-custodial parents against whom access rights are being manipulated or children's access is being denied. 
Some of these disputes can be quite minor in isolation but ultimately they are very important in the lives of the people concerned. Even very simple, limited disputes can escalate to major conflict and a situation where one parent uses the child against the other parent as part of that dispute. One of the reasons why that can flourish is the inadequacy of the existing dispute resolution system where, in most situations, the person who is the aggrieved party faces the prospect of considerable expense, time and delay in order to resolve a dispute. Therefore, a much more user-friendly dispute resolution mechanism is critical. 
I suspect that the problem with the family law system at the moment is that it has become part of the broader legal establishment. We face the same kinds of issues in areas like workers compensation, where there is an elaborate framework involving a lot of people, a lot of lawyers, and a lot of notional and actual rights. It may all look very good on paper and be difficult to criticise in theory, but in practice, when you deal with the consequences of how that system actually works, you realise that it has major practical deficiencies—particularly for those who cannot afford to pay for lawyers or to participate in the system in the way that it is structured. Establishing some kind of better dispute resolution mechanism that is less formal, less costly and less time consuming is, I believe, a fundamental obligation of this parliament. I commend that aspect of the report also.
On the issues of child support payment and the amounts that are involved, I also think that the committee has got it right. I confess that I have a self-interest in making these observations, so I should caution anybody who is taking notice of what I say that, as a person who is currently paying the absolute maximum in child support, obviously I cannot separate myself entirely from the issues. However, I think the arguments put in the report, at both extremes, are compelling. There are substantial numbers of people in this country who are paying too little in child support, and there are others who are paying too much—where the amount being paid is out of all proportion to the actual cost of raising a child, even in relative comfort in an upper middle-class kind of environment.
The problem with this is that it distorts behaviour. It creates a range of false incentives. For some people it creates an incentive not to work, and it creates incentives for tax avoidance to avoid responsibilities. These things will always be there in some form or other. When a family splits in two, there are always losers, and usually both parties lose because costs that were spread over a single unit are now spread over two units. Nonetheless, we can do better, and I think that the proposals put forward by the committee are commendable because they address the issues in a sensible, intelligent way.
It is worth noting, for example, as an illustration of the anomaly and as an illustration of the perverse incentives and the penalties that exist in the current system, that under the current child support arrangements the maximum payment for a high-income earner with one child is approaching $400 a week and that if that person has a child in a second relationship the liability for child support that they have to pay is reduced by roughly $12 a week. In effect, the system says: `The child of your first marriage is worth $400 a week, and the child of your second marriage is worth $12 a week.' That is an absolute absurdity and a fundamental disincentive and barrier to people forming second relationships. Clearly, that is a major problem. What happens to people in this situation? They are the people who end up in the suicide flats. They are the ones who end up with problems at work, getting retrenched and, in middle age, becoming alcoholics, committing suicide, getting into all kinds of different social problems. We should be ensuring both for custodial parents and for non-custodial parents that one of the objectives of the system is to maximise their opportunities to repartner. That should be a very important objective of the system.
—And not discriminate against children.
—That is right. These are very difficult issues and there is no absolute black-and-white solution to them. Nonetheless, we can do a great deal better than is currently the case.
The final thing I think is important to say is that this inquiry is a very good illustration in practice of how taking a broader relationships perspective on issues that face our society can change the way we deal with them and also is not inherently politically partisan. The great outcome of this report is that we have a very constructive, valuable alternative strategy for dealing with these issues from a bipartisan position where there is no necessary barracking for one side or another in the traditional battles that have been involved in this sphere and where the issues have not become a political football between the different sets of interests—one highly approving, the other highly disapproving. That is a tremendous achievement on the part of the committee. I believe it illustrates the value that we can achieve as a society and as representatives if we take a broader relationships focused approach on these kinds of issues. We can produce outcomes that will get broad community support and broad political support.
These issues are huge. Now that the honourable member for Chifley is in the chamber I will repeat my earlier comments. With very few exceptions, such as the honourable member for Chifley, for far too long members of parliament right across the board have failed to address these issues and have neglected our responsibilities. These issues affect millions of Australians—not just a relatively small minority but a huge number of people. In a very substantial proportion of cases, the effects on people's lives are extremely adverse. That is inherent in what we are dealing with here. When you have marriage breakdowns where children are involved there will be damage, there will be problems, no matter what structure of arrangements we have to deal with them. But we can do a great deal better than we are doing now.
The reforms in the 1980s were overwhelmingly focused on the financial issues of ensuring that children could be brought up with a reasonable standard of living and that custodial parents were not battling away in extreme poverty, as many were. That was correct and proper. That was appropriate. It was important. But it was only the first stage of dealing with these issues. The next stage is what is recommended in this report. All the members of the committee should be commended for their tremendous contribution. All of them, whenever they eventually retire or leave public life, should look back on this report as a very important contribution to the long-term welfare and wellbeing of the people of this nation.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title> Family and Community Affairs Committee</title>,Committees,26,1,speech
"King, Peter, MP",LP,2004-02-11,"—The family is the bedrock of our society. To make good that proposition, we in this place must ensure that the law conforms to the principle and values contained within it. As has been put so eloquently by the honourable member who has just spoken and is contained in paragraph after paragraph of this important report, which received deserved publicity over the Christmas vacation, all is not well in the bedrock of our society and much can be done to improve the solutions that this parliament is offering through legislation and administrative arrangements and through the judicature and the judicial arrangements that we are responsible for.
My attention was first drawn to this problem by several constituents, and two principal cases that I will mention briefly. The first was of a man who walked through my front door looking destitute; he had a rather painful tale to tell. He was then living in a garage at a friend's house. His bank account was empty because the Child Support Agency had, on the application of his former wife, removed any remaining funds because of his failure—which he conceded—to pay child support. His concern was that he could not afford lawyers to contest the quantum of the payment. Quite frankly, he had lost the will or the morale to take yet another battle through the courts to resolve the issue and effect a balance which he thought fair and which, on the face of it, appeared to me to be more reasonable than what had been laid down by the court structure. I did not have the opportunity to speak to the wife and I have not done so since. But that is one of the anonymous cases of many around this nation where extreme unhappiness has been the result of the separation of families.
Another case involves a slightly different flavour where again a male approached my office and claimed that his businesses had been ruined by payments made as a result of separation agreements that the Family Court had refused to amend. It was true that his businesses had been sold and he did appear to have suffered significantly. But, as a result of investigations I made through the Child Support Agency, it appeared that there were significant queries about the extent of the disclosure of (a) his losses and (b) the impact of the orders upon his business arrangements.
I suppose it is fair to say that, at the end of the day, what is sometimes forgotten with these problems is that the eye of the storm, the centre of the problem, is the other children of the family. I raised some of these issues in the party room last year because I was concerned about the administration of the Child Support Agency and what appeared to be the draconian impact of some of its administrative measures, based upon legislation, which gave the right to access bank accounts without notice in some cases and which appeared to lead to hardship in other cases while, on the other hand, recognising that the Child Support Agency was carrying out a very important role in our society.
I spoke about these issues to the executive director of the Child Support Agency—who, after being rather hard to get, finally responded to my correspondence—to learn first-hand about some of the cases that I was concerned about and which I had written about but to which I had had no reasonable response. So at least in relation to my constituents there was follow-up and some attention was paid to the detail of those concerns. I was pleased too when the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, the Hon. Larry Anthony, announced this important inquiry and, in particular, sought to focus on the problems of separated families in relation to the arrangements for children and whether or not there should be a presumption that children will spend equal time with each parent and, if so, in what circumstances such a presumption could be rebutted.
The measures in this report which I would commend to the House and which it seems to me are a basis for legislative intervention may be summarised as follows. Firstly, in respect of post-marriage arrangements, the proposal that part 7 of the Family Law Act be amended to create a clear and rebuttable presumption in favour of equal shared parental responsibility is at the heart of the matter. I think the committee came up with a sensible solution to a very difficult problem—which, quite frankly, the Family Court has been grappling with since the amendments to the act in 1995—as to how shared parental responsibility should be defined. The formula involves a requirement that parents consult with one another before making decisions about major issues relevant to the care, welfare and development of children, including but not confined to education, present and future religious and cultural upbringing, health, and change of surname and usual place of residence—all in the form of a parenting plan. It struck me as a sensible, expedient proposal that would be workable having regard to the desire of the committee and those many concerned people out in the wider community to ensure that less formality and more focusing on the substantive problems that parents and children face be the subject of any report and any final recommendations.
One of the problems has been that section 60B of the act sets out the importance of a child's right to continue to know and be cared for by both parents, yet the outcomes in post-separation parenting arrangements since 1995 have not supported this nostrum. So the proposal put forward by the committee, it seems to me, does address this problem and is a proposal that is workable.
The second aspect of the report in relation to post-marriage arrangements that I would commend is the proposal that courts not be the first port of call where there has been a separation and a breakdown of the family. Rather, a tribunal, in this case to be called a families tribunal, with power to resolve disputes about shared parenting responsibility should be established which would look at future parenting arrangements in the best interests of children, or children and property, principally by agreement of the parents, being child inclusive and non-adversarial. It sounds good, I suppose, although, to be fair to the Family Court, when parties line up one side against the other, whether before an informal families tribunal such as that proposed or in the Family Court itself, one side will take a point against the other and at the end of the day somebody has to decide who is right and who is wrong. One of the problems with these situations is that, because emotions run high, people are not disposed to compromise. Settlement is not really part of the lexicon of the parties involved, and the children affected by this are really a third consideration. So it is very difficult, no matter what form of tribunal you adopt, to ensure that you reach that informality and that you reach that proper focus which the committee is inviting the government to introduce.
With that one word of warning, I support the recommendation so that the Family Court becomes, in a sense, the last port of call, the tribunal which decides the dispute that the families tribunal does not. I say to the legislators and administrators who seek to bring in this legislation: be careful about giving any judicial power to such a tribunal; leave that with the Family Court. Make this the tribunal you have set out to make it—namely, one that will seek to reach compromise and one that will make recommendations that lead to that focus on substance which is at the heart of this recommendation in the report.
The third recommendation that I commend relates to community education. Of course none of us are perfect when it comes to parenting—and some of us would concede that we are not perfect when it comes to many things—but parenting is a matter of value judgment; there are some objective criteria but there are many subjective criteria as well. Circumstance, morality, religious belief and conviction, tradition, family ties and other factors influence the way people approach this sort of problem. Nonetheless, at the end of the day, it is helpful to have a community education program to identify those objective criteria which, in the experience of those involved in family relationship advisory services, are critical for a successful outcome.
The fourth recommendation that I embrace concerns the need for better access to services relating to breakdown. Those services have to be available. It seems to me it is not just a question of having somebody sitting behind a desk; sometimes they have to get out from behind the desk and go out to the community—out to the houses, out to the caravan parks and even out onto the streets. But they need to have a structured and sensitive system in place that is really going to address these problems and make those services accessible.
The second group of measures that I wish to focus on in this debate concerns child support services. The six weeks moratorium is, I think, a good idea. The doubling of the payment is a good idea: $5 a week is obviously too little. The adjustment of the payments to reflect the real needs of the children's arrangements is important. People should be paying what is necessary and what is needed. I think those arrangements are good. I like the idea of a detailed investigation into the operation of the Child Support Agency, as proposed by this committee, and I recommend to the minister that he set about doing that.
The third basic issue of concern is grandparents and their role. I commend the committee for conferring on grandparents—and I would extend this to relatives—a role in the parenting plan. There is going to need to be a little bit of  creativity with our administrators in dealing with this aspect of the proposal but, at the end of the day, can anybody think of somebody who is better at supporting the children of a separated family than the relatives, anybody who would care more than them? Obviously there will be some who will not care but, where there is a choice, where such people are available, they should be supported to do so. That is the gravamen of the report. I commend this report to the House. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title> Family and Community Affairs Committee</title>,Committees,26,1,speech
"Price, Roger, MP",ALP,2004-02-11,"—It is a pleasure to speak on this report. When this inquiry was first announced there were probably three levels of concern. Firstly, we on the Labor side were very apprehensive about the nature of this inquiry and whether or not, frankly, we were going to be wedged. Secondly, we on the Labor side were very concerned about the short duration that the committee had to get into a very difficult subject and to bring out a worthwhile report. We have paid some penalties for timing but it is a credit to Kay Hull, the committee and the committee secretariat that this proved not to be a problem, just as, I might say, the first matter proved not to be a problem. Thirdly, those on the coalition side were concerned about whether it would be possible to get goodwill in the committee so that we could produce a unanimous report. Indeed, that proved not to be a problem in the end.
I must say that I have spent a little bit of time on this subject, as was so generously remarked on by the member for Melbourne. I have always fundamentally believed that there had to be a better way. Having spent a little bit of time in the area in the past and coming newly onto the committee, I must say that the committee members were pretty generous to me. In no way was I the fount of all knowledge; indeed, I gained and learnt a lot from being on the inquiry. I pay tribute to our deputy chair, Julia Irwin, and Jennie George. I think they made a very powerful contribution and in no small measure added to the acceptance of the report on our Labor side. Of course, Harry Quick was also a member of the committee.
Nothing has disappointed me more than some of the knee-jerk hysterical reactions by groups that I have spent many years going to and talking to about these matters, particularly some of the dads groups. I was more than disappointed at what I thought was a very poor response by the lone parents organisation that speaks for men's groups on these issues.
It is true that we did not endorse the presumption of joint rebuttable custody. That does not mean that before the report was tabled there had not been instances where that has been the model freely adopted by some parents. But we did not accept it. We went for something that was far more fundamental, and that was to say, `Look, in trying to navigate our way through this thorny area, we need to keep at the forefront of our minds the children and the impact on the children.' If there is to be a common denominator for reform, it will be the children. If there is to be a common denominator for parents breaking away from what can often be almost warfare, it will be the children. Indeed, there was a tremendous amount of evidence that child-focused mediation—that is, when you are talking to the children and to the parents, and the parents are having fed back to them some of the impacts that their separation and divorce are having on the children—often is the catalyst and facilitator for a change of attitudes for a more sensible outcome. What we are trying to entrench here is that parents cannot absolve themselves from their responsibility for decision making and involvement in the lives of their children. Intact, separated, lapsed—whatever you like to say—that is the principle. It is not 75-25, it is not 80-20; it is 50-50. In fact, I think there has been a whole new emphasis given to parenting plans.
When parenting plans first came in, I said in this place, `They are terrific things and they work exceedingly well for parents who do not need them.' What this report says is that the first thing that parents need to do, in a relatively short period of time, is to sit down and work out what is going to happen to the children, what will be in the best interests of the children, what their mutual responsibilities to the children will be, and how they are going to make decisions in the future. We have really put a new emphasis on children. 
I am pleased that the member for Dickson is in the chamber, because during the hearings he was constantly raising the issue of tribunals. I could not be more pleased. It is fundamental to understand that the committee had evidence from learned law professors, as well as from the chief legal adviser to the Commonwealth, that issues of residency and contact can be treated administratively. If they are treated administratively rather than judicially, a tribunal does not need a chapter 3 judge to head it. The Child Support Agency deals with administrative matters, which are seen as being administrative and therefore there is no chapter 3 head of the Child Support Agency—just as there will not be with this tribunal.
Some have said, `We'll have to look at the constitutionality of the tribunal.' Learned law professors can disagree, and I guess sometimes the learned advice of the chief legal adviser to the Commonwealth may be a tad wrong; but, in the interim, I think it is worth while taking it. It affords us a real breakthrough—a huge breakthrough. I think what shocked so many members of the committee was hearing how many thousands of dollars are spent on pursuing issues surrounding divorce. If only that money were being spent on the children, and on the parents getting on with their new lives, it would be a huge success. There has never been any study—and I regret it—that estimates what people out there in voter land are spending on the legal profession in family law on issues of divorce, contact and residency. We know that they can spend over $100,000. They can spend all their available money. They can wrack up the debt on the Bankcard and then they are into the grandparents. We even learned of a grandparent in Blacktown who, tragically, lost her house funding the legal profession. I think there is a role for the profession, but I do not think it has a role in dealing with the entrails of failed marriages and divorces, in the majority of cases. 
The tribunal clearly can deal with issues of contact and residency. The model that we have proposed is one that is familiar to a lot of Australians, and that is conciliation and arbitration—that is, trying to bring the parties together and then arbitrating a decision, but only arbitrating after a panel of tribunal members has actually decided. It is a system that is familiar, it works well, it will work well, and lawyers can appear only by leave of the tribunal. In other words, we are trying to get lawyers out of the tribunal. We are trying to stop this haemorrhage of family assets post-separation and divorce. We want a sensible, no frills and minimum cost approach for people to sort out those problems. In fact, the best idea is for them to sort it out themselves and do not go near a tribunal or a court.
I want to say a couple of things about the Family Court. If I go and hold up a garage in my electorate, I will go to the Magistrate's Court and then to the District Court. If I commit an assault and battery on someone, I will go to the Magistrate's Court and then to the District Court. But if my marriage fails, I have to go to the equivalent not of the Blacktown Magistrate's Court or the Penrith District Court but to the Supreme Court of New South Wales. That is a superior court. One of the real problems we have in trying to get parents to be sensible about the dissolution of their marriage is that they need to go through a grieving process. It is all very well to say that in the Family Court parents will not agree and will prolong the dispute. But it is really like an out-of-body experience for them. The great advantage of a tribunal is that you can allow some of the grief and hurt to come out in a tribunal setting. It makes no difference to the ultimate decision. It is certainly irrelevant in terms of the legality of the thing but it is just so important in terms of the healing process.
In a sense there is a controversial function added to the tribunal—again I give due credit to the member for Dickson—and that is an investigative arm. One of the most frustrating issues in family law is the fact that allegations are made. As one QC who has taken appeal cases to the Family Court in Adelaide said to me—I apologise that I cannot name him—the Family Court is rife with perjury. There are state instrumentalities such as the police and, in my state, the Department of Community Services, that are charged with investigating it. But once matters get to the Family Court those state instrumentalities tend to drop off and you have a void. I can make some heinous allegations in the court that essentially remain uninvestigated and untested, but the law makes decisions about respective matters in the Family Court. Whether or not we do that, a very important area has been highlighted in that recommendation.
Lone parents said that nothing has changed in relation to the tribunal. I say to them that everything has changed in relation to the tribunal and in relation to the recommendations. We are told time and again, and I accept it, that at Christmas time people commit suicide because they have no prospect of contact with their children. It is a terrible situation. This report is all about appropriate and proper balancing and ensuring that parents do have contact. I cannot say that we will have a 100 per cent success rate in every marriage or relationship breakdown but we can be confident that we will make a huge difference to the vast bulk of those cases.
I now refer to child support. If we were rushed in any area—perhaps the report suffered a little, although I do not resile from the recommendations—it was child support. We were unable to do some modelling. We would sorely have loved to know what the effect of certain changes and combinations would have been. I cannot but agree with the member for Melbourne that it is an utter disgrace that under the current system you can see that children in one relationship are treated differently and are financially supported differently from children in a second or third relationship. That brings us no joy at all and it is a matter of shame.
I support the recommendations. I particularly highlight that, for the first time, we have recommended a proper external review of child support decisions. There was an internal review process. It was better than just going to the Family Court, which was the system that it replaced, but again this is a logical and sound development of the system. At a Commonwealth level, citizens should be entitled to a proper external review that does not cost them an arm and a leg. 
Again, I compliment my fellow committee members and the staff. I think that it represents the best traditions of the parliament in bringing down a unanimous report on such a difficult area.

"Dutton, Peter, MP",LP,2004-02-11,"—I will start my contribution today by thanking Kay Hull and my fellow committee members for the superb effort they have put in over the last four or five months. I listened quite intently to the contribution from my good friend the member for Chifley and, despite much robust debate during the course of our committee hearings, both public and private, I do want to say today that the member for Chifley has been a long-term advocate for change in this very important area of public policy. It is also appropriate that the member for Hinkler should be in the Main Committee today because he too is a person who represents his electorate very well and has voiced on a number of occasions, both in our party room and in other arenas, the need for change in this area. 
It is also a timely opportunity today to thank Bev Forbes, Margaret Atkin and all of the committee secretariat staff for their dedication and their support throughout the term of this inquiry. Without their assistance, we would not have been able to achieve what we have done in such a short period of time. I also congratulate the Prime Minister, who initiated this inquiry. It was his foresight and his reading of the mood of the Australian public that initiated this inquiry. He understood the depth of feeling and hurt and anger in many parts of our community, and it is very appropriate that this inquiry has been set up. I thank the Prime Minister and the other ministers involved in that process.
Members of the committee and other members of this place have spoken about this report and about the almost 1,700 submissions that the committee received. Indeed, we took extensive evidence right across Australia. It is fair to say that there were some common themes that came from those submissions. Despite the fact that we were criticised for wanting to report within a short period of time, we felt that, even if we had 17,000 submissions, the same themes would have come through. With one million children in Australia affected by family separation, this issue is one of the greatest social problems this nation faces. Some of the themes that affected these children were the complaint from non-custodial parents, generally the fathers, that they were denied access to the children who lived with the mother or away from the non-custodial parent. That was certainly a common theme that was expressed not just by fathers but by mothers who are non-custodial parents. 
One of the other main themes was in relation to recipients of child support payments, who complained that their former partner was not paying the appropriate amount or was not paying anything at all. There were other themes, including, very sadly and tragically, stories from grandparents who had enjoyed very successful and loving relationships with their grandchildren right up to the point of separation and from that point on they had been deprived of seeing their grandchildren. That is one of the most tragic stories that we heard constantly throughout this inquiry. It is very sad indeed that people in the prime of their life who have so much to offer in the raising and the formation of a child's life should be deprived of that not so small pleasure.
I said before that this is one of the greatest social problems in Australia and I do not think it should be underestimated. It is a symptom or reflection, I suppose, of the broader issue of relationship breakdown in our community. The inquiry certainly has uncovered the flawed process we have for dealing with this breakdown. The member for Chifley quite rightly spoke in some detail about the problems with the Family Court. Although many people in Australia following the breakdown of their relationship are able to successfully deal with the quantum of problems that they face in the best interests of the children and of themselves, there are still a large proportion of people who find it completely inappropriate that their matters are dealt with by the Family Court. 
It is fair to say that the barriers for entry to the Family Court are great. They include the costs to both parties. We have taken evidence through this inquiry that the cost can extend to many hundreds of thousands of dollars—money that could, incidentally, be spent to set the child up for life, to put the child through private education or to provide housing and everything else, yet it is being squandered in a very bitter battle. Another great barrier is the delays that are experienced. Some matters are still not dealt with after a two-year period, which is completely unacceptable for many reasons—not least of which is the fact that children, depending on their age, may well have grown through that two-year period into an age where they require different things from their parents. It may be that they have been deprived of contact with one parent through a development period, which will set them back for the rest of their lives. That is an unacceptable situation.
Nobody who came before our inquiry and provided evidence that the status quo was acceptable convinced me or, I think, the other committee members that an adversarial system is appropriate for dealing with family breakdowns and outcomes that are in the best interests of the child. In my view, there is no place for an adversarial process where we are trying to provide a definite and substantive outcome for children—particularly for young children, who should enjoy a loving relationship with both their mum and their dad. It is unacceptable that these matters are dealt with in a family court that is adversarially based, that pitches one party against the other and that provides a forum for many people to continue the conflict that was present during the period that their relationship was intact. There are many people in Australia who use this process with malintent and who act quite irresponsibly, in my view—as irresponsibly as some of the legal practitioners who, on the evidence that we received, prolong these matters for financial gain. All of those people can be grouped into the same disgraceful category.
I suppose that is the reason for the substantive recommendation of this report—that a new family law process be established, under which a families tribunal would be established. That tribunal would see, on our recommendations, a panel of three people—somebody who expresses or is able to express the best interests of the child, somebody who is legally qualified and would be able to draft documents and parenting plans that both parties are able to work with, and somebody who would provide a balance in the area of mediation. The tribunal would operate so that, if the parties were not able to reach agreement, they would be arbitrated for and a decision in the best interests of the child would be provided to them.
One of the serious constraints the Family Court has at the moment is the fact that when interim or final orders are made, they are not living documents. So, when the circumstances of a particular family grouping change, the people have to go back to the court at great expense to have the orders modified. As children grow older, their needs change. As new partners come into the relationship, the needs, not just of the mum and dad but of the children, change. As new children come into the relationship then the circumstances and requirements change. As the job, the employment or the geographical location of either the mother or father changes, so do the circumstances in relation to the orders or parenting plan that needs to be put in place. That is one of the hallmarks of the families tribunal—it provides the ability, on our recommendations, for people to go back to the tribunal and have necessary arrangements and changes made that do support the best interests of the child.
—Madam Deputy Speaker, may I ask the member a question?
 (Ms Corcoran)—Is the member for Dickson prepared to take a question?
—Yes.
—Go ahead.
—Could he see that extending to federal magistrates being able to make those interim orders as well?
—I thank the member for Hinkler for his question. There has been some discussion about the involvement of federal magistrates in the process at the moment and about some of the powers that they have in relation to this process. The view of the committee, and the recommendations, would be that the parties would indeed go back to the tribunal and that under this process they would not go back to the federal magistrates, but that is one option that is certainly worthy of being looked at.
The member for Chifley made the very good point earlier that the Family Court is the equivalent of the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court, in most jurisdictions, is where murder trials are held or where there are trials for trafficking in large quantities of drugs. That indicates the seriousness and the severity of matters that need to go before a court such as the Supreme Court. That is one of the great barriers in relation to the structure of the Family Court. To get anywhere, people need to have money. They need to be able to engage not just a solicitor but a barrister and, in other circumstances, other counsel and legal experts, and witnesses that need to provide evidence to support one side or the other.
One of the other main restrictions in relation to the Family Court that has been spoken about before is in relation to affidavits and the giving of untested and uncorroborated evidence, which we have taken much evidence about. A complaint that followed right through this inquiry and right across Australia was that many affidavits go before the Family Court—one provided by the mum, one provided by the dad—and that it is untested and uncorroborated evidence that is accepted by the court, and the orders are made, quite unfairly, on that basis. It is an integral part of the families tribunal that we have recommended that an investigative arm be established. In these truly contested matters and where there are allegations of certain abuse and sexual abuse, the families tribunal investigative arm would be able to find the facts in relation to these contested allegations and the court would be able to decide based on those investigated facts. That is a substantive part of the way in which the families tribunal would provide for a just outcome for hundreds of thousands of Australians who do not receive that sort of justice under the Family Court system at this point in time.
The other considerable recommendations that we made were in relation to the Child Support Agency and the range of inequities that exist within that system. Nobody is suggesting that either in this area of child support recommendations or, indeed, anywhere in this report we have addressed all of the concerns that exist in our constituencies right across Australia. I know that my friend the member for Dobell has been a great and positive contributor to this debate and sees constituents about these matters on a daily basis. He has aired on a frequent basis problems that have been raised with him. We do not say that we have a system that can fit everybody's scenario. It is impossible, in my view, to try to come up with a system that provides a positive outcome for the millions of Australians who are affected by this situation and by the outcomes that result from family breakdown.
On the Child Support Agency we did make some important recommendations. There are many non-custodial parents who pay nothing towards the raising of their children. That is a completely unacceptable situation. There are many non-custodial parents who pay as little as $5 a week. In my view, that is also completely unacceptable. You can today buy a packet of cigarettes for twice that price. For somebody not to be able to contribute $5 a week, regardless of the situation, to a child that they have brought into the world, a child for whom they have not just a moral obligation but a financial obligation to see grow and prosper, is a completely unacceptable situation.
At the other end of the scale, under the Child Support Agency there are people—the majority of people—who pay a fair and decent contribution to the raising of their children. Many of those people have a legitimate complaint, in relation to the operation of the Child Support Agency and the systems that are in place within the agency, that they are dealt with unfairly and that they are denied reasonable contact with their children. Their complaints are justified, their complaints are understandable, and I have sympathy with their complaints, because there is evidence of that right across Australia. It is a problem we have tried to address, for example, by knocking out the 109 nights. There are many other ways that we could address this. We have suggested in this report that there does need to be further investigation of the Child Support Agency and the formula that is relied upon to formulate payments by non-custodial parents to custodial parents.

"Quick, Harry, MP",ALP,2004-02-11,"—I am proud to follow the honourable member for Dickson—a fellow member of the House Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs—in this debate on the committee's report, Every picture tells a story: report on the inquiry into child custody arrangements in the event of family separation. I have not written anything down; I guess I am going to ad lib. It is funny that today I am wearing my tie with a whole bunch of kids and sunshine on it. As a former teacher, before I became a parliamentarian, I experienced at first hand the whole issue of dysfunctionality in families and how hard it is for families to exist. 
One of the things that has an impact on most people when they see this report is the cover. It shows three children's paintings of aspects of family dysfunction. One is a picture of an ambulance, with a mum saying, `No,' a dad saying, `Yes,' and the child saying, `When Mum and Dad fight, it feels like my head is about to explode.' Another one shows a mum saying, `Sorry I yelled at you,' a dad saying, `Sorry I called you a cow,' and a child in the middle. The last picture is the most telling one: it shows mum's house, dad's house and the child cut in half.
In chapter one, we see some frightening statistics which I think all honourable members ought to have a look at. In this nation that is so successful and has so much going for it, 978,400 children have a natural parent who does not live with them. That is almost a million kids living with one parent. In 88 per cent of cases the absent parent is the father, and in 12 per cent of cases the absent parent is the mother. One of the other committees in this place recently did a report on boys in schools. There are so many links between this report and other reports that have been done. Following on from the statistics I just mentioned, 41 per cent of those children in sole care visited their other natural parent once a fortnight—which is the usual standard once the Family Court process is gone through: every second weekend and half the school holidays. Twenty-one per cent visited their other parent once a month or up to once every six months, and the frightening thing is that 36 per cent visited their natural parent only once a year—or less.
When we started this report, I was very sceptical about the agenda of the government. I thought, `How in the name of creation can you deal with an issue as complex as this, which affects every federal member?' As I said, we are talking about 978,400 kids, and we were given 55 non-sitting days. But this is a wonderful committee; I have been proud to be a member of it ever since I got here in 1993. With only one exception—and that was a very small exception—all of our reports have been unanimous and, in lots of cases, they have been groundbreaking. In those 55 days, we had to plough through 1,709 submissions—a pile several metres tall—from almost every conceivable section of the Australian community. Most of us in this place are pretty hardened; after a while you have seen the good, the bad and the ugly, but I can tell you that there were many tears shed as we read those submissions.
When we went out as a committee and spoke to people and when we had public hearings, some of which were in camera because of the sensitivities, and we heard people confronting for the first time a committee of the House—with the media involved and hundreds of people there and us sitting there like a court of inquisition—those people were able to explain to us in their own words the impact of dysfunctionality and the impact of the Child Support Agency, the Family Court, lawyers and the whole system. In many cases, their lives had been ruined financially and emotionally and they had lost contact with their children. As we toured around Australia, the 10 of us on the House committee were really confronted emotionally by the enormity of the problem. In hindsight, the 55 days enabled us to really focus on this issue. I believe that the report Every picture tells a story is one of the great reports that have emanated from this place in its 100-odd year history.
We have not solved all the problems. We have upset the fathers, who were upset in the first place. We have upset the Family Court lawyers. We have upset the chief honcho, Mr Nicholson. We have not given everybody everything they wanted. But I think as a starting point we have put in place a structure that is infinitely more sensible and in the best interests of the children. The first recommendation says:
The committee recommends that Part VII of the Family Law Act 1975 be amended to create a clear presumption, that can be rebutted, in favour of equal shared parental responsibility ...
If you look at the statistics about the number of marriages and the number of divorces in Australia, you see that this situation is not going to go away.
As a former educationalist, what I think is missing and needs to be addressed in our education system is a realisation that relationships are so important in our lives—that we need to work on them; that, entering into a contract with another person to have and to raise children is an enormous responsibility; and that, when, for whatever reason, that relationship ends, it is not an opportunity to pay back and to take advantage of your financial situation and your ability to access lawyers in order to punish your partner. The interests of the children should be paramount.
Each of us in this place can cite numerous examples where the person who is really suffering is the child. True, in most cases, the wives are going through a tremendous amount of trauma and an inability to function as a person because they are financially dependent upon Centrelink when the Child Support Agency fails in its responsibility to get the money from the noncustodial parent. But, conversely, there are people of the female sex who, for whatever reason, use their vindictiveness and their hold over the children to punish their male partners.
There are 29 excellent recommendations in this report—for example, the setting up of a tribunal; and the polite coercion of both partners when there is a separation to go through mediation and to sit down and develop a parenting plan in the best interests of the children, to say, `We have a responsibility for these children which is not just for the first six months of their lives; it is ongoing until they are able to enter the work force and, in many cases, it lasts a lifetime, but we at least need to give them some foundations and a start.'
As we took evidence right around Australia, I think each and every member of the committee was horrified at the amounts of money that some people expended in order to just get every second weekend and half the school holidays—in some cases it was in excess of $100,000. This money is being denied the children that they have responsibility for. As I say, it is a traumatic thing. It affects almost a million children. Those children are being denied the opportunities given to children who are fortunate enough to grow up in a family where both parents, whatever their station in life, have worked out a parenting plan for their kids. As a federal MP with two daughters I know that it is not easy. For me, when my wife and I were parenting, I found it very hard to argue that I was doing my bit for Sarah and Hannah. I was spending 20 weeks here and probably another 10 weeks wandering around Australia trying to sort out the nation's business. There was a parenting plan organised. It was not written in concrete but there was a realisation that, in order for my wife to work and for me to be a federal member, there needed to be some cohesion and at least some rough planning about who was doing what and who had what responsibilities.
When this dysfunctionality occurs and people say, `I've had enough; I'm about to leave,' to then just throw them into the Family Court and expect lawyers to pick up the pieces—and charge like wounded bulls—is the wrong way. These 29 recommendations will bring change. It is not going to change overnight. We still have a whole lot of people in the system. I guess once the government's response is out in the public domain we can move on, but we have all these people who are already in the system. 
For my last couple of minutes I would like to mention one thing that really worries me about the current system and which hopefully will change: the relationship between the Child Support Agency and Centrelink. Centrelink is one of these great behemoths that spew out bits of paper to people. In 88 per cent of cases the custodial parent is the mother, who is relying on Centrelink. They are battling through the Child Support Agency to get the money and then the money suddenly comes and Centrelink says, `You've got all this money and we've overpaid you,' and there is enormous stress. There ought to be an understanding. I am not sure how it could work but hopefully it could come about with the setting up of one of the latter recommendations. The whole issue of breaching and people being owed tens of thousands of dollars and then suddenly getting it has an enormous impact on overpayments of family tax benefits A and B and such complex issues.
It has been a wonderful learning curve for me and the other nine members of the committee. I would like to thank them for their honesty and endeavour. We have worked together and had lots of arguments. I spat the dummy several times and walked out, but in the finish we came up with a wonderful report. I compliment the secretariat staff. They did a job that was absolutely amazing, collating the 1,709 submissions, working day and night and finally, with Kay Hull, the committee chair, they completed this wonderful report, which I know has been widely received and is being read avidly by all members of this place. I look forward to the government's follow-up and I know we will do justice to the families that are going through this trauma now and into the future. I thank the committee for giving me the opportunity to say a few words on Every picture tells a story.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title> Family and Community Affairs Committee</title>,Committees,26,1,speech
"Ticehurst, Kenneth, MP",LP,2004-02-11,"—I became involved in this issue back in September 2002, when a fellow from Dads in Distress came into my office and told me that over 2½ thousand men a year commit suicide because they have difficulty getting access to their children. I also know of a case where a fellow was denied access to his child because he had been accused of sexually interfering with the child. That was totally false, but it was accepted offhand and he was denied access. That same fellow, who was a member of the police force at the time, was exonerated in the courts, but even today it is still on his record. So when he leaves the police force he is going to be restricted in whatever job he undertakes, because that false claim is on his record.
I raised this issue in our party room back in September 2002. Some of the cases that I have mentioned were picked up by other members—as we know, every member gets the same sorts of complaints—but I was encouraged by Senator Jeannie Ferris to set up a panel and bring some people down and have a forum where members and senators could attend and hear people's cases; and that is exactly what I did. One of the people who came to that forum rang me the other day and said, `I am not sure whether I should jump off the skillion or go and shoot my ex-husband.' That is the sort of trauma that is going on in our society. Irrespective of their marital status, society has a responsibility to support mothers and fathers to fulfil their role as effective parents. This is the premise of the Australian government's family law inquiry—after all, the strength of our families will determine our children's futures and the future of our nation.
Last year I held a series of child access forums in my electorate of Dobell to allow mothers, fathers and grandparents to work with experts in the field to define what they believed to be the key areas in which family law required changing. One common point raised was the need for relationship education in the early years and throughout high school. We need to instil in children the vitality of the family unit and of loving family relationships. Yes, reading aloud is important—nobody disagrees with that—but reading to a disturbed and worried child is less effective. The forum also highlighted that the system needs to provide more opportunities and incentives for parents to reach agreements between themselves, to assist in minimising the damage caused to children by separation and conflict. Many grandparents and, indeed, great-grandparents attended these forums and expressed to me their concern that they were being overlooked in family law practices. These are some of the key recommendations that I have been finding from my electorate of Dobell. 
The committee recommends that part VII of the Family Law Act 1975 be amended to create a clear presumption—which can be rebutted—in favour of equally shared parental responsibility in the first year of post-separation decision making. It is talking not about halving time—although access is a big issue—but about sharing responsibility. This involves a requirement that parents consult with one another before making decisions about major issues relevant to the care, welfare and development of children, including, but not confined to, present and future education, religious and cultural upbringing, health, change of surname and usual place of residence. This should be in the form of a parenting plan.
Joint custody is a means to an end and not an end in itself. The end is the opportunity for children to know, and to have a relationship with, both of their parents. This should only happen when the relationship enriches the child; it certainly should not happen when it harms the child. While there will always be exceptions, there are many parents who want better access arrangements; they want to meet their responsibilities and they want to do the right thing by their kids. I am hopeful that the recommendations of the report will help to facilitate that.
Where there are parents who do not want to do the right thing and be fully involved, we need to be giving them encouragement to do the right thing—not just by the kids but for the future of our society. To achieve this we have to not just make minor changes to the law but to radically shake up the system to change its emphasis. This, in association with an extensive public education campaign, is the best way to change community perceptions, attitudes and actions in the area of parental responsibility after separation. The proposed new system is deliberately less legalistic and more child focused. It reduces the role of the courts. The new system would better assist and equip parents to take responsibility for resolving their disputes in a non-adversarial way and in the best interests of their child or children. 
The committee recommends that the government review the community's current access to services which can assist those who cannot achieve and sustain shared parenting on their own to develop skills to communicate effectively around their children's needs, which will enable them to resolve their ongoing conflict and include the needs of their children in that decision making. In the United States a maternal preference in child custody has given way to the best interests of the child standard. This has resulted in a system that oscillates towards joint custody. In some part of the United States the system also provides opportunities and incentives for parents to reach agreements between themselves and assist in minimising the damage of separation and conflict to children. This approach has helped to greatly reduce the incidence of divorce in many cases, which may contribute to a fall in the incidence of child abuse and a decrease in the financial cost of divorce to the community. 
The committee recommends that the Commonwealth government move to recognise the role of grandparents, and indeed great-grandparents, by taking steps to ensure that contact with grandparents and extended family members is considered by parents when developing their post-separation parenting plan and developing strategies to ensure that grandparents and extended family members are included in mediation and family counselling activities when it is in the best interests of the child. This is great news for parents and grandparents in my electorate and beyond. 
The inquiry was not just about a better deal for fathers. Initially my observations were that 10 per cent of these cases involved women, but as the submissions came in that increased to about 15 per cent. I am talking about important social legislation affecting some of the most important and vulnerable people in the community, our children. Children have a right to know and be cared for by both their parents regardless of whether their parents are married, separated, have never married or have never lived together. Children have a right of contact on a regular basis with both their parents and grandparents, who can have a stabilising effect on family break-ups. There are no simple solutions or quick fixes. Each family is different and each child is different, and the issue must be approached on an individual basis. 
The resulting child custody report is good news for many people of the Central Coast who have expressed to me their frustration with the Family Law Act and Child Support Act and the incorrect administration of those acts. The current system is causing hardship and pain to many single parents, both men and women, and is indirectly impacting on their children's futures. The report is a serious attempt to deal with real problems. Not everybody will be happy with the recommendations of the report. However, it is very important to have these proposed changes on the table for everyone to debate. 
I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs, led by committee chair Kay Hull, on their great efforts to conduct an intensive six-month inquiry into the operation of our family law system and child custody arrangements following family separation. Unfortunately I was not a member of this committee, but I kept close contact with the people involved. It must be remembered that this report is only a template, an outline of the way forward. It will be up to the Prime Minister to make the final tough decisions in the interests of Australian families. I am confident that the outcome of this inquiry will have a positive and encouraging impact on mothers, fathers, grandparents and indeed great-grandparents and, most importantly, the lives of the most innocent members of our society, our children.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title> Family and Community Affairs Committee</title>,Committees,26,1,speech
"Irwin, Julia, MP",ALP,2004-02-11,"—Yesterday I had the opportunity to make some comments on this report in the House and I took that opportunity to express some of my concerns about the shortage of time, in preparing this report, to do justice to the many submissions made to the committee. But I want to make it quite clear that, apart from the areas of the child support formula and the work of the Child Support Agency, I believe that the report has given full weight to the hundreds of submissions and the evidence given at the committee's hearings. 
This is a report which has the potential to bring major improvements to the lives of so many children, parents and grandparents in families that live apart. As I said in my speech on the tabling of the report, listening to and reading the experiences has been deeply moving to all members of the committee. We cannot play politics with such an important matter. We cannot play politics with the lives of one million Australian children. Having heard and read those stories, the first conclusion that was reached was that the present system was broken and needed fixing. It needed more focus on the needs of children—not just saying that it should be in the best interests of the children but really doing something that made sure that the best interests of the children were being addressed at every stage of the process.
So when it came to looking at the terms of reference and, in particular, the question of whether there should be a presumption that children will spend equal time with each parent and, if so, in what circumstances such a presumption could be rebutted, the committee definitely took a much broader view which considered the whole process of parenting arrangements. This led the committee to view parenting plans as being the key to settling the arrangements that were in the best interests of the child. But this was to be based on a concept of equal shared parenting responsibility as the first tier in post-separation decision making. That is expressed in recommendation 1 of the report—that presumption would not apply where there is entrenched conflict, family violence, substance abuse or established child abuse, including sexual abuse.
So the development of a parenting plan with the idea of equal shared parental responsibility becomes the foundation for arrangements made in relation to the care of children when parents separate. But to be effective these arrangements need to be made as early as possible in family breakdowns. For that reason, the committee recommends that a shopfront single entry point into the broader family law system be established. Instead of the entry point being the solicitor's office, where parenting arrangements are not likely to be the first priority of the parties, the committee recommends that separating parents have early access to information about shared parenting, the impact of conflict on children and dispute resolution options. There should also be case assessment and screening by appropriately trained and qualified staff, and there should even be some power to compel both parties to participate in the assessment process. From there, parents can be referred to external providers of mediation and counselling services with programs suitable to the needs of the family's dispute, including assistance in the development of a parenting plan. Such a process can avoid the often poisonous conflict that arises from a strictly legal approach to family disputes.
But as valuable as such a process may be in getting parents started down the track of setting parenting arrangements, if the process then leads back to the legalistic court system much of what may have been gained can be lost. Also, parenting plans need to be flexible to allow for changes in the lives of parents and the development of children. So the process needs to be flexible and understanding, but above all it should respect the genuine equal sharing of parental responsibility. So the committee has recommended a most radical change. The committee proposes the establishment of a statute based families tribunal with the power to decide disputes about shared parenting responsibility, with respect to future parenting arrangements that are in the best interests of the child, and property matters by agreement of the parents.
The committee feels that the families tribunal should be child inclusive and non-adversarial with simple procedures that respect the rules of natural justice. Rather than members having a strictly legal background, the committee feels that the families tribunal should be appointed from professionals practising in the family relationships area and that it should first attempt to conciliate disputes. The committee sees hearings of the families tribunal being conducted by a panel of three members comprising a mediator, a child psychologist or other professional able to address the child's perspective, and a legally qualified member.
The committee heard of many instances where parents are unable to access the family law court because of the associated cost. For that reason and to preserve the process of mediation, the committee felt that legal counsel, interpreters or other experts should be involved at the sole discretion of the tribunal and that experts should be drawn from an accredited panel maintained by the tribunal. For this process of mediation to have the best chance of success, the committee recommended that there be a sixweek moratorium before any obligation to pay child support arises and that parents should be able to access—and I state again: parents should be able to access—their full entitlement to social security without penalty, to ensure that neither they nor their children are financially disadvantaged. This should enable the process of mediation to commence as early as possible and without the concerns of current support payments being an issue. 
Where child abuse is a factor—and the committee has already indicated that the proposed process should not apply where there is established child abuse—it is proposed that an investigative arm of the families tribunal investigate such claims to determine if a mediation process under the families tribunal should proceed or if the case should be dealt with by the Family Court. The Family Court would therefore be limited to these cases, the enforcement of orders of the families tribunal and the review of decisions of the families tribunal.
Other structural changes to the Family Court are also recommended. The committee received many submissions from grandparents and made recommendations to include grandparents in the parenting plan where it is in the best interests of the child and also in negotiating the parenting plan. These recommendations have not been without their critics—and we have received a number of criticisms. But, as I have said, the committee has come to the view that these changes are necessary if we are to achieve a system which is generally based on equal shared parental responsibility. It is my view and that of the whole committee that this can only be achieved where parents are assisted from the earliest stages of separation to accept their responsibility for the wellbeing of their children and to have access to a process which allows them to reach agreement on how best to provide care and support for their children. The present system of family law has failed to do this—it has definitely failed. The proposed families tribunal offers a better way of meeting the need of separating families to develop parenting plans which are in the best interests of the children.
The issue of child support is one of the most difficult to deal with in the family law system. As I mentioned at the beginning of my speech, I would have liked the committee to have had more time to consider this issue in more detail; but some aspects of child support stand out as warranting immediate attention. It amazed committee members to find that some 40 per cent of child support payments under section 66 are only $5 per week, and the committee had no hesitation in recommending that these payments be doubled to $10 per week. Another area which should receive immediate attention from government is amendments to sections 47 to 49, which limit payments when a child spends more than 109 nights with a non-resident parent. If we are to encourage greater shared parenting, these sections must be amended. 
The committee also recommended addressing the way a payer's child support income is determined to reduce the impact of applying the full percentage to overtime earnings and earnings from a second job. The effect of the present rules can only be to deter payers from working overtime and increasing income from a second job. Measures to improve the collection of child support are recommended—and some of these are long overdue—to ensure that child support payments are collected, although I am prepared to concede that cancelling drivers licences may be taking things a bit too far.
One problem the committee faced was the lack of data on the costs of caring for children and the additional costs faced by parents to re-establish homes after separation. This data would have greatly assisted the committee in considering the equity of child support formulas and would also be valuable to government in considering future changes. Again, I feel that the committee could have used more time to assess the work of the Child Support Agency and to consider ways in which its operation may be improved. The report does recommend a review of strategies and calls for a process of external review of Child Support Agency decisions.
The report of the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs has been well received in the wider community, and I am proud of all the committee members from both sides of politics. Its recommendations call for long overdue changes to a system which is clearly not meeting the needs of children and parents of families living apart. The objective of equal shared parenting responsibility can be achieved only if changes to the process and the levels of support are made. The ball is now in the government's court. Having called for this inquiry, the Prime Minister, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and the Attorney-General must act to put these recommendations into effect. The report has been very warmly received by my Labor colleagues, and I can confidently predict that a number of these recommendations will be taken up by a future Labor government.
It is true there is some cost involved. The committee was made aware of the long delays for families accessing mediation services—delays of up to six months. As I have mentioned, a key to achieving good outcomes from mediation is that it should begin as early as possible. So, clearly, we need more resources for mediation services. The establishment of a families tribunal will also come at a cost but, when you consider the cost to government and individuals of the present Family Court system, in the long run we may achieve some savings. I would also note the cost of legal aid now going to some parties in Family Court matters which may be better spent on the operation of a families tribunal.
Of the number of inquiries that I have participated in during my time in this parliament, this inquiry has been the most draining but, as I think the honourable member for Makin would agree, the most rewarding. I feel very proud of the result and I feel proud of all the committee members. I believe that the committee has made recommendations that can make a real difference to the lives of the so many thousands of Australian families that separate each year. What is now required is the commitment from government to make these proposed improvements a reality. As I stated earlier, we cannot play politics—and we have not played politics—with the lives of over one million Australian children.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title> Family and Community Affairs Committee</title>,Committees,26,1,speech
"Draper, Trish, MP",LP,2004-02-11,"—I commend the member for Fowler, Julia Irwin, our deputy chair, for her speech. I enjoyed it immensely. I would also like to add that I am very proud of the work that we achieved. Every picture tells a story is the title of the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs inquiry into child custody arrangements following parental separation. Over the past six months, members of the committee heard many sad and desperate stories. For my constituents, I am pleased to have participated in this report as a member of the standing committee, but I must also add—as all of the committee members so far have said—that this has been a very tough assignment for all of us. At this point I would like to quote the foreword of the report:
One of the highlights of committee work for parliamentarians is the people we meet. During this inquiry our greatest delight was hearing from the nine children and five young adults at our final meeting of the inquiry. These children and young adults were a microcosm of what this inquiry was all about.
These 14 young people talked about the important issues of the inquiry—what it was like for them when their parents were separating and how their living arrangements were decided. These children and young adults were articulate, open, funny, serious and sometimes sad. They told us their stories and as a result the real meaning of this inquiry was clearly understood.
Another young boy, Jack, who we were unable to meet with, told us his story through his four drawings. We are so grateful to Jack for the pictures which we have used on the cover and inside cover of our report. Jack's story is a simple and complex one at the same time. It is a story we can all identify with in some way.
`Every picture tells a story'.
Jack's pictures tell us:
Jack shares his time between mum's house and dad's house.
He loves his mum and he loves his dad.
He doesn't like it when his mum and dad argue.
He's happy when they talk to each other.
It is a tough story because dad lives in one city and mum lives somewhere else.
He likes to see them both all the time but he can't because the distance makes it too hard.
Jack's pictures encapsulate the most important voice of all—the voice of the children.
The harsh reality of living in the 21st century is that many marriages or de facto relationships will fail. People change, mistakes are made and sometimes individuals just grow apart. It is not for the state to intervene in what are essentially personal matters between two adults but perhaps, as a community, we can do more to help couples to overcome their problems and reduce the pressures which exacerbate the causes of family breakdown. Of equal if not more importance is our responsibility to ensure that the needs of children are accorded the greatest priority and that their safety and general wellbeing are of prime concern. This is the true strength of this inquiry. From any reading of the 29 recommendations listed in the report, one could not escape the conclusion that the committee heeded the very first item of the terms of reference: that the best interests of the child are the paramount consideration.
Yes, we do recommend the creation of a presumption in favour of equal shared parental responsibility—and there are very good and worthy reasons for this—but we also make it clear, in recommendation 2, that the Family Law Act 1975 should be amended to `create a clear presumption against shared parental responsibility with respect to cases where there is entrenched conflict, family violence, substance abuse or established child abuse, including sexual abuse'. 
We also recognise that, no matter how difficult the break-up of a relationship may be for the adults involved, it can be an emotional tragedy for the child or children of that relationship. Tragically, for some the scars never heal. More than anything else, a child needs to know the love and care of both parents, whenever and wherever possible. They need to know that mum and dad are interested in what they do and are concerned about them. Even in a happy marital situation, one parent may spend more actual time than the other parent with the child or children, but both parents take an interest in their lives and make decisions about their upbringing.
Over the years that I have been a member of parliament I have heard many pleas from parents—generally from fathers but sometimes from mothers—who feel that they are not being included in the lives of their children. They feel like outcasts, even though they may have access on a regular basis. The system fails these adults as much as it fails the children, who are often left with the impression that mum or dad does not play an important role in their lives anymore. This is despite the fact that the Family Law Act 1975 was supposed to include a presumption of shared parenting. All members will know that this is not the reality, and this fact was reinforced by the hundreds of submissions received by the inquiry. The inquiry found:
A real child focus is not yet a reality in the system or in the behaviour of separating families.
To address these problems, the committee considers that for shared parenting a fifty-fifty shared residence or physical custody of the child or children should be considered as a starting point for all discussion and negotiation, except in situations where the child might be placed in danger of physical or emotional harm. I stress that this is a point from which negotiations should begin, with the ultimate aim being an agreement on shared parenting where both parents continue to play an equal role in the life of their child or children. Problems often arise where one parent seeks to move to a distant location, effectively cutting off the other parent from all meaningful contact with their offspring. True, an effective shared parental responsibility—which is the aim of the committee—would mean that the relocation of one parent would become less of an option. The mechanism by which shared parenting would operate is the parenting plan. By agreeing to this plan, both parents acknowledge the equal partnership in making decisions about their child or children. In recommendation 9 the committee specifically recommends:
... that the Family Law Act 1975 be amended to require separating parents to undertake mediation or other forms of dispute resolution before they are able to make an application to a court/tribunal for a parenting order, except when issues—
as I said before—
of entrenched conflict, family violence, substance abuse or serious child abuse, including sexual abuse, require different access to the courts/tribunal. 
Recommendation 10 states:
The committee recommends that the funding for the Family Relationships Services Program be increased following a review with respect to the appropriate targeting and adequacy of resources for the service types which will provide the most benefit to families' positive family relationships, before during and after separation.
In this review the committee recommends that consideration be given particularly to a significant further expansion of children's contact services nationally.
In recommendation 11, the committee recommended:
... that a shop front single entry point into the broader family law system be established attached to an existing Commonwealth body, with national geographic spread and infrastructure, with the following functions:
	provision of information about shared parenting, the impact of conflict on children and dispute resolution options; 
	case assessment and screening by appropriately trained and qualified staff;
	power to request attendance of both parties at a case assessment process; and
	referral to external providers of mediation and counselling services with programs suitable to the needs of the family's dispute including assistance in the development of a parenting plan.
In recommendation 12 the committee recommended:
... that the Commonwealth government establish a national, statute based, Families Tribunal with power to decide disputes about shared parenting responsibility ... with respect to future parenting arrangements that are in the best interests of the child/ren, and property matters by agreement of the parents. The Families Tribunal should have the following essential features:
	It should be child inclusive, non adversarial, with simple procedures that respect the rules of natural justice.
	Members of the Families Tribunal should be appointed from professionals practising in the family relationships area.
	The Tribunal should first attempt to conciliate the dispute.
	A hearing on the dispute should be conducted by a panel of three members comprising a mediator, a child psychologist or other professional able to address the child's perspective and a legally qualified member.
	Legal counsel, interpreters or other experts should be involved in proceedings at the sole discretion of the Tribunal. Experts should be drawn from an accredited panel maintained by the Tribunal.
The committee's recommendations in general have been supported publicly by Family Services Australia who in a media release on 8 January stated:
The results of the latest Parliamentary Inquiry by the Federal Government shed further light on how better we can nurture our children. Family Services Australia, the largest national industry representative body and member association of providers of family support services, welcomes the Shared Custody Inquiry recommendations for expanding services and strategies which help separating parents reduce conflict and focus on the needs of their children.
The committee also considered the role of grandparents after hearing many stories of how this third generation of family is often completely removed from the lives of their grandchildren. The importance of an extended family and the sense of continuity and belonging in the development of a child, not to mention the love of a grandparent for their grandchild, cannot be overestimated. This is why the committee has recommended further amendments to the Family Law Act 1975 to explicitly refer to grandparents to ensure that they, and other extended family members, are considered by parents when developing their parent plan. Possibly, parents will even make specific plans for contact with those extended family members—importantly, as I have said before, without the expensive costs of lawyers within the present adversarial system and the Family Court.
The second aspect of the inquiry's terms of reference dealt with the existing mechanism by which child support payments are calculated. The committee have made a number of progressive recommendations on this matter. I know that not everybody in the community supports the recommendations in their entirety. Some say we go too far, while others say we have not gone far enough. But the committee members had to consider all aspects of what is a very complex and sometimes very emotional issue. Ultimately, we believe that the implementation of these recommendations would make the system fairer to all, whilst continuing to place the interests of the child as the main priority.
I welcome the positive comments of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs on the outcome of the inquiry, and I look forward to the government's considered response to the recommendations. I also wish to place on record my appreciation of the committee chair, the member for Riverina, the supporting secretariat and my fellow committee members for the extraordinary amount of time and energy that was put in. All members of the committee spent many hours, days and weeks reading through the public submissions and considering all aspects of the issues raised. I have enjoyed working with all of my parliamentary colleagues, both Labor and coalition, in a bipartisan manner and believe that, despite the heavy workload, we have provided the parliament with something very positive and a means to improve the lot of many of our fellow Australians, especially those one million children who are the real victims of broken relationships. I recommend the report.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title> Family and Community Affairs Committee</title>,Committees,26,1,speech
"George, Jennie, MP",ALP,2004-02-11,"—As a backbencher in this parliament and one who, like many others, deals on a regular basis with constituents who seek my help in matters to do with the Child Support Agency and family breakdown, it was a terrific opportunity for me to participate in the work of this committee, despite the fact that the time constraint was quite onerous. I want to echo the comments made by the member for Makin in congratulating the chair of the committee, the member for Riverina, and all the members of the committee for their enlightened contributions conducted in a bipartisan manner. We decided from the outset that the issues we were asked to consider—that is, how we could reform the family law system to make it work better and more fairly—were too important for party politics to be intruded into. Very importantly, our starting point was that the best interests of children had to be the paramount consideration.
We were quite daunted by the short time frame. With regard to that, I want to state my thanks to the very hard working secretariat, who laboured for many hours to make sure that we were able to present the report and have it tabled by the end of the year. I also want to thank the thousands of people who either made written submissions or travelled huge distances to be with us. They often travelled hundreds of miles to make a five-minute contribution. It was at times a very emotional experience, but I feel that the average person out there in the community should feel satisfied that the committee, in the recommendations that we have proposed, has seriously considered the trials and tribulations that beset people when marriages break down and, very importantly, what happens as far as children are concerned.
As a member of the committee I was quite startled to realise the very high percentage of children, some 36 per cent, who visited their other natural parent either rarely—with `rarely' being defined as once a year or even less often—or never at all. With such a damning statistic it is no wonder that many separated parents, mostly fathers, feel excluded from their children's lives following separation.
That was one of the real issues we had to contend with: how do we make the system fairer while recognising changing work force patterns, recognising that there are many more women now in paid employment and also recognising the very positive development where there are greater numbers of fathers who want to spend more of their time with their children. We established that despite the best intentions of the parliament in 1995 with the Family Reform Act, shared parenting and shared care was in fact atypical for the overwhelming majority of separated families. It is almost as if a status quo had been established where we had what people describe as the `cookie-cutter outcome' of the 80-20 split-up where the mother, primarily, had the child or children resident with her and fathers being seen as supplementary additions to the equation. I think many of them describe themselves as the kind of Hollywood dads that appear in the child's life maybe on alternate fortnights, for part of the holidays and for very few days in between.
Despite those intentions in 1995 that we would move to a greater emphasis on shared parenting, the reality was something quite different. The committee has recommended that the system ought to operate with a rebuttable presumption of equal shared parental responsibility in post-separation decision making. By this we mean that in law there will be a requirement that parents consult with one another before making decisions about major issues relevant to the care, welfare and development of children. We envisage that this would include decisions about where children would be educated, the nature of their religious and cultural upbringing and their usual place of residence. We have in mind that this would be formalised in a parenting plan.
The committee rejected the concept that we were asked to investigate of a rebuttable presumption of fifty-fifty shared custody. While we believe that the goal for the majority of families should be to increase the amount of parenting time—hopefully to a situation, where it is feasible, of shared parenting time—we could not support forcing such an outcome or the mandating of fifty-fifty shared custody arrangements in potentially inappropriate circumstances by way of legislation. We had a weight of professional opinion that came to the committee that stability in a primary home and routine is an optimal outcome for young children in particular. We thought that the amount of time a child spent with each parent after separation should be a decision made preferably by both parents—one that was in the interests of the child and on the basis of what arrangements would work best for each family. The one-size-fits-all approach was not something we could support. However, we do acknowledge that in the current situation too many children are missing out and that this has some negative impacts, particularly for young men, and we acknowledge the debate in the community about the lack of parental role models, particularly for our boys.
I think there was quite a deal of confusion about the notion of a rebuttable presumption of joint custody; many people believed that this operated in some states in the USA. After extensive research by the committee and the secretariat, we found that that was not the case. What was operating was the notion of shared legal responsibility, a conclusion that the committee has recommended. So it was not only about looking at how we could assist a better relationship between children in separated families but also a recognition, I think, that in changing work force patterns the traditional model may no longer be one that suits a growing interest on the part of fathers, as parents, to have a greater say in the raising of their children and more involvement with them.
There was also considerable dissatisfaction with the institutional way in which the current family law process operates. Australia's system for resolving family disputes remains primarily a legal and adversarial one. Because it is adversarial, you end up producing winners and losers. At a time of heightened emotional strain between separating adults, you end up with one feeling that they are the loser in the equation, and that carries on with them in the way they view their ongoing relationship with their children: they see themselves—as they often told us in their evidence—as the losers in the system.
The other issue that concerned me about the adversarial nature of the legal system was that many of my constituents felt that justice was not done because they did not have the money to pursue cases that they felt had significant merit. And this is not only for the initial applications that go before the Family Court. We were often told of the frustration people experienced when court orders that had been determined and which were then breached required nothing short resubmitting oneself to a very lengthy and costly legal process to gain an outcome. When you have a system where people feel excluded on the basis of their capacity to pay, there is something wrong. 
Beyond that, we believed, and came to the view in our recommendations, that there should be greater emphasis on mediation, and that assistance for separating adults to reach sensible and rational outcomes was a preferable way to go. You cannot legislate for good behaviour, and not everybody is going to avail themselves of the recommended increase in material and financial resources to assist in mediation, but we have to make recommendations that we believe are going to suit the majority of families rather than those in whose eyes no system is going to produce a reasonable outcome.  There are people and some groups that still believe the committee has not gone far enough. It may be that in the end you cannot produce recommendations that are going to get support from everybody, but I have no doubt that our recommendations have met with wide support in mainstream Australia.
We recommend that in future there be a requirement for separating parents to formally go through mediation before they are able to make an application to a court or tribunal for a parenting order, except in cases where there is family violence, substance abuse or child abuse, including sexual abuse. Where those issues are the cause of marital breakdown, and issues relating to the welfare of children have to be resolved, they will continue to be formally dealt with through the courts. But instead of what happens now in marital breakdown, where the first point of reference is the local solicitor or the chamber magistrate, we are suggesting that there be a one-stop shop approach where government can establish agencies that can assist parents to develop a parenting plan that has the interests of the children at its centre.
We believe that a families tribunal should be established where, in the event of mediation not resolving the dispute between the separating parents, a system of conciliation and arbitration along the lines that we have had historically for resolving industrial relations disputes might be set in place to deal with family issues into the future. We believe that the vast majority of cases are capable of resolution before disputes reach lawyers and the court.

Main Committee adjourned at 1.00 p.m.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title> Family and Community Affairs Committee</title>,Committees,26,1,speech
"Cadman, Alan, MP",LP,2004-02-11,"—In Australia the number of marriages taking place per year has for the last 10 years been 110,000 to 115,000. The number of divorces which have also taken place over that 10-year period has gradually increased from about 42,000 to 49,000 in 2000. The number of divorces involving children is almost the total number: they nearly all involve children to some extent.
This inquiry into child custody arrangements of the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs exposed some intense hurt and pain from dreadful personal relationships that had soured and, in some instances, gone to violence, noncommunication and a sort of warfare between separated partners in which the children became involved and were one of the weapons used by parents against each other. Of the 597,000 families who had a child with a natural parent living elsewhere, 41 per cent received no child support, 42 per cent received cash child support and a further 16.3 per cent received only in-kind child support.
Whilst the statistics are interesting, it is really the interpersonal relationships that were the focus of the committee's attention. We have had representations, certainly on our side of the House, for a number of years now from fathers who do not have the custody or the care of their children about the unfairness of the system. Investigations have indicated that there are certainly strong elements to say that those fathers have good reason for their complaints. But, on the other hand, there are instances where fathers, or the non-custodial parent, have failed to live up to their obligations and made life excruciatingly difficult for the custodial parent.
The committee came to this issue and decided that there were two distinct areas that needed attention: existing cases where there are court orders and arrangements in place, and cases that are yet to come before the court or yet to be decided where change offers the greatest scope and prospect to get a new environment and ethos operating. So the two areas had to be dealt with. It would be no surprise to the House to hear me say that the prospective cases, where we could bring significant change, offered the greatest opportunities for us to try to ameliorate the problems.
Australia has a system where the court intervenes in family break-ups more specifically and with more detail than any other nation on earth. As far as I can make out, in Britain, the United States and Europe there is generally a more conciliatory attitude adopted by the family law acts. Around the world, parents are told by the courts and by the structure of family law in their country, `It is your problem, so you need to try to resolve it.' In Australia, however, the court is likely to intervene at a very early stage and people have access to the court at a very early stage. In some instances, the court seems to delight in taking early intervention. That is something that this committee believes should be changed.
Despite the best efforts of the parliament in 1995 to bring changes that reflect a more congenial approach, a better sharing by parents of responsibility for the future of their children, there is little evidence that that has had any impact on the courts or the outcomes whatsoever. But this committee is more serious about bringing change.
The Family Court of Australia has had an opportunity to try to implement those previous decisions of the parliament, and the parliament now has considered the issue and thinks that the court ought to be more strongly addressed in its responsibilities. Firstly, for existing cases we need to look at what the benefits are one way or the other. The complaints of the dads have been about their access to children. `Non-custodial parents' would be a better term because it does not matter whether they are male or female. There are no gender factors in this process whatsoever. I will use the term `dads' but it includes any non-custodial parent. Dads want better access to their children, access that is understandable and access that is provided as the courts lay down. The onerous payment of child support where there is more than one family involved is something that needs addressing. If a partner remarries that establishes two families for which they have financial responsibility: a former marriage and court based commitment, and a current marriage. Mums have complaints which are justified: non-compliance by fathers in payment and also hiding income and failing to live up to the responsibilities of a parent.
How do we resolve these? What the committee decided for existing cases was basically this: where there are breaches, they should be added up and there should be a cumulative approach to breaches. For instance, if a mother, for spurious reasons, fails to grant access—where there is a contrived process to keep fathers away from children for no good reason—then we believe that the meter should be turned on and, after the third breach within a pattern of deliberate defiance of court orders, consideration should be given to changing the parenting order, so that the father increases his access and increases opportunity, so there is a penalty for non-compliance. Currently there are no penalties; it is all subjective law. The families come before the courts and the judge makes a decision on what he considers may be in the best interest of the children. On property settlement and matters like that it is a very easy process because the court is dealing with factual information, but this is subjective law and the sooner we get away from it for the future the better. But for those in the current system there needs to be some discipline applied, and the court should retain the ultimate sanction of imprisonment. We believe that, harsh though that may seem, there are some people who deliberately flout the law and cause great hardship and trauma within their family. 
In the current system we believe that there should be a cap on the income paid by parents because there is a limit to how much money should be invested in a child. If there is a lifestyle maintenance factor in the payment of child benefits, that should be considered as part of the maintenance for the total family and not related to the care of children. So there should be a cap on the amount that is payable for the maintenance of children and we believe there should be an estimation made on the cost of raising children at various income levels so that benefits paid to custodial parents should be related to the actual cost of raising children.
The committee also believes that the deliberate link between the amount of child support and the time children spend with each parent under sections 47 and 49 should be removed. There is no doubt that the 109 nights syndrome is prevalent and greater access generally will not be given if mothers feel they are going to damage their income by granting more than 109 nights' access the way the scales work. We believe that that factor ought to be removed completely and it should be replaced with a new parenting payment to non-resident parents with above 10 per cent care. 
It is not only the cases which come before the courts that are affected by this 109-night regime, but also cases that do not. There is an 80/20 per cent rebuttable assumption already in the system. It is assumed by practically every male and every female in the nation, encouraged by their solicitors, that the male will have the children every second weekend and half of the school holidays. That is the 80/20 per cent rule that is currently in place. It is a regime that works throughout the system and, despite denials by the Family Court and other people, it is in place and that is the way in which the system is working. We have rejected that approach. Part of the rejection of that approach is to deal with the 109-night factor for residency and the linking of that to benefits and child payments.
We also recommend amending the determination of the payer's child support income. We recommend that it be determined by halving the formula for income earned by way of a second job—provided the first job is 38 hours or more—or overtime. Where there is a second family involved, people work extraordinarily hard and have huge commitments that they try to live up to. Some families break under this process and the male usually becomes unemployed. I believe that some people become unemployed deliberately, to avoid their responsibilities. When the payer becomes unemployed, the minimum payment of $5 a week comes into effect and that is the way the matter is resolved. We have tried, in this system, to toughen the rules applying to child support payments. So there is a requirement here that all sorts of measures to collect funds under the child support scheme should be applied by the child support agency. We do not believe that enough effort is made. We also believe that the minimum payment limit of $5 a week should be doubled. We believe that all decisions of the child support agency should be open to external review. That is what is proposed for existing cases, a substantial change. 
For new cases there is a new regime, a process of assuming that parents have equal say in the future of their children. It is not a rebuttable process but simply an assumption that the law will make sure that each parent has an equal say, and there will be no reasons for them to not have an equal say. From that will flow the concept of equal time spent with parents unless that proves impractical. The parenting plan for the future of the children—involving their education, religious training, type of lifestyle, sports and the friends they will associate with—needs to be developed from day one. Under these proposals, no payments are contemplated for six weeks until a parenting plan is in place. Social security benefits can be paid but there will be no payments or child support until the parents show a willingness to go to mediation and try to resolve their differences. Once that process starts, within the six-week period, payments can start to flow. So there is an incentive there for parents to try to resolve this issue, both for the dad and the mum, or the caring parent and the non-custodial parent, to be able to get together to establish a proper plan. Once that plan is in place it will be capable of variation because as children grow up changes need to be made, but it should be done by way of mediation, conciliation if necessary or, ultimately, arbitration through a tribunal without any support from the legal community. The only support of a legal type that the tribunal can bring is advice to the tribunal itself, where it will seek clarification on points of law. Only on a denial of natural justice should any cases go forward to the Family Court.
This process is enlightened and helpful. My heart goes out to those people currently trapped with court orders in the existing system. If both partners want to adopt the new system they may under our proposal—but the warfare that currently exists can be assisted by a number of techniques including supervised meetings between parents and other processes such as those adopted by Unifam.

In my view, this is possibly the most important parliamentary committee report that has been handed down in the time that I have been in the parliament. It is to the great credit of all members of the committee that they have come up with a set of proposals that really do offer the opportunity of having a bipartisan way forward to deal with an intractable, extremely difficult and very challenging set of issues that touch the lives of hundreds of thousands, indeed millions, of Australians—issues that for too long the parliament has swept under the carpet.

Sitting suspended from 10.41 a.m. to 10.55 a.m.
—Other than a handful of honourable exceptions, such as the member for Chifley, we in this parliament have for far too long neglected the issues that are dealt with in this report, Every picture tells a story. There are a number of particular themes in this report that I want to comment on in commending the committee—both Liberal and Labor members—for its work and for the ideas and proposals that have been put forward in the report.
Something I am particularly pleased about is that a theme that I referred to in my book Crowded Lives has, quite independently of anything I have done, been picked up by the committee: that is, that the current system of child support, custodial arrangements and access issues is far too heavily focused on financial matters. Although those are clearly fundamental, there is a deficiency in the current system in that it does not deal anywhere near enough with the question of the right of children to have the love and nurturing and care of both parents, regardless of whether or not both parents are living with them under the same roof.
Clearly there will be circumstances where that is not possible; there will be circumstances where that is not desirable. But it is worth noting that there are something like 300,000 children in Australia who either do not see at all or only very occasionally see the parent who is not living in the same home with them. In some cases undoubtedly that will be a good thing, but in many cases it is a tragedy. It is something that can cause significant damage to the wellbeing of the child. It can cause children to grow up with feelings of resentment, of abandonment and of anger and can have a range of negative consequences for their futures as adults in our society.
I believe our society needs to send more signals to people who are in the position of non-custodial parents like me that just because you are no longer living under the same roof as your children does not mean that you no longer have responsibilities as a parent for their upbringing. And these responsibilities are not just financial responsibilities; in particular, fathers are more than wallets and they have responsibilities to their children which go well beyond the question of straight financial contribution. In turn, custodial parents—in most cases mothers—have a responsibility to ensure that the non-custodial parents have a reasonable opportunity to fulfil those responsibilities to their children.
I am pleased to see that the committee has not adopted the initial starting proposal that was put to it about rebuttable 50-50 joint custody, mainly because that is an unrealistic proposition. However much it may have been motivated by well meaning intentions, in the real world that we inhabit it would simply set the bar too high and create a situation where, the bar being set so high, the vast majority of people would not even try and jump. We want people to jump. By setting the bar too high, we create a disincentive to even bother trying.
The concept that the committee has come up with as an alternative is commendable. It is exactly the right kind of approach: the concept of joint responsibility, which means both a say in the upbringing of the child on the part of the non-custodial parent but also a set of responsibilities that go with that. It includes the concept of a parenting plan and a negotiated outcome between the two separating parents that will lead to a longer term set of arrangements designed to ensure that to the maximum extent possible both parents play a role in the lives of their children, both parents contribute to the upbringing of their children and both parents fulfil their responsibility of love and nurturing to their children, regardless of the fact that their relationship has broken down.
We should not be too naive about this. Obviously, every marital or family breakdown is unique and in many circumstances nothing will solve the problem. This is very tricky terrain for legislators because we are dealing with the most emotionally fraught and the most difficult issues that confront people. Nonetheless, we have to do better. We may not be able to solve all these problems for everybody but we have to do better than we have been doing in the past.
The second theme that I applaud in the committee's report is the proposed establishment of a new tribunal to deal with many of the disputes that emerge in family breakdown, separation and custody situations. This has been surprisingly controversial. I think that much of the attack on this proposal has been a little bit self-interested. To me the concept has enormous merit. Inevitably, there will need to be debate about the fine detail—there are some tricky issues to navigate here—but there is no doubt, from my experience dealing with constituents, both custodial and non-custodial parents, that one of the fundamental weaknesses in the existing system is people's inability to get quick, easy, cheap resolution of disputes. That is a fundamental problem. It is a fundamental problem for a custodial parent who is having payments withheld, payments cheated on or false statements made with respect to income. It is an equally fundamental problem for non-custodial parents against whom access rights are being manipulated or children's access is being denied. 
Some of these disputes can be quite minor in isolation but ultimately they are very important in the lives of the people concerned. Even very simple, limited disputes can escalate to major conflict and a situation where one parent uses the child against the other parent as part of that dispute. One of the reasons why that can flourish is the inadequacy of the existing dispute resolution system where, in most situations, the person who is the aggrieved party faces the prospect of considerable expense, time and delay in order to resolve a dispute. Therefore, a much more user-friendly dispute resolution mechanism is critical. 
I suspect that the problem with the family law system at the moment is that it has become part of the broader legal establishment. We face the same kinds of issues in areas like workers compensation, where there is an elaborate framework involving a lot of people, a lot of lawyers, and a lot of notional and actual rights. It may all look very good on paper and be difficult to criticise in theory, but in practice, when you deal with the consequences of how that system actually works, you realise that it has major practical deficiencies—particularly for those who cannot afford to pay for lawyers or to participate in the system in the way that it is structured. Establishing some kind of better dispute resolution mechanism that is less formal, less costly and less time consuming is, I believe, a fundamental obligation of this parliament. I commend that aspect of the report also.
On the issues of child support payment and the amounts that are involved, I also think that the committee has got it right. I confess that I have a self-interest in making these observations, so I should caution anybody who is taking notice of what I say that, as a person who is currently paying the absolute maximum in child support, obviously I cannot separate myself entirely from the issues. However, I think the arguments put in the report, at both extremes, are compelling. There are substantial numbers of people in this country who are paying too little in child support, and there are others who are paying too much—where the amount being paid is out of all proportion to the actual cost of raising a child, even in relative comfort in an upper middle-class kind of environment.
The problem with this is that it distorts behaviour. It creates a range of false incentives. For some people it creates an incentive not to work, and it creates incentives for tax avoidance to avoid responsibilities. These things will always be there in some form or other. When a family splits in two, there are always losers, and usually both parties lose because costs that were spread over a single unit are now spread over two units. Nonetheless, we can do better, and I think that the proposals put forward by the committee are commendable because they address the issues in a sensible, intelligent way.
It is worth noting, for example, as an illustration of the anomaly and as an illustration of the perverse incentives and the penalties that exist in the current system, that under the current child support arrangements the maximum payment for a high-income earner with one child is approaching $400 a week and that if that person has a child in a second relationship the liability for child support that they have to pay is reduced by roughly $12 a week. In effect, the system says: `The child of your first marriage is worth $400 a week, and the child of your second marriage is worth $12 a week.' That is an absolute absurdity and a fundamental disincentive and barrier to people forming second relationships. Clearly, that is a major problem. What happens to people in this situation? They are the people who end up in the suicide flats. They are the ones who end up with problems at work, getting retrenched and, in middle age, becoming alcoholics, committing suicide, getting into all kinds of different social problems. We should be ensuring both for custodial parents and for non-custodial parents that one of the objectives of the system is to maximise their opportunities to repartner. That should be a very important objective of the system.
—And not discriminate against children.
—That is right. These are very difficult issues and there is no absolute black-and-white solution to them. Nonetheless, we can do a great deal better than is currently the case.
The final thing I think is important to say is that this inquiry is a very good illustration in practice of how taking a broader relationships perspective on issues that face our society can change the way we deal with them and also is not inherently politically partisan. The great outcome of this report is that we have a very constructive, valuable alternative strategy for dealing with these issues from a bipartisan position where there is no necessary barracking for one side or another in the traditional battles that have been involved in this sphere and where the issues have not become a political football between the different sets of interests—one highly approving, the other highly disapproving. That is a tremendous achievement on the part of the committee. I believe it illustrates the value that we can achieve as a society and as representatives if we take a broader relationships focused approach on these kinds of issues. We can produce outcomes that will get broad community support and broad political support.
These issues are huge. Now that the honourable member for Chifley is in the chamber I will repeat my earlier comments. With very few exceptions, such as the honourable member for Chifley, for far too long members of parliament right across the board have failed to address these issues and have neglected our responsibilities. These issues affect millions of Australians—not just a relatively small minority but a huge number of people. In a very substantial proportion of cases, the effects on people's lives are extremely adverse. That is inherent in what we are dealing with here. When you have marriage breakdowns where children are involved there will be damage, there will be problems, no matter what structure of arrangements we have to deal with them. But we can do a great deal better than we are doing now.
The reforms in the 1980s were overwhelmingly focused on the financial issues of ensuring that children could be brought up with a reasonable standard of living and that custodial parents were not battling away in extreme poverty, as many were. That was correct and proper. That was appropriate. It was important. But it was only the first stage of dealing with these issues. The next stage is what is recommended in this report. All the members of the committee should be commended for their tremendous contribution. All of them, whenever they eventually retire or leave public life, should look back on this report as a very important contribution to the long-term welfare and wellbeing of the people of this nation.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,26,2,speech
"King, Peter, MP",LP,2004-02-11,"—The family is the bedrock of our society. To make good that proposition, we in this place must ensure that the law conforms to the principle and values contained within it. As has been put so eloquently by the honourable member who has just spoken and is contained in paragraph after paragraph of this important report, which received deserved publicity over the Christmas vacation, all is not well in the bedrock of our society and much can be done to improve the solutions that this parliament is offering through legislation and administrative arrangements and through the judicature and the judicial arrangements that we are responsible for.
My attention was first drawn to this problem by several constituents, and two principal cases that I will mention briefly. The first was of a man who walked through my front door looking destitute; he had a rather painful tale to tell. He was then living in a garage at a friend's house. His bank account was empty because the Child Support Agency had, on the application of his former wife, removed any remaining funds because of his failure—which he conceded—to pay child support. His concern was that he could not afford lawyers to contest the quantum of the payment. Quite frankly, he had lost the will or the morale to take yet another battle through the courts to resolve the issue and effect a balance which he thought fair and which, on the face of it, appeared to me to be more reasonable than what had been laid down by the court structure. I did not have the opportunity to speak to the wife and I have not done so since. But that is one of the anonymous cases of many around this nation where extreme unhappiness has been the result of the separation of families.
Another case involves a slightly different flavour where again a male approached my office and claimed that his businesses had been ruined by payments made as a result of separation agreements that the Family Court had refused to amend. It was true that his businesses had been sold and he did appear to have suffered significantly. But, as a result of investigations I made through the Child Support Agency, it appeared that there were significant queries about the extent of the disclosure of (a) his losses and (b) the impact of the orders upon his business arrangements.
I suppose it is fair to say that, at the end of the day, what is sometimes forgotten with these problems is that the eye of the storm, the centre of the problem, is the other children of the family. I raised some of these issues in the party room last year because I was concerned about the administration of the Child Support Agency and what appeared to be the draconian impact of some of its administrative measures, based upon legislation, which gave the right to access bank accounts without notice in some cases and which appeared to lead to hardship in other cases while, on the other hand, recognising that the Child Support Agency was carrying out a very important role in our society.
I spoke about these issues to the executive director of the Child Support Agency—who, after being rather hard to get, finally responded to my correspondence—to learn first-hand about some of the cases that I was concerned about and which I had written about but to which I had had no reasonable response. So at least in relation to my constituents there was follow-up and some attention was paid to the detail of those concerns. I was pleased too when the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, the Hon. Larry Anthony, announced this important inquiry and, in particular, sought to focus on the problems of separated families in relation to the arrangements for children and whether or not there should be a presumption that children will spend equal time with each parent and, if so, in what circumstances such a presumption could be rebutted.
The measures in this report which I would commend to the House and which it seems to me are a basis for legislative intervention may be summarised as follows. Firstly, in respect of post-marriage arrangements, the proposal that part 7 of the Family Law Act be amended to create a clear and rebuttable presumption in favour of equal shared parental responsibility is at the heart of the matter. I think the committee came up with a sensible solution to a very difficult problem—which, quite frankly, the Family Court has been grappling with since the amendments to the act in 1995—as to how shared parental responsibility should be defined. The formula involves a requirement that parents consult with one another before making decisions about major issues relevant to the care, welfare and development of children, including but not confined to education, present and future religious and cultural upbringing, health, and change of surname and usual place of residence—all in the form of a parenting plan. It struck me as a sensible, expedient proposal that would be workable having regard to the desire of the committee and those many concerned people out in the wider community to ensure that less formality and more focusing on the substantive problems that parents and children face be the subject of any report and any final recommendations.
One of the problems has been that section 60B of the act sets out the importance of a child's right to continue to know and be cared for by both parents, yet the outcomes in post-separation parenting arrangements since 1995 have not supported this nostrum. So the proposal put forward by the committee, it seems to me, does address this problem and is a proposal that is workable.
The second aspect of the report in relation to post-marriage arrangements that I would commend is the proposal that courts not be the first port of call where there has been a separation and a breakdown of the family. Rather, a tribunal, in this case to be called a families tribunal, with power to resolve disputes about shared parenting responsibility should be established which would look at future parenting arrangements in the best interests of children, or children and property, principally by agreement of the parents, being child inclusive and non-adversarial. It sounds good, I suppose, although, to be fair to the Family Court, when parties line up one side against the other, whether before an informal families tribunal such as that proposed or in the Family Court itself, one side will take a point against the other and at the end of the day somebody has to decide who is right and who is wrong. One of the problems with these situations is that, because emotions run high, people are not disposed to compromise. Settlement is not really part of the lexicon of the parties involved, and the children affected by this are really a third consideration. So it is very difficult, no matter what form of tribunal you adopt, to ensure that you reach that informality and that you reach that proper focus which the committee is inviting the government to introduce.
With that one word of warning, I support the recommendation so that the Family Court becomes, in a sense, the last port of call, the tribunal which decides the dispute that the families tribunal does not. I say to the legislators and administrators who seek to bring in this legislation: be careful about giving any judicial power to such a tribunal; leave that with the Family Court. Make this the tribunal you have set out to make it—namely, one that will seek to reach compromise and one that will make recommendations that lead to that focus on substance which is at the heart of this recommendation in the report.
The third recommendation that I commend relates to community education. Of course none of us are perfect when it comes to parenting—and some of us would concede that we are not perfect when it comes to many things—but parenting is a matter of value judgment; there are some objective criteria but there are many subjective criteria as well. Circumstance, morality, religious belief and conviction, tradition, family ties and other factors influence the way people approach this sort of problem. Nonetheless, at the end of the day, it is helpful to have a community education program to identify those objective criteria which, in the experience of those involved in family relationship advisory services, are critical for a successful outcome.
The fourth recommendation that I embrace concerns the need for better access to services relating to breakdown. Those services have to be available. It seems to me it is not just a question of having somebody sitting behind a desk; sometimes they have to get out from behind the desk and go out to the community—out to the houses, out to the caravan parks and even out onto the streets. But they need to have a structured and sensitive system in place that is really going to address these problems and make those services accessible.
The second group of measures that I wish to focus on in this debate concerns child support services. The six weeks moratorium is, I think, a good idea. The doubling of the payment is a good idea: $5 a week is obviously too little. The adjustment of the payments to reflect the real needs of the children's arrangements is important. People should be paying what is necessary and what is needed. I think those arrangements are good. I like the idea of a detailed investigation into the operation of the Child Support Agency, as proposed by this committee, and I recommend to the minister that he set about doing that.
The third basic issue of concern is grandparents and their role. I commend the committee for conferring on grandparents—and I would extend this to relatives—a role in the parenting plan. There is going to need to be a little bit of  creativity with our administrators in dealing with this aspect of the proposal but, at the end of the day, can anybody think of somebody who is better at supporting the children of a separated family than the relatives, anybody who would care more than them? Obviously there will be some who will not care but, where there is a choice, where such people are available, they should be supported to do so. That is the gravamen of the report. I commend this report to the House. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,26,2,speech
"Price, Roger, MP",ALP,2004-02-11,"—It is a pleasure to speak on this report. When this inquiry was first announced there were probably three levels of concern. Firstly, we on the Labor side were very apprehensive about the nature of this inquiry and whether or not, frankly, we were going to be wedged. Secondly, we on the Labor side were very concerned about the short duration that the committee had to get into a very difficult subject and to bring out a worthwhile report. We have paid some penalties for timing but it is a credit to Kay Hull, the committee and the committee secretariat that this proved not to be a problem, just as, I might say, the first matter proved not to be a problem. Thirdly, those on the coalition side were concerned about whether it would be possible to get goodwill in the committee so that we could produce a unanimous report. Indeed, that proved not to be a problem in the end.
I must say that I have spent a little bit of time on this subject, as was so generously remarked on by the member for Melbourne. I have always fundamentally believed that there had to be a better way. Having spent a little bit of time in the area in the past and coming newly onto the committee, I must say that the committee members were pretty generous to me. In no way was I the fount of all knowledge; indeed, I gained and learnt a lot from being on the inquiry. I pay tribute to our deputy chair, Julia Irwin, and Jennie George. I think they made a very powerful contribution and in no small measure added to the acceptance of the report on our Labor side. Of course, Harry Quick was also a member of the committee.
Nothing has disappointed me more than some of the knee-jerk hysterical reactions by groups that I have spent many years going to and talking to about these matters, particularly some of the dads groups. I was more than disappointed at what I thought was a very poor response by the lone parents organisation that speaks for men's groups on these issues.
It is true that we did not endorse the presumption of joint rebuttable custody. That does not mean that before the report was tabled there had not been instances where that has been the model freely adopted by some parents. But we did not accept it. We went for something that was far more fundamental, and that was to say, `Look, in trying to navigate our way through this thorny area, we need to keep at the forefront of our minds the children and the impact on the children.' If there is to be a common denominator for reform, it will be the children. If there is to be a common denominator for parents breaking away from what can often be almost warfare, it will be the children. Indeed, there was a tremendous amount of evidence that child-focused mediation—that is, when you are talking to the children and to the parents, and the parents are having fed back to them some of the impacts that their separation and divorce are having on the children—often is the catalyst and facilitator for a change of attitudes for a more sensible outcome. What we are trying to entrench here is that parents cannot absolve themselves from their responsibility for decision making and involvement in the lives of their children. Intact, separated, lapsed—whatever you like to say—that is the principle. It is not 75-25, it is not 80-20; it is 50-50. In fact, I think there has been a whole new emphasis given to parenting plans.
When parenting plans first came in, I said in this place, `They are terrific things and they work exceedingly well for parents who do not need them.' What this report says is that the first thing that parents need to do, in a relatively short period of time, is to sit down and work out what is going to happen to the children, what will be in the best interests of the children, what their mutual responsibilities to the children will be, and how they are going to make decisions in the future. We have really put a new emphasis on children. 
I am pleased that the member for Dickson is in the chamber, because during the hearings he was constantly raising the issue of tribunals. I could not be more pleased. It is fundamental to understand that the committee had evidence from learned law professors, as well as from the chief legal adviser to the Commonwealth, that issues of residency and contact can be treated administratively. If they are treated administratively rather than judicially, a tribunal does not need a chapter 3 judge to head it. The Child Support Agency deals with administrative matters, which are seen as being administrative and therefore there is no chapter 3 head of the Child Support Agency—just as there will not be with this tribunal.
Some have said, `We'll have to look at the constitutionality of the tribunal.' Learned law professors can disagree, and I guess sometimes the learned advice of the chief legal adviser to the Commonwealth may be a tad wrong; but, in the interim, I think it is worth while taking it. It affords us a real breakthrough—a huge breakthrough. I think what shocked so many members of the committee was hearing how many thousands of dollars are spent on pursuing issues surrounding divorce. If only that money were being spent on the children, and on the parents getting on with their new lives, it would be a huge success. There has never been any study—and I regret it—that estimates what people out there in voter land are spending on the legal profession in family law on issues of divorce, contact and residency. We know that they can spend over $100,000. They can spend all their available money. They can wrack up the debt on the Bankcard and then they are into the grandparents. We even learned of a grandparent in Blacktown who, tragically, lost her house funding the legal profession. I think there is a role for the profession, but I do not think it has a role in dealing with the entrails of failed marriages and divorces, in the majority of cases. 
The tribunal clearly can deal with issues of contact and residency. The model that we have proposed is one that is familiar to a lot of Australians, and that is conciliation and arbitration—that is, trying to bring the parties together and then arbitrating a decision, but only arbitrating after a panel of tribunal members has actually decided. It is a system that is familiar, it works well, it will work well, and lawyers can appear only by leave of the tribunal. In other words, we are trying to get lawyers out of the tribunal. We are trying to stop this haemorrhage of family assets post-separation and divorce. We want a sensible, no frills and minimum cost approach for people to sort out those problems. In fact, the best idea is for them to sort it out themselves and do not go near a tribunal or a court.
I want to say a couple of things about the Family Court. If I go and hold up a garage in my electorate, I will go to the Magistrate's Court and then to the District Court. If I commit an assault and battery on someone, I will go to the Magistrate's Court and then to the District Court. But if my marriage fails, I have to go to the equivalent not of the Blacktown Magistrate's Court or the Penrith District Court but to the Supreme Court of New South Wales. That is a superior court. One of the real problems we have in trying to get parents to be sensible about the dissolution of their marriage is that they need to go through a grieving process. It is all very well to say that in the Family Court parents will not agree and will prolong the dispute. But it is really like an out-of-body experience for them. The great advantage of a tribunal is that you can allow some of the grief and hurt to come out in a tribunal setting. It makes no difference to the ultimate decision. It is certainly irrelevant in terms of the legality of the thing but it is just so important in terms of the healing process.
In a sense there is a controversial function added to the tribunal—again I give due credit to the member for Dickson—and that is an investigative arm. One of the most frustrating issues in family law is the fact that allegations are made. As one QC who has taken appeal cases to the Family Court in Adelaide said to me—I apologise that I cannot name him—the Family Court is rife with perjury. There are state instrumentalities such as the police and, in my state, the Department of Community Services, that are charged with investigating it. But once matters get to the Family Court those state instrumentalities tend to drop off and you have a void. I can make some heinous allegations in the court that essentially remain uninvestigated and untested, but the law makes decisions about respective matters in the Family Court. Whether or not we do that, a very important area has been highlighted in that recommendation.
Lone parents said that nothing has changed in relation to the tribunal. I say to them that everything has changed in relation to the tribunal and in relation to the recommendations. We are told time and again, and I accept it, that at Christmas time people commit suicide because they have no prospect of contact with their children. It is a terrible situation. This report is all about appropriate and proper balancing and ensuring that parents do have contact. I cannot say that we will have a 100 per cent success rate in every marriage or relationship breakdown but we can be confident that we will make a huge difference to the vast bulk of those cases.
I now refer to child support. If we were rushed in any area—perhaps the report suffered a little, although I do not resile from the recommendations—it was child support. We were unable to do some modelling. We would sorely have loved to know what the effect of certain changes and combinations would have been. I cannot but agree with the member for Melbourne that it is an utter disgrace that under the current system you can see that children in one relationship are treated differently and are financially supported differently from children in a second or third relationship. That brings us no joy at all and it is a matter of shame.
I support the recommendations. I particularly highlight that, for the first time, we have recommended a proper external review of child support decisions. There was an internal review process. It was better than just going to the Family Court, which was the system that it replaced, but again this is a logical and sound development of the system. At a Commonwealth level, citizens should be entitled to a proper external review that does not cost them an arm and a leg. 
Again, I compliment my fellow committee members and the staff. I think that it represents the best traditions of the parliament in bringing down a unanimous report on such a difficult area. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,26,2,speech
"Dutton, Peter, MP",LP,2004-02-11,"—I will start my contribution today by thanking Kay Hull and my fellow committee members for the superb effort they have put in over the last four or five months. I listened quite intently to the contribution from my good friend the member for Chifley and, despite much robust debate during the course of our committee hearings, both public and private, I do want to say today that the member for Chifley has been a long-term advocate for change in this very important area of public policy. It is also appropriate that the member for Hinkler should be in the Main Committee today because he too is a person who represents his electorate very well and has voiced on a number of occasions, both in our party room and in other arenas, the need for change in this area. 
It is also a timely opportunity today to thank Bev Forbes, Margaret Atkin and all of the committee secretariat staff for their dedication and their support throughout the term of this inquiry. Without their assistance, we would not have been able to achieve what we have done in such a short period of time. I also congratulate the Prime Minister, who initiated this inquiry. It was his foresight and his reading of the mood of the Australian public that initiated this inquiry. He understood the depth of feeling and hurt and anger in many parts of our community, and it is very appropriate that this inquiry has been set up. I thank the Prime Minister and the other ministers involved in that process.
Members of the committee and other members of this place have spoken about this report and about the almost 1,700 submissions that the committee received. Indeed, we took extensive evidence right across Australia. It is fair to say that there were some common themes that came from those submissions. Despite the fact that we were criticised for wanting to report within a short period of time, we felt that, even if we had 17,000 submissions, the same themes would have come through. With one million children in Australia affected by family separation, this issue is one of the greatest social problems this nation faces. Some of the themes that affected these children were the complaint from non-custodial parents, generally the fathers, that they were denied access to the children who lived with the mother or away from the non-custodial parent. That was certainly a common theme that was expressed not just by fathers but by mothers who are non-custodial parents. 
One of the other main themes was in relation to recipients of child support payments, who complained that their former partner was not paying the appropriate amount or was not paying anything at all. There were other themes, including, very sadly and tragically, stories from grandparents who had enjoyed very successful and loving relationships with their grandchildren right up to the point of separation and from that point on they had been deprived of seeing their grandchildren. That is one of the most tragic stories that we heard constantly throughout this inquiry. It is very sad indeed that people in the prime of their life who have so much to offer in the raising and the formation of a child's life should be deprived of that not so small pleasure.
I said before that this is one of the greatest social problems in Australia and I do not think it should be underestimated. It is a symptom or reflection, I suppose, of the broader issue of relationship breakdown in our community. The inquiry certainly has uncovered the flawed process we have for dealing with this breakdown. The member for Chifley quite rightly spoke in some detail about the problems with the Family Court. Although many people in Australia following the breakdown of their relationship are able to successfully deal with the quantum of problems that they face in the best interests of the children and of themselves, there are still a large proportion of people who find it completely inappropriate that their matters are dealt with by the Family Court. 
It is fair to say that the barriers for entry to the Family Court are great. They include the costs to both parties. We have taken evidence through this inquiry that the cost can extend to many hundreds of thousands of dollars—money that could, incidentally, be spent to set the child up for life, to put the child through private education or to provide housing and everything else, yet it is being squandered in a very bitter battle. Another great barrier is the delays that are experienced. Some matters are still not dealt with after a two-year period, which is completely unacceptable for many reasons—not least of which is the fact that children, depending on their age, may well have grown through that two-year period into an age where they require different things from their parents. It may be that they have been deprived of contact with one parent through a development period, which will set them back for the rest of their lives. That is an unacceptable situation.
Nobody who came before our inquiry and provided evidence that the status quo was acceptable convinced me or, I think, the other committee members that an adversarial system is appropriate for dealing with family breakdowns and outcomes that are in the best interests of the child. In my view, there is no place for an adversarial process where we are trying to provide a definite and substantive outcome for children—particularly for young children, who should enjoy a loving relationship with both their mum and their dad. It is unacceptable that these matters are dealt with in a family court that is adversarially based, that pitches one party against the other and that provides a forum for many people to continue the conflict that was present during the period that their relationship was intact. There are many people in Australia who use this process with malintent and who act quite irresponsibly, in my view—as irresponsibly as some of the legal practitioners who, on the evidence that we received, prolong these matters for financial gain. All of those people can be grouped into the same disgraceful category.
I suppose that is the reason for the substantive recommendation of this report—that a new family law process be established, under which a families tribunal would be established. That tribunal would see, on our recommendations, a panel of three people—somebody who expresses or is able to express the best interests of the child, somebody who is legally qualified and would be able to draft documents and parenting plans that both parties are able to work with, and somebody who would provide a balance in the area of mediation. The tribunal would operate so that, if the parties were not able to reach agreement, they would be arbitrated for and a decision in the best interests of the child would be provided to them.
One of the serious constraints the Family Court has at the moment is the fact that when interim or final orders are made, they are not living documents. So, when the circumstances of a particular family grouping change, the people have to go back to the court at great expense to have the orders modified. As children grow older, their needs change. As new partners come into the relationship, the needs, not just of the mum and dad but of the children, change. As new children come into the relationship then the circumstances and requirements change. As the job, the employment or the geographical location of either the mother or father changes, so do the circumstances in relation to the orders or parenting plan that needs to be put in place. That is one of the hallmarks of the families tribunal—it provides the ability, on our recommendations, for people to go back to the tribunal and have necessary arrangements and changes made that do support the best interests of the child.
—Madam Deputy Speaker, may I ask the member a question?
 (Ms Corcoran)—Is the member for Dickson prepared to take a question?
—Yes.
—Go ahead.
—Could he see that extending to federal magistrates being able to make those interim orders as well?
—I thank the member for Hinkler for his question. There has been some discussion about the involvement of federal magistrates in the process at the moment and about some of the powers that they have in relation to this process. The view of the committee, and the recommendations, would be that the parties would indeed go back to the tribunal and that under this process they would not go back to the federal magistrates, but that is one option that is certainly worthy of being looked at.
The member for Chifley made the very good point earlier that the Family Court is the equivalent of the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court, in most jurisdictions, is where murder trials are held or where there are trials for trafficking in large quantities of drugs. That indicates the seriousness and the severity of matters that need to go before a court such as the Supreme Court. That is one of the great barriers in relation to the structure of the Family Court. To get anywhere, people need to have money. They need to be able to engage not just a solicitor but a barrister and, in other circumstances, other counsel and legal experts, and witnesses that need to provide evidence to support one side or the other.
One of the other main restrictions in relation to the Family Court that has been spoken about before is in relation to affidavits and the giving of untested and uncorroborated evidence, which we have taken much evidence about. A complaint that followed right through this inquiry and right across Australia was that many affidavits go before the Family Court—one provided by the mum, one provided by the dad—and that it is untested and uncorroborated evidence that is accepted by the court, and the orders are made, quite unfairly, on that basis. It is an integral part of the families tribunal that we have recommended that an investigative arm be established. In these truly contested matters and where there are allegations of certain abuse and sexual abuse, the families tribunal investigative arm would be able to find the facts in relation to these contested allegations and the court would be able to decide based on those investigated facts. That is a substantive part of the way in which the families tribunal would provide for a just outcome for hundreds of thousands of Australians who do not receive that sort of justice under the Family Court system at this point in time.
The other considerable recommendations that we made were in relation to the Child Support Agency and the range of inequities that exist within that system. Nobody is suggesting that either in this area of child support recommendations or, indeed, anywhere in this report we have addressed all of the concerns that exist in our constituencies right across Australia. I know that my friend the member for Dobell has been a great and positive contributor to this debate and sees constituents about these matters on a daily basis. He has aired on a frequent basis problems that have been raised with him. We do not say that we have a system that can fit everybody's scenario. It is impossible, in my view, to try to come up with a system that provides a positive outcome for the millions of Australians who are affected by this situation and by the outcomes that result from family breakdown.
On the Child Support Agency we did make some important recommendations. There are many non-custodial parents who pay nothing towards the raising of their children. That is a completely unacceptable situation. There are many non-custodial parents who pay as little as $5 a week. In my view, that is also completely unacceptable. You can today buy a packet of cigarettes for twice that price. For somebody not to be able to contribute $5 a week, regardless of the situation, to a child that they have brought into the world, a child for whom they have not just a moral obligation but a financial obligation to see grow and prosper, is a completely unacceptable situation.
At the other end of the scale, under the Child Support Agency there are people—the majority of people—who pay a fair and decent contribution to the raising of their children. Many of those people have a legitimate complaint, in relation to the operation of the Child Support Agency and the systems that are in place within the agency, that they are dealt with unfairly and that they are denied reasonable contact with their children. Their complaints are justified, their complaints are understandable, and I have sympathy with their complaints, because there is evidence of that right across Australia. It is a problem we have tried to address, for example, by knocking out the 109 nights. There are many other ways that we could address this. We have suggested in this report that there does need to be further investigation of the Child Support Agency and the formula that is relied upon to formulate payments by non-custodial parents to custodial parents.

"Quick, Harry, MP",ALP,2004-02-11,"—I am proud to follow the honourable member for Dickson—a fellow member of the House Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs—in this debate on the committee's report, Every picture tells a story: report on the inquiry into child custody arrangements in the event of family separation. I have not written anything down; I guess I am going to ad lib. It is funny that today I am wearing my tie with a whole bunch of kids and sunshine on it. As a former teacher, before I became a parliamentarian, I experienced at first hand the whole issue of dysfunctionality in families and how hard it is for families to exist. 
One of the things that has an impact on most people when they see this report is the cover. It shows three children's paintings of aspects of family dysfunction. One is a picture of an ambulance, with a mum saying, `No,' a dad saying, `Yes,' and the child saying, `When Mum and Dad fight, it feels like my head is about to explode.' Another one shows a mum saying, `Sorry I yelled at you,' a dad saying, `Sorry I called you a cow,' and a child in the middle. The last picture is the most telling one: it shows mum's house, dad's house and the child cut in half.
In chapter one, we see some frightening statistics which I think all honourable members ought to have a look at. In this nation that is so successful and has so much going for it, 978,400 children have a natural parent who does not live with them. That is almost a million kids living with one parent. In 88 per cent of cases the absent parent is the father, and in 12 per cent of cases the absent parent is the mother. One of the other committees in this place recently did a report on boys in schools. There are so many links between this report and other reports that have been done. Following on from the statistics I just mentioned, 41 per cent of those children in sole care visited their other natural parent once a fortnight—which is the usual standard once the Family Court process is gone through: every second weekend and half the school holidays. Twenty-one per cent visited their other parent once a month or up to once every six months, and the frightening thing is that 36 per cent visited their natural parent only once a year—or less.
When we started this report, I was very sceptical about the agenda of the government. I thought, `How in the name of creation can you deal with an issue as complex as this, which affects every federal member?' As I said, we are talking about 978,400 kids, and we were given 55 non-sitting days. But this is a wonderful committee; I have been proud to be a member of it ever since I got here in 1993. With only one exception—and that was a very small exception—all of our reports have been unanimous and, in lots of cases, they have been groundbreaking. In those 55 days, we had to plough through 1,709 submissions—a pile several metres tall—from almost every conceivable section of the Australian community. Most of us in this place are pretty hardened; after a while you have seen the good, the bad and the ugly, but I can tell you that there were many tears shed as we read those submissions.
When we went out as a committee and spoke to people and when we had public hearings, some of which were in camera because of the sensitivities, and we heard people confronting for the first time a committee of the House—with the media involved and hundreds of people there and us sitting there like a court of inquisition—those people were able to explain to us in their own words the impact of dysfunctionality and the impact of the Child Support Agency, the Family Court, lawyers and the whole system. In many cases, their lives had been ruined financially and emotionally and they had lost contact with their children. As we toured around Australia, the 10 of us on the House committee were really confronted emotionally by the enormity of the problem. In hindsight, the 55 days enabled us to really focus on this issue. I believe that the report Every picture tells a story is one of the great reports that have emanated from this place in its 100-odd year history.
We have not solved all the problems. We have upset the fathers, who were upset in the first place. We have upset the Family Court lawyers. We have upset the chief honcho, Mr Nicholson. We have not given everybody everything they wanted. But I think as a starting point we have put in place a structure that is infinitely more sensible and in the best interests of the children. The first recommendation says:
The committee recommends that Part VII of the Family Law Act 1975 be amended to create a clear presumption, that can be rebutted, in favour of equal shared parental responsibility ...
If you look at the statistics about the number of marriages and the number of divorces in Australia, you see that this situation is not going to go away.
As a former educationalist, what I think is missing and needs to be addressed in our education system is a realisation that relationships are so important in our lives—that we need to work on them; that, entering into a contract with another person to have and to raise children is an enormous responsibility; and that, when, for whatever reason, that relationship ends, it is not an opportunity to pay back and to take advantage of your financial situation and your ability to access lawyers in order to punish your partner. The interests of the children should be paramount.
Each of us in this place can cite numerous examples where the person who is really suffering is the child. True, in most cases, the wives are going through a tremendous amount of trauma and an inability to function as a person because they are financially dependent upon Centrelink when the Child Support Agency fails in its responsibility to get the money from the noncustodial parent. But, conversely, there are people of the female sex who, for whatever reason, use their vindictiveness and their hold over the children to punish their male partners.
There are 29 excellent recommendations in this report—for example, the setting up of a tribunal; and the polite coercion of both partners when there is a separation to go through mediation and to sit down and develop a parenting plan in the best interests of the children, to say, `We have a responsibility for these children which is not just for the first six months of their lives; it is ongoing until they are able to enter the work force and, in many cases, it lasts a lifetime, but we at least need to give them some foundations and a start.'
As we took evidence right around Australia, I think each and every member of the committee was horrified at the amounts of money that some people expended in order to just get every second weekend and half the school holidays—in some cases it was in excess of $100,000. This money is being denied the children that they have responsibility for. As I say, it is a traumatic thing. It affects almost a million children. Those children are being denied the opportunities given to children who are fortunate enough to grow up in a family where both parents, whatever their station in life, have worked out a parenting plan for their kids. As a federal MP with two daughters I know that it is not easy. For me, when my wife and I were parenting, I found it very hard to argue that I was doing my bit for Sarah and Hannah. I was spending 20 weeks here and probably another 10 weeks wandering around Australia trying to sort out the nation's business. There was a parenting plan organised. It was not written in concrete but there was a realisation that, in order for my wife to work and for me to be a federal member, there needed to be some cohesion and at least some rough planning about who was doing what and who had what responsibilities.
When this dysfunctionality occurs and people say, `I've had enough; I'm about to leave,' to then just throw them into the Family Court and expect lawyers to pick up the pieces—and charge like wounded bulls—is the wrong way. These 29 recommendations will bring change. It is not going to change overnight. We still have a whole lot of people in the system. I guess once the government's response is out in the public domain we can move on, but we have all these people who are already in the system. 
For my last couple of minutes I would like to mention one thing that really worries me about the current system and which hopefully will change: the relationship between the Child Support Agency and Centrelink. Centrelink is one of these great behemoths that spew out bits of paper to people. In 88 per cent of cases the custodial parent is the mother, who is relying on Centrelink. They are battling through the Child Support Agency to get the money and then the money suddenly comes and Centrelink says, `You've got all this money and we've overpaid you,' and there is enormous stress. There ought to be an understanding. I am not sure how it could work but hopefully it could come about with the setting up of one of the latter recommendations. The whole issue of breaching and people being owed tens of thousands of dollars and then suddenly getting it has an enormous impact on overpayments of family tax benefits A and B and such complex issues.
It has been a wonderful learning curve for me and the other nine members of the committee. I would like to thank them for their honesty and endeavour. We have worked together and had lots of arguments. I spat the dummy several times and walked out, but in the finish we came up with a wonderful report. I compliment the secretariat staff. They did a job that was absolutely amazing, collating the 1,709 submissions, working day and night and finally, with Kay Hull, the committee chair, they completed this wonderful report, which I know has been widely received and is being read avidly by all members of this place. I look forward to the government's follow-up and I know we will do justice to the families that are going through this trauma now and into the future. I thank the committee for giving me the opportunity to say a few words on Every picture tells a story.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,26,2,speech
"Ticehurst, Kenneth, MP",LP,2004-02-11,"—I became involved in this issue back in September 2002, when a fellow from Dads in Distress came into my office and told me that over 2½ thousand men a year commit suicide because they have difficulty getting access to their children. I also know of a case where a fellow was denied access to his child because he had been accused of sexually interfering with the child. That was totally false, but it was accepted offhand and he was denied access. That same fellow, who was a member of the police force at the time, was exonerated in the courts, but even today it is still on his record. So when he leaves the police force he is going to be restricted in whatever job he undertakes, because that false claim is on his record.
I raised this issue in our party room back in September 2002. Some of the cases that I have mentioned were picked up by other members—as we know, every member gets the same sorts of complaints—but I was encouraged by Senator Jeannie Ferris to set up a panel and bring some people down and have a forum where members and senators could attend and hear people's cases; and that is exactly what I did. One of the people who came to that forum rang me the other day and said, `I am not sure whether I should jump off the skillion or go and shoot my ex-husband.' That is the sort of trauma that is going on in our society. Irrespective of their marital status, society has a responsibility to support mothers and fathers to fulfil their role as effective parents. This is the premise of the Australian government's family law inquiry—after all, the strength of our families will determine our children's futures and the future of our nation.
Last year I held a series of child access forums in my electorate of Dobell to allow mothers, fathers and grandparents to work with experts in the field to define what they believed to be the key areas in which family law required changing. One common point raised was the need for relationship education in the early years and throughout high school. We need to instil in children the vitality of the family unit and of loving family relationships. Yes, reading aloud is important—nobody disagrees with that—but reading to a disturbed and worried child is less effective. The forum also highlighted that the system needs to provide more opportunities and incentives for parents to reach agreements between themselves, to assist in minimising the damage caused to children by separation and conflict. Many grandparents and, indeed, great-grandparents attended these forums and expressed to me their concern that they were being overlooked in family law practices. These are some of the key recommendations that I have been finding from my electorate of Dobell. 
The committee recommends that part VII of the Family Law Act 1975 be amended to create a clear presumption—which can be rebutted—in favour of equally shared parental responsibility in the first year of post-separation decision making. It is talking not about halving time—although access is a big issue—but about sharing responsibility. This involves a requirement that parents consult with one another before making decisions about major issues relevant to the care, welfare and development of children, including, but not confined to, present and future education, religious and cultural upbringing, health, change of surname and usual place of residence. This should be in the form of a parenting plan.
Joint custody is a means to an end and not an end in itself. The end is the opportunity for children to know, and to have a relationship with, both of their parents. This should only happen when the relationship enriches the child; it certainly should not happen when it harms the child. While there will always be exceptions, there are many parents who want better access arrangements; they want to meet their responsibilities and they want to do the right thing by their kids. I am hopeful that the recommendations of the report will help to facilitate that.
Where there are parents who do not want to do the right thing and be fully involved, we need to be giving them encouragement to do the right thing—not just by the kids but for the future of our society. To achieve this we have to not just make minor changes to the law but to radically shake up the system to change its emphasis. This, in association with an extensive public education campaign, is the best way to change community perceptions, attitudes and actions in the area of parental responsibility after separation. The proposed new system is deliberately less legalistic and more child focused. It reduces the role of the courts. The new system would better assist and equip parents to take responsibility for resolving their disputes in a non-adversarial way and in the best interests of their child or children. 
The committee recommends that the government review the community's current access to services which can assist those who cannot achieve and sustain shared parenting on their own to develop skills to communicate effectively around their children's needs, which will enable them to resolve their ongoing conflict and include the needs of their children in that decision making. In the United States a maternal preference in child custody has given way to the best interests of the child standard. This has resulted in a system that oscillates towards joint custody. In some part of the United States the system also provides opportunities and incentives for parents to reach agreements between themselves and assist in minimising the damage of separation and conflict to children. This approach has helped to greatly reduce the incidence of divorce in many cases, which may contribute to a fall in the incidence of child abuse and a decrease in the financial cost of divorce to the community. 
The committee recommends that the Commonwealth government move to recognise the role of grandparents, and indeed great-grandparents, by taking steps to ensure that contact with grandparents and extended family members is considered by parents when developing their post-separation parenting plan and developing strategies to ensure that grandparents and extended family members are included in mediation and family counselling activities when it is in the best interests of the child. This is great news for parents and grandparents in my electorate and beyond. 
The inquiry was not just about a better deal for fathers. Initially my observations were that 10 per cent of these cases involved women, but as the submissions came in that increased to about 15 per cent. I am talking about important social legislation affecting some of the most important and vulnerable people in the community, our children. Children have a right to know and be cared for by both their parents regardless of whether their parents are married, separated, have never married or have never lived together. Children have a right of contact on a regular basis with both their parents and grandparents, who can have a stabilising effect on family break-ups. There are no simple solutions or quick fixes. Each family is different and each child is different, and the issue must be approached on an individual basis. 
The resulting child custody report is good news for many people of the Central Coast who have expressed to me their frustration with the Family Law Act and Child Support Act and the incorrect administration of those acts. The current system is causing hardship and pain to many single parents, both men and women, and is indirectly impacting on their children's futures. The report is a serious attempt to deal with real problems. Not everybody will be happy with the recommendations of the report. However, it is very important to have these proposed changes on the table for everyone to debate. 
I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs, led by committee chair Kay Hull, on their great efforts to conduct an intensive six-month inquiry into the operation of our family law system and child custody arrangements following family separation. Unfortunately I was not a member of this committee, but I kept close contact with the people involved. It must be remembered that this report is only a template, an outline of the way forward. It will be up to the Prime Minister to make the final tough decisions in the interests of Australian families. I am confident that the outcome of this inquiry will have a positive and encouraging impact on mothers, fathers, grandparents and indeed great-grandparents and, most importantly, the lives of the most innocent members of our society, our children.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,26,2,speech
"Irwin, Julia, MP",ALP,2004-02-11,"—Yesterday I had the opportunity to make some comments on this report in the House and I took that opportunity to express some of my concerns about the shortage of time, in preparing this report, to do justice to the many submissions made to the committee. But I want to make it quite clear that, apart from the areas of the child support formula and the work of the Child Support Agency, I believe that the report has given full weight to the hundreds of submissions and the evidence given at the committee's hearings. 
This is a report which has the potential to bring major improvements to the lives of so many children, parents and grandparents in families that live apart. As I said in my speech on the tabling of the report, listening to and reading the experiences has been deeply moving to all members of the committee. We cannot play politics with such an important matter. We cannot play politics with the lives of one million Australian children. Having heard and read those stories, the first conclusion that was reached was that the present system was broken and needed fixing. It needed more focus on the needs of children—not just saying that it should be in the best interests of the children but really doing something that made sure that the best interests of the children were being addressed at every stage of the process.
So when it came to looking at the terms of reference and, in particular, the question of whether there should be a presumption that children will spend equal time with each parent and, if so, in what circumstances such a presumption could be rebutted, the committee definitely took a much broader view which considered the whole process of parenting arrangements. This led the committee to view parenting plans as being the key to settling the arrangements that were in the best interests of the child. But this was to be based on a concept of equal shared parenting responsibility as the first tier in post-separation decision making. That is expressed in recommendation 1 of the report—that presumption would not apply where there is entrenched conflict, family violence, substance abuse or established child abuse, including sexual abuse.
So the development of a parenting plan with the idea of equal shared parental responsibility becomes the foundation for arrangements made in relation to the care of children when parents separate. But to be effective these arrangements need to be made as early as possible in family breakdowns. For that reason, the committee recommends that a shopfront single entry point into the broader family law system be established. Instead of the entry point being the solicitor's office, where parenting arrangements are not likely to be the first priority of the parties, the committee recommends that separating parents have early access to information about shared parenting, the impact of conflict on children and dispute resolution options. There should also be case assessment and screening by appropriately trained and qualified staff, and there should even be some power to compel both parties to participate in the assessment process. From there, parents can be referred to external providers of mediation and counselling services with programs suitable to the needs of the family's dispute, including assistance in the development of a parenting plan. Such a process can avoid the often poisonous conflict that arises from a strictly legal approach to family disputes.
But as valuable as such a process may be in getting parents started down the track of setting parenting arrangements, if the process then leads back to the legalistic court system much of what may have been gained can be lost. Also, parenting plans need to be flexible to allow for changes in the lives of parents and the development of children. So the process needs to be flexible and understanding, but above all it should respect the genuine equal sharing of parental responsibility. So the committee has recommended a most radical change. The committee proposes the establishment of a statute based families tribunal with the power to decide disputes about shared parenting responsibility, with respect to future parenting arrangements that are in the best interests of the child, and property matters by agreement of the parents.
The committee feels that the families tribunal should be child inclusive and non-adversarial with simple procedures that respect the rules of natural justice. Rather than members having a strictly legal background, the committee feels that the families tribunal should be appointed from professionals practising in the family relationships area and that it should first attempt to conciliate disputes. The committee sees hearings of the families tribunal being conducted by a panel of three members comprising a mediator, a child psychologist or other professional able to address the child's perspective, and a legally qualified member.
The committee heard of many instances where parents are unable to access the family law court because of the associated cost. For that reason and to preserve the process of mediation, the committee felt that legal counsel, interpreters or other experts should be involved at the sole discretion of the tribunal and that experts should be drawn from an accredited panel maintained by the tribunal. For this process of mediation to have the best chance of success, the committee recommended that there be a sixweek moratorium before any obligation to pay child support arises and that parents should be able to access—and I state again: parents should be able to access—their full entitlement to social security without penalty, to ensure that neither they nor their children are financially disadvantaged. This should enable the process of mediation to commence as early as possible and without the concerns of current support payments being an issue. 
Where child abuse is a factor—and the committee has already indicated that the proposed process should not apply where there is established child abuse—it is proposed that an investigative arm of the families tribunal investigate such claims to determine if a mediation process under the families tribunal should proceed or if the case should be dealt with by the Family Court. The Family Court would therefore be limited to these cases, the enforcement of orders of the families tribunal and the review of decisions of the families tribunal.
Other structural changes to the Family Court are also recommended. The committee received many submissions from grandparents and made recommendations to include grandparents in the parenting plan where it is in the best interests of the child and also in negotiating the parenting plan. These recommendations have not been without their critics—and we have received a number of criticisms. But, as I have said, the committee has come to the view that these changes are necessary if we are to achieve a system which is generally based on equal shared parental responsibility. It is my view and that of the whole committee that this can only be achieved where parents are assisted from the earliest stages of separation to accept their responsibility for the wellbeing of their children and to have access to a process which allows them to reach agreement on how best to provide care and support for their children. The present system of family law has failed to do this—it has definitely failed. The proposed families tribunal offers a better way of meeting the need of separating families to develop parenting plans which are in the best interests of the children.
The issue of child support is one of the most difficult to deal with in the family law system. As I mentioned at the beginning of my speech, I would have liked the committee to have had more time to consider this issue in more detail; but some aspects of child support stand out as warranting immediate attention. It amazed committee members to find that some 40 per cent of child support payments under section 66 are only $5 per week, and the committee had no hesitation in recommending that these payments be doubled to $10 per week. Another area which should receive immediate attention from government is amendments to sections 47 to 49, which limit payments when a child spends more than 109 nights with a non-resident parent. If we are to encourage greater shared parenting, these sections must be amended. 
The committee also recommended addressing the way a payer's child support income is determined to reduce the impact of applying the full percentage to overtime earnings and earnings from a second job. The effect of the present rules can only be to deter payers from working overtime and increasing income from a second job. Measures to improve the collection of child support are recommended—and some of these are long overdue—to ensure that child support payments are collected, although I am prepared to concede that cancelling drivers licences may be taking things a bit too far.
One problem the committee faced was the lack of data on the costs of caring for children and the additional costs faced by parents to re-establish homes after separation. This data would have greatly assisted the committee in considering the equity of child support formulas and would also be valuable to government in considering future changes. Again, I feel that the committee could have used more time to assess the work of the Child Support Agency and to consider ways in which its operation may be improved. The report does recommend a review of strategies and calls for a process of external review of Child Support Agency decisions.
The report of the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs has been well received in the wider community, and I am proud of all the committee members from both sides of politics. Its recommendations call for long overdue changes to a system which is clearly not meeting the needs of children and parents of families living apart. The objective of equal shared parenting responsibility can be achieved only if changes to the process and the levels of support are made. The ball is now in the government's court. Having called for this inquiry, the Prime Minister, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and the Attorney-General must act to put these recommendations into effect. The report has been very warmly received by my Labor colleagues, and I can confidently predict that a number of these recommendations will be taken up by a future Labor government.
It is true there is some cost involved. The committee was made aware of the long delays for families accessing mediation services—delays of up to six months. As I have mentioned, a key to achieving good outcomes from mediation is that it should begin as early as possible. So, clearly, we need more resources for mediation services. The establishment of a families tribunal will also come at a cost but, when you consider the cost to government and individuals of the present Family Court system, in the long run we may achieve some savings. I would also note the cost of legal aid now going to some parties in Family Court matters which may be better spent on the operation of a families tribunal.
Of the number of inquiries that I have participated in during my time in this parliament, this inquiry has been the most draining but, as I think the honourable member for Makin would agree, the most rewarding. I feel very proud of the result and I feel proud of all the committee members. I believe that the committee has made recommendations that can make a real difference to the lives of the so many thousands of Australian families that separate each year. What is now required is the commitment from government to make these proposed improvements a reality. As I stated earlier, we cannot play politics—and we have not played politics—with the lives of over one million Australian children.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,26,2,speech
"Draper, Trish, MP",LP,2004-02-11,"—I commend the member for Fowler, Julia Irwin, our deputy chair, for her speech. I enjoyed it immensely. I would also like to add that I am very proud of the work that we achieved. Every picture tells a story is the title of the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs inquiry into child custody arrangements following parental separation. Over the past six months, members of the committee heard many sad and desperate stories. For my constituents, I am pleased to have participated in this report as a member of the standing committee, but I must also add—as all of the committee members so far have said—that this has been a very tough assignment for all of us. At this point I would like to quote the foreword of the report:
One of the highlights of committee work for parliamentarians is the people we meet. During this inquiry our greatest delight was hearing from the nine children and five young adults at our final meeting of the inquiry. These children and young adults were a microcosm of what this inquiry was all about.
These 14 young people talked about the important issues of the inquiry—what it was like for them when their parents were separating and how their living arrangements were decided. These children and young adults were articulate, open, funny, serious and sometimes sad. They told us their stories and as a result the real meaning of this inquiry was clearly understood.
Another young boy, Jack, who we were unable to meet with, told us his story through his four drawings. We are so grateful to Jack for the pictures which we have used on the cover and inside cover of our report. Jack's story is a simple and complex one at the same time. It is a story we can all identify with in some way.
`Every picture tells a story'.
Jack's pictures tell us:
Jack shares his time between mum's house and dad's house.
He loves his mum and he loves his dad.
He doesn't like it when his mum and dad argue.
He's happy when they talk to each other.
It is a tough story because dad lives in one city and mum lives somewhere else.
He likes to see them both all the time but he can't because the distance makes it too hard.
Jack's pictures encapsulate the most important voice of all—the voice of the children.
The harsh reality of living in the 21st century is that many marriages or de facto relationships will fail. People change, mistakes are made and sometimes individuals just grow apart. It is not for the state to intervene in what are essentially personal matters between two adults but perhaps, as a community, we can do more to help couples to overcome their problems and reduce the pressures which exacerbate the causes of family breakdown. Of equal if not more importance is our responsibility to ensure that the needs of children are accorded the greatest priority and that their safety and general wellbeing are of prime concern. This is the true strength of this inquiry. From any reading of the 29 recommendations listed in the report, one could not escape the conclusion that the committee heeded the very first item of the terms of reference: that the best interests of the child are the paramount consideration.
Yes, we do recommend the creation of a presumption in favour of equal shared parental responsibility—and there are very good and worthy reasons for this—but we also make it clear, in recommendation 2, that the Family Law Act 1975 should be amended to `create a clear presumption against shared parental responsibility with respect to cases where there is entrenched conflict, family violence, substance abuse or established child abuse, including sexual abuse'. 
We also recognise that, no matter how difficult the break-up of a relationship may be for the adults involved, it can be an emotional tragedy for the child or children of that relationship. Tragically, for some the scars never heal. More than anything else, a child needs to know the love and care of both parents, whenever and wherever possible. They need to know that mum and dad are interested in what they do and are concerned about them. Even in a happy marital situation, one parent may spend more actual time than the other parent with the child or children, but both parents take an interest in their lives and make decisions about their upbringing.
Over the years that I have been a member of parliament I have heard many pleas from parents—generally from fathers but sometimes from mothers—who feel that they are not being included in the lives of their children. They feel like outcasts, even though they may have access on a regular basis. The system fails these adults as much as it fails the children, who are often left with the impression that mum or dad does not play an important role in their lives anymore. This is despite the fact that the Family Law Act 1975 was supposed to include a presumption of shared parenting. All members will know that this is not the reality, and this fact was reinforced by the hundreds of submissions received by the inquiry. The inquiry found:
A real child focus is not yet a reality in the system or in the behaviour of separating families.
To address these problems, the committee considers that for shared parenting a fifty-fifty shared residence or physical custody of the child or children should be considered as a starting point for all discussion and negotiation, except in situations where the child might be placed in danger of physical or emotional harm. I stress that this is a point from which negotiations should begin, with the ultimate aim being an agreement on shared parenting where both parents continue to play an equal role in the life of their child or children. Problems often arise where one parent seeks to move to a distant location, effectively cutting off the other parent from all meaningful contact with their offspring. True, an effective shared parental responsibility—which is the aim of the committee—would mean that the relocation of one parent would become less of an option. The mechanism by which shared parenting would operate is the parenting plan. By agreeing to this plan, both parents acknowledge the equal partnership in making decisions about their child or children. In recommendation 9 the committee specifically recommends:
... that the Family Law Act 1975 be amended to require separating parents to undertake mediation or other forms of dispute resolution before they are able to make an application to a court/tribunal for a parenting order, except when issues—
as I said before—
of entrenched conflict, family violence, substance abuse or serious child abuse, including sexual abuse, require different access to the courts/tribunal. 
Recommendation 10 states:
The committee recommends that the funding for the Family Relationships Services Program be increased following a review with respect to the appropriate targeting and adequacy of resources for the service types which will provide the most benefit to families' positive family relationships, before during and after separation.
In this review the committee recommends that consideration be given particularly to a significant further expansion of children's contact services nationally.
In recommendation 11, the committee recommended:
... that a shop front single entry point into the broader family law system be established attached to an existing Commonwealth body, with national geographic spread and infrastructure, with the following functions:
	provision of information about shared parenting, the impact of conflict on children and dispute resolution options; 
	case assessment and screening by appropriately trained and qualified staff;
	power to request attendance of both parties at a case assessment process; and
	referral to external providers of mediation and counselling services with programs suitable to the needs of the family's dispute including assistance in the development of a parenting plan.
In recommendation 12 the committee recommended:
... that the Commonwealth government establish a national, statute based, Families Tribunal with power to decide disputes about shared parenting responsibility ... with respect to future parenting arrangements that are in the best interests of the child/ren, and property matters by agreement of the parents. The Families Tribunal should have the following essential features:
	It should be child inclusive, non adversarial, with simple procedures that respect the rules of natural justice.
	Members of the Families Tribunal should be appointed from professionals practising in the family relationships area.
	The Tribunal should first attempt to conciliate the dispute.
	A hearing on the dispute should be conducted by a panel of three members comprising a mediator, a child psychologist or other professional able to address the child's perspective and a legally qualified member.
	Legal counsel, interpreters or other experts should be involved in proceedings at the sole discretion of the Tribunal. Experts should be drawn from an accredited panel maintained by the Tribunal.
The committee's recommendations in general have been supported publicly by Family Services Australia who in a media release on 8 January stated:
The results of the latest Parliamentary Inquiry by the Federal Government shed further light on how better we can nurture our children. Family Services Australia, the largest national industry representative body and member association of providers of family support services, welcomes the Shared Custody Inquiry recommendations for expanding services and strategies which help separating parents reduce conflict and focus on the needs of their children.
The committee also considered the role of grandparents after hearing many stories of how this third generation of family is often completely removed from the lives of their grandchildren. The importance of an extended family and the sense of continuity and belonging in the development of a child, not to mention the love of a grandparent for their grandchild, cannot be overestimated. This is why the committee has recommended further amendments to the Family Law Act 1975 to explicitly refer to grandparents to ensure that they, and other extended family members, are considered by parents when developing their parent plan. Possibly, parents will even make specific plans for contact with those extended family members—importantly, as I have said before, without the expensive costs of lawyers within the present adversarial system and the Family Court.
The second aspect of the inquiry's terms of reference dealt with the existing mechanism by which child support payments are calculated. The committee have made a number of progressive recommendations on this matter. I know that not everybody in the community supports the recommendations in their entirety. Some say we go too far, while others say we have not gone far enough. But the committee members had to consider all aspects of what is a very complex and sometimes very emotional issue. Ultimately, we believe that the implementation of these recommendations would make the system fairer to all, whilst continuing to place the interests of the child as the main priority.
I welcome the positive comments of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs on the outcome of the inquiry, and I look forward to the government's considered response to the recommendations. I also wish to place on record my appreciation of the committee chair, the member for Riverina, the supporting secretariat and my fellow committee members for the extraordinary amount of time and energy that was put in. All members of the committee spent many hours, days and weeks reading through the public submissions and considering all aspects of the issues raised. I have enjoyed working with all of my parliamentary colleagues, both Labor and coalition, in a bipartisan manner and believe that, despite the heavy workload, we have provided the parliament with something very positive and a means to improve the lot of many of our fellow Australians, especially those one million children who are the real victims of broken relationships. I recommend the report.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,26,2,speech
"George, Jennie, MP",ALP,2004-02-11,"—As a backbencher in this parliament and one who, like many others, deals on a regular basis with constituents who seek my help in matters to do with the Child Support Agency and family breakdown, it was a terrific opportunity for me to participate in the work of this committee, despite the fact that the time constraint was quite onerous. I want to echo the comments made by the member for Makin in congratulating the chair of the committee, the member for Riverina, and all the members of the committee for their enlightened contributions conducted in a bipartisan manner. We decided from the outset that the issues we were asked to consider—that is, how we could reform the family law system to make it work better and more fairly—were too important for party politics to be intruded into. Very importantly, our starting point was that the best interests of children had to be the paramount consideration.
We were quite daunted by the short time frame. With regard to that, I want to state my thanks to the very hard working secretariat, who laboured for many hours to make sure that we were able to present the report and have it tabled by the end of the year. I also want to thank the thousands of people who either made written submissions or travelled huge distances to be with us. They often travelled hundreds of miles to make a five-minute contribution. It was at times a very emotional experience, but I feel that the average person out there in the community should feel satisfied that the committee, in the recommendations that we have proposed, has seriously considered the trials and tribulations that beset people when marriages break down and, very importantly, what happens as far as children are concerned.
As a member of the committee I was quite startled to realise the very high percentage of children, some 36 per cent, who visited their other natural parent either rarely—with `rarely' being defined as once a year or even less often—or never at all. With such a damning statistic it is no wonder that many separated parents, mostly fathers, feel excluded from their children's lives following separation.
That was one of the real issues we had to contend with: how do we make the system fairer while recognising changing work force patterns, recognising that there are many more women now in paid employment and also recognising the very positive development where there are greater numbers of fathers who want to spend more of their time with their children. We established that despite the best intentions of the parliament in 1995 with the Family Reform Act, shared parenting and shared care was in fact atypical for the overwhelming majority of separated families. It is almost as if a status quo had been established where we had what people describe as the `cookie-cutter outcome' of the 80-20 split-up where the mother, primarily, had the child or children resident with her and fathers being seen as supplementary additions to the equation. I think many of them describe themselves as the kind of Hollywood dads that appear in the child's life maybe on alternate fortnights, for part of the holidays and for very few days in between.
Despite those intentions in 1995 that we would move to a greater emphasis on shared parenting, the reality was something quite different. The committee has recommended that the system ought to operate with a rebuttable presumption of equal shared parental responsibility in post-separation decision making. By this we mean that in law there will be a requirement that parents consult with one another before making decisions about major issues relevant to the care, welfare and development of children. We envisage that this would include decisions about where children would be educated, the nature of their religious and cultural upbringing and their usual place of residence. We have in mind that this would be formalised in a parenting plan.
The committee rejected the concept that we were asked to investigate of a rebuttable presumption of fifty-fifty shared custody. While we believe that the goal for the majority of families should be to increase the amount of parenting time—hopefully to a situation, where it is feasible, of shared parenting time—we could not support forcing such an outcome or the mandating of fifty-fifty shared custody arrangements in potentially inappropriate circumstances by way of legislation. We had a weight of professional opinion that came to the committee that stability in a primary home and routine is an optimal outcome for young children in particular. We thought that the amount of time a child spent with each parent after separation should be a decision made preferably by both parents—one that was in the interests of the child and on the basis of what arrangements would work best for each family. The one-size-fits-all approach was not something we could support. However, we do acknowledge that in the current situation too many children are missing out and that this has some negative impacts, particularly for young men, and we acknowledge the debate in the community about the lack of parental role models, particularly for our boys.
I think there was quite a deal of confusion about the notion of a rebuttable presumption of joint custody; many people believed that this operated in some states in the USA. After extensive research by the committee and the secretariat, we found that that was not the case. What was operating was the notion of shared legal responsibility, a conclusion that the committee has recommended. So it was not only about looking at how we could assist a better relationship between children in separated families but also a recognition, I think, that in changing work force patterns the traditional model may no longer be one that suits a growing interest on the part of fathers, as parents, to have a greater say in the raising of their children and more involvement with them.
There was also considerable dissatisfaction with the institutional way in which the current family law process operates. Australia's system for resolving family disputes remains primarily a legal and adversarial one. Because it is adversarial, you end up producing winners and losers. At a time of heightened emotional strain between separating adults, you end up with one feeling that they are the loser in the equation, and that carries on with them in the way they view their ongoing relationship with their children: they see themselves—as they often told us in their evidence—as the losers in the system.
The other issue that concerned me about the adversarial nature of the legal system was that many of my constituents felt that justice was not done because they did not have the money to pursue cases that they felt had significant merit. And this is not only for the initial applications that go before the Family Court. We were often told of the frustration people experienced when court orders that had been determined and which were then breached required nothing short resubmitting oneself to a very lengthy and costly legal process to gain an outcome. When you have a system where people feel excluded on the basis of their capacity to pay, there is something wrong. 
Beyond that, we believed, and came to the view in our recommendations, that there should be greater emphasis on mediation, and that assistance for separating adults to reach sensible and rational outcomes was a preferable way to go. You cannot legislate for good behaviour, and not everybody is going to avail themselves of the recommended increase in material and financial resources to assist in mediation, but we have to make recommendations that we believe are going to suit the majority of families rather than those in whose eyes no system is going to produce a reasonable outcome.  There are people and some groups that still believe the committee has not gone far enough. It may be that in the end you cannot produce recommendations that are going to get support from everybody, but I have no doubt that our recommendations have met with wide support in mainstream Australia.
We recommend that in future there be a requirement for separating parents to formally go through mediation before they are able to make an application to a court or tribunal for a parenting order, except in cases where there is family violence, substance abuse or child abuse, including sexual abuse. Where those issues are the cause of marital breakdown, and issues relating to the welfare of children have to be resolved, they will continue to be formally dealt with through the courts. But instead of what happens now in marital breakdown, where the first point of reference is the local solicitor or the chamber magistrate, we are suggesting that there be a one-stop shop approach where government can establish agencies that can assist parents to develop a parenting plan that has the interests of the children at its centre.
We believe that a families tribunal should be established where, in the event of mediation not resolving the dispute between the separating parents, a system of conciliation and arbitration along the lines that we have had historically for resolving industrial relations disputes might be set in place to deal with family issues into the future. We believe that the vast majority of cases are capable of resolution before disputes reach lawyers and the court.

(1)	Further to the answer to question No. 1565 (Hansard, 15 May 2003, page 14537) concerning the operation of Airservices Australia during industrial action, what were the contingency arrangements that were confirmed as obligatory in the advice from the Office of Legal Counsel and can a copy of that legal advice be provided.
(2)	What were the findings of each of the four investigations conducted by Airservices Australia into incidents that occurred during the industrial action and can a copy of the reports be provided.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Aviation: Air Traffic Control</title>,Answers to Questions in Writing,27,1,question
"Anderson, John, MP",NATS,2004-02-11,"—Airservices Australia has advised that the answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(1)	The Office of Legal Counsel, in an un-minuted meeting during the lead up to the first contingency last year, was asked by the Head Air Traffic Controller (HATC) to confirm that Airservices had an obligation to prepare and implement safety measures to apply in the event that normal ATC functions could not be delivered. The measures implemented were designed to allow safe airways operations to continue in a limited manner during the interruptions to normal services. That confirmation was provided verbally.
Subsequent written advice from the General Counsel confirmed that the plan adopted was “legally acceptable” under the Air Services Act 1995 and also clarified the CASA role in approving or endorsing the plan.
To enable this issue to be concluded, after three questions in Parliament, I have requested Airservices offer you a briefing to better explain in detail the processes followed.
(2)	The findings of the four investigations were:
Incident 1 - VH-LMZ ESIR 2002 00767 Brisbane Centre Operations (BCO) - second contingency.
At 0535 LMZ was found to be within restricted/controlled airspace without the knowledge of the administrating authority.
This incident occurred after the resumption of normal services following the industrial action that precipitated the implementation of the national ATS Contingency Plan. There was no conflicting traffic or separation breakdown.
Incident 2 - THA993 ESIR 2002 00766 Brisbane Centre Operations (BCO) - second contingency.
THA993 was found to be within restricted/controlled airspace without the knowledge of the administrating authority. This incident occurred after the resumption of normal services following the industrial action that precipitated the implementation of the National ATS Contingency Plan. There was no conflicting traffic or separation breakdown.
Incident 3 - QFA93 ESIR 00765 Melbourne Centre Operations (MCO) - second contingency.
QFA93 was being held within Melbourne Centre airspace to facilitate meeting a time slot into the temporary restricted airspace via overhead Sydney. The aircraft advised it had received an onwards clearance bypassing Sydney.
The pilot may have confused company messages of proposed flight planning amendments to assist in regaining the fuel lost during its delay but a clearance via other than overhead Sydney had not been issued by Melbourne Centre or the National Airspace Contingency Coordination Centre (NACCC).
The controller confirmed clearance via overhead Sydney and processed the aircraft on that route. There was no conflicting traffic or breakdown of separation standards.
Incident 4 TJP/HVM ESIR 00682 Melbourne Centre Operations (MCO) - first contingency.
VH-HVM and VH-TJP were in conflict in temporary restricted area associated with the implementation of the National Contingency Plan.
At approximately 0015 Adelaide ATC observed TJP inbound to Adelaide on route T51, the usual inbound route for traffic Brisbane-Adelaide. The National Contingency Flight Matrix indicated approval for this flight on a different route; via Melbourne and then as per the standard Melbourne - Adelaide route, H246. HVM tracking Bankstown - Adelaide, apparently via H44 and Q60 did not have approval to operate in the temporary restricted area.
The routes being flown converge at position BLACK, which is the commencement point of a standard arrival procedure. The relative positions of the aircraft were such that it was apparent that they would be in close proximity to each other at BLACK.
Two-way communications were established with both aircraft at approximately 70nm Adelaide. The controller issued traffic information and clearances to enter Adelaide Class C airspace that provided vertical separation.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Aviation: Air Traffic Control</title>,Answers to Questions in Writing,27,1,answer
