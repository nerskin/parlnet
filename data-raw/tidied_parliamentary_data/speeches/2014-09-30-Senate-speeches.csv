"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2014-09-30,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (12:32):  I seek leave to move a motion relating to the deployment of Australian troops to Iraq.


Leave not granted. 




Senator MILNE:
  Pursuant to contingent notice, I move:


That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent me from moving a motion to provide for the consideration of a matter, namely a motion relating to the Abbott government's proposed deployment of Australian personnel to military action in Iraq.


It is a critical matter that, at this very moment we are standing here, the RAAF has informed the Australian community it is ready for combat in Iraq. The Prime Minister has told the Australian community that he will be taking the matter to cabinet any minute—whenever he chooses to do so. Yet the Australian parliament has not debated this deployment of Australian troops to a multiyear war in the Middle East. This is the most shocking thing a government can do, to just go ahead and commit young men and women to war in the Middle East without a plan, without a strategy and without any notion of where this might end up.


There are families across Australia with sons, daughters, husbands, brothers and sisters in the armed forces. They remember Afghanistan and they remember young people dying in that conflict—and they will be asking themselves, as we stand here today, 'Why are we going to another war in the Middle East?' We have to actually think about that: why are we sending them to another war in the Middle East and is it in the Australian national interest to do so? In the United Kingdom, Prime Minister Cameron recalled the House of Commons to debate this matter. In the United States, President Obama recalled congress to talk about bombing in Syria. But nothing like that has occurred in Australia. The Australian parliament, and therefore the Australian people, have not been given an opportunity to hear from the government the rationale for committing people to war—nor to have it debated. 


Before the Iraqi government had asked anything of Australia, we had already stood up and said we would join the United States, blindly going into another war in Iraq. It was announced before the al-Abadi government had asked us anything. Only after we already had our planes in the Middle East and only after we already had our boots on the ground in the United Arab Emirates did we go to Iraq to try to retrospectively sort out the legalities of what we might be doing. We are only now retrospectively determining what we are embarking upon and why. What do we know? In the last few days President Obama has said that he had underestimated the power of ISIL, that they are continuing to advance in spite of the air raids. US Senator McCain has said that he wished the President would stop saying that there would be no boots on the ground. 


In Syria, there is already huge suspicion about the US involvement in Syria, whether the US is supporting President Assad. There is a suspicion that Washington is coordinating with Damascus and that the main beneficiary of the bombing in Syria is President Assad. Already we are arming the Free Syrian Army—but there is huge suspicion—and the al-Qaeda forces are now joining with the ISIL forces. All of the extremist forces are coming together because they are suspicious of what the Americans are doing, and of what we will be doing, because we have not actually outlined it. 


Will the consequences be contained within Iraq and Syria? No, they will not. We have already seen the fabric of our own society being torn apart. There is fear in the Australian community that is being driven by the increase in the likelihood of terrorist attack and the increase in the likelihood of recruitment—because Australia is going into another war in the Middle East. We have to know what is happening with President Assad. Will the mission target Assad's forces? If it does, will that bring in the Russians? What is the intent? The Americans want to replace President Assad, they want to defeat ISIL and they want a new government in Iraq. The questions are: how will that be achieved, how will it be contained and why is it in our national interest? 


The government must tell the parliament. We must be able to debate these matters. We need accountability from the executive—and that is the role of parliament. We are the body that is supposed to hold them to account. That is why we should be having the debate. (Time expired)

"Fifield, Sen Mitch",LP,2014-09-30,"



Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Social Services) (12:37):  I am sure all colleagues would agree that there are few decisions that weigh more heavily on a prime minister than a decision to place Australian Defence Force personnel potentially in harm's way, whether it be the Abbott government, the Howard government or the Hawke government before it. This is an area of decision making that governments take very seriously and weigh up very carefully. The Australian government has deployed ADF personnel to the Middle East in order to be in a position where, should the government take a decision to commit personnel and assets to combat, that they are there, that they are prepared, that they are acclimatised and that they are in the best position to give effect to a decision of the government. That decision has not yet been made.


I think that Prime Minister Abbott has really been a model in terms of the way that he has kept the Australian public and the Australian parliament informed of events that potentially will see Australian forces engaged. The Prime Minister has taken this responsibility very seriously. He has made sure that he has been a participant in forums including the United Nations General Assembly and the United Nations Security Council, and he has spoken to the Australian people through various means to make sure that they are aware of the context in which decisions may potentially be made. In Australia we do not have requirements akin to those of the United States, where the congress does have a formal role in relation to certain military activities. It is the convention and the custom and the practice in Australia that the government of the day—the executive—ultimately takes the decision and bears the responsibility for the commitment of ADF personnel and assets. I know that that is an approach which is agreed between the government and the opposition—that the National Security Committee of Cabinet deliberates, that the cabinet deliberates, and decisions are then made. In the course of that, the opposition is consulted and kept apprised of events. That is the process that we follow in Australia. I think that is the appropriate process and one that the Australian people are comfortable with.


The Australian parliament is clearly an appropriate place for these matters to be discussed and debated. Indeed, only a couple of weeks ago the Prime Minister made a statement to the House of Representatives and there was the opportunity for debate on that statement in that place and in the Senate. I have no doubt that there will be further updates to the parliament by the Prime Minister and by the defence minister and that there will be further opportunity for colleagues in this place, quite rightly, to discuss what are very significant matters. But that should be done in an orderly way, and I am sure that there will be further opportunity for that to occur, as is quite right. What the Australian Greens are seeking to do here today is a stunt. No notice of this proposed motion, to my knowledge, was provided to the government. We do have business before this place, and there will be time—an appropriate time—to discuss matters in relation to potential deployment of Australian Defence Force personnel.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2014-09-30,"



Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (12:42):  I indicate on behalf of the Labor opposition that we do not support the suspension of standing orders at this time, and our position is driven by two principles. The first is our position on decisions in relation to the deployment of Australian military personnel, and I will return to that. The second is the imperative for having debates of such serious nature conducted with appropriate notice to senators in the chamber and structured in the appropriate way, rather than simply being brought on through a suspension of standing orders at the commencement of the Senate.


First, our position as a party on decisions to deploy Australian military personnel is clear and has been articulated by both me and Senator Conroy previously and by successive leaders of the Labor Party. These are decisions of the executive government of the day. They are, of course, amongst the most important and difficult decisions which any government can make, but they are decisions of the executive government, not of the parliament. We do, however, believe that once a government makes such a decision it should be announced and explained properly to the public and to the parliament. The government does have a responsibility in the national interest to be transparent—consistent with the safety and security of ADF personnel—about the decisions it makes. That is the point at which there is an important role, and an entirely legitimate role, for the parliament to consider and debate such decisions.


Senators may recall that on a previous occasion, when a similar call was made by the Greens, Labor made it very clear we were willing to have an appropriate and structured debate—and, in fact, the parliament did have an appropriate debate, with notice given to senators. Where we obviously part company with the Greens is on their position that any such deployment should be the subject of parliamentary approval. That is the basis of Senator Milne's position. That is the basis on which the gallery was notified of her intention to move the suspension of standing orders. I respect that that is her position, but it is not the position of the Labor Party and our system of government, the executive. These are decisions of the executive.


As I said, we indicate to the government that, when the government does make further significant decisions about military operations or, indeed, humanitarian operations, we do think it is appropriate for there to be appropriate parliamentary debate and discussion and we would support that.


While I am on my feet and given the comments that were made by Senator Milne and Senator Fifield, I again place on record our thanks to the ADF personnel who are currently pre-deployed to the United Arab Emirates. These personnel enjoy the full support of the Australian Labor Party and the Australian people as they prepare to assist the Iraqi army and the Kurdish Peshmerga in their fight against IS. I again extend my thanks to their families, who remain at home—the partners, parents, children and friends who will ensure nervous weeks and months ahead as their loved ones participate in this mission. We know that the women and men of our ADF will undertake their mission with their usual professionalism, determination and dedication. They will all be in our thoughts—all of us—until they are returned home safely.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2014-09-30,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (12:46):  I rise to support Senator Milne's motion and this Greens' motion to have the deployment of Australian personnel debated urgently. I indicate to Senator Wong that the motion was distributed to senators in the chamber; I have a copy of it here. Our preference is to have this motion debated and voted on before we throw the ADF in harm's way, because doing it afterwards is kind of beside the point.


This deployment has still not been put to a vote. I want to point out to those outside the building who may be listening that this debate seeks to establish chamber time for a vote on the matter, rather than simply pretending that the Prime Minister's office will take care of the matter and they have it all under control. I want to highlight the fact that the arguments that were raised when we brought this matter to the chamber a week or two ago—that it is impossible, indeed insane, for the parliament to conduct such a debate because we would be intruding on tactical decisions, we would be giving our intentions away to the enemy, we would not be able to move swiftly enough; all of these arguments that, for some reason, assume that Australian parliamentarians are incapable of holding an intelligent, reasoned debate on such a serious issue—have been blown out of the water by actions in kindred parliaments around the world.


The fact is that Prime Minister Cameron recalled Westminster last week for precisely this debate. The motion was carried, as it probably would be in Australia because Labor is at one with the Abbott government on this matter; but at least senators and members would be forced to put their names on the record on one side or another and to take responsibility for the decision that is being made in our name. If it is good enough for Westminster, why not for us? What British parliamentarians and thereby the media and the public have been able to establish is that the deployment is constrained to air strikes and air operations, it does not contemplate ground troops and it does not contemplate incursions into Syria. So the British people at least have some idea of the scope and nature of the deployment, and parliament has conferred. The deployment may not have strategic legitimacy but at least it has a veneer of democratic legitimacy in that parliament has been brought into the loop and MPs have been forced to stand up and be counted one way or another. I should point out that a substantial minority of those in the British parliament—in the house, at least—voted against the deployment for many of the same reasons that Senator Milne has identified this morning.


So how is it that they can manage to do this in Westminster? Is it their bruising experience of the Iraq war, where British soldiers were coming home wrapped in flags with horrific regularity? What is it that they learned about that Iraq deployment that we here in Australia failed to learn?


How extensive will this deployment be? The 'no boots on the ground' commitment has been jettisoned. The 'strictly humanitarian mission' concept has already been jettisoned. Now the Australian government is being deliberately ambiguous about our engagement, or not, inside Syria, which is where the Islamic State's support base has the largest footprint. What is the risk that Australia is inadvertently playing directly into the hands of this horrific entity and simply playing our part in their recruitment strategy? Has that been considered by the National Security Committee of cabinet? How long will they be deployed for? What would success look like? 


These are matters that can be brought to the Australian parliament so that those on the front bench and the back benches, in the opposition parties and on the crossbench can put their names on one side or other of the ledger. We know what happens when such a decision is left to the Prime Minister alone, because that is how this whole horrific mess started. Simply calling it a 'tradition', as Senator Fifield did earlier, is not good enough. There are all kinds of things that used to be a tradition—




Senator Fifield:
  No, I said 'convention'.




Senator LUDLAM:
  I think 'tradition' was the word you used, Senator Fifield. 'Convention' will do just as well. Conventions change. It is time that we grew up, as other parliaments around the world have done.


President Obama, while contesting the notion that he needs to go to Congress for authorisation for air strikes in Iraq nonetheless sought congressional authority to go into Syria—




Senator O'Sullivan:
  It’s a completely different system.




Senator LUDLAM:
  It is a democracy. 




Senator O'Sullivan:
  You need to study.




Senator LUDLAM:
  It is a democracy.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order, on my right!




Senator LUDLAM:
  And what could be a more important question to bring to a chamber such as this than the decision to deploy the ADF into harm's way? If it is good enough for President Obama to seek congressional authority for attacks inside Syria, if it is good enough for Prime Minister Cameron to go to his parliament to seek parliamentary approval for air strikes in Iraq, then it is about time we in Australia grew up—so that we do not find ourselves subject to mission creep in a horrendous, multiyear occupation of a country in a part of the world that foreign-flagged high explosives played a really important part in destabilising in the first place. It is time we learned from the mistakes of the past.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2014-09-30,"



Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (12:51):  I again indicate Labor will not be supporting this motion for the suspension of standing orders. I begin by expressing my support and Labor's support for ADF personnel currently involved in operations in Iraq and those that are pre-deployed in the United Arab Emirates. As they always do, they are undertaking their task with dedication and great professionalism. I also want to give my support to the families of the personnel deployed; their role should not be forgotten during these times.


It is the role of parliament to debate issues of concern, particularly when it comes to whether Australia deploys its Defence forces. Labor fully supports the role of parliament as a place of debate, but that should not be confused with requiring parliamentary approval. The role of the parliament in approving military action is fraught with danger, but this is what the Greens are proposing. As the Senate has debated before, Labor believes that the government must retain maximum flexibility to respond to threats to Australia's national security quickly and efficiently. A requirement for parliamentary approval would create situations where ADF personnel are deployed to a war-like environment without appropriate legal authority or important legal protections. It could also necessarily increase the risk to the deployment. Labor has always supported the need to debate such issues; that is the role of the parliament.


We are pleased that the government facilitated a debate on Iraq earlier this month and we fully expect the government to provide further opportunities to debate this deployment in the coming weeks and months. That is appropriate and ensures an important level of transparency to any ADF deployment. Regular statements to parliament by the government is something Labor initiated, and it is something that this government should continue. Let me conclude by saying that it is Labor's view that executive government remains the most appropriate body to exercise civilian control of the Australian Defence Force. It is appropriate for the parliament to debate government decisions that involve the deployment of ADF personnel, but that should be done in a considered way. We do not support this suspension.

"Seselja, Sen Zed",LP,2014-09-30,"



Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory) (12:54):  I would like to commence by putting on record my gratitude to our ADF personnel for the work that they do in keeping our country safe. I am sure that all Australians will join with senators in wishing them safety and good will in whatever they may be asked to do by the Australian government. Senator Milne expressed concerns about the experience in places like Afghanistan, and there is no doubt that in many ways we wish we had never gone into Afghanistan, but the Australian government, along with many other governments, responded to the horrific events of September 11—and to the fact that we saw a terrorist training ground in Afghanistan—and responded to the unacceptable threat that that posed. When I speak to ADF personnel about the role that they were asked to play and that they played, I do not hear warmongering—they are not people who are keen to go to war—but men and women who understand that sometimes it is necessary to actually confront evil. They are proud of the role that they have played in confronting that evil in many parts of the world, and I think we should be proud of the job they have done on our behalf.


When we debate this particular motion about suspending standing orders, there are a couple of issues to consider, and other senators have touched on them. One is about the correct role of parliament in relation to military deployments. I agree with what has been expressed by Senator Fifield, Senator Wong and Senator Conroy: that is, that the process whereby the executive government makes the decision as to if, when and how to deploy our military personnel is one that is held us in good stead. This is not a process that happens on a whim; this is a process that goes through detailed consultations at an executive level at the National Security Committee of Cabinet; and detailed consultations with the opposition, who, in this case, have been briefed right across the board and right along the way, and they have expressed their support. We do not have a situation where the processes are being ignored; this is a process that has been followed that for many years and is being followed in this particular circumstance. Other countries have different constitutional requirements and in some cases they have different processes. What we have here is a situation where the government has consulted with the opposition and will make decisions as an executive—and we are grateful to have the backing of the opposition for the process. 


There are many opportunities for this place to debate military deployments, and that is a good thing. We are debating it here for half an hour, but there are ample opportunities for such debates—we can list an issue on the Notice Paper, and there are many other mechanisms of the Senate that allow debate. I welcome such debates, and the Australian government welcomes such debates, but this attempt to suspend standing orders with no notice is unfortunately a stunt. It is not a serious attempt at a parliamentary debate; it is simply a bit of grandstanding by the Greens. I think that is unfortunate in the circumstances that we face this kind of grandstanding. There are plenty of opportunities and I would encourage any senator to take those opportunities but not to engage in these kinds of stunts. We should not have a situation with the executive government has to consult with the Greens in order to make a decision on the deployment of Australian military personnel. We have longstanding conventions; they have been followed; they have stood us in good stead; and I think this suspension should be rejected. (Time expired)



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that the motion to suspend standing orders moved by Senator Milne be agreed to.

"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2014-09-30,"



Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (13:06):  The Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (2014 Budget Measures No. 1) Bill 2014 and the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (2014 Budget Measures No. 2) Bill 2014 amount to a serious attack on the Australian welfare state. In his budget reply, our opposition leader, Mr Shorten, said about the budget that was brought down that it was an attack on the freedom of integrity, on the freedom of respect, on the freedom that gives every person dignity and the right to be treated equally and on the freedom of compassion and respect that gives individuals the opportunity to fulfil their potential. This is the freedom we believe in, and this budget undermines that freedom. It weakens it. This budget tears at the fabric of our country. Indeed, these bills are the heart of that budget. They attack the most vulnerable in our community. I believe that the government is trying to destroy our system of a 'fair go' specifically through these bills.


We know that through the proposals that we have before us millions of pensioners, families, people with disability, carers and young people will be worse off; cuts will throw Australia's most vulnerable citizens into poverty. Is this what the Prime Minister meant when he said that he was going to protect the vulnerable? As has been said many times, there are a series of broken promises in this legislation: broken promises to pensioners, broken promises to Australian families, broken promises to people with disability, broken promises to carers and broken promises to young people who do not have work.


Before the election, this Prime Minister promised Australian pensioners that there would be no cuts or changes to the pension, yet within these bills we see cuts to pension indexation which will undeniably diminish the living standards of age pensioners, disability pensioners, veterans and carers. Despite what the government says—despite the rhetorical discussion about whether these are cuts or reductions—these are cuts. People will have less money; to me, that is a cut.


Before the election, Australian families were promised by this Prime Minister that they would be better off under an Abbott government. They are now counting the cost of the cruel cuts to family payments contained in these bills. There is a fear which was raised by Bill Shorten in his budget reply that this budget—and, I believe, in particular these bills—will make Australia a colder, meaner and narrower place. This is a failure of this government—a government that promised govern for all of us—in its mutual obligation to young job seekers as they look for work. 


I know that many senators in this debate will talk about particular elements in this bill, and there are so many about which to talk. I want to raise a few. The bills will tear up our system of social contracts—social contracts that have been built by successive governments of all particular flavours over the last century. They are based on the pillars of the Australian welfare state: access to universal health care and education, a fair and secure pension system, support for people who cannot work due to disability or caring responsibilities and support that helps get people into work. It took more than a century to develop the system that we have today; these bills will take that system out. 


We have a social welfare system of which Australians can be proud. No-one claims that it is perfect. We accept that, and we need to consistently work together in our communities to see how we can make it better. Importantly, I say 'work together'. When the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs looked at this legislation, every one of the witnesses that came to see us said that they wanted to engage with government to look at the system. They were not just rejecting and saying no—though they were rejecting the changes in these bills, there is no doubt about that—they were prepared to work with the government to find alternative ways to make our system stronger. The statements from government that only they care about our budget and our society and that only they are aware of the need for change are just not true. We need to have security in our system. It is that very security that these bills seek to destroy. 


The Abbott government is making a false and misleading argument to support these cuts. We heard on budget night one element which continues to infuriate me and many people in the community: a claim that we are a nation of leaners and lifters and that the leaners need to do more heavy lifting. Apart from the fact that that claim is offensive, what does it mean? Does it mean that anyone who has any need of reliance on welfare is automatically not worthy? Is that what the government is saying? Once again, people are not being treated with respect through this process. 


We agree with the comments made by the Council on the Ageing:


If the argument is that pensions need to go down in terms of Commonwealth expenditures because of a fiscal crisis, we do not think that is a sufficient argument …


In fact, there is compelling evidence that the proportion of Australians who are welfare-dependent is decreasing. Despite the cries of the government and its compliant media, who run regular media statements about people who are taking down the system, the statistics in the June analysis of the Melbourne Institute using the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey showed that Australians have reduced their dependence on welfare. In 2001, 23 per cent of working-age people in Australia received a welfare payment each week. In 2011, that had dropped to 18.5 per cent, and it continues to drop despite the rhetoric and despite the claims that our system is falling over and is unsustainable.


We know that across the OECD Australia spends less on welfare than any other country except Iceland. Earlier this year, Minister Andrews claimed that Australia is a risk of becoming a welfare state like nations in Europe, but welfare spending in Australia is well below the countries in the OECD. 




Senator O'Sullivan:
  Compared to Greece, Italy and Ireland?




Senator MOORE:
  In fact, our welfare expenditure accounted for just 8.6 per cent of GDP in 2013 compared to the OECD average of 13 per cent. Perhaps Senator O'Sullivan can give me the figures which he is mumbling about. The government's claim that Australia is heading for some sort of welfare crisis is complete rubbish. 


These bills build up the premise that people are not supporting Australia, but they are. These bills are an unprecedented attack on pensioners and seniors. The Prime Minister said that pensions would not be cut. Well, they will be. The real amount of pension will be cut. The pension indexation changes will impact on what people are able to get from their pension. Treasurer Hockey admitted that the Abbott government's changes to pension indexation will result in massive cuts to the age pension, saying:


… in 2024-25, according to the Parliamentary Budget Office, instead of being $74.8 billion a year it is $67.9 billion a year. 


In Senate Estimates, answers from Minister Fifield showed that the changes to the pension indexation have been put in place in an effort to slow the rate of pension increase. 


What has occurred is that people have been made afraid. They have been made afraid about the security of their future. They have been made to feel as though they are doing something wrong, when in fact they have not. That is not the intent of our system. It is to engage and support, not to demonise.


The major advocacy organisations that support aged people in our country are saying they want to have a discussion about retirement in Australia. They think it is an important thing to do. They do not like their members—older Australians—being referred to as 'leaners'. They want a discussion about how we can work together to best work as a nation. We need to look across the board at our retirement system and not take a blunt instrument like the indexation tool to rip money out of the fortnightly payments of Australian pensioners.


I remember, as you would, Mr Acting Deputy President Gallacher, that when we had the call several years ago to increase pensions, our government, the Rudd government, actually increased pensions. The people on this side were saying we should do more. So their argument is not consistent. With our superannuation changes, again, we believe that we should be protecting superannuation and not ripping it away.


But it is not just age pensioners and veterans who are being affected by these bills. Self-funded retirees are also being betrayed in the budget. The bills include the abolition of the seniors supplement, an annual payment of $876 to people who receive the Commonwealth seniors health card. Already the government has cut the pensioner concessions that are linked between the Commonwealth and state governments, a process that of course is blamed completely on the states, but that is just not true.


We believe that there is a clear indication in these two bills that people in Australia will now be divided into those who have and those who have not, and this government is ripping more money off the people who have not. We consistently talk about the issues of the cumulative effect of these cuts. You cannot take one issue and look at it in isolation. We had evidence during our inquiry about what the cumulative effect would be of the range of cuts. This needs to be addressed by the community and by the government.


In regard to the age pension and superannuation, I will be moving amendments to the bills today to remove the following cruel cuts from the bills: cuts to pensions, through the indexation changes; increasing the age pension to 70; abolishing the seniors supplement; the resetting of the social security and veterans entitlements test deeming thresholds; cessation of the pensioner education supplement; the removal of the three-month backdating of the disability pension under the Veterans' Entitlement Act 1986; and a pause to indexation of the income-test-free areas for all pensioners. Labor will not support these measures.


When we get to families there is another series of attacks. These bills contain measures that can only be described as a full-scale cost-of-living attack on Australian families. It includes a massive $7.5 billion in cuts to family payments. This legislation will put more pressure on the budgets of millions of families, and low-income families will be hit the hardest. We have figures from independent modelling agency NATSEM saying that the government has no credibility in claiming that this is a fair budget. NATSEM research showed that around 1.2 million families will be, on average, $3,000 a year worse-off by 2017-18. In contrast, the top 20 per cent of households will experience either no impact, a negligible impact, or in fact a positive impact.


The bills seek to freeze the payment rate for family tax benefits. They seek to freeze the low-income-free area for family tax benefits, including the low-income-free area for those who receive the maximum rate of family tax benefit A. According to the Department of Social Services, a freeze to the low-income-free area for FTB-A alone will see more than 370,000 families around $750 a year worse off in 2016-17. Over the life of the children's schooling, eligible families will be around $15,000 worse off as a result of this budget, including the measures in these bills. By 2016, a single-income couple family on $65,000 with two school-age children will be around $6,000 worse off each year. We have the figures. Through Senate estimates we tried to get information about these cuts. We tried to find out exactly who was going to be impacted. We found out slowly through Senate estimates that around 700,000 families will lose family tax benefit B, if the government actually gets these bills through.


Families will lose their payment when their youngest child turns six. We have been fighting these kinds of reductions for years, looking at the need for effective parenting. Again, removing this payment when the youngest child turns six does not engage effectively with what we know is best practice for families and for parenting. It erodes the sense of security, the sense of harmony, that people should have with their government.


Today I will also move amendments to reflect that Labor will oppose the indexing of parenting payment (single) by CPI only—the government is moving the wages benchmark. Labor will oppose the government's move to freeze the rates of family tax benefits; oppose revising the family tax benefit end-of-year supplements to their original values, and cease indexation; and, oppose limiting family tax benefit part B to families with children under six years of age. The new allowance, which as been put in because the government knew this was going to have an impact, further complicates the system and does not adjust effectively for the loss from the original cut. Labor will also oppose freezes to the income-free-areas for family payments.


The bills also include a measure to tighten the means testing for FTB-B from $150,000 to $100,000. Labor accepts the need for means testing. We in fact have implemented means testing for many payments, such as the age pension and the private health insurance rebate. We originally introduced means testing to family tax benefit part B. You will remember that when we did that, the people who are now in government but were on the opposition side of the chamber at the time and they abused our changes, saying that we were heartless, that we did not understand the need, and that we were not effectively fulfilling our role in government. It is always dangerous when you go back and read past Hansards. But I would encourage people to have a look at what this government said when they were in opposition about changes to our system. Compare the rhetoric and compare the allegations, then you will see—when you hear their statements—that there again is no consistency.


There was considerable debate in our inquiry and also considerable information from people who have written in to many of us through the committee process—through email and phone calls—about their concern about the young job seekers' changes. There were a series of questions that we put to the department at our inquiry about the impact and the research behind the singularly unique and harsh changes that the government has brought in, which will withdraw the safety net for young job seekers. I know many senators will be putting information on the record about how concerned they are about this.


The National Welfare Rights Network stated in our inquiry that the changes in this measure to unemployment eligibility for young people under 30 is:


…a fundamental attack on the basic right to social security and the principle of adequate income support based on need.


ACOSS said:


The removal of any income support for a group of people not in paid work fundamentally changes the Australian income support safety net.


The St Vincent de Paul Society said:


We find very concerning the idea that the government would intentionally remove any semblance of a social safety net for a particular group of people.


The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights has also pointed out that amongst all the changes that were brought forward, this particular attack on young, unemployed people does not meet the requirement to fit the human rights expectations of our community. Again, I stress that these bills—as part of a wider budget—actually attack the relationship between our citizens and our social welfare system. These do not respond to the way that we have committed to ensuring that people in need will have support.




Senator O'Sullivan:
  It will be a lot harsher if we do not get the budget in order.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Gallacher
):  Order!




Senator MOORE:
  There is gross unfairness at the heart of this government's budget. We now know that people will not be benefited by these processes. We will also be moving amendments in this particular section of the bill. We will be removing the following sections to extend the ordinary waiting period for working age payments, we will be rejecting the cessation of the education entry payment and we will be rejecting moving people under 25 from Newstart onto youth allowance, which would be with weekly cuts to their already minimal allowances.


The forcing of young people under 30 to wait six months without any support at all then becomes a rolling punishment. It is not just once; but it is six months on, six months off. Think about what that will do to Australian families. This applies to people under 30. These are independent people who now will be forced back to relying on family or charity. That does not meet any requirement under our acceptance of what should be what our nation does. We are also rejecting the pauses to indexation for the low income-free area for student payments, including the student income bank limits. We are also rejecting pausing indexation of income-free areas for all working age allowances.


There are many other elements of this bill that need consideration. They are enormous piece of legislation, but I think it is important that senators across the board can identify elements that offend them, that cause fear and that we should be addressing. We believe the government has not effectively shared the pain of the budget. They said that there would be pain in the budget, but it has not been shared fairly. The most vulnerable, who are the people who are reliant on support, will bear the greatest punishment. We reject this process and we will actually be ensuring that the through this debate, we will be focusing on what needs to change.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (13:26):  The Greens oppose these bills. They are so bad that we do not think that you can amend them to save them. They are fundamentally cutting at the fabric of our community and we will be opposing both of these bills. ACOSS says that these bills are radical structural changes to our social security system. I agree with their comments, but I go further: these are radical changes to our community.


Our community, once these changes come into effect, will no longer look or be as an inclusive as it is now. We will no longer have a land of the fair go, where we help the most vulnerable and where people are considered to have access to opportunity. It will be changed into a meaner, less inclusive community where if you have money or your parents have money, you will have an advantage and you will have access to opportunities that many others do not. We will move away from a community where we expect that we will help the most vulnerable and disadvantaged in our community and where we provide help to people who need it. These budget measures do not discriminate against specific peoples, because they are having a go at everybody: at young people, at older Australians, at single parents, at people with disabilities and at families.


We have had overwhelming evidence that shows the negative impacts of these measures. Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights has made the point that they do not consider that the measures that deny people access to social security are compatible with human rights. Accordingly, it says that:


…the committee considers that the measure is incompatible with the right to social security and the right to an adequate standard of living.


When they looked at the age criteria for the Newstart allowance and the exclusion periods, which will chuck under 30-year-olds off income support, they said:


Accordingly, the committee considers that the measures in Schedules 8 and 9 are incompatible with the rights to equality and non-discrimination on the basis of age.


They have also sought further advice from the minister about the impact of these measures on equality and nondiscrimination on the basis of gender and family responsibilities.


These measures are fundamentally unacceptable. As the National Welfare Rights Network says, these measures are not fair and they are not equitable. The harshest cuts in these budget measures are to the most vulnerable, yet these are the people who we should be helping; the most vulnerable are the people who should be supported by our community. Not supporting people, in the way that these budget measures would cause to come into effect, is not fair and it is not equitable.


The government is in fact making a concerted attempt to rent giant, great big holes in our safety net. There is absolutely no doubt that that is what is happening. These changes have been universally rejected by all submitters to the Senate inquiry, except for the government's own department. People can see through what the government is attempting to do—that is, to destroy our safety net. The community does not like it and neither do the Greens. We expect our safety net to provide a basic but adequate standard of living for our citizens and a foundation from which they can see beyond barriers to inclusion in our community and barriers to employment, to overcome their disadvantage.


We need a well-grounded, reasoned, evidence-based, credible, ethical approach that is person-centred and ensures their wellbeing, making sure they are included in decision making and giving them control over their lives. We should be working with people's strengths, hopes and aspirations and building on these. This approach will generate lasting change to those persons' lives; while blaming, punishing and demonising does not help people to overcome their disadvantage and in fact entrenches dependency and hopelessness.  These bills will do that. These bills will increase inequality, particularly for young people who will be set back, potentially, for life. Living on nothing for over six months at a time, which is what these bills enable, creates dependency. It will create hopelessness and it will create a revolving door of people having to go on and off income support because barriers to employment and to inclusiveness are not being overcome with these measures.


These bills contain the government's cruellest welfare measures, their cruellest budget measures. They will take billions of dollars out of our social security system, money which should be invested in helping people. These measures do none of what I am talking about in terms of the way we should be supporting people to overcome disadvantage, how we should be supporting the most vulnerable. These changes are, I believe, purposely designed to hurt the most disadvantaged. The inquiry into these bills heard repeatedly of the negative and potentially dangerous effects that these budget measures will have. The government is making a determined attempt to radically change our social security system in this country and our safety net. 


This is not the first time attempts have been made. Previous Prime Ministers Howard, Rudd and Gillard all made changes that were negative but these take the cake. These will fundamentally change how we care and support the most disadvantaged. These bills will add to the growing inequality in Australia. They will have long- ranging effects as wealth, interest and power are concentrated more and more with a few. These measures will affect generations ahead. When combined with other budget measures, people will be priced out of the housing market. People will be unable to find accommodation. Education will become more inaccessible to people. There will be more insecure access to income support and if they become sick people will not be able to access adequate assistance. The submissions and evidence to the inquiry into these bills show that, if enacted, these bills will compound poverty and hardship in our community and will not help improve employment participation. As St Vincent de Paul said to the inquiry:


We cannot agree with measures that will drive people even deeper into poverty, above all in an environment where there simply aren't enough jobs for the numbers of people looking for work.


A number of organisations raised concern about the cumulative impact of these measures, with National Welfare Rights Network saying:


These Bills contain a wide range of measures which have complex interactions with each other, and with other measures proposed in other Bills the harshest reductions to income are felt by the more vulnerable social security recipients and low income working families.


These bills are fundamentally a shift in the wrong direction on income support. Again the National Welfare Rights Network described the proposals in the bills before the committee as containing:


… some of the most significant changes to the Australian system of income support since it was first introduced in a consolidated Social Security Act in 1947.


I agree with them. These measures include forcing young people to live for six months and potentially longer without any income support, and changes to indexation of the pensions which will have an increasing impact on the ability of older Australians and single parents to meet their living expenses. Increasing the retirement age will have a significant impact on many older workers. Cutting and freezing payments for families and single parents will have a significant impact. Reassessing payment eligibility for people with disability will also have a significant impact. As NATSEM said, and I go back to the point I made earlier, the government know what they are doing. They know they are going to be impacting the most disadvantaged. That is why I think this has been designed that way. They had advice from and modelling done by NATSEM which made it clear that:


… this budget is raising revenue by taking income from the disadvantaged people in far greater proportions than from the affluent. As a result of changes to pensions, family allowances, unemployment benefits, and other social security payments, the poorest one in five Australian families will be hit up for up to 10.8 per cent of their income in 2017-18. By contrast, the richest Australian families can expect to forgo a maximum of 1.7 per cent in the same period.


In their submission to these bills, St Vincent de Paul said:


We cannot agree with measures that will drive people even deeper into poverty, above all in an environment where there simply—


is not enough work. These measures will impact on a range of Australians. Let us look at the budget measures which affect younger Australians, in particular the harshest budget measure of all, the one that shows this government simply does not understand what they are doing to young people. They think they will motivate people to find work because they think there are jobs out there for the picking, if people were motivated. Well, there are not the jobs there. There simply are not enough jobs for all young people, but we will dump them onto no income support anyway and expect them to live with nothing. While I am on this point, please, I beg the crossbenchers: do not compromise on this measure. Even a month, which I have heard some people talk about, is too long without income support—you already sow the seeds for homelessness and for people's inability to meet their basic needs.


We need to be generating and adopting a system that is supportive of young people, that helps them overcome their barriers and that helps them see a future beyond being able to sometimes access a part-time, casual or temporary job where they cycle in and out of employment. That is not how you can build a family; that is not how you can build a secure future. This budget measure dumps young people onto no income support for six months and, potentially, longer if you happen to breach one of your requirements. There is this neat, cute little description of 'new payment', but you still have to meet your requirements if you were, in fact, getting income support. This is an ideological approach to how this government thinks you support young people. It has got it so wrong, and the evidence clearly shows that. Also, the human rights committee now says it is incompatible.


The Abbott government's attitude to employment for young people, as I said, assumes that these jobs are readily available and young people are making a lifestyle choice. None of the young people I have spoken to are making that lifestyle choice. They have told me of the dozens and dozens of jobs that they have applied for and the circumstances where there are 1,000 people applying for one job. I heard, in fact, over the weekend from a young person who said that Target was opening a new store in Western Australia, and they had over 900 applications for around 100 jobs. That is 800 people that will be disappointed. And those 800 people, you could bet, would have applied and applied for jobs.


The government thinks that by making life unbearable for young job seekers they will see the light and their barriers to employment will suddenly be overcome. That is so far from the truth. It will condemn young people to poverty and to probably forcing them to lose their accommodation and not be able to meet their basic needs. That is not a safety net. That is simply getting rid of any form of social security for those young people. Poverty, we know, is another barrier to employment. Workforce exclusion is complex and enduring, particularly for people who are disadvantaged. This simplistic ideological approach will not help people into work. It will not overcome those complex and enduring problems. Denying income support to job seekers under 30 for more than six months and then subjecting them to Work for the Dole regimes—and I do not have time to go into all of the problems there—is a major problem. It is fundamentally unacceptable. It is wrongheaded and needs to be rejected.


If you look at indexation, the government says that these bills propose to change the indexation for age pensions, disability support pensions and parenting payments. However, the indexation for parenting payments changes come in straightaway. The others do not come in until after the next election. Again, who will that hit the most? Of course, single parents. Single parents have already copped cut after cut. But if you then look at what it will do to age pensioners and to people on disability support pension, ACOSShas calculated it will be about an $80 per week impact by the time those indexation changes come into effect. That is a cut to the pension. Whether the government likes to describe it like that or not, it is a cut to the pension. We reject it. Likewise, we reject the increase in the retirement age because older people's exclusion from the workplace once they fall out of employment has not been addressed. And we know that one-third of the people on Newstart have barriers to employment, and we are not adequately addressing those payments. The combination of the changes to retirement age, indexation and freezing of assets will have a significant impact on older Australians.


As COTA pointed out, in their submission and to the Senate inquiry, they are not opposed to looking at how you address retirement income. There are many perverse incentives included which the government is not addressing in these measures that COTA and others think need to be addressed. We think their idea of a retirement income review is a very good idea. Wouldn't you think it would be sensible to do that first before you bring in these ad hoc changes? And, of course, it is very cute for the government to say that they are not breaking their promise. They are breaking their promise. This is a cut to the pension that will adversely impact many Australians. If you then look at the other changes in this budget, such as co-payments and changes to access to health, these are other impacts that older Australians have to face.


The government are also talking about changes which—and I just cannot understand it—are seeking to demonise disability support pensioners, who are now having their portability changed from six weeks to four weeks. Why? They are trying to demonise people. They trying to say, 'It is because you are travelling overseas; therefore, you should not be doing it because you are on a disability support pension.' I have had a number of people contact my office saying that they have been saving up for years and years to be able to travel overseas. And it is harder when you are travelling overseas with a disability. They are travelling to see relatives or because of a dream that they have always had to see the world or to see a specific place. They save up for years, and what are the government saying? 'You can only go for four weeks.' It is mean and demonising to people with disabilities.


People with disabilities are extremely concerned, also, about the reassessment for those under the age of 35. They do not think the process is well thought out. There is the impact on families in terms of, particularly, single parents due to changes to the family tax benefit. Again, this is another impact on single parents. It is ill-thought through. How many times are we going to have a bash at single parents in this place? Government after government has. And yet this government talks about trying to support families. Obviously single parents do not count as families to this government. The supplement of $750 will not adequately compensate single parents.


And then of course we are taking away again the pensioner education supplement, which is particularly important for single parents. The previous government, the Gillard government, took it away but saw sense and restored it. It was only restored this year and now it is going again. People with disabilities are extremely concerned about the demise of the pensioner education supplement and the impact that will have on them when they are trying to get better qualifications so they can engage in work. The problem for people with disabilities is it is hard to engage with work; they have many barriers to overcome. Single parents are the same.


We will be opposing these two bills. There are a couple of measures in these bills that in fact could be supported, but we think the bills are so bad that it is not worth amending them. The equal remuneration case for Western Australia is an example. Dealing with superannuation and the seniors' health card are important measures, but the government is trying to maybe sugarcoat the other measures by putting these ones in there. If the government wants support for those measures, it can pull them out of the bill and put them separately. We will not be seeking to amend these bills because they are not saveable. They fundamentally affect our social security safety net and they should be rejected, both of them.

Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia) (13:46):  It is with pleasure that I rise to speak on the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (2014 Budget Measures No. 1) Bill 2014 today. I am not going to have the opportunity to say everything this afternoon but I am going to specifically comment on the less than accurate—I know Senator Moore, I know Senator Siewert and I work closely with them so I will not use the word 'mischievous'—comments that have been in the paper today about the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights and its deliberations. I will come to that in a moment.


It is with pleasure that I rise to speak on the bill today because this legislation is designed to do something long overdue in this country. All of us in this parliament are committed to assisting the most vulnerable in our community. We all share an interest in helping those who are unable to fend for themselves financially. I happily believe that senators from other parties share that same aspiration, which makes some of the attacks we hear from those opposite all the more galling.


No political party in this country has a monopoly on compassion. And the consistent attempts by some of those opposite to cast debates on these matters in these Dickensian terms are as false as they are tiresome. But the simple fact is that if we want to make sure that the generations to come enjoy the same sorts of social support, networks and frameworks as current generations, we have a responsibility today to get government spending in our country onto a more sustainable footing. I know that this is a point that many opposite either cannot or will not accept but we cannot continue to spend the way we have been spending. Without wanting to traverse the same ground at length, we have to look at the situation this government inherited when it came to office just over a year ago. We face a situation where government debt, in the absence of any action to correct our current course, was on track to hit $667 billion in a decade's time. I would have thought it was pretty clear that was a very obvious signal of the unsustainable nature of our spending.


Looked at another way, between 2012 2014, the former Labor government was planning to increase government spending by about 16 per cent. On an international basis, that puts Australia right at the top of the list in government spending. While there are certain tables where it would be good to see Australia at the top, this is certainly not one of them.


In more immediate terms, what Labor's runaway debt position means is an interest bill for the nation of around $1 billion every month. That is a huge opportunity cost for this generation and for future generations. Just imagine what a government could do with an extra billion dollars per month in delivering critical infrastructure, providing support for health and education services or, indeed, giving the people's money back to them because it is not government money ultimately, it belongs to those who paid the tax in the first instance. But, bizarrely, the position of those opposite is that we should continue living it up today and let tomorrow look after itself. That is not the responsible way; that is not the new government's way. We were elected because we said we would get the budget back on track and that is what we are determined to do and that is what we will do.


Future generations will not thank those of us in this parliament today if they find the cupboard is bare when they need support down the track and, indeed, in more perilous times. Let me declare: I have supported all of the government budget measures. I am not just on the public record in Western Australia but I am on the public record in many of our nation's papers as supporting the budget measures, all of them. These are difficult times; they require difficult answers.


I was not surprised to learn that Labor today had sought to scaremonger, to misrepresent the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights. I was disappointed that ACOSS, who I have met a couple of times, decided to join in that scaremongering. What ACOSS said was not wrong; it Was just not completely true. What Labor has said was not wrong; it was just not completely true. I am personally disappointed because Senator Moore and others will know that the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights in our parliament, like other scrutiny committees, has a cherished and valuable role. It is free from the partisan politics that dominate other committees.


Just for the information of senators and those who might have an interest, let me just explain what it is that the committee does. The main function of the committee is to examine bills and legislative instruments that come before the parliament for compatibility with human rights, as defined by seven core international and human rights conventions to which Australia is a party. In simple terms, those conventions define a range of civil and political rights, as well as rights collectively described as economic, social and cultural rights. To understand the way in which the committee undertakes its examination of legislation it is critical to note that, aside from absolute rights such as the right not to be subject to torture, human rights may be generally subject to what are termed permissible limitations under international human rights law. Accordingly, the committee's analytical framework focuses on, firstly, identifying if a proposed measure might have the effect of limiting the enjoyment of a specific right and, secondly, whether any such limitations may be regarded as permissible or justified.


Today we read about an issue in The Australian newspaper and, again, I was disappointed because the journalist concerned—whose stories I normally like reading—did not have the courtesy to speak to the chairman of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights. If she had chosen to, if Labor had been interested in a thorough debate on the human rights implications and if ACOSS had been concerned about engaging in a thorough debate on the human rights implications, they would have gone not just to the report but to the chairman's tabling statement, the statement that I give in this parliament every time I present a human rights report. What would they have found? I might just add here that Senator Siewert or Senator Moore did not talk about it; they gave incomplete explanations. What did the chairman say? I would like to draw senators' attention to one bill in this report, which is of particular interest and relevance to the committee's task of assessing legislation for compatibility with human rights. The bill, the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (2014 Budget Measures No. 2) Bill 2014, seeks to amend various acts relating to social security, family assistance, veterans' entitlements and farm household support to make a number of changes to certain Australian government payments. The report says:


The committee previously sought the advice of the minister—


that is accurate—


as to whether the measures are compatible with these rights, noting that the statement of compatibility did not adequately identify and assess how potential limitations on the right to social security, the right to an adequate standard of living and the rights to quality and non-discrimination would be reasonable, necessary and proportionate in each case.


That is not a sin. Many government departments do not meet the statement of compatibility test in the first instance. That is not new to this government; it was a feature of the previous government. And Senator Moore is nodding her head in agreement! But this is the critical point: 


The further information provided by the minister in this case is an excellent model—


I did not hear that from either Senator Moore or Senator Siewert.


for the kind of detailed information and analysis required to assist the committee in its assessment of the human rights compatibility of legislation. This further information has allowed the committee to conclude that the measures are largely compatible with the right to social security and the right to an adequate standard of living, with identified limitations of rights being generally assessed as reasonable, necessary and proportionate in pursuit of a legitimate objective.


This is the other point that Senator Moore, Senator Siewert, The Australian, ACOSS and the Labor Party omitted from their coverage today. 


Significantly, out of the twelve matters raised by the committee in relation to measures in the bill, the committee has concluded that ten of these are compatible with human rights.


I do not know about you, Mr Acting Deputy President, but in my language that is a distinction. It is more than a pass; it is a distinction. But this is the critical point: in an effort to prosecute their argument, Labor, ACOSS and The Australian—I cannot believe I am saying it—decided to go for a half-truth, not the full truth. That is very disappointing. 



In the few moments available to me, let me say that it is not new for governments to suffer the ire of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, which speaks to its scrutiny value and its parliamentary value. I was just reflecting this morning: what other common, familiar issue was there last year or the year before? Of course, it was Labor's media reforms that fell foul of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Human Rights. They, deservedly, fell foul. I now read from a report in TheSydney Morning Herald:


Of particular concern to the committee—


that is, the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Human Rights—


is Labor's proposal to appoint a single person—the public interest media advocate—to oversee newspaper regulators and judge whether media ownership is ''in the public interest''.


''These bills appear to limit the right to freedom of expression and freedom of association,'' wrote the committee about the two bills that govern the self-regulation of newspapers.


It is true and I think that many Australians would be surprised to learn that there is a human right to an adequate standard of living and a human right to food and shelter, but the fact is that our country, under the stewardship of then Prime Minister Holt—and I might add, for the benefit of my National Party colleagues, also at the table was 'Black Jack' McEwen, the Deputy Prime Minister—rightly or wrongly, signed up to international treaties. It has a parliamentary committee to oversee them. It is doing good work, but Labor could not resist the temptation. I expect better from ACOSS, the Labor Party and The Australian.

Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (13:06):  The Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (2014 Budget Measures No. 1) Bill 2014 and the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (2014 Budget Measures No. 2) Bill 2014 amount to a serious attack on the Australian welfare state. In his budget reply, our opposition leader, Mr Shorten, said about the budget that was brought down that it was an attack on the freedom of integrity, on the freedom of respect, on the freedom that gives every person dignity and the right to be treated equally and on the freedom of compassion and respect that gives individuals the opportunity to fulfil their potential. This is the freedom we believe in, and this budget undermines that freedom. It weakens it. This budget tears at the fabric of our country. Indeed, these bills are the heart of that budget. They attack the most vulnerable in our community. I believe that the government is trying to destroy our system of a 'fair go' specifically through these bills.


We know that through the proposals that we have before us millions of pensioners, families, people with disability, carers and young people will be worse off; cuts will throw Australia's most vulnerable citizens into poverty. Is this what the Prime Minister meant when he said that he was going to protect the vulnerable? As has been said many times, there are a series of broken promises in this legislation: broken promises to pensioners, broken promises to Australian families, broken promises to people with disability, broken promises to carers and broken promises to young people who do not have work.


Before the election, this Prime Minister promised Australian pensioners that there would be no cuts or changes to the pension, yet within these bills we see cuts to pension indexation which will undeniably diminish the living standards of age pensioners, disability pensioners, veterans and carers. Despite what the government says—despite the rhetorical discussion about whether these are cuts or reductions—these are cuts. People will have less money; to me, that is a cut.


Before the election, Australian families were promised by this Prime Minister that they would be better off under an Abbott government. They are now counting the cost of the cruel cuts to family payments contained in these bills. There is a fear which was raised by Bill Shorten in his budget reply that this budget—and, I believe, in particular these bills—will make Australia a colder, meaner and narrower place. This is a failure of this government—a government that promised govern for all of us—in its mutual obligation to young job seekers as they look for work. 


I know that many senators in this debate will talk about particular elements in this bill, and there are so many about which to talk. I want to raise a few. The bills will tear up our system of social contracts—social contracts that have been built by successive governments of all particular flavours over the last century. They are based on the pillars of the Australian welfare state: access to universal health care and education, a fair and secure pension system, support for people who cannot work due to disability or caring responsibilities and support that helps get people into work. It took more than a century to develop the system that we have today; these bills will take that system out. 


We have a social welfare system of which Australians can be proud. No-one claims that it is perfect. We accept that, and we need to consistently work together in our communities to see how we can make it better. Importantly, I say 'work together'. When the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs looked at this legislation, every one of the witnesses that came to see us said that they wanted to engage with government to look at the system. They were not just rejecting and saying no—though they were rejecting the changes in these bills, there is no doubt about that—they were prepared to work with the government to find alternative ways to make our system stronger. The statements from government that only they care about our budget and our society and that only they are aware of the need for change are just not true. We need to have security in our system. It is that very security that these bills seek to destroy. 


The Abbott government is making a false and misleading argument to support these cuts. We heard on budget night one element which continues to infuriate me and many people in the community: a claim that we are a nation of leaners and lifters and that the leaners need to do more heavy lifting. Apart from the fact that that claim is offensive, what does it mean? Does it mean that anyone who has any need of reliance on welfare is automatically not worthy? Is that what the government is saying? Once again, people are not being treated with respect through this process. 


We agree with the comments made by the Council on the Ageing:


If the argument is that pensions need to go down in terms of Commonwealth expenditures because of a fiscal crisis, we do not think that is a sufficient argument …


In fact, there is compelling evidence that the proportion of Australians who are welfare-dependent is decreasing. Despite the cries of the government and its compliant media, who run regular media statements about people who are taking down the system, the statistics in the June analysis of the Melbourne Institute using the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey showed that Australians have reduced their dependence on welfare. In 2001, 23 per cent of working-age people in Australia received a welfare payment each week. In 2011, that had dropped to 18.5 per cent, and it continues to drop despite the rhetoric and despite the claims that our system is falling over and is unsustainable.


We know that across the OECD Australia spends less on welfare than any other country except Iceland. Earlier this year, Minister Andrews claimed that Australia is a risk of becoming a welfare state like nations in Europe, but welfare spending in Australia is well below the countries in the OECD. 




Senator O'Sullivan:
  Compared to Greece, Italy and Ireland?




Senator MOORE:
  In fact, our welfare expenditure accounted for just 8.6 per cent of GDP in 2013 compared to the OECD average of 13 per cent. Perhaps Senator O'Sullivan can give me the figures which he is mumbling about. The government's claim that Australia is heading for some sort of welfare crisis is complete rubbish. 


These bills build up the premise that people are not supporting Australia, but they are. These bills are an unprecedented attack on pensioners and seniors. The Prime Minister said that pensions would not be cut. Well, they will be. The real amount of pension will be cut. The pension indexation changes will impact on what people are able to get from their pension. Treasurer Hockey admitted that the Abbott government's changes to pension indexation will result in massive cuts to the age pension, saying:


… in 2024-25, according to the Parliamentary Budget Office, instead of being $74.8 billion a year it is $67.9 billion a year. 


In Senate Estimates, answers from Minister Fifield showed that the changes to the pension indexation have been put in place in an effort to slow the rate of pension increase. 


What has occurred is that people have been made afraid. They have been made afraid about the security of their future. They have been made to feel as though they are doing something wrong, when in fact they have not. That is not the intent of our system. It is to engage and support, not to demonise.


The major advocacy organisations that support aged people in our country are saying they want to have a discussion about retirement in Australia. They think it is an important thing to do. They do not like their members—older Australians—being referred to as 'leaners'. They want a discussion about how we can work together to best work as a nation. We need to look across the board at our retirement system and not take a blunt instrument like the indexation tool to rip money out of the fortnightly payments of Australian pensioners.


I remember, as you would, Mr Acting Deputy President Gallacher, that when we had the call several years ago to increase pensions, our government, the Rudd government, actually increased pensions. The people on this side were saying we should do more. So their argument is not consistent. With our superannuation changes, again, we believe that we should be protecting superannuation and not ripping it away.


But it is not just age pensioners and veterans who are being affected by these bills. Self-funded retirees are also being betrayed in the budget. The bills include the abolition of the seniors supplement, an annual payment of $876 to people who receive the Commonwealth seniors health card. Already the government has cut the pensioner concessions that are linked between the Commonwealth and state governments, a process that of course is blamed completely on the states, but that is just not true.


We believe that there is a clear indication in these two bills that people in Australia will now be divided into those who have and those who have not, and this government is ripping more money off the people who have not. We consistently talk about the issues of the cumulative effect of these cuts. You cannot take one issue and look at it in isolation. We had evidence during our inquiry about what the cumulative effect would be of the range of cuts. This needs to be addressed by the community and by the government.


In regard to the age pension and superannuation, I will be moving amendments to the bills today to remove the following cruel cuts from the bills: cuts to pensions, through the indexation changes; increasing the age pension to 70; abolishing the seniors supplement; the resetting of the social security and veterans entitlements test deeming thresholds; cessation of the pensioner education supplement; the removal of the three-month backdating of the disability pension under the Veterans' Entitlement Act 1986; and a pause to indexation of the income-test-free areas for all pensioners. Labor will not support these measures.


When we get to families there is another series of attacks. These bills contain measures that can only be described as a full-scale cost-of-living attack on Australian families. It includes a massive $7.5 billion in cuts to family payments. This legislation will put more pressure on the budgets of millions of families, and low-income families will be hit the hardest. We have figures from independent modelling agency NATSEM saying that the government has no credibility in claiming that this is a fair budget. NATSEM research showed that around 1.2 million families will be, on average, $3,000 a year worse-off by 2017-18. In contrast, the top 20 per cent of households will experience either no impact, a negligible impact, or in fact a positive impact.


The bills seek to freeze the payment rate for family tax benefits. They seek to freeze the low-income-free area for family tax benefits, including the low-income-free area for those who receive the maximum rate of family tax benefit A. According to the Department of Social Services, a freeze to the low-income-free area for FTB-A alone will see more than 370,000 families around $750 a year worse off in 2016-17. Over the life of the children's schooling, eligible families will be around $15,000 worse off as a result of this budget, including the measures in these bills. By 2016, a single-income couple family on $65,000 with two school-age children will be around $6,000 worse off each year. We have the figures. Through Senate estimates we tried to get information about these cuts. We tried to find out exactly who was going to be impacted. We found out slowly through Senate estimates that around 700,000 families will lose family tax benefit B, if the government actually gets these bills through.


Families will lose their payment when their youngest child turns six. We have been fighting these kinds of reductions for years, looking at the need for effective parenting. Again, removing this payment when the youngest child turns six does not engage effectively with what we know is best practice for families and for parenting. It erodes the sense of security, the sense of harmony, that people should have with their government.


Today I will also move amendments to reflect that Labor will oppose the indexing of parenting payment (single) by CPI only—the government is moving the wages benchmark. Labor will oppose the government's move to freeze the rates of family tax benefits; oppose revising the family tax benefit end-of-year supplements to their original values, and cease indexation; and, oppose limiting family tax benefit part B to families with children under six years of age. The new allowance, which as been put in because the government knew this was going to have an impact, further complicates the system and does not adjust effectively for the loss from the original cut. Labor will also oppose freezes to the income-free-areas for family payments.


The bills also include a measure to tighten the means testing for FTB-B from $150,000 to $100,000. Labor accepts the need for means testing. We in fact have implemented means testing for many payments, such as the age pension and the private health insurance rebate. We originally introduced means testing to family tax benefit part B. You will remember that when we did that, the people who are now in government but were on the opposition side of the chamber at the time and they abused our changes, saying that we were heartless, that we did not understand the need, and that we were not effectively fulfilling our role in government. It is always dangerous when you go back and read past Hansards. But I would encourage people to have a look at what this government said when they were in opposition about changes to our system. Compare the rhetoric and compare the allegations, then you will see—when you hear their statements—that there again is no consistency.


There was considerable debate in our inquiry and also considerable information from people who have written in to many of us through the committee process—through email and phone calls—about their concern about the young job seekers' changes. There were a series of questions that we put to the department at our inquiry about the impact and the research behind the singularly unique and harsh changes that the government has brought in, which will withdraw the safety net for young job seekers. I know many senators will be putting information on the record about how concerned they are about this.


The National Welfare Rights Network stated in our inquiry that the changes in this measure to unemployment eligibility for young people under 30 is:


…a fundamental attack on the basic right to social security and the principle of adequate income support based on need.


ACOSS said:


The removal of any income support for a group of people not in paid work fundamentally changes the Australian income support safety net.


The St Vincent de Paul Society said:


We find very concerning the idea that the government would intentionally remove any semblance of a social safety net for a particular group of people.


The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights has also pointed out that amongst all the changes that were brought forward, this particular attack on young, unemployed people does not meet the requirement to fit the human rights expectations of our community. Again, I stress that these bills—as part of a wider budget—actually attack the relationship between our citizens and our social welfare system. These do not respond to the way that we have committed to ensuring that people in need will have support.




Senator O'Sullivan:
  It will be a lot harsher if we do not get the budget in order.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Gallacher
):  Order!




Senator MOORE:
  There is gross unfairness at the heart of this government's budget. We now know that people will not be benefited by these processes. We will also be moving amendments in this particular section of the bill. We will be removing the following sections to extend the ordinary waiting period for working age payments, we will be rejecting the cessation of the education entry payment and we will be rejecting moving people under 25 from Newstart onto youth allowance, which would be with weekly cuts to their already minimal allowances.


The forcing of young people under 30 to wait six months without any support at all then becomes a rolling punishment. It is not just once; but it is six months on, six months off. Think about what that will do to Australian families. This applies to people under 30. These are independent people who now will be forced back to relying on family or charity. That does not meet any requirement under our acceptance of what should be what our nation does. We are also rejecting the pauses to indexation for the low income-free area for student payments, including the student income bank limits. We are also rejecting pausing indexation of income-free areas for all working age allowances.


There are many other elements of this bill that need consideration. They are enormous piece of legislation, but I think it is important that senators across the board can identify elements that offend them, that cause fear and that we should be addressing. We believe the government has not effectively shared the pain of the budget. They said that there would be pain in the budget, but it has not been shared fairly. The most vulnerable, who are the people who are reliant on support, will bear the greatest punishment. We reject this process and we will actually be ensuring that the through this debate, we will be focusing on what needs to change.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2014-09-30,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (13:26):  The Greens oppose these bills. They are so bad that we do not think that you can amend them to save them. They are fundamentally cutting at the fabric of our community and we will be opposing both of these bills. ACOSS says that these bills are radical structural changes to our social security system. I agree with their comments, but I go further: these are radical changes to our community.


Our community, once these changes come into effect, will no longer look or be as an inclusive as it is now. We will no longer have a land of the fair go, where we help the most vulnerable and where people are considered to have access to opportunity. It will be changed into a meaner, less inclusive community where if you have money or your parents have money, you will have an advantage and you will have access to opportunities that many others do not. We will move away from a community where we expect that we will help the most vulnerable and disadvantaged in our community and where we provide help to people who need it. These budget measures do not discriminate against specific peoples, because they are having a go at everybody: at young people, at older Australians, at single parents, at people with disabilities and at families.


We have had overwhelming evidence that shows the negative impacts of these measures. Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights has made the point that they do not consider that the measures that deny people access to social security are compatible with human rights. Accordingly, it says that:


…the committee considers that the measure is incompatible with the right to social security and the right to an adequate standard of living.


When they looked at the age criteria for the Newstart allowance and the exclusion periods, which will chuck under 30-year-olds off income support, they said:


Accordingly, the committee considers that the measures in Schedules 8 and 9 are incompatible with the rights to equality and non-discrimination on the basis of age.


They have also sought further advice from the minister about the impact of these measures on equality and nondiscrimination on the basis of gender and family responsibilities.


These measures are fundamentally unacceptable. As the National Welfare Rights Network says, these measures are not fair and they are not equitable. The harshest cuts in these budget measures are to the most vulnerable, yet these are the people who we should be helping; the most vulnerable are the people who should be supported by our community. Not supporting people, in the way that these budget measures would cause to come into effect, is not fair and it is not equitable.


The government is in fact making a concerted attempt to rent giant, great big holes in our safety net. There is absolutely no doubt that that is what is happening. These changes have been universally rejected by all submitters to the Senate inquiry, except for the government's own department. People can see through what the government is attempting to do—that is, to destroy our safety net. The community does not like it and neither do the Greens. We expect our safety net to provide a basic but adequate standard of living for our citizens and a foundation from which they can see beyond barriers to inclusion in our community and barriers to employment, to overcome their disadvantage.


We need a well-grounded, reasoned, evidence-based, credible, ethical approach that is person-centred and ensures their wellbeing, making sure they are included in decision making and giving them control over their lives. We should be working with people's strengths, hopes and aspirations and building on these. This approach will generate lasting change to those persons' lives; while blaming, punishing and demonising does not help people to overcome their disadvantage and in fact entrenches dependency and hopelessness.  These bills will do that. These bills will increase inequality, particularly for young people who will be set back, potentially, for life. Living on nothing for over six months at a time, which is what these bills enable, creates dependency. It will create hopelessness and it will create a revolving door of people having to go on and off income support because barriers to employment and to inclusiveness are not being overcome with these measures.


These bills contain the government's cruellest welfare measures, their cruellest budget measures. They will take billions of dollars out of our social security system, money which should be invested in helping people. These measures do none of what I am talking about in terms of the way we should be supporting people to overcome disadvantage, how we should be supporting the most vulnerable. These changes are, I believe, purposely designed to hurt the most disadvantaged. The inquiry into these bills heard repeatedly of the negative and potentially dangerous effects that these budget measures will have. The government is making a determined attempt to radically change our social security system in this country and our safety net. 


This is not the first time attempts have been made. Previous Prime Ministers Howard, Rudd and Gillard all made changes that were negative but these take the cake. These will fundamentally change how we care and support the most disadvantaged. These bills will add to the growing inequality in Australia. They will have long- ranging effects as wealth, interest and power are concentrated more and more with a few. These measures will affect generations ahead. When combined with other budget measures, people will be priced out of the housing market. People will be unable to find accommodation. Education will become more inaccessible to people. There will be more insecure access to income support and if they become sick people will not be able to access adequate assistance. The submissions and evidence to the inquiry into these bills show that, if enacted, these bills will compound poverty and hardship in our community and will not help improve employment participation. As St Vincent de Paul said to the inquiry:


We cannot agree with measures that will drive people even deeper into poverty, above all in an environment where there simply aren't enough jobs for the numbers of people looking for work.


A number of organisations raised concern about the cumulative impact of these measures, with National Welfare Rights Network saying:


These Bills contain a wide range of measures which have complex interactions with each other, and with other measures proposed in other Bills the harshest reductions to income are felt by the more vulnerable social security recipients and low income working families.


These bills are fundamentally a shift in the wrong direction on income support. Again the National Welfare Rights Network described the proposals in the bills before the committee as containing:


… some of the most significant changes to the Australian system of income support since it was first introduced in a consolidated Social Security Act in 1947.


I agree with them. These measures include forcing young people to live for six months and potentially longer without any income support, and changes to indexation of the pensions which will have an increasing impact on the ability of older Australians and single parents to meet their living expenses. Increasing the retirement age will have a significant impact on many older workers. Cutting and freezing payments for families and single parents will have a significant impact. Reassessing payment eligibility for people with disability will also have a significant impact. As NATSEM said, and I go back to the point I made earlier, the government know what they are doing. They know they are going to be impacting the most disadvantaged. That is why I think this has been designed that way. They had advice from and modelling done by NATSEM which made it clear that:


… this budget is raising revenue by taking income from the disadvantaged people in far greater proportions than from the affluent. As a result of changes to pensions, family allowances, unemployment benefits, and other social security payments, the poorest one in five Australian families will be hit up for up to 10.8 per cent of their income in 2017-18. By contrast, the richest Australian families can expect to forgo a maximum of 1.7 per cent in the same period.


In their submission to these bills, St Vincent de Paul said:


We cannot agree with measures that will drive people even deeper into poverty, above all in an environment where there simply—


is not enough work. These measures will impact on a range of Australians. Let us look at the budget measures which affect younger Australians, in particular the harshest budget measure of all, the one that shows this government simply does not understand what they are doing to young people. They think they will motivate people to find work because they think there are jobs out there for the picking, if people were motivated. Well, there are not the jobs there. There simply are not enough jobs for all young people, but we will dump them onto no income support anyway and expect them to live with nothing. While I am on this point, please, I beg the crossbenchers: do not compromise on this measure. Even a month, which I have heard some people talk about, is too long without income support—you already sow the seeds for homelessness and for people's inability to meet their basic needs.


We need to be generating and adopting a system that is supportive of young people, that helps them overcome their barriers and that helps them see a future beyond being able to sometimes access a part-time, casual or temporary job where they cycle in and out of employment. That is not how you can build a family; that is not how you can build a secure future. This budget measure dumps young people onto no income support for six months and, potentially, longer if you happen to breach one of your requirements. There is this neat, cute little description of 'new payment', but you still have to meet your requirements if you were, in fact, getting income support. This is an ideological approach to how this government thinks you support young people. It has got it so wrong, and the evidence clearly shows that. Also, the human rights committee now says it is incompatible.


The Abbott government's attitude to employment for young people, as I said, assumes that these jobs are readily available and young people are making a lifestyle choice. None of the young people I have spoken to are making that lifestyle choice. They have told me of the dozens and dozens of jobs that they have applied for and the circumstances where there are 1,000 people applying for one job. I heard, in fact, over the weekend from a young person who said that Target was opening a new store in Western Australia, and they had over 900 applications for around 100 jobs. That is 800 people that will be disappointed. And those 800 people, you could bet, would have applied and applied for jobs.


The government thinks that by making life unbearable for young job seekers they will see the light and their barriers to employment will suddenly be overcome. That is so far from the truth. It will condemn young people to poverty and to probably forcing them to lose their accommodation and not be able to meet their basic needs. That is not a safety net. That is simply getting rid of any form of social security for those young people. Poverty, we know, is another barrier to employment. Workforce exclusion is complex and enduring, particularly for people who are disadvantaged. This simplistic ideological approach will not help people into work. It will not overcome those complex and enduring problems. Denying income support to job seekers under 30 for more than six months and then subjecting them to Work for the Dole regimes—and I do not have time to go into all of the problems there—is a major problem. It is fundamentally unacceptable. It is wrongheaded and needs to be rejected.


If you look at indexation, the government says that these bills propose to change the indexation for age pensions, disability support pensions and parenting payments. However, the indexation for parenting payments changes come in straightaway. The others do not come in until after the next election. Again, who will that hit the most? Of course, single parents. Single parents have already copped cut after cut. But if you then look at what it will do to age pensioners and to people on disability support pension, ACOSShas calculated it will be about an $80 per week impact by the time those indexation changes come into effect. That is a cut to the pension. Whether the government likes to describe it like that or not, it is a cut to the pension. We reject it. Likewise, we reject the increase in the retirement age because older people's exclusion from the workplace once they fall out of employment has not been addressed. And we know that one-third of the people on Newstart have barriers to employment, and we are not adequately addressing those payments. The combination of the changes to retirement age, indexation and freezing of assets will have a significant impact on older Australians.


As COTA pointed out, in their submission and to the Senate inquiry, they are not opposed to looking at how you address retirement income. There are many perverse incentives included which the government is not addressing in these measures that COTA and others think need to be addressed. We think their idea of a retirement income review is a very good idea. Wouldn't you think it would be sensible to do that first before you bring in these ad hoc changes? And, of course, it is very cute for the government to say that they are not breaking their promise. They are breaking their promise. This is a cut to the pension that will adversely impact many Australians. If you then look at the other changes in this budget, such as co-payments and changes to access to health, these are other impacts that older Australians have to face.


The government are also talking about changes which—and I just cannot understand it—are seeking to demonise disability support pensioners, who are now having their portability changed from six weeks to four weeks. Why? They are trying to demonise people. They trying to say, 'It is because you are travelling overseas; therefore, you should not be doing it because you are on a disability support pension.' I have had a number of people contact my office saying that they have been saving up for years and years to be able to travel overseas. And it is harder when you are travelling overseas with a disability. They are travelling to see relatives or because of a dream that they have always had to see the world or to see a specific place. They save up for years, and what are the government saying? 'You can only go for four weeks.' It is mean and demonising to people with disabilities.


People with disabilities are extremely concerned, also, about the reassessment for those under the age of 35. They do not think the process is well thought out. There is the impact on families in terms of, particularly, single parents due to changes to the family tax benefit. Again, this is another impact on single parents. It is ill-thought through. How many times are we going to have a bash at single parents in this place? Government after government has. And yet this government talks about trying to support families. Obviously single parents do not count as families to this government. The supplement of $750 will not adequately compensate single parents.


And then of course we are taking away again the pensioner education supplement, which is particularly important for single parents. The previous government, the Gillard government, took it away but saw sense and restored it. It was only restored this year and now it is going again. People with disabilities are extremely concerned about the demise of the pensioner education supplement and the impact that will have on them when they are trying to get better qualifications so they can engage in work. The problem for people with disabilities is it is hard to engage with work; they have many barriers to overcome. Single parents are the same.


We will be opposing these two bills. There are a couple of measures in these bills that in fact could be supported, but we think the bills are so bad that it is not worth amending them. The equal remuneration case for Western Australia is an example. Dealing with superannuation and the seniors' health card are important measures, but the government is trying to maybe sugarcoat the other measures by putting these ones in there. If the government wants support for those measures, it can pull them out of the bill and put them separately. We will not be seeking to amend these bills because they are not saveable. They fundamentally affect our social security safety net and they should be rejected, both of them.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Smith, Sen Dean",LP,2014-09-30,"



Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia) (13:46):  It is with pleasure that I rise to speak on the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (2014 Budget Measures No. 1) Bill 2014 today. I am not going to have the opportunity to say everything this afternoon but I am going to specifically comment on the less than accurate—I know Senator Moore, I know Senator Siewert and I work closely with them so I will not use the word 'mischievous'—comments that have been in the paper today about the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights and its deliberations. I will come to that in a moment.


It is with pleasure that I rise to speak on the bill today because this legislation is designed to do something long overdue in this country. All of us in this parliament are committed to assisting the most vulnerable in our community. We all share an interest in helping those who are unable to fend for themselves financially. I happily believe that senators from other parties share that same aspiration, which makes some of the attacks we hear from those opposite all the more galling.


No political party in this country has a monopoly on compassion. And the consistent attempts by some of those opposite to cast debates on these matters in these Dickensian terms are as false as they are tiresome. But the simple fact is that if we want to make sure that the generations to come enjoy the same sorts of social support, networks and frameworks as current generations, we have a responsibility today to get government spending in our country onto a more sustainable footing. I know that this is a point that many opposite either cannot or will not accept but we cannot continue to spend the way we have been spending. Without wanting to traverse the same ground at length, we have to look at the situation this government inherited when it came to office just over a year ago. We face a situation where government debt, in the absence of any action to correct our current course, was on track to hit $667 billion in a decade's time. I would have thought it was pretty clear that was a very obvious signal of the unsustainable nature of our spending.


Looked at another way, between 2012 2014, the former Labor government was planning to increase government spending by about 16 per cent. On an international basis, that puts Australia right at the top of the list in government spending. While there are certain tables where it would be good to see Australia at the top, this is certainly not one of them.


In more immediate terms, what Labor's runaway debt position means is an interest bill for the nation of around $1 billion every month. That is a huge opportunity cost for this generation and for future generations. Just imagine what a government could do with an extra billion dollars per month in delivering critical infrastructure, providing support for health and education services or, indeed, giving the people's money back to them because it is not government money ultimately, it belongs to those who paid the tax in the first instance. But, bizarrely, the position of those opposite is that we should continue living it up today and let tomorrow look after itself. That is not the responsible way; that is not the new government's way. We were elected because we said we would get the budget back on track and that is what we are determined to do and that is what we will do.


Future generations will not thank those of us in this parliament today if they find the cupboard is bare when they need support down the track and, indeed, in more perilous times. Let me declare: I have supported all of the government budget measures. I am not just on the public record in Western Australia but I am on the public record in many of our nation's papers as supporting the budget measures, all of them. These are difficult times; they require difficult answers.


I was not surprised to learn that Labor today had sought to scaremonger, to misrepresent the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights. I was disappointed that ACOSS, who I have met a couple of times, decided to join in that scaremongering. What ACOSS said was not wrong; it Was just not completely true. What Labor has said was not wrong; it was just not completely true. I am personally disappointed because Senator Moore and others will know that the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights in our parliament, like other scrutiny committees, has a cherished and valuable role. It is free from the partisan politics that dominate other committees.


Just for the information of senators and those who might have an interest, let me just explain what it is that the committee does. The main function of the committee is to examine bills and legislative instruments that come before the parliament for compatibility with human rights, as defined by seven core international and human rights conventions to which Australia is a party. In simple terms, those conventions define a range of civil and political rights, as well as rights collectively described as economic, social and cultural rights. To understand the way in which the committee undertakes its examination of legislation it is critical to note that, aside from absolute rights such as the right not to be subject to torture, human rights may be generally subject to what are termed permissible limitations under international human rights law. Accordingly, the committee's analytical framework focuses on, firstly, identifying if a proposed measure might have the effect of limiting the enjoyment of a specific right and, secondly, whether any such limitations may be regarded as permissible or justified.


Today we read about an issue in The Australian newspaper and, again, I was disappointed because the journalist concerned—whose stories I normally like reading—did not have the courtesy to speak to the chairman of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights. If she had chosen to, if Labor had been interested in a thorough debate on the human rights implications and if ACOSS had been concerned about engaging in a thorough debate on the human rights implications, they would have gone not just to the report but to the chairman's tabling statement, the statement that I give in this parliament every time I present a human rights report. What would they have found? I might just add here that Senator Siewert or Senator Moore did not talk about it; they gave incomplete explanations. What did the chairman say? I would like to draw senators' attention to one bill in this report, which is of particular interest and relevance to the committee's task of assessing legislation for compatibility with human rights. The bill, the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (2014 Budget Measures No. 2) Bill 2014, seeks to amend various acts relating to social security, family assistance, veterans' entitlements and farm household support to make a number of changes to certain Australian government payments. The report says:


The committee previously sought the advice of the minister—


that is accurate—


as to whether the measures are compatible with these rights, noting that the statement of compatibility did not adequately identify and assess how potential limitations on the right to social security, the right to an adequate standard of living and the rights to quality and non-discrimination would be reasonable, necessary and proportionate in each case.


That is not a sin. Many government departments do not meet the statement of compatibility test in the first instance. That is not new to this government; it was a feature of the previous government. And Senator Moore is nodding her head in agreement! But this is the critical point: 


The further information provided by the minister in this case is an excellent model—


I did not hear that from either Senator Moore or Senator Siewert.


for the kind of detailed information and analysis required to assist the committee in its assessment of the human rights compatibility of legislation. This further information has allowed the committee to conclude that the measures are largely compatible with the right to social security and the right to an adequate standard of living, with identified limitations of rights being generally assessed as reasonable, necessary and proportionate in pursuit of a legitimate objective.


This is the other point that Senator Moore, Senator Siewert, The Australian, ACOSS and the Labor Party omitted from their coverage today. 


Significantly, out of the twelve matters raised by the committee in relation to measures in the bill, the committee has concluded that ten of these are compatible with human rights.


I do not know about you, Mr Acting Deputy President, but in my language that is a distinction. It is more than a pass; it is a distinction. But this is the critical point: in an effort to prosecute their argument, Labor, ACOSS and The Australian—I cannot believe I am saying it—decided to go for a half-truth, not the full truth. That is very disappointing. 



In the few moments available to me, let me say that it is not new for governments to suffer the ire of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, which speaks to its scrutiny value and its parliamentary value. I was just reflecting this morning: what other common, familiar issue was there last year or the year before? Of course, it was Labor's media reforms that fell foul of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Human Rights. They, deservedly, fell foul. I now read from a report in TheSydney Morning Herald:


Of particular concern to the committee—


that is, the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Human Rights—


is Labor's proposal to appoint a single person—the public interest media advocate—to oversee newspaper regulators and judge whether media ownership is ''in the public interest''.


''These bills appear to limit the right to freedom of expression and freedom of association,'' wrote the committee about the two bills that govern the self-regulation of newspapers.


It is true and I think that many Australians would be surprised to learn that there is a human right to an adequate standard of living and a human right to food and shelter, but the fact is that our country, under the stewardship of then Prime Minister Holt—and I might add, for the benefit of my National Party colleagues, also at the table was 'Black Jack' McEwen, the Deputy Prime Minister—rightly or wrongly, signed up to international treaties. It has a parliamentary committee to oversee them. It is doing good work, but Labor could not resist the temptation. I expect better from ACOSS, the Labor Party and The Australian.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (15:01):  I have some further information for Senator Collins in relation to a question she asked me on Thursday about the Melba Foundation. I can confirm to Senator Collins that I approved a grant of $275,000 to the classical recording charitable trust the Melba Foundation, on the basis of departmental advice. I can also inform Senator Collins that, in 2009-10, the Hon. Peter Garrett on the same basis approved a grant of $1 million to the Melba Foundation; in 2010-11, the Hon. Peter Garrett approved a grant of $750,000 to the Melba Foundation; and, in 2011-12, the Hon. Peter Garrett approved a grant of $500,000 to the Melba Foundation.

Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (15:02):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Defence (Senator Johnston) to questions without notice asked by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Wong) and Senator Conroy today relating to the manufacture of the next fleet of Australian submarines.


This matter really is not being given the respect it deserves in this chamber. I think that anybody who has visited South Australia or lived in, worked in or read about South Australia would realise how important this issue is, how widely held and deeply felt this issue is. There are plenty of Liberal supporters in South Australia—not a majority, I might add; not enough to get into government, but there are plenty of them there—and they view this decision by this minister and this government with clear disdain. This is not a decision which anyone in South Australia will support this government on. People may have a view of the budget, a view of the fiscal world, but they are very, very clear on the need to retain a manufacturing base in South Australia—retaining high quality, high skill, high-value jobs in South Australia. 


Let us put on the record some of the comments of a couple of those very solid Liberal contributors. Let us take the member for Hindmarsh, Mr Matt Williams. He has written to his Prime Minister exhorting him to make a different decision, imploring him to make a decision in the seat of Hindmarsh. Let us take our own good Senator Fawcett, who put out a press release as late as last week saying that he fully supports the design build—well, let us read it. Let us go straight to the source:


I am a strong advocate for building the next submarines in Australia.


My views in summary are:


We need a submarine that meets defence needs


The Collins experience has taught us that being able to maintain them is critical, and


The most cost effective way to get the submarine we need, and have the ability to maintain them, is to partner with an established submarine manufacturer to build the submarines in Australia.


That is not from the Labor side; that is from the Liberal side. Let us have a look at what the former leader of the Liberal Party in South Australia, the now Minister For Defence Industries as well as a number of other portfolios, who says very, very clearly what the situation is. Mr Martin Hamilton-Smith takes complete umbrage at this decision, saying:


'It beggars belief that any federal government would seriously consider spending up to $250 billion of Australian taxpayers' money on buying naval ships from overseas …


Mr Hamilton-Smith said there were 27,000 defence jobs in this state, including 3000 in ship building, and 'industry activity worth hundreds of billions of dollars over 30 years that hinge on this decision due in the coming year'.


Those are just a few comments, not from our side of the chamber, not from our side of politics—although I must say that Martin-Hamilton Smith is a very valued member of the Labor government in South Australia, which manages to convince the electorate and, I might say, the general population of the value of manufacturing to our state.


This crew opposite chased the automotive industry out of town. They chased Holden out of town. They basically said, 'Put you dollars down or get out.' Now they are making a similar sort of mistake on the long-term viability of manufacturing in South Australia, and it is absolutely criminal. It is a very, very bad, short-sighted view to have taken. Even the current leader of the Liberal Party in South Australia, the honourable Steve Marshall—he is not quite 'the Hon.' yet; he never made it, but he may one day—is out there castigating this decision, the mishandling of this. He is out there castigating this decision—the mishandling of this. What did Senator Johnston say? He said: 'We will be doing it. We will be building 12 submarines in Adelaide.' And then he said: 'We will be picking up, if we win the next election, the cudgels for this project as fast as we possibly can.' What did we see in question time today? (Time expired)

"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2014-09-30,"



Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Services) (15:07):  It was very clear from Minister Johnston's intervention today that the five or six years under Labor were characterised by absolutely no contracts and no obligations. It is hypocritical for Senator Gallacher to come to this place, stand here and berate us on this side after Labor's appalling legacy in this space. This is a government which will make decisions on naval matters and on defence matters. And we will make those decisions for the right reasons. It is vitally important that Defence acquisitions have to be made on the basis of Defence logic—not industry policy, not regional policy, but on the basis of sound Defence policy.


As Minister Johnston has said, we have not yet made a final decision on the design and the build of the next generation of Australian submarines. What we do know is that we will be having more submarines. The bulk of the work on this project will be centred around the South Australian shipyards to take advantage of the work that has been done in that area over many, many years. This, of course, is consistent with our pre-election commitment. Labor in government failed to make a vitally important decision in relation to submarines over the six years they were in government. It is important now that we move quickly to fill this capability gap, because, as the minister said, it is now a decision about avoiding a capability gap.


It was demonstrated very clearly by the minister in his answer to Senator Conroy that when he opened box SEA 1000 the box was absolutely empty. In fact, there were actually cobwebs. You sat on your hands for five or six years and did absolutely nothing about it. Now you are coming in here bleating and crying crocodile tears and indulging in what can only be described as absolutely hollow acts. For example, I want to quote the joint media release of my Liberal colleagues in South Australia.




Senator Conroy:
  Oh dear, how embarrassing.




Senator Fierravanti-Wells:
  You indulge in this hollow union pledge of promising to advocate that all naval ships and submarines are to be designed, built and maintained in Australia. This is meaningless, because we all know that in defence matters it is vitally important that we do work—and we have been working—with other countries for decades. The Collins class submarine was a Swedish design, by the company Kockums, with US combat systems by Rockwell and French power and propulsion by Jeumont Schneider. The Air Warfare Destroyer was based on a Spanish design by Navantia with combat systems manufactured by the US company Lockheed Martin. International collaboration has long been a feature of Defence matters.



Senator Conroy interjecting—




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  Senator Conroy, let me tell you that having spent many years married to Commander Wells, who was in the Navy for 35 years, I can say modestly that I do know something about defence matters. What we do know is your appalling legacy during the time that you were in government. We have stopped the defence cuts and have increased spending on Defence. Your period in government was one of the poorest for spending in defence. Under Labor defence spending as a share of GDP dropped to 1.56 per cent in the 2012-13 budget—which is the lowest since 1938. In 2012-13 Labor's 10.5 per cent cut to defence was the largest single cut since the Korean War. Immediately following on your 2009 white paper, Labor cut or deferred $16 billion from the defence budget out to 2016-17. (Time expired)

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2014-09-30,"



Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:12):  I rise to take note of these answers given by the Minister for Defence on submarines. I will very much enjoy taking the opportunity to set some facts on the table. I know Senator Birmingham wants to flee the chamber before he gets ousted as being the senior Liberal source in South Australia who says this government has completely mishandled the submarine issue in South Australia. 


Let me remind this place of the coalition's solemn promise to build 12 submarines in Adelaide. In May last year the now Defence minister stood outside the ASC in Adelaide and this is what he said:


We will deliver those submarines from right here at ASC in South Australia.


Standing right next to him was the South Australian Liberal leader and this is what he said immediately afterwards:


The State Liberals welcome the Coalition’s confirmation today that 12 submarines will be built in Adelaide under a Coalition Government.


A unity ticket! Senator Johnston and the leader of the opposition in South Australia guaranteeing everybody in South Australia that 12 subs were to be built in South Australia. So maybe, just maybe, that is why the state Liberal leader is so angry at the handling of this issue by his federal counterparts. That is right—Mr Steven Marshall was in the press yesterday blaming the defence minister's broken promise for a fall in his support in South Australia. The South Australian Liberal opposition leader, who happened to be standing next to Senator David Johnston outside the front gates, is blaming the federal government—Senator Johnston, Senator Abetz, and Senator Birmingham and all those other South Australian Liberal senators who have rolled over and abandoned employment and abandoned families in South Australia. A federal Liberal MP from South Australia told The Australian that the submarine issue had been handled 'very badly'. So your own MPs are coughing you all up. You have handled it very badly. What he means by that is: you have told a lie. You made a solemn promise to the people of South Australia in the lead-up to the election and you have broken it. 


This decision puts at risk thousands of jobs in South Australia and across the country. It also puts at risk our strategically vital submarine-building and shipbuilding industry. It is not just Labor who has warned about the dangers of this broken promise. As was mentioned earlier in question time, last year the former Chief of the Defence Force of Australia, our current Governor-General, Sir Peter Cosgrove, wrote that it would be a tragic loss to our country if we were to lose our submarine-building capability. Let me quote then General Cosgrove:


Whenever I am asked why we should build submarines in Australia, my short reply is that we can’t afford not to.


He concludes his article by saying:


Let’s use confidence and common sense and build the subs here.


There is a complete lack of common sense coming from the government on those issues. What we are seeing here is a complete capability gap and, more importantly, a credibility gap from the Minister for Defence, Senator Johnston. Every single submarine expert in this country is condemning this government's decision, for very good capability reasons. I invite those who are interested to listen this afternoon and evening to a Senate hearing into this very issue, where the country's top experts will explain exactly why this government is so deceitful.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2014-09-30,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (15:17):  Why do the Labor opposition keep giving us these opportunities? I just cannot believe it. It started the other day with an MPI from Senator Moore and it just gets better. Isn't it amazing what an expert Senator Conroy is in opposition? What an amazing expert in submarines he is in opposition. What a shame Senator Conroy did not say too much when he was a senior minister. As my leader just said, if there is a capability gap, I think it is between Senator Conroy's left ear and his right ear. Nevertheless, I think that jokes about a 'hunt for red October' will start to flow out. 


Isn't it also incredible that the now Leader of the Opposition, Mr Shorten, seemed to be very silent when he was a senior minister? Here he was on 7 September demanding that the government promise to keep building submarines in South Australia. Where was he when Mr Rudd was Prime Minister, when Ms Gillard was Prime Minister and when Mr Rudd was Prime Minister again? Where was he in keeping Mr Rudd up to his promise that, 'A Labor government would ensure the submarines were built by ASC at its Port Adelaide site, with construction to begin in 2017'? Where were you, Senator Conroy, when Mr Rudd ripped $20 billion out of the defence project? 


It is amazing that poor old Mr Shorten did not realise that his good mate Labor MP Mr David Feeney was going to be standing behind him at the great rally at ASC, because it was poor old David Feeney that belled the cat. At the rally he said, 'Australia's shipbuilding and submarine-building industry are now at the crossroads.' You bet they are at the crossroads. Who put them there? Who put them in the Conroy cul-de-sac? Who put them in the Feeney dead end? It was the Labor government of the day. They took $20 billion out of the submarine contract, with the complicit involvement of the South Australian Labor government. Don't forget that they were involved in this, Senator Conroy, while you turn your back to this discussion. They then turned around and took another $16 billion, much of which would have gone to the South Australian defence procurement and materiel organisation.


I turn to the comments made by Senator Johnston in response to the pathetic questions by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Wong, and her deputy, Senator Conroy. Senator Johnston indicated two things—firstly, his intimate knowledge of matters defence, particularly submarines. He was asked why he made certain observations and why he made certain others. The explanation, through you, Deputy President, to those in the public gallery, would be that when a responsible government leaves government you would expect there to be well-formed plans into the future for something as important as a procurement program for replacement of the Collins class submarine. You would expect that plan would be well formed, that it would be well developed and that it would be there for a new government to pick up and to carry on with, with or without modifications. When Senator Johnston, as defence minister, picked up that file, it was empty. Don't worry too much about the protestations of the people from the other side. I ask Senator Conroy and Senator Wong, a South Australian senator, a finance minister of the day: why were there no future plans for that gap in capability once the Collins class submarine was to be replaced? It was Senator Johnston who, in opposition, was so well versed in this portfolio that he was able to tell us here today the down time for the Australian Collins class submarine, the German submarine and the Japanese submarine. I think he said it was eight months for the Japanese, 11 months for the German and 18 months for the Collins class.


Whilst we move towards the white paper, let us not forget that the estimate for the cost of the replacement submarines, should they be built in Australia exclusively, is some $40 billion. The figures that I have seen—and I believe they are in the public arena—for German or Japanese submarines are half of that price. I defer again to my colleague Senator Fawcett, a man with an enormous amount of experience in this field, who has spoken of the fact that the Collins class submarine was initially designed by the Swedish and built with Swedish, US and French involvement. Senator Fawcett is very wisely saying that that type of process can work into the future for the benefit of Australia and South Australia. (Time expired)

"McEwen, Sen Anne",ALP,2014-09-30,"



Senator McEWEN
 (South Australia—Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:23):  I am very pleased to have the opportunity yet again to speak on the future submarine project, which is so important for my home state of South Australia. I thank Senators Wong and Conroy for asking questions about it again today.


We know that the government wants to break the promise that it made to South Australians before the 2013 federal election and again before the 2014 state election. That promise was to design, build and maintain the 12 new submarines in Adelaide, South Australia, at the Australian Submarine Corporation. We know that the Minister for Defence, Minister Johnston, has been sidelined in his own cabinet room in this debate because the bean counters are in control of defence capability in Australia, not the Minister for Defence and not the Department of Defence. This has become a matter of money when there are much more important issues at stake, including the security of our country. 


We know that the opposition leader in South Australia is truly despairing of the ineptitude and indecision of his federal counterparts because they are unable to commit to the promises made before the state election. Mr Steven Marshall is well aware that the future of shipbuilding and submarine building in South Australia is the single most important issue playing out in South Australia at the moment. He knows that his federal colleagues are about to sacrifice over 20,000 jobs in South Australia's defence sector and to thereby condemn South Australia to a future without the high-tech shipbuilding jobs that are so important. For over 25 years there has been bipartisan support to build up the shipbuilding industry in South Australia, and it will take this government—this Abbott government—probably a couple of years to destroy it.


Today, through questions asked by Senators Wong and Conroy, we heard that there are also concerns from experts, not only about the potential economic disaster for South Australia but also about the potential disaster for defence capability that this government seems to be hurtling towards with its decision to design and build the new submarines somewhere other than Australia. We know that Japan has been considered for that, and we know that Japanese experts in shipbuilding have already been secretly to South Australia to have a look at the Australian Submarine Corporation; and we understand that Australian representatives are currently, or have been, in Japan to investigate the situation there. We know that the government is contemplating purchasing a Japanese-designed and built submarine despite the fact that Australia can and should build and maintain its own future submarines. We heard today that the current Governor-General and former Chief of the Defence Force, Sir Peter Cosgrove, said:


To outsource this work would be to export hundreds of billions of dollars of work to supporting another country’s industry and jobs, rather than investing in our own.


General Cosgrove said that to outsource that work would be short-sighted. We certainly know that it is short-sighted.


As well today, we heard that two former submarine commanders and members of the Australian Navy—defence personnel who do know what they are talking about—have questioned this government's intended course of action. They have questioned whether that Japanese submarine will meet Australia's defence requirements in terms of the range that a submarine needs, the endurance a submarine needs when it is operating in Australia and around Australia's waters, and in terms of the capability of that submarine. Those gentlemen are experts when it comes to submarines. They are very concerned, as are we in the Labor Party, about the future of Australia's submarine capability. We know that submarine capability is absolutely integral to Australia's national security and it is the one thing that we should not be outsourcing, it is the one thing that we should not cede control of. We are capable, we are more than capable, of maintaining and keeping this industry in South Australia and in Australia. This is an industry that we cannot afford to lose. We need to have a long-term view about the future of defence capability in Australia and I am pleased that Labor senators are fighting very hard for submarine jobs in South Australia.

Senator LAZARUS
 (Queensland—Leader of the Palmer United Party in the Senate) (15:35):  Pursuant to contingent notice, I move:


That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent me moving a motion relating to the conduct of the business of the Senate—namely, a motion to give precedence to a motion circulated in the chamber to establish a select committee on certain aspects of Queensland government administration.


The Australian Constitution states that there must me a clear separation of powers between the parliament, the executive government and the judiciary in Australia. The separation of powers and functions ensures that no single body is able to exercise total authority or to misuse power. The system is considered to be one of the fundamental elements of a fair, democratic and honest government.


In my home state of Queensland our parliament consists of one house, the lower house. There is no upper house to provide the critical checks and balances needed for open representative and transparent governance in parliament. Over the last 18 months, serious issues have been raised across the community regarding Queensland government appointments, judicial appointments, project approvals, quarry approvals, use of funds, policies and practices, environmental degradation, and various other matters. In fact, on 9 September, at only a few minutes to midnight, the Queensland government moved a last-minute amendment to the Mineral and Energy Resources (Common Provisions) Bill 2014 to remove the rights of land owners to object to mining on their property.


The Commonwealth allocates significant funds to the state of Queensland, and Australian taxpayers need and deserve clarification in relation to the appropriate use of these funds by the Queensland government. I constantly receive many phone calls from Queensland residents who are crying on the phone and desperate for my help to stop the terrible things that are happening in my home state of Queensland.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  You should see what Newspoll says!

  Today, I am calling on the Senate to ensure that the people of Queensland are heard. This inquiry must happen. It must go on. The Commonwealth has an obligation to ensure that the funds supplied by the Commonwealth are being used for appropriate purposes. The select committee will consult with the Queensland community to undertake this assessment. I urge my colleagues to support my actions to ensure that the motion is considered by the Senate.

Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service and Minister for Employment) (15:38):  The government opposes this second attempt to breach the fundamental conventions that surround the Westminster system. The last time we debated this, which was just a few days ago, I pointed out what Odgers had to tell us on page 77 about the comity between parliaments and how singularly unwise it is for one parliament or one house of a parliament to seek to inquire into another.


I thought we had that debate and common-sense prevailed. Clearly, common-sense has not prevailed and we now are confronted with this, quite frankly, personal vendetta by the leader of the Palmer United Party to pursue Mr Newman, the Premier of Queensland. We heard from Senator Lazarus just then that there were concerns about judicial appointments in Queensland. Guess what? If you are concerned about it, run for the Queensland parliament. Use the Queensland parliament and its forums, because if you think that you can use the federal parliament's forums to overcome what you consider to be shortcomings in the Queensland parliament, guess what? The Queensland parliament can then start adopting exactly the same tactics against Palmer United, Senator Lazarus or anyone else.


Is this the way we want to trash our democracy? Democracy is a fragile flower. It does require convention, it does require precedent and it does require people to remain within their bailiwick. We could have a situation where technically you could have the Queensland parliament having resolutions about the Senate and then, when any senator arrives in Queensland, they could be picked up by the Queensland authorities and be brought before the bar of the Queensland parliament to answer questions. That is what can happen and that is the route we are going down.


Way back in 1996, this was attempted in relation to the Victorian parliament in relation to a casino licence. Common-sense finally prevailed and that inquiry, quite rightly, did not go ahead. I would have thought the lessons of history should be learnt. As I said last week, I can understand that the Palmer United Party is relatively new to this place and is not fully across all of the precedent and all of the practice. But I say to those colleagues opposite, especially from the Australian Labor Party, that you know the precedent and you know the embarrassment that you got yourselves into in 1996 with the Victorian casino inquiry. That went nowhere. Why? For exactly the reasons that will confront this inquiry.


Chances are, lawyers will make some money out of it and the High Court may well be entertained as well. I might add that Mr Newman, the Premier of Queensland, is doing an excellent job. If Newspoll is any guide, the people of Queensland are now saying that he in fact is doing a good job. As he has taken the tough decisions, the people of Queensland are now accepting what has occurred under that government as having been within their best interests.


When we start using one parliament to fight another parliament, we get into a territory that is singularly foolish and singularly designed to bring these institutions of parliament into disrepute. I do not lay that charge on Palmer United, because I am still willing to give them the benefit of the doubt; albeit that benefit is shrinking by the moment, given all that was said about this just last week. But those opposite in the Australian Labor Party know the folly of this move and they know that this should not be entertained.


Interestingly, when this motion failed last week there was a collective sigh of relief around this place, knowing that the right thing had been done by this parliament and its institutions. Now, one assumes that some dirty deals have been done behind the scenes, which allow this matter to be re-ventilated. It will be interesting to see if it is the Australian Greens or the Australian Labor Party who have done a backflip in relation to this. Whichever party it is, they have done a great disservice to this place. (Time expired)




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Mr President, I rise on a point of order. I am sorry, I do not have the standing order; but perhaps I could seek your assistance. This motion was dealt with just a week ago. This seems to me, on my very quick reading, to be exactly the same motion. Is it possible for senators to raise the same motion day after day?



The PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Macdonald. This is actually a procedural motion, so the provision of the standing order that you are correctly referring to does not apply to this particular aspect, which is a suspension motion.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Mr President, I rise on a further point of order. I was aware that this is a procedural motion. But what is the point of dealing with this if there is a provision in the standing orders—which in the back of my mind there is; I just cannot refer you to the actual standing order—that prevents this substantive motion from being dealt with. If that is the case, then the procedural motion is also irrelevant.



The PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Macdonald. It is standing order 86, for your reference. There have been rulings on this in the past, and Odgers does make mention of it. It indicates that this rule is rarely invoked—that is, the same question rule—simply because generally with the passage of time and changing circumstances it could happen that the same text could refer to a different question. Senator Macdonald, in this instance in relation to the suspension motion, it will not apply; but, post the suspension motion, that might be another question.

 (Victoria—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:45):  Mr President, could I indicate that the motion has actually been amended and is not in the same form as was debated last week. Can I turn to the arguments put forward by Senator Abetz. This is a government that has trampled on every single convention that you can imagine. It has called royal commissions to pursue its own nasty political vendettas. We have had a waste of taxpayers' money that will be over $100 million by the time they are all finished. We have had two royal commissions with no other purpose than to try to smear, abuse and vilify the former governments. This is a government that knows no decent bounds whatsoever. Do you want to know what the final arbiter of that decision would be? Even former Prime Minister John Howard has said, 'I wouldn't have called those royal commissions.' When Senator Abetz stands up here and talks about the decent and right thing to do—




Senator Brandis:
  Mr President, I rise on a point of order. The motion that we are debating is a motion to suspend standing orders to permit debate of a motion to establish a Senate inquiry on the terms circulated by the Palmer United Party. It has absolutely nothing to do with a royal commission that is currently in progress into the subject of trade union corruption. 



The PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Brandis. As is the general nature of suspension of standing orders, the debate does venture into the topic which the suspension of standing orders relates to. I allowed that with the previous speaker, and I will allow it with Senator Conroy. 




Senator CONROY:
  Thank you, Mr President. I thought Senator Abetz roamed widely in his particular contribution. He spoke extensively about what is the decent and right thing to do. Let us be clear: $100 million is being wasted by those opposite to pursue their political opponents. This is an absolute abuse of process. These royal commissions are nothing but a stunt. Senator Abetz said that we have a convention whereby we do not investigate each other's chambers. This is not an investigation of a chamber. This is an examination of the conduct of a government—not the chamber and not the institution of parliament in Queensland. It is looking at a thoroughly corrupt bunch of individuals in Queensland and their conduct behind the scenes. 




Senator Brandis:
  Mr President, I rise on a point of order. You cannot accuse members of another parliament of corruption.

They won a large majority. You would have thought, Mr President, that, after winning a large majority, you would not have to behave in the nasty and vindictive way in which that government has behaved. You have wiped out the opposition pretty much. You have only got the one chamber. You would have thought you could have behaved decently—yet, the Campbell Newman government has behaved anything but. This motion says, 'Let us have a law—




Senator O'Sullivan:
  Mr President, I rise on a point of order. It is one thing to have a debate in relation to what is happening here, but the point of order is that the senator continues to make aspersions against another government. Section 193(3) of the standing orders is very clear where it refers to imputations and personal reflections on those members of other houses. The standing orders refers to it in one of the only places it does as 'highly disorderly'. The senator should be reminded of the order and should abide by it. 



The PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator O'Sullivan. Senator Conroy, I did give you a warning on the previous point of order. You cannot reflect on the good character and reputation of another parliament or a member of another parliament. Senator Conroy, continue your remarks but be observant of the standing orders. 




Senator CONROY:
  Thank you, Mr President. I will confine my remarks to the conduct of the government as a whole rather than any individual to save you having to respond to total furphies from those opposite. The conduct of the Campbell Newman government is something that deserves scrutiny. In Queensland, where Sir Joe Bjelke-Petersen described press conferences as ’feeding the chooks', there is a long history of such behaviour by Queensland National Party members of parliament, and some of them went to jail. What we are seeing is the beginnings of the conduct highlighted by the terms of reference that are before us today. Those opposite are very sensitive—and they should be very sensitive! 



Government senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order on my right! 



Senator Brandis interjecting—




Senator CONROY:
  Oh dear! 



The PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Conroy, you have the call. 




Senator CONROY:
  Thank you, Mr President. We can see how sensitive a button you have touched, Senator Lazarus, with this motion. You can see just how sensitive the Queensland Liberal-National Party machine is. They will do anything. They will smear anybody. They will put up any furphy whatsoever to defend their mates in Queensland. 




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Mr President, I rise on a point of order. Senator Conroy has been here long enough to know the standing order that he must address his remarks through the chair and not direct to Senator Lazarus. 



The PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Macdonald. That is a technically correct point of order. Senator Conroy, you have the call. 




Senator CONROY:
  I have been guilty, Mr President. Senator Macdonald's strongest case in defence of his colleagues and mates in the Queensland Liberal-National Party is exactly that—that I was facing in the wrong direction. What a committee this is going to be! With strong, intellectual points of order like that, Senator Lazarus, you will have your hands full. Through you, Mr President: Senator Lazarus will have his hands full in dealing with this committee and the sort of raucous abuse, smear and innuendo that you have already seen from those opposite. We will see where this committee leads us. I indicate that the Labor opposition will be supporting this suspension.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2014-09-30,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (15:52):  To understand what a contemptible political stunt this is, you only have to remember that this is the very same motion, with just a tiny bit of cosmetic amendment, that seven days ago not a single senator was prepared to vote for—not one. Not the Labor Party, not the Palmer United Party, and the Greens voted against it—although apparently they have now stitched up a deal with Senator Conroy. But this is the same motion with a tiny cosmetic change to give it a simulacrum of credibility; the same motion that not one senator was prepared to vote for seven days ago. Of course, this is a stunt. We saw Mr Palmer, the member for Fairfax, in the back of the chamber a moment ago vigorously, heatedly negotiating with Senator Conroy and with the leader of the Australian Greens.


We look at the terms of the motion. This is a motion to establish a Senate committee, and, as every member of this Senate knows, the composition of Senate committees is broadly required by convention to reflect the political composition of the chamber. Do you know how many government senators will sit as members of this committee, Mr President? One government senator. There are 33 government senators of the 76 members of this chamber. So the Senate proposes to establish a committee of the Senate in which the government is represented by one senator. This is a breach of convention, as I pointed out in the debate on the equivalent motion last week, and probably a breach of the law. Do not take my word for it, Mr President; take the word of the illustrious former Clerk of the Senate, the late Harry Evans, who, when in 1996 a somewhat similar political tactic was tried but on a much narrower basis to examine one aspect alone of the Victorian government—that is, the Victorian racing inquiry—provided advice to the Senate in which he said that, as a matter of convention and probably as a matter of law, such a motion could not validly be passed by this chamber. In some advice to former Senator Kemp, dated 8 October 1996, the late Mr Evans summarised advice from Professor Dennis Pearce, an eminent public lawyer, who said this:


There is probably a legal barrier to the summoning of members of state parliaments … The Senate's powers of inquiry are probably limited to matters within the legislative competence of the Commonwealth Parliament.


Yet, if we go through the subparagraphs of paragraph 1, which set out the terms of reference in eight subparagraphs, most of them bear no relationship to the legislative powers of the Commonwealth parliament. He went on to say:


There is probably a limitation on those inquiry powers in relation to the states in so far as inquiries may not curtail the capacity of state governments to function.


Yet this motion goes to the heart of the legislative, the executive and the judicial arms of the Queensland government. He went on to say:


These probable legal limitations on the Senate's powers of inquiry would provide a basis for a legal challenge to any particular inquiry …


That is the advice given by the illustrious former Clerk, the late Harry Evans, based on, in turn, the legal and constitutional advice of one of Australia's greatest public lawyers, Professor Dennis Pearce. That was about a motion that went to one aspect of the operations of the Victorian government of the day, some 18 years ago. If that inquiry was unconventional, a breach of the Senate's conventions and practices, and, in Professor Pearce's views, probably unconstitutional, how much more unconstitutional is an inquiry that goes to the plenitude of the legislative, executive and judicial arms of the Queensland government? Senator Lazarus, you have been sold a pup. You have been sold a pup by the Labor Party and by the Greens. This motion is out of order, it is unlawful and it is a disgrace.

"Waters, Sen Larissa",AG,2014-09-30,"



Senator WATERS
 (Queensland) (15:57):  In Queensland it seems that we are back to the Joh Bjelke-Petersen days. Here we 'Joh' again. I have said before in this place—and, no doubt, I will have cause to say it again—that the Queensland government has been on a brutal agenda of attacking the environment, public servants and civil liberties in Queensland. We have seen thousands of public servants sacked. We have seen more than 20 environmental laws overturned and an agenda of infringements—if I can be so polite about it—about civil liberties for Queenslanders. There is clearly an urgent need to look into this brutal agenda, which is why the Greens are, and always have been, supporting this inquiry.


On those environmental changes that the Newman government has rolled out, sadly there has been an absolute denigration of the environmental laws. There has been a tax on the native vegetation laws in winding back protections for riparian vegetation and regrowth vegetation. There have been repeals of coastal protection laws which will damage the Great Barrier Reef in completely overturning our state planning policy for coastal areas. The Wild Rivers legislation has been repealed and overturned, particularly for Cape rivers. There has been a program to allow grazing in national parks, which are supposed to be for the conservation of nature, and logging in areas that had been earmarked to become national parks. Just this month, as I mentioned last week, the Queensland government passed a bill through the state parliament at three minutes to midnight removing public objection rights to the biggest mines in Queensland. That is the biggest step backwards that we have seen in community rights to protect the environment and to uphold the law in living memory. It is pretty clear that the Queensland government are trying to silence Queenslanders in favour of letting the big mining companies run absolutely riot. They consistently put the big mining companies ahead of the people of Queensland.


That is precisely why it makes no sense at all that this state government be given more responsibility for the environment and to in fact be given, as this government intends, the responsibility for environmental approvals that the current federal environment minister has. The Abbott government has been set on turning us back by 30 years in giving away its environmental powers completely to the Queensland and other state governments.



Senator Brandis interjecting—




Senator WATERS:
  It is the foreign affairs power, Senator Brandis. Please, you of all people should know your Constitution. I am pleased that we have had discussions with the Palmer United Party along those lines.



Senator O'Sullivan interjecting—




Senator Milne:
  Mr President, I rise on a point of order. My colleague is entitled to make her contribution and be respected. I would ask Senator O'Sullivan to stop his disorderly behaviour.



The PRESIDENT:  I ask senators on my right, in particular, to stop interjecting.




Senator WATERS:
  As I was saying, the appalling track record of the Newman government in Queensland on the environment is precisely why they should not be given more powers over the environment, and they specifically should not be given the federal environmental approval powers under the EPBC Act that this government is proposing to give them.


I am pleased that we have had discussions with the Palmer United Party along those lines. We have clearly put the position that, if the Newman government are so awful as to warrant an inquiry into their terrible track record, clearly they should not be given more powers over the environment. I am pleased that the Palmer United Party have agreed with that logical conclusion.


I am also pleased that we have been able to secure amendments to the terms of reference for this inquiry to clearly bring in both the appalling track record of the Newman government and the track record of Commonwealth oversight of coal seam gas approvals in Queensland, which have been a very vexed issue no matter which government has been in power. I am pleased that we will now be able to look at those issues.


I am also pleased that the terms of reference are broad enough to consider Mr Clive Palmer's environmental track record through his company in relation to the Yabulu nickel refinery on the shores of the Great Barrier Reef and the Galilee Basin coalmine.




Senator Brandis:
  Mr President, I rise on a point of order. I know you have already been addressed on the subject of standing order 86. As I understand your ruling, if standing orders are suspended then standing order 86 is also suspended and provides, therefore, no limitation on the capacity of the Senate to discuss the substantive motion. If I understood you correctly, that was your ruling before.



The PRESIDENT:  My ruling before was that we were dealing with a suspension motion and, as such, being a procedural motion, standing order 86 was not applicable because we were dealing purely with the suspension. When the suspension matter is resolved, if there are any other points of order in relation to other standing orders, I will be happy to entertain them then. But it is not applicable at the moment. Your point of order at the moment, Senator Brandis—




Senator Brandis:
  I have not made my point of order yet.



The PRESIDENT:  Okay, but your point of order should directly relate to the substance we are discussing now.




Senator Brandis:
  As a matter of fact, my point of order relates to the validity of this debate. The reason before I took the point of order I wanted to clarify the rationale for your ruling is that if standing orders were to be suspended, if this motion were to be put and carried, then there would be no capacity on the substantive motion to invoke the standing order under section 86. If that be the case then in circumstances such as these section 86 could never be invoked, so it becomes circular. For that reason, I am taking a different point of order now not in relation to the substantive motion but in relation to the procedural motion. Because, just as the substantive motion is substantially to the effect of the motion that was defeated last Tuesday prior to that motion coming on to be voted on, there was a procedural motion to suspend standing orders. My submission to you, Mr President, is that the motion which is now before the chair is identical to the motion that was decided on last week. Therefore, it is in fact at this stage of the debate that standing order 86 can be invoked. If standing order 86 cannot be invoked at this stage in the debate then it cannot be invoked at all because if this motion is put and carried then section 86 will be suspended. Obviously, that cannot be the intention of the standing orders because, were that so, section 86 could never be made effective or operative because by the device of moving a procedural motion a senator could always render it inapplicable. That is why I submit to you, sir, that it is on the procedural motion, in fact, that you ought to entertain a point of order that this debate itself is a violation of section 86, because the same question on substantially the same motion was put and determined last week.



The PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Brandis. Senator Milne, I am going to take advice, but I am happy for you to add directly to the point of order I understand Senator Brandis is lodging.




Senator Milne:
  I do want to comment on Senator Brandis's desperate move to prevent this vote being taken. I think it is pretty evident now why he never made it onto the short list of the Queensland bar association.



The PRESIDENT:  That is not a point of order.




Senator Milne:
  I want to say in relation to this matter—



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Milne, you are now deviating from a point of order by casting personal remarks against Senator Brandis. I will allow you to continue if your point of order is directly relevant to the point of order that has been raised by Senator Brandis.




Senator Milne:
  Mr President, the point at issue here is that there has been a move for a suspension of standing orders. That is a procedural matter that ought to be determined. Then the question might be raised as to whether it is the same question. And it is not the same in substance, because there is a substantially different amendment which has been added, and we will have that debate once the suspension of standing orders has been dealt with. You cannot stop a suspension of standing orders on the basis of something that may be determined at a later time.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  On the same point of order, Mr President, the motion that we dealt with a week ago, before we dealt with the substantive motion, was that so much of the standing orders would be set aside as would prevent Senator Lazarus from moving a motion relating to a particular three-page motion that he then proceeded to deal with. Senator Brandis's point, which I reinforce, is that this motion we are dealing with today—dealing with setting aside standing orders so that Senator Lazarus could in fact move this three-page motion, which would be incorporated into the Hansard record—is exactly the same motion and, for the reasons Senator Brandis gave, is exactly the reason by-law 86 provides.




Senator Fifield:
  Mr President, on the same point of order: the points raised by Senator Milne have a certain Alice in Wonderland quality to them. There is a circularity to the argument, which means that standing order 86 could never in fact be invoked; there would never in fact be the circumstances where it could be cited. We are not actually talking about something in the abstract here, because Senator Lazarus has in fact already circulated to the chamber the wording of the motion he seeks to move. So, we are not just talking about the suspension of standing orders in the abstract in order to allow Senator Lazarus to move a motion that we are unaware of the wording of. Senator Lazarus has circulated the motion in the chamber. He has made reference to it in his suspension motion. I would have thought that for the chamber to determine whether standing orders should or should not be suspended one of the very relevant considerations would in fact be the wording of the motion Senator Lazarus has circulated—which clearly, according to standing order 86, falls foul, because it is the same in substance as that moved last Tuesday. So, the only opportunity for yourself, Mr President, to form a ruling in relation to Senator Lazarus's substantive motion is now.



The PRESIDENT:  Senator O'Sullivan, I do not intend to take any further points of order in relation to this particular aspect. I have a clear direction as to where I am heading with this. I appreciate Senator Brandis's point of order and understand where he is coming from. And Senator Fifield in particular, in relation to your point of view, the actual substantive motion, if we get there—because there is yet to be probably two questions before the chair before we get to the substantive motion—I do not accept that argument. Standing order 86, Senator Brandis, can come into effect on any ordinary day of business. We have now just stepped out of the ordinary in relation to the same question or the same matter, because we have set aside what standing orders we need to. This is the motion—to set aside what standing orders we need to. We are debating that. It is a procedural motion. So, this procedural motion cannot be subjected to standing order 86. Otherwise we would have all sorts of problems with standing order 86 and suspension motions in their own right may not be able to be moved. So, I am ruling that there is no point of order, although I do understand and respect the point of order that has been raised. Senator Waters, we will come back to you. You have 35 seconds left in which you can continue your remarks.




Senator WATERS:
  As I was attempting to communicate—albeit it was a little difficult, with the noise in the chamber—clause 2 of the proposed terms of reference is clearly a new insertion, and that is precisely the clause that we will be able to use to look at the Commonwealth's oversight of coal seam gas in Queensland, which clearly has been inadequate and needs in my view to be much stronger. This will be a Senate inquiry, and it is clearly within the legislative competence of the federal parliament. It has been drafted to ensure that, and it is an inquiry that the Greens will support.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (16:12):  I thought it was too good to be true last week. I noted that Senator Milne was away from the parliament and that in her absence the more rational and less motivated members of the Greens political party—




Senator Milne:
  Mr President, a point of order: I did withdraw a remark that you deemed to be disrespectful, and I would ask that Senator Macdonald be required to withdraw a similar disrespectful remark.



The PRESIDENT:  I was just conferring with the Clerk, but, Senator Macdonald, if you did make a remark that you consider needs withdrawing, it would assist the chamber. In the absence of that, I have not heard any remark, Senator Milne, but I am happy to review it.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I am mystified as to what the remark is. I will start again, with the same words. I could not believe it last week when the Greens political party for once had some honesty and integrity. They did this during a time when Senator Milne—




Senator Moore:
  Mr President, a point of order: I have been refraining from being involved in this discussion around points of order, but I do think that Senator Macdonald now has clearly put an imputation of improper motives towards Senator Milne and the Greens party.



The PRESIDENT:  I did not take that from Senator Macdonald's remarks, and I was listening quite carefully in relation to the point of order Senator Milne had raised. I will let Senator Macdonald continue.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I just could not believe it when the Greens decided that if the motion Senator Lazarus moved last week was to be at all fair, it should not just look at a particular government; it should look at any recent government in Queensland. So Senator Abetz moved, and the Greens, much to my surprise, supported, an amendment that said that not only would we look at the current Queensland government but we would look at the previous one as well—the one that actually introduced coal seam gas mining into Queensland, the one that had the Tahitian prince ripping off millions of dollars and the one that had a cabinet minister sent to jail for bribery. 


Sure, go ahead and look at the Campbell Newman government! I, quite frankly, have no problem with looking into the Campbell Newman government, because it is an honest government that is full of integrity. But what we were looking forward to was using the inquiry to look into the actions of the Palmer United Party and Mr Clive Palmer—and the threats that he may or may not have made to the Deputy Premier of Queensland over whether or not there was a railway line to his mine. I am quite happy to look into that part of Campbell Newman's government, but what about the Labor Party government, the one with cabinet ministers actually in jail for bribery and with Tahitian princes ripping off $10 million? 


When the Greens supported Senator Abetz's amendment, I thought, 'At last the Greens, most of whom I know and most of whom I have great respect for, have seen sense and have agreed to include the rotten Bligh Labor administration.' I looked over and I thought, 'Why do the Greens have this new-found openness and accountability?' Then I noticed that Senator Milne was not there. Senator Milne is an effective operator on some occasions, some might say, but her pathological hatred for anything on our side of the parliament is known to every single person.


So we had this farcical situation last week where the majority of the Greens said, 'Okay, let's have an inquiry, but let's bring in the government that actually introduced coal seam gas mining into Queensland.' Perhaps there were some dirty deals there, perhaps done with my namesake, the Labor minister Ian Macdonald from New South Wales, who used to hand out mining leases with his morning tea to all his mates in the union movement. I thought, 'Well, that's fair enough; let's have a look at the Bligh government as well as the Newman government.' But then the penny dropped and the Labor Party suddenly realised that a motion that they had been planning to support was now going to expose the Bligh Labor government to real accountability. 


Now we have this farcical situation. The substance of the motion being proposed is exactly the same as the last one. It is all about Mr Palmer's hatred of Mr Campbell Newman. That is the substance of it. You can add all the little words you like. If Senator Waters says that this is a new issue, I am sure she will want to include the Labor government again, because—I repeat—it was the Labor government that introduced coal seam gas mining into Queensland, the coal seam gas mining that Senator Waters is so concerned about. As I mentioned last week, this makes a farce of the whole parliamentary system. I cannot believe that the more sensible and rational people in the Labor Party are going along with this farcical, fraudulent situation.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that the motion moved by Senator Lazarus to suspend standing orders in order for him to move a motion be agreed to.

(ii) the Prime Minister, Mr Tony Abbott, has previously won the same award in 2002, 2010 and 2011,

Peter Dutton MP


Tony Burke MP


Barnaby Joyce MP

(iv) sexism undermines efforts to achieve gender equality and as Ms Emma Watson said in her address to the United Nations recently, 'Men—I would like to take this opportunity to extend your formal invitation. Gender equality is your issue too'; and

  This motion is frivolous and demeaning of the needs of women and is expressed in a collage of confused words that fail to advance the cause of gender equality which we in this parliament should all be committed to. The motion is another stark illustration of the underwhelming level of debate that the Greens and their craving for media attention bring to this place. I am sure that those who support and work hard to advance the cause of gender equality would support the view that Senator Waters would achieve more in the quest and make a greater contribution to the cause of gender equality if she spent as much time fighting for and supporting the gender equality cause as she does drafting notices of motion that make no discernible difference whatsoever to the lives of Australian women. Clearly the women of Australia are entitled to expect more from the Greens and in particular Senator Waters. However, I do not expect they will get it.

Senator KETTER
 (Queensland) (17:53):  Thank you very much, Mr Acting Deputy President. I am very pleased to make a contribution in respect of this MPI relating to the failure of this government to address multinational tax integrity whilst attacking the living standards of pensioners, students and young job seekers. Of course, the premise of the MPI is the fact that we have a government based on broken promises and twisted priorities. There is nothing more evident in that in relation to this propensity of the government to attack the living standards of pensioners, students and young job seekers whilst, at the same time, leaving the big end of town alone and with various tax arrangements which need to be looked at.


We have a government that last year claimed that there was a budget emergency. You would think that a government that really believed that would do everything in its power to improve its revenue streams, but of course what we see is, in fact, the attacks on pensioners, the unemployed and students. We know that the government has moved away from that rhetoric of a budget emergency. I note that recently in New Zealand the Treasurer admitted that there was, in fact, nothing wrong with the Australian economy. As everybody here knows, Australia has a relatively low international debt and the growth rate of the Australian economy is amongst some of the best in the world. It is perverse that we have a Treasurer who uses the terminology of 'lifters' and 'leaners'. What the government is doing in this regard—or, more precisely, what they are not doing—is they are giving the leaners a head start by going too slow on tax reform. A 2013 paper by the Treasury titled 'Implications of the modern global economy for the taxation of multinational enterprises' states:


As chair of the G20 in 2014, Australia can have a prominent role in determining and driving this reform agenda.


As chair of the G20, Australia should be leading from the front, and it is time for Mr Hockey to step up to the plate. Empty talk will not cut it for tackling multinational tax. There is a significant gap between this government's rhetoric and its actions when it comes to ensuring that multinationals pay their fair share of tax within Australia. I draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that the previous Labor government did make an attempt to address this particular issue. I refer to the Tax Laws Amendment (Countering Tax Avoidance and Multinational Profit Shifting) Bill 2013. When given the opportunity, the members of the coalition did not support this attempt by the previous Labor government to address this issue.


It simply is not fair that major Australian companies operating internationally can shirk their tax responsibilities. Companies that earn profits in Australia must pay tax in Australia. I think people on all sides in this place would accept that basic principle. Multinational tax avoidance leaves small businesses and everyday Australians to pick up the slack of paying for government services. Major companies benefit from Australia's highly educated workforce, our extensive road, rail and port infrastructure, our secure energy supply and our willingness to attract investment. It is reasonable that those companies should also make a fair contribution to the tax base, which funds those things. Unfair tax arrangements advantage large multinational companies over domestic Australian companies. This is unproductive, inefficient and unfair.


Labor has a proud record of reducing multinational tax avoidance. When in office, Labor introduced key reforms that would have prevented $5 billion in revenue from being moved offshore. Unfortunately, the government is not fully implementing these measures and this is costing the budget over $1.1 billion. I, again, refer to the bill from 2013 that I mentioned previously, and when addressing that bill, the current Treasurer said:




We really must start this debate by asking whether these amendments are required at all.



He went on to call measures in the bill:




…


an unnecessary overreaction. More red tape for business


…



In addition, I note the contribution by Senator Cormann in relation to that same bill. He said:




…


we do not support Labor Party knee-jerk overreactions in the face of yet another desperate attempt to raid more cash to feed its spending addiction


…



Senator Cormann went on to attack the ATO on behalf of big business. In extraordinary comments, he said:




There can be a large disconnect between the way business is properly conducted and the way the government, in particular the Australian Taxation Office, would require business to be conducted—because, quite frankly, the Treasury and the tax office invariably do not understand how business actually legitimately operates.



I wonder if the finance minister still has the view that Treasury and the ATO do not understand how business operates—that is an extraordinary statement.


I note a recent report released by the Tax Justice Network found that, overall, the effective tax rate of ASX 200 companies over the last decade was 23 per cent. If these companies had paid at the statutory rate of 30 per cent, this would have produced an additional $8.4 billion in corporate tax annually. Despite this, the Treasurer has been all bluff and bluster on cracking down on multinational tax avoidance. He boasts that by committing to a 2017 start date for the common reporting standard on banking information, Australia is moving towards better financial transparency. What he did not say was that his proposed timetable lags behind the early adopter group of nations like the United Kingdom, Argentina, France, Germany, India, Italy and Mexico. Despite his bold rhetoric, the Treasurer's timetable puts Australia behind over 40 other countries. The Treasurer is all talk and no action.


These are not fringe issues. As The Age reported on 6 September this year:


There is stark evidence that Australia's corporate tax base is being eroded, with the burden of revenue falling increasingly heavily on individuals. The proportion of income tax collected from business in Australia has shrunk over the past five years, falling from 23 per cent in 2007-08 to 19 per cent in 2012-13 according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. At the same time, the proportion of income tax collected from individuals rose from 37 per cent to 39 per cent.


But it is not only our own tax revenues which benefit from a more transparent and fair tax system. As the Micah Challenge state in their submission to the earlier mentioned Treasury inquiry:


Australia's stance on tax law, policy and international arrangements around tax also have a clear connection to the capacity of governments in developing countries to secure sufficient and sustainable sources of financing for development. Pressing for reform on the international tax system also has the potential to build and strengthen norms of transparency and accountability among and between governments, citizens and business- particularly multinational enterprises.



In March this year, the tax office announced it was investigating 86 major international firms for allegedly shifting profits offshore. It is estimated the combined cost of these schemes is more than a billion dollars a year in lost tax revenue. The government is in need of doing something about this issue. Hollow rhetoric will not suffice. The government is making up for its inaction through cuts to essential services and programs that support the most disadvantaged in our country. And the budget also shows the government would prefer to take revenue— (Time expired)

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2014-09-30,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (18:03):  What a pleasure to follow Senator Ketter in this debate. From the sounds of his measured, moderate contribution to this debate, I look forward to more debates. Senator Ketter, the time when the Labor Party could lecture anyone on budget superiority, on budget certainty, on budget balancing will be the day hell freezes over. For the Labor Party to try to lecture anyone on budget matters is just so amusing that I really cannot take you as being serious. You have no doubt been left with the motion and you have done your best to prosecute it.


Mr Rudd, you might remember—long before your time so I do not blame you for overlooking these things—had the 2020 Summit.




Senator O'Sullivan:
  Was that Rudd 1 or Rudd 2?




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  This was Rudd 1. There were all these fine ideals about tax reform and a huge very expensive two- or three-day talkfest. We had the Henry tax review as a result of it. The Henry tax review took hundreds of days and hundreds of thousands of dollars and came up with a set of suggestions. The then Labor government completely ignored all but one or two of them. The only one it picked up it seemed was an abortion of the MRRT. That then turned out to be such a mess that in the end every Australian understood that it was a useless tax that was costing more to collect than it was actually collecting.


You will remember Mr Swan promising every year that he would get a surplus. It never appeared. Nobody ever expected it would. I think not even Mr Rudd or Ms Gillard themselves ever believed his or her Treasurer when he indicated he was going to bring in a surplus. So, as I say, let the Labor Party lecturing on tax is a non sequitur. I could go through a whole series of examples but time does not permit that and they are all well known.


Your motion talks about attacking the living standards of pensioners, students and young jobseekers. The biggest attack on the living standards of pensioners, students and jobseekers was paying $33 million each and every day to foreign lenders on money that the Labor government had borrowed. That in itself adds to the cost of living. It means that living standards that could be paid for with that $33 million a day were not being paid and it meant that we had to introduce the difficult and very stringent budget that we see today.


This concern about international tax is something that we on this side have been looking at for some time. And I pay credit to my colleague Senator Bill Heffernan, who, for years, has been talking about the way big multinational companies do not pay their fair share of tax and about how they enter into schemes where the tax, if any, is paid overseas in countries which have a lower tax rate than Australia.


Before I hear further pious words of the Greens and the Labor Party, could I ask either of them why they did not support my motion a couple of months ago for the Paid Parental Leave scheme to be deferred until later and for the money being collected from companies to fund that scheme to be put into addressing the bottom line of the budget? Did the Greens give any support to that? I heard them rabbiting on in question time today about the tax that multinationals pay. But when they had the opportunity to do something about it a couple of months ago in this chamber they were absolutely dead silent. They would not even cross the floor to help me in supporting the proposal that the additional tax collected from companies be diverted to paying off Labor's budget black hole.


Again, as is typical with the Greens, it is all hypocrisy: say one thing, do another. It is so typical of the Greens. They are all about free speech and yet when an issue comes up and an inquiry is undertaken by this chamber—improperly set out, I would suggest, and one that I am sure will nevertheless be overturned in the High Court—how many of the 33 government senators do the Greens give the opportunity to to participate in that inquiry? Just one. How many from the Labor Party, with 25 senators? Two. And how many from PUP, with three senators? One. And the chairman, on a big salary. This is the Greens hypocrisy. It just demonstrates, time and time again, why you cannot believe, trust or even try to negotiate with the Greens. 


In relation to that Queensland motion, Greens' leader Senator Milne was out of the chamber and the rest of the Greens agreed to include the Labor Party in that particular inquiry. I could not believe my ears. I thought that all the things I had been saying about the Greens for 24 years had been wrong. But I was right. You simply cannot believe the Greens. Senator Milne came back to lead the Greens political party. The sensible compromise that had been negotiated by the Greens Whip and a couple of sensible people in the Greens political party was overthrown by the leader and the leader went back to take out her absolutely pathological hatred of anyone who is not on the Left side of politics.


So whether it is on this matter of multinational tax integrity or whether it is on a matter of inquiring into other governments or preventing senators from having their say, the Greens are just full of hypocrisy. Not only do they vote to set up this committee, which does not stand any test of fairness or propriety but, more than that, the Greens cut off debate.


When Labor was in government and the Greens were their lackeys, supporting them all the way, we had so many guillotines and gags on debate that we lost count. But we thought that, with the change of government, perhaps there will not be quite so many gags, guillotines and restriction of debate moved by the government and  there has not been. I think it has only happened once, as opposed to 400 or 500 times under the Labor-Greens regime. But today we have Labor and the Greens, again, joining together for another couple of gags. And this is the Greens political party, which will go out there and tell all their followers, 'We're all in favour of free speech and accountability.' Have a look at this dodgy committee which has just been set up! Accountability? With two Labor members, one Green, one Palmer United and just one government senator. Accountability simply goes out of the door when it applies to the Greens political party. The idea of everyone having their say, everyone having the ability to play their part in this chamber and fully discuss matters, again, goes out of the door when the Greens political party join with Labor to curtail debate.


In the few seconds left to me, can I just congratulate Joe Hockey, a fabulous Treasurer. He has done an excruciatingly good job in trying to correct Labor's mess. I remind anyone who might be listening to this debate that Labor, in six short years, left a debt approaching $600 billion for every Australian, paying their share of $33 million each and every day—I repeat, each and every day—to pay off Labor's debt to foreign lenders. That is the sort of tax mess that Mr Hockey has had to address. He is doing a wonderful job and I wish him every support in his ongoing job of fixing Labor's mess. (Time expired)

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2014-09-30,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (18:13):  We have an opportunity in parliament this afternoon during this matter of public importance debate to debate a $1 trillion scandal around the world. What did the taxpayer get from Senator Macdonald in the last 10 minutes? Verbal vomit and tripe. This issue is not going to be swept under the carpet, through you, Chair, to Senator Macdonald. Australia has to take on corporate tax avoidance. We have to do it with the rest of the world. It has been reported that, globally, more than $20 trillion in tax is avoided and put into tax havens. Tax avoidance in Australia has been outlined in a comprehensive report that was referred to by Senator Milne in question time today, compiled by the Tax Justice Network. This network, working in collaboration with a large number of stakeholders, has looked at Australia's specific circumstances and it has come up with a figure of at least $8.4 billion in lost tax through multinationals each year.


We have tax avoidance problems with individuals, which the tax department is tackling through an amnesty. On the same hand, we have cuts to the tax department—savage cuts to staff, savage cuts to resources. When we know that $1 invested in forensic work to chase tax cheats is going to pay a good dividend to the Australian voter, to Australian citizens, we are cutting resources to the tax department. Let us hope the amnesty works. I will certainly look forward to asking more questions about that at upcoming Senate estimates—as will other senators. 


What I am really interested in is this question of tax avoided in Australia. We have an estimate from a study here today, but what is the government's—Treasury's—own estimate of tax avoided in this country in recent years? Are we confident that we are tackling this problem properly? Can we confidently say in forward estimates that we are going to bring in billions of dollars of revenue—billions of dollars that are desperately needed to pay the bills?


It was interesting listening to Senator Macdonald, because he obviously has no understanding at all of the history of this country. Since Federation, this country has run current account deficits. Anyone who understands economics would know that current accounts include government spending. Current account deficits mean that we always borrow, in the private sector and in the government sector. We have always borrowed from overseas, since Federation. 


I do not hear anyone talking about the interest on the borrowings that we have, and have always had, in the private sector. All we hear is this same mantra of the daily interest rate bill. If that money is being spent productively—being invested into our communities, our schools, our social welfare systems and the networks that help people get up and running when they need that help—then that is a good, productive investment in our country. And it will be paid back.


We get a very limited level of economic debate from that side of the chamber because that is what suits their propaganda. I will be very interested to know what the government is forecasting in terms of revenue from stronger action on tax minimisation. What is this tax minimisation? At a corporate level it is often referred to as 'profit shifting' or 'base erosion' and 'transfer pricing'. Essentially they are pretty similar concepts. It is when multinational corporations plan or put in place a planning process to allocate costs and revenues to different locations to reduce their tax liability. 


As outlined in the report Who pays for our commonwealth? tackling corporate tax avoidance is an urgent priority. We see very high gearing ratios amongst the ASX 200, which means that they have high debt levels; and there are issues with interest repayments, which are tax deductible; and it is a good way of avoiding tax. I will get to the point in a minute that, unfortunately, these things are legal. There are loopholes in tax systems all around the world because we do not have harmonisation between countries that have the same tax systems. This allows multinational corporations to exploit different tax rules in different countries and get away with it.  So, apart from the fact that we have to take a much stronger stance and crack down on tax avoidance or tax dodging, we also need to look at how we change the rules, both here and globally, to tighten up what is essentially an unfair avoidance of tax by multinationals. 


Here are a couple of conclusions from the report that I referred to earlier. Within the ASX 200 companies, nearly one-third have an average effective tax rate of 10 per cent or less; 57 per cent disclose subsidiaries in secret jurisdictions, which are also commonly referred to as tax havens; and 60 per cent report debt-to-equity levels, as I mentioned—high, but in this case over 75 per cent, which artificially reduce taxable profits.


We recently raised this issue at the G20; our Treasurer raised this issue. It has been around for years; tax dodging by multinational corporations has been discussed in parliament and in media circles for decades. Now we are finally getting around to being part of a global cooperative effort to do something about it. But if you read the media there is a lot of cynicism that anything is going to get done. 


Information sharing is great—it is a good start—but there is a lot more that could be done to avoid tax-dodging and tax minimisation, which essentially is a legal way that multinationals avoid paying tax in their country. But we all agree on one thing. The communique released after the G20 meeting in Cairns last week said: 'Profits should be taxed where economic activities deriving the profits are performed and where value is created.' 




Senator Williams:
  I agree with that.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  Good. In this case, we hear stories about companies that do not pay any tax in this country—for example, James Hardie, Westfield Retail Property Trust, large mining companies, 21st Century Fox—we have some really clear examples of companies that are very large players in the Australian landscape who are not paying tax. If it is true that we are in a budget emergency—although I note that that rhetoric has been toned down considerably in the last six months—if it is logical that we need more revenue, and I think we do, we can raise revenue through a fixed mining tax and through a price on carbon. That would be tens of billions of dollars that we could spend not just on investment but on the most needy in our country; providing that safety net of social security and health that we desperately need in this country. I think that in itself is a good investment in our people. This is not all about businesses; it is not all about infrastructure; it is about people. People are the key ingredient.


The Greens moved over the weekend to have an inquiry—which I certainly hope we will be able to get tripartisan support for—to look at this issue of tax minimisation and tax avoidance and give certainty to stakeholders in this country. When I say 'stakeholders', I am talking about hundreds of different organisations—church groups, unions, social welfare groups et cetera—who want to see this issue fixed once and for all. They want to see real action by our government to crack down on tax dodging in Australia.


It is not going to be easy. You can do it in one country, but it really needs to be done in multiple countries for it to be effective. Why is that? Senator Williams, it is because we are dealing with multinational companies—that is, they have jurisdictions in more than one country. That allows them to do the types of profit shifting and transfer pricing arrangements that I highlighted. If we do not have cooperation from other countries, we will not succeed in this endeavour—and that needs leadership. Like we took leadership on climate change—and then it was ripped down by the coalition government—we need to take global leadership on this issue. The Micah Challenge, the Oaktree Foundation and all the stakeholders are saying to us, 'Get out there and take a global leadership role and let's get this done.'

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2014-09-30,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (18:23):  I recently spoke on the matter of multinational tax avoidance during the adjournment debate, and I rise today to do so again. All countries need strong measures and strong cooperation to ensure that multinational companies pay their fair share of tax. When multinationals do not pay their fair share, it falls to others to pick up the tab. The tax burden shifts to ordinary workers and small business owners, and it creates an uneven playing field where small businesses are competing with large multinationals who gain a competitive advantage by paying less tax. This is fundamentally unfair.


During my adjournment speech I mentioned the campaign being run by the Tax Justice Network to eliminate multinational tax avoidance. I gave an example of a poor worker in Zambia who paid more absolute tax than a multinational company in the same country and the same industry. Australia owes it to everyday Australians who pay their fair share of tax to effectively combat multinational tax avoidance. But we also owe it to the world's poor to be part of the global effort against multinational tax avoidance.


I mentioned the Tax Justice Network earlier. Recently they released a report which showed that the ASX 200 companies—the top 200 companies in Australia—had an effective tax rate of 23 per cent. This is despite Australia having a corporate tax rate of 30 per cent. Had these companies paid an effective rate of 30 per cent, they would have provided Australia with an extra $8.4 billion in corporate tax revenue every year. The 23 per cent rate was the total across all the ASX 200 companies. In fact, a third of these companies were paying 10 per cent or less in corporate tax and 14 per cent of these companies paid no tax at all. The report also found that 57 per cent of those companies had subsidiaries in what is labelled 'secrecy jurisdictions' or jurisdictions with low financial transparency.


We live in an increasingly globalised and digital world, where commercial transactions are taking place across national borders in larger and larger volumes. Multinational companies use clever and complex schemes to shift their profits from high-taxing to low-taxing jurisdictions to minimise the amount of tax they pay. So, when it comes to combating multinational tax avoidance, we need to be ahead of the game. We need to be moving forward, not backward. And we need to ensure that profits earned in Australia are taxed in Australia. We owe it to all the Australian workers and small businesses who, unlike multinational companies, have no choice but to pay tax in Australia on all of their taxable income.


Labor has a proud record of combating multinational tax avoidance; introducing reforms in government which prevented $5 billion in revenue being moved offshore. Sadly, the Abbott government are refusing to fully implement these measures, a decision which is costing the budget $1.1 billion. In other words, instead of building on Labor's reforms, this government are actually moving backwards.


One of the measures the government are trying to dump is Labor's tax transparency reforms. Labor in government introduced measures which required companies earning over $100 million a year to disclose their total income, taxable, income and tax paid. However, the Abbott government want to repeal this measure. The government are also not proceeding with reforms announced by Labor to tighten the offshore banking unit regime, nor is it proceeding with the changes to reporting for multiple entry consolidated groups. The government are continuing the poor record on multinational tax avoidance that they had in opposition, where they voted against the previous Labor government's legislation to plug loopholes in Australia's transfer pricing rules and anti-avoidance provisions, and to crack down on companies overvaluing assets in international transactions.


While going backwards on multinational tax integrity, the Abbott government are also making savage cuts to the Australian Taxation Office, which will make it more difficult to pursue multinational companies for tax compliance. The government announced in this year's budget that they are cutting 4,700 staff from the tax office, leaving them underpowered to investigate the tax compliance of large multinational companies. The ATO announced in March this year that they are investigating 86 major international firms for allegedly shifting their profits offshore. The Commissioner of Taxation has said that every dollar invested in ATO staff generates between one and six dollars of revenue. Remarkably, the Abbott government's budget cuts to the ATO will therefore end up costing Australia more revenue than they save.


The upcoming G20 meeting in Brisbane, and Australia's presidency of the G20, has the potential to be an opportunity for Australia to take a leadership role on multinational tax avoidance. Instead, we have a Treasurer who is boasting that Australia is moving towards better financial transparency by committing to a 2017 start date for the common reporting standard on banking information. This is in contrast to nations like the United Kingdom, Argentina, France, Germany, India, Italy and Mexico, who are early adopters of the standard. In fact, Mr Hockey's timetable puts Australia behind 40 other countries. Mr Hockey, the Treasurer, is all bluff and bluster about seriously addressing multinational tax avoidance. If he is serious about the problem then he needs to tell the Australian people not only what his plans are but also how much revenue they will add to the bottom line. So far the only changes the government has made to Australia's multinational tax regime which affect the budget bottom line are ones which have resulted in less—not more—revenue. As I said before, together these measures add up to $1.1 billion in revenue. It is absolutely galling that a government which uses a 'budget emergency' to justify slugging everyday Australians $7 every time they visit their GP, to justify cutting pensions and family payments and to justify forcing job seekers to live on nothing but fresh air for six months, would let multinational companies off paying their fair share of tax to the tune of $1.1 billion.


If there is a real budget emergency, then why would this government not proceed with Labor's sensible reforms to make multinational companies pay their fair share of tax? Why would they forgo over a billion dollars in revenue? Is this the 'great global leadership' to which Senator Cormann was referring during question time today? The answer is simple—there is no budget emergency. We had this confirmed just two weeks ago by 63 of Australia's leading economists. 


The coalition's actions since coming to government deny their rhetoric about a budget emergency. After all, this is the party which decried debt and deficit in opposition, yet soon after coming to government they doubled the deficit and substantially blew out the timetable for achieving a budget surplus. If Australia is truly experiencing a budget emergency, surely it makes sense to tighten the rules to clamp down on multinational tax avoidance, not to relax them.


The manufactured budget emergency is just an excuse, a cover, for the Abbott government's real agenda. That agenda is to help the big end of town at the expense of struggling Australians. Of course they will deny it, but the evidence speaks volumes. At the same time as this government's cruel and unfair budget makes savage cuts to vital government services and to assistance for small businesses and struggling Australians, the government is doling out gifts and tax breaks to the big end of town. This is the government which is giving a tax break to billionaire miners, this is the government which is writing out $50,000 cheques to millionaire mums, this is the government which is giving generous tax breaks to 15,000 of Australia's wealthiest superannuation account holders, and, as we have heard in this debate, this is the government which is giving multinational companies a $1.1 billion tax break instead of working to make them pay their fair share of tax.


These are the actions of a government which has its priorities all wrong, a government which would rather cut income from pensioners and families and tax sick Australians than make sure some of Australia's largest companies pay their fair share of tax. These are the actions of a government which puts the interests of its wealthy mates in big business ahead of struggling small business owners and vulnerable Australians. It is time for this government to get serious about multinational tax avoidance and work to close tax loopholes, not relax them. As I said, when multinationals do not pay their fair share, it falls to others to pick up the tab. The tax burden shifts to ordinary workers and to small business owners. It creates a very unlevel playing field when small businesses are competing with large multinationals who gain a competitive advantage by paying less tax. It is high time this government got serious about multinational tax avoidance. (Time expired)

Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales) (18:33):  I find it amazing that those opposite would want to talk about tax. It is just amazing. Let us have a look at your record.



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator WILLIAMS:
  We are getting a bit of a reaction! I must have touched a nerve. Let us look at your record of budgets and tax and income and expenditure. The last time you delivered a budget surplus, Senator Dastyari was six years old. There has been a lot of water under the bridge since then. 


Let us have a look at the record. I want to take you to fuel excise. When the Hawke-Keating government was elected in 1983, the tax on fuel was 6.3c a litre. When they left in 1996, that had grown to 34c a litre—6.3c to 34c. It was the Howard government that froze that excise at 38c. It grew from 34c to 38c and then it was frozen in 1999-2000. Yes, we want to bring indexation back now to fix our roads. That is why I support it—to fix our roads.



Senator Bilyk interjecting—




Senator WILLIAMS:
  Mr Rudd promised no new taxes. I wonder if Senator Bilyk can remember the luxury car tax. Do you remember the luxury car tax? There were to be no new taxes! That did a great job for Holden, didn't it? That really helped Holden get on their feet! Because someone worked hard and could afford an up-market car—let's tax that! Then there was the alcopops tax. That was going to solve all the problems of binge drinking. 


Then Prime Minister Rudd, I think it was—it was hard to keep track of the Prime Minister in the previous government; it was hard to know who was Prime Minister at any time—gave us the superprofits tax. That was going to generate all the revenue. Then Prime Minister Gillard was going to solve all the problems with that tax by bringing in a minerals resource rent tax. She did exactly that. She spent $16 billion, but the tax did not raise any money—a total of about $300 million over the years. Then there was the carbon tax, the carbon tax we were never going to have. It did absolutely nothing to reduce CO2 emissions in Australia. 


I do not think there would be one senator in this chamber who would not agree that, if you make money in this country, you should pay the tax in this country. That is fair. Life is about fairness and that is a fair way to be. We are well aware of the issue. My colleague Senator Heffernan has been pushing this barrow for a fair while, I can assure you. If you make the money here, you pay the tax here. We know about Google—why they are set up in Ireland—and we know about many of those other big companies, such as Apple. We know they are avoiding paying their share of tax. 


But I want to point out Labor's record on tax reform. It really is embarrassing. Do you remember former Prime Minister Rudd holding his 2020 summit? He invited the talented and the opinionated. He got out the butcher's paper and came up with his thought bubble on tax reform—the Henry tax review. We heard all about the Henry tax review. So important was the Henry review that Labor did not release it until just before the budget in 2010—even though it had been given to Treasurer Wayne Swan in December 2009. Why was it not made public? What were they hiding? This is their history on tax reform. What came out of the Henry tax review? As I said, the resource super profits tax, which was expected to raise $49.5 billion over five years. Yes—$49.5 billion—an academic's tax with little thought for practical consequences. In July 2010, the resource super profits tax proposal was replaced with the minerals resource rent tax—another complex tax, and I have mentioned the figures on that. The original MRRT estimate was that it would raise $10.5 billion in its first two years to July 2014. In fact, just $340 million was raised in net terms in that period—less than $20 per Australian.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  Have you got any figures there on cost shifting?




Senator WILLIAMS:
  I will get on to cost shifting, Senator Whish-Wilson, and I will get on to transfer pricing. I will take your interjection. That is why I do not like transfer pricing one bit, especially when it comes to countries and governments buying our farms, growing the food and taking it back to their country. I will give you an example: if a foreign country buys a property and it costs them $1 million to plant a crop of wheat, and it might be a good season and they harvest $2 million worth of wheat. They actually sell that wheat back to their country for—guess what? One million dollars. The country buys the wheat at half price. Costs are $1 million; income is $1 million. No profit, no tax—they just transfer it overseas. It is wrong, and that is why I am very pleased to say that Treasurer Joe Hockey is leading the fight on this very issue.


No doubt this will be raised at the G20 in Brisbane in November and discussed at length. I agree with you, Senator Whish-Wilson—this has to be a global effort. The countries have to combine together to share information on those who are dodging tax in this country, and any other country around the world. I am sure those in many countries see money transferred out of their country and tax avoidance by the big end of town, when they need to pay their fair share in those countries as well. It is Treasurer Joe Hockey who is leading this very fight to capture those in the net who make the money in this country to pay the tax in this country. If they do not, who is going to pay the tax? The small Aussie battlers, the small businesses? Or are we going to go down the road of Labor, which we do not want to go down, of more budget deficits, more borrowing—in other words, mortgaging our children's future away. That is certainly not sustainable, and it is a road to a brick wall. We have seen what the previous government did—$240 billion of government budgets in just six years and hence the $340-odd billion of gross debt we have today.


As I said—and I know my colleague Senator Heffernan will certainly continue this argument in far more detail than I have given this chamber—if you earn the money in this country, you pay the tax in this country. And I welcome Senator Heffernan's phone ringing, and countries working together—starting off with G20 in November, with Treasurer Joe Hockey leading the reforms.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland) (18:40):  Again, what we heard from the Nationals, the supporters of the Liberal Party, is simply rhetoric, and empty at that. What they are now saying in effect, if you boil the speech down and if you forgive his inability to understand how fuel excise has worked—is that the Howard government froze it and then put in indexation. He brushed over that a little bit quicker than he should have. 



Senator Williams interjecting—




Senator LUDWIG:
  He might want to bite now. People in rural Australia do understand how indexation will mean that their fuel will increase in price over time. He touched on fixing our roads. If you look at Labor's record on fixing roads over its term in government, it outshines yours by a country mile. If you look at his gloss over, really the MRRT in total, what he does not say, ultimately, is how regional and rural Australia will benefit from an MRRT and how small business would have benefited from accelerated depreciation and from a range of measures. It glosses over that completely. What we also did not hear is how we address the issues around climate change. Yes, if you are opposed to a carbon tax, if you are opposed to an emissions trading scheme, if you are a complete denier of climate change like the Nationals are, then I accept what Senator Williams is saying. But it is wrong.


Then suddenly at the end of his speech he dealt with the substance of what this argument is all about. This is about a treasurer, Mr Joe Hockey, who is not serious at all about cracking down on multinational tax avoidance. If he was serious about it, we would be seeing him take the argument domestically into the G20, but he does not. All he wants to do is to walk the walk and talk the talk but ultimately to lead us nowhere. He does not intend to deal with the issues at hand. By not proceeding with sensible measures which we implemented to close tax loopholes, the Australian people will be forgone in the order of $1.1 billion in revenue. To put this in perspective, that is about a new hospital that could be built. What this government is all about is talking loudly but taking no action. If you look at how they have ripped money out of the tax commissioner and sacked public servants, they have left the tax office woefully underpowered to go against these global firms. We do not have any real leadership in the G20 to look at tax scams or to argue how we can ensure multinationals pay their fair tax. What we do have is a weak and equivocal government that will get rolled on this issue in the G20 and will then use some tough words to dress up what is in fact a rhubarb pie.


What we have is a government that is also attacking those who can least afford it. Where Labor increased the pension, looked at how we could assist pensioners and how we could provide support for students, where we looked at how we could, in the longer term, assist those who are less advantaged than ourselves—this government is ripping it all away.


More fundamentally, at the last election Mr Abbott promised that there would be no cuts to health, no changes to pensions, no change to the GST and no cuts to the ABC or SBS. This budget included the opposite—it is a budget of broken promises. This coalition government cannot even manage its own house to ensure that it delivers on its own promises, let alone deal with the big end of town, attack those firms that do have the capacity to pay and make a reasonable contribution to international action.

Senator HEFFERNAN
 (New South Wales) (18:45):  I thank Senator Seselja for his space in this play. I could probably take an hour without notes and give you all the details without any political background or crap. There are nine tax havens in the world that have zero tax for corporates, and they are fundamentally used as a normal procedure now for most multinationals. There are also countries like Singapore that have a tax rate of 15 per cent. Obviously no-one is breaking the law under the present regime and that is why John Phillips, the past chairman of the Foreign Investment Review Board, said the whole act and the international convention on tax needed to be rewritten. Obviously it has to be done as a group of nations, which is why Swan when he was Treasurer sent his Treasury officials around to see me for two hours. They did not understand what a derivative swap was—and hands up all those in the chamber who can give me a tutorial on how derivative swaps work. No? No-one knows that that is part of the mechanism. The legislation that protects our revenue base was written when it used to take six weeks on a ship to go to England to play cricket. As John Phillips said, it needs to be brought up to date.


We welcome foreign investment but it has to be on a level playing field so it does not distort the capital market, does not distort the commodity market and does not distort the revenue base. As Senator Williams said, with sovereign investors, our acquisition act does not deal with foreign acquisition. If under the international convention you are a sovereign investor and you come out here and declare your income from the production of whatever it is you have invested in, you get charity status if it is for a humanitarian purpose—you bypass the tax system altogether. Obviously transfer pricing has a real part to play in this, and of course there are the likes of ADM. I chaired that inquiry. One of the reasons I did not appreciate what they were up to is that they are serious corporate crooks when it comes to tax. Having left here, having said they had turned over a new page, they got a $700 million bill in the US.


If we are going to deal with this we have to understand the enormity of the problem. I agree that it is not fair on wage earners to have to pay more tax. Institutions were in denial for 50 years about what they were doing with kids, and all of a sudden everyone is up apologising at the royal commission: 'Yes, it has been going on and we apologise.' Tax, internationally, has got to that stage. It is normal behaviour now for multinationals to expect to pay minimal max, whether it is through transfer pricing, thin capitalisation, the derivative swap market or deadset charity status. We need to get the legislation up to date and I congratulate the government on taking the lead at G20, but Swanny took it up as well. He took it to an earlier G20. I appreciated him sending people around so I could explain to them what a derivative swap was. The US do not like us saying this, but the US is technically insolvent. The largest debt they have is $5 trillion to their own pension fund, which is a double debt. Last year they estimate they missed out on $600 billion through tax avoidance. By way of interest, without naming anyone, the largest anti-tax avoidance case the US government had last year was against an Australian company. We are in it up to our necks Fair enough, they are not breaking the law—as Packer said, you would be a mug if you did not minimise your tax. Let's get the law up-to-date, let's do it as a group of nations, let's not play political games in this chamber about it. Why in God's name do we not have a GST on online trading when online trading is putting retail trading out of business? It does not make any sense.


There is no need to play politics with any of this. It is about preventing the redefinition in the Western world of sovereignty. As I have said to the various officials, if you model out what is happening now and look at the increase in the graph for the take-up of the opportunity, without breaking the law, of not paying tax, we have no capacity in the future to meet the expectations of the electorate, to expect to go to a clean and safe hospital, to have roads that are safe and bridges that do not fall apart, to have a defence force and to have schools. Even though there are some people in this chamber who argue we should not have public schools and public hospitals and we should pay less tax, I think we should pay our fair share of tax and I think the multinational corporate world should be part of that because it is normal behaviour now, as part of the bottom-line profit for a lot of these countries, which adds to their share price, to pay little or no tax. It is just not giving the taxpayers of Australia a fair go. We have to rewrite the legislation and we have to do it as a group of nations because if Australia tried to do it on our own we would be isolated.


Why is it that even our own Future Fund—this is a bit sensitive—has entities in tax havens? Why is it that foreign capital coming into Australia is more patient than Australian capital? It is because of the tax advantages for capital coming into Australia. Our super funds should be investing in the development of Australia but that does not happen because of the return on the capital and because of the tax arrangements for foreign capital. As I say, I need an hour to do this sensibly, without notes because I know it all backwards. We could fix it. Last year it is estimated—it is only an estimate—there was about $3 trillion involved in derivative swaps and tax avoidance to June 30 last year. It is fair to say to the Australian people that as a parliament we want to address this. If we do not address it—as I say, some of the institutional stuff is a bit sensitive—it just becomes a nightmare which will redefine sovereignty.


How do you convince some of the accounting firms who make a living out of giving advice on how to avoid tax that we have to redefine what they have been doing? They will have teams of lobbyists coming to parliament. I had a bloke ring me up and blow the hell out of me this morning because I got a bit of a run in the paper today on this. This should not be about politics; it should be about the national interest; it should be about keeping Australia as the best place in the world to raise a family, breathe fresh air and drink clean water. It should be about the group of the Western developed world being able to provide for its own people as well as look after the wellbeing of some of the less wealthy countries. We can't do that if the $30 trillion—Senator Whish-Wilson, you mentioned 20 trillion—they think it is closer to $30 trillion stacked away. As you are probably aware, the US government is in the process of bringing in a moratorium so they can repatriate some of the capital—a bit like a gun buyback. How do you fix all this? The only way to fix it is for the group of 20 nations to tackle it, but bear in mind that some of that group of 20 are beneficiaries and that sovereignty as we know it cannot continue unless we do.

The speech read as follows—



CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (UNEXPLAINED WEALTH AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2014


I am pleased to introduce the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Unexplained Wealth and Other Measures) Bill 2014. 


Serious and organised crime poses a significant threat to Australian communities. The Government is committed to ensuring our nation is safe and secure, and to taking tough steps to strike at the heart of organised crime. It is for this reason that we are today taking action to strengthen Commonwealth laws that target 'unexplained wealth'. 


Unexplained wealth laws turn the tables on criminals who live off the benefits of their illegal activities at the expense of hard working Australians. They also provide an avenue to target the criminal kingpins who enjoy the proceeds of crime, without committing actual crimes themselves. In appropriate circumstances, unexplained wealth laws allow a court to order a person to demonstrate that his or her wealth was lawfully acquired. If they are unable to do so, the person may be ordered to forfeit their illegitimate wealth. 


Unexplained wealth laws are a highly effective tool in the fight against serious and organised crime. Taking the profit out of crime undermines the entire business model of criminal groups and prevents illicit funds being reinvested to support further criminal activity. 


In our Policy to Tackle Crime, the Coalition Government promised to strengthen Commonwealth unexplained wealth laws to ensure we have the toughest framework possible to target criminal proceeds. This commitment followed the 2011 inquiry by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement (PJC-LE) into the Commonwealth's unexplained wealth laws and arrangements. 


In its final report, the PJC-LE found that the unexplained wealth provisions in the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (POC Act) were not working as intended. The Committee made 18 recommendations aimed at improving the investigation and litigation of Commonwealth unexplained wealth matters. While some of these recommendations have been implemented, there are a number outstanding. We're seeking to rectify this situation as part of our commitment to make the Commonwealth's unexplained wealth laws as effective as possible.




Measures in the Bill 



The measures in the Bill are designed to:


ensure the most effective framework for law enforcement to investigate and take action to target unexplained wealth 


streamline the processes for obtaining unexplained wealth orders while ensuring appropriate safeguards, and


close loopholes in the Proceeds of Crime Act that potentially make it easier to escape unexplained wealth actions and frustrate court processes. 


I will now outline the amendments in each of these categories in further detail. 




Effective law enforcement framework



To ensure that law enforcement powers are sufficient to target and restrain criminal assets, the Bill will amend existing search and seizure powers in the Proceeds of Crime Act to allow authorised officers to seize material relevant to unexplained wealth. This amendment will address some uncertainty that exists under current arrangements and ensure that material relevant to unexplained wealth proceedings can be seized when searching premises under a warrant. 


Other measures will enhance the ability of law enforcement to share information obtained under the Proceeds of Crime Act with appropriate State, Territory and foreign authorities. This will ensure agencies are able to work cooperatively to effectively recover all proceeds of crime, including unexplained wealth.


To balance the expansion of these powers, the Bill requires the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police to report annually to the PJC-LE on the number of unexplained wealth investigations and applications. This will strengthen the PJC-LE's oversight of the use of the provisions and ensure appropriate checks on the use of unexplained wealth investigative powers. 




Streamlining processes for obtaining unexplained wealth orders



As well as ensuring that law enforcement agencies are better placed to attack the profits of criminal syndicates, the Bill also responds to PJC-LE recommendations aimed at improving the efficiency and fairness of unexplained wealth laws. 


Under the Bill, a court will no longer have an overarching discretion to refuse to make unexplained wealth orders for suspected wealth of $100,000 or more. The PJC-LE considered that there were adequate safeguards already contained in the Act. The court will retain its discretion for orders for suspected wealth of less than $100,000 and will still be able to refuse to make an order if satisfied that it is not in the public interest. Removing the general discretion will improve certainty for all parties, while also maintaining appropriate protections for those subject to unexplained wealth orders. 


The Bill will also reduce unnecessary duplication in affidavit requirements by repealing certain requirements where police have already presented the same affidavit material to support an earlier related application. 


The Bill will also improve the court's ability to enforce an unexplained wealth order by setting out a process to allow restrained property to be used to pay a debt owed to the Commonwealth under an unexplained wealth order. This will improve the enforcement of unexplained wealth orders and bring the scheme into line with other types of orders in the Proceeds of Crime Act. 




Closing loopholes in the Proceeds of Crime Act



The Bill will also close loopholes in the Proceeds of Crime Act identified by the PJC-LE and by law enforcement. 


The Bill will prevent restrained assets, which may have been unlawfully acquired, from being dispersed on legal expenses by people who are trying to frustrate an unexplained wealth case. They will instead be able to seek representation through legal aid, as is the case with other proceeds of crime orders. 


The Bill will also clarify that a person whose property is subject to a preliminary unexplained wealth order is prevented from frustrating unexplained wealth proceedings by simply failing to appear when ordered to do so.




Conclusion



In addition to the further minor amendments made by the Bill, these changes represent a major reform of Commonwealth unexplained wealth laws. The measures have been informed by the PJC-LE's comprehensive inquiry and extensive consultation with law enforcement agencies and other stakeholders. 


Debate adjourned.

Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (18:59):  I rise to oppose the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (2014 Budget Measures No. 1) Bill 2014 and the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (2014 Budget Measures No. 2) Bill 2014. Before the election we were told this would be a government of no surprises, a government that would never countenance cuts to health or education and that would leave the pension exactly as it is, a government that would support Australian families. How times have changed. We now know this is a budget that attacks the poor and vulnerable while it rewards the wealthy. It contains some of the harshest measures in Australian history. If passed in full, it would leave the Australian social contract in tatters and each and every one of us would be poorer for it. 


Some of the very worst of the attacks in this budget are contained in the bills before us today. If they are passed, literally millions of Australians will be worse off. Very few low- and middle-income Australians would escape the crosshairs of this brutal legislation. This social services legislation includes significant attacks on pensioners, people with a disability, carers, young job seekers and low- and middle-income Australian families. Australia did not vote for these bills, and Labor will not and cannot support them as they stand. What is worse is that these cruel attacks are not necessary. The government has fabricated an economic crisis or a budget emergency, as they like to call it, in order to justify the harsh measures contained in these bills. 


The truth is that Australia's economic credentials are the envy of the world. We have the 12th largest economy on the planet, despite the fact that we do not even make the top 50 for population size. We have solid growth, relatively low unemployment, low interest rates and low debt. According to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, the current net debt for all levels of government in Australia is equivalent to 13.8 per cent of GDP. This is less than one-fifth of the average debt burden carried by other industrial economies. We are only one of 10 nations in the world to achieve the AAA stamp of economic approval from all three ratings agencies. How those opposite can stand up again and again and tell the Australian people that we are in the midst of an economic crisis given these undeniably solid fundamentals is beyond me. 


Normally when governments are trying to mount a case in the national debate they will put forward independent and reputable experts who will back up their argument. But, as we have seen, economists who have been willing to come out in support of the government's Chicken Little 'sky is falling' view of the world have been very thin on the ground. In fact, the very opposite is true. Earlier this month, 63 of Australia's leading economists banded together to publicly refute the government's confection. They rejected the very concept of the budget emergency, in a statement that read in part:


Australia does not face any present or imminent debt crisis. Australia’s deficit and accumulated debt are both low, relative to international experience and Australia’s own history.


They also warned that the way forward is investment in jobs, not harsh cuts. On this matter they say:


The most effective route to restored fiscal balance is to help more Australians find work, earn incomes, and pay taxes. But major and unnecessary reductions in government program spending and public sector employment would have the opposite effect.


This expert testimony shines a glaring light on how seriously overblown and dangerous the government's economic claims really are. But it seems those opposite will not let either expert advice or solid facts get in the way of their scaremongering. No-one is denying that we should be chartering a path to a more sustainable balance of incomings and outgoings, but to launch an all-out attack on the most vulnerable Australians in order to achieve this is shameful. This is not the only fabrication the government are spreading in order to justify these cruel bills. No, not content with talking down our economy, they have also turned to maligning Australia's solid welfare system, trying to convince us all that spending is spiralling out of control. Again, they have neither truth nor evidence to support this. 


The truth is that Australia's welfare bill is second lowest amongst OECD countries. In 2013 our welfare spending was just 8.6 per cent of our GDP compared to the OECD average of 13 per cent. This is a government that trades in fear in order to scare Australians into believing that its cruel and heartless agenda is the only way forward. Tony Abbott misled the Australian people to get into high office and now he is confecting a budget emergency and welfare spike in order to launch a systematic attack on millions of Australians. 


First in line for cuts are pensioners. In 2009, on the recommendation of the Harmer pension review, the age, disability and carer pensions increased to 27.7 per cent of male total average weekly earnings to ensure that real incomes did not go backwards as the years went by. But these bills would change this accepted formula. Instead, the government wants to link pensions to the usually lower consumer price index. To give you an idea of the impacts of this in the real world, if these indexing arrangements were put in place four years ago, a single pensioner would now be $1,500 a year worse off each year than they are today. It is very clear that those opposite do not understand the impacts of a $1,500 cut to a very modest income of around $22,000 on Australian pensioners. Although that is not surprising when you consider recent reports that one of the budget's greatest fans, Mr Christopher Pyne, thought nothing of splashing close to $1,500 of taxpayers' money on a day room in a swish London hotel. 


Looking forward, the Australian Council of Social Service, ACOSS, has estimated that, if it is passed, this measure would see pensioners $80 a week poorer in a decade's time. This adds up to over $4,000 a year. If this measure passes, the cost of living will continue to increase but the pension will fail to keep up. Over time this smaller pension increase will compound, making it even harder to make ends meet. Make no mistake: this is a cut, despite what those opposite might say—a cut by stealth, granted, but a cut nonetheless. If these bills pass, Australia's 2.9 million pensioners will see an ongoing erosion of their spending capacity and an ever-mounting burden just to stay on top of daily expenses. In Tasmania this will impact on close to 100,000 pensioners. Nearly 22,000 of these pensioners live in my home electorate of Braddon. These people have contributed all their lives to the social and economic wealth of the country, but they are now being treated as little more than an economic burden. 


The government's flimsy justification for these cuts relies on peddling that old rotten chestnut that our spending on pensions is out of control. Again, the facts are not on the government side. Australia spends just 3.5 per cent of GDP on the age pension, making us one of the lowest spending nations in the developed world. The OECD average of spending on pensions was 7.8 per cent of GDP in 2009. In fact, many nations—including Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Portugal and Slovenia—spend in excess of 10 per cent. 


Notably, these cuts will not be restricted to age pensions. The government also proposes to use the same indexing measures for the disability support and carers pensions, and the single parenting payment, ensuring that in total 3.2 million Australians will be worse off. Not only are pensioners being forced to suffer a continuing decline in their standard of living but this bill would also have them working until they are 70 years old. This would give Australia the highest pension age of any country in the OECD. This proposal is short-sighted, and it will unfairly impact on blue-collar workers, low-income workers and women. It also flies in the face of everything we know about the serious problem of age discrimination in Australian workplaces. If 50-year-olds are finding it hard to get work, how does the government think that the situation is going to magically reverse itself for 60- or 65-year-olds? 


Labor's decision to increase the pension age to 67 by 2023 was supported by a broad and thorough review of Australia's pension system. It also came with a significant improvement to the base rate for the pension and improvements to indexation. In contrast, this plan to increase the pension age to 70 is an ill-considered and ill-advised move that has been rushed through with no consultation or rational basis. 


To add insult to injury, the Abbott government is axing the National Partnership Agreement on Certain Concessions for Pensioner Concession Card and Seniors Card Holders. This will scrap $1.3 billion in Commonwealth assistance to the states and territories to provide seniors and Seniors Health Card holders with discounts on their rate notices; on their water, sewerage, electricity and gas bills; on their car registration; and on their public transport fares. The national seniors organisation estimates that these concessions can add up to $1,200 for seniors each and every year. This is clearly another cut that will mean that pensioners will have to pay more for essential services from already tight budgets. 


Tony Abbott promised solemnly before the election—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Williams
):  Order! Senator Urquhart, please refer to the Prime Minister by his correct title. 




Senator URQUHART:
  Prime Minister Abbott promised solemnly before the election that there would be no changes to the pension. Now he wants to keep people working longer before they get the pension, pay them less when they finally get there and rip away government support for essential services. Australia's pensioners have a right to feel betrayed by this government and its broken promises, but they are not the only ones. These shabby amendments would also slash $7.5 billion from the budgets of Australian families through changes to the family payments system. Firstly, the Abbott government is seeking to freeze the family tax benefit payment rates including the income-free area for people on the maximum family benefit A rate. This would see more than 370,000 families lose around $750 a year in 2016-17, which will compound over time making it harder and harder to keep up with the cost of living. Again, we are seeing another policy from this government that will hit the poorest hardest. 


The ACTU pointed out the unfairness of these cuts to family benefits when it said:


Many low- and middle-income working families rely on Family Tax Benefit to ensure they have a decent material standard of living. The expansion of family payments was a proud achievement of the Accord under the Hawke and Keating Governments. The provision of adequate family payments significantly reduced child poverty in Australia. Reducing these payments in real terms, as this Budget measure proposes to do, will cut the incomes of millions of working Australians. Child poverty is highly likely to rise.


In addition to these undeniable cuts, those opposite also want to cut family tax benefit B from families when their youngest child turns six. This is likely to impact 700,000 families and it will, again, unquestionably hit single-income families the hardest. In fact, it will slug single parents with an effective marginal tax rate of around 80c in the dollar for each dollar that they earn above $48,000. 


The Australian Council of Social Services found that a single parent with one child aged between six and 12 would lose $37 a week from this measure alone. But it does not stop there. The Abbott government also plans to cut and then stop indexation of the family tax benefit end of year supplements. Together, these family payment changes are unfair measures that will disproportionately affect the poorest Australians, and they come at a time when the Palmer party has cosied up with the government to axe the schoolkids bonus in December 2016.


The bills before us today contain some of the most disgraceful elements of one of the most unfair budgets in history. If passed in full, this budget of broken promises would have seen around 1.2 million families $3,000 a year worse off on average by 2017-18. At the same time, the top 20 per cent of households would be a little better off. These figures do not come from Labor. They actually come from the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling, or NATSEM, which garnered a glowing recommendation from our Prime Minister as being: 


… the most reputable and authoritative modelling organisation in Australia.


Of course, this is part of the information that Mr Hockey removed from the budget papers, despite the fact that it has been a standard inclusion back to 2005. Modelling has shown a single-income family on $65,000 with two school-aged children will be around $6,000 a year worse off from 2016 as a result of the proposed changes. Clearly, a loss of 10 per cent of income would have a significant impact on their ability to manage everyday living costs, and is entirely unacceptable. It is clear that Mr Hockey knew how unfair his budget was, and he was trying to hide it from the Australian people.


If the cuts to pensioners and families within these bills are harsh and unnecessary, then the attack on job seekers is absolutely reprehensible. It is no overstatement to say that these are some of the most draconian welfare measures we have ever seen in this country. The most serious concern for me is the Abbott government's plan to force young job seekers to wait six months before they are eligible for any income support. This is not just cruel; it is inhumane. We are a country that prides itself on our strong safety net and our support for others when they are down on their luck. This bill tears the guiding principle of a fair go to shreds in favour of enforced destitution that is a sure-fire recipe for mass desperation. And, of course, it will do absolutely nothing to create more jobs for young Australians.


Department of Social Services figures obtained by ACOSS show that each year more than 100,000 people would be hit by the proposed six-month waiting period. In my home state of Tasmania, it is estimated that 12,500 young jobseekers will be affected over the next four years.


Unsurprisingly, this measure has been widely condemned by anyone who has an understanding of Australia's labour market and of our welfare system. The National Welfare Rights Network described it perfectly as:


… a fundamental attack on the basic right to social security and the principle of adequate income support based on need.


St Vincent De Paul chief, John Falzon, warned that it will plunge jobseekers into poverty and force them to choose between charity and crime. Some jobseekers may be able to turn to family or friends but many thousands of jobseekers do not have this kind of support. For them, illegal means might be the only option they have. And, of course, any increase in crime will undoubtedly flow through into the judicial system.


Similarly, our health and social services systems will wear a heavy burden if there is a spike in depression, suicide, homelessness and other social problems that often accompany financial desperation. We should never forget that if the hit on the budget will be bad from this ill-considered policy, the toll on families and local communities will be immeasurable.


Yet again we have seen the government dragging out falsehoods to justify their bad bills. The Minister for Social Services, Kevin Andrews, was caught out last week peddling false information. The minister has recently been trying to justify this cruel measure by saying that New Zealand already forces its jobseekers to wait a month before they receive income support. The Parliamentary Library disagrees, saying that no such waiting period exists. Yet again we see the government fabricating evidence to support their heartless policy.




Senator O'Sullivan:
  I rise on a point of order. It is this reference to the government, or members of the government, with these disparaging remarks, suggesting that they are lying—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Williams
):  There is no point of order. Senator Urquhart has the call.




Senator URQUHART:
  Even the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, which is chaired by the government's own Senator Dean Smith, found this legislation to be harsh and incompatible with Australia's human rights obligations. The plan to force young people to live without an income for six months breaches the right of Australians to social security and to an adequate standard of living. Not only that, but the committee also found the government's plan to increase the eligible age for Newstart from 22 to 25 years breached the rights to equality and non-discrimination on the basis of age.


Despite their stated goal of helping jobseekers to gain the dignity of work, their words belie their cruel and heartless attitudes to unemployed people. We have had Treasurer Joe Hockey falsely divide the world into lifters and leaners, with implications that the latter are just too lazy to go out and get themselves a six-figure salary. He has continued to use this false and arrogant division to fan public resentment against unemployed people.


Those opposite need to understand that unemployment is not a lifestyle choice. The vast majority of jobseekers are genuinely seeking work to escape an income that is far below the poverty line. This government is on the ball when it comes to punishing jobseekers, but sadly lacking on creating jobs.


In North West Tasmania, which has a 12-month average youth unemployment rate of close to 18 per cent, the government has actually cut the Employment Coordinator. If this does not show how completely twisted their priorities are, I do not know what would.


These bills represent some of the cruellest attacks in history on vulnerable Australians. They do not have the support of experts, and they will unfairly impact on literally millions of low-income and middle-income Australians, jobseekers and pensioners across all of Australia. We should vote against this legislation.

Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (18:59):  I rise to oppose the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (2014 Budget Measures No. 1) Bill 2014 and the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (2014 Budget Measures No. 2) Bill 2014. Before the election we were told this would be a government of no surprises, a government that would never countenance cuts to health or education and that would leave the pension exactly as it is, a government that would support Australian families. How times have changed. We now know this is a budget that attacks the poor and vulnerable while it rewards the wealthy. It contains some of the harshest measures in Australian history. If passed in full, it would leave the Australian social contract in tatters and each and every one of us would be poorer for it. 


Some of the very worst of the attacks in this budget are contained in the bills before us today. If they are passed, literally millions of Australians will be worse off. Very few low- and middle-income Australians would escape the crosshairs of this brutal legislation. This social services legislation includes significant attacks on pensioners, people with a disability, carers, young job seekers and low- and middle-income Australian families. Australia did not vote for these bills, and Labor will not and cannot support them as they stand. What is worse is that these cruel attacks are not necessary. The government has fabricated an economic crisis or a budget emergency, as they like to call it, in order to justify the harsh measures contained in these bills. 


The truth is that Australia's economic credentials are the envy of the world. We have the 12th largest economy on the planet, despite the fact that we do not even make the top 50 for population size. We have solid growth, relatively low unemployment, low interest rates and low debt. According to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, the current net debt for all levels of government in Australia is equivalent to 13.8 per cent of GDP. This is less than one-fifth of the average debt burden carried by other industrial economies. We are only one of 10 nations in the world to achieve the AAA stamp of economic approval from all three ratings agencies. How those opposite can stand up again and again and tell the Australian people that we are in the midst of an economic crisis given these undeniably solid fundamentals is beyond me. 


Normally when governments are trying to mount a case in the national debate they will put forward independent and reputable experts who will back up their argument. But, as we have seen, economists who have been willing to come out in support of the government's Chicken Little 'sky is falling' view of the world have been very thin on the ground. In fact, the very opposite is true. Earlier this month, 63 of Australia's leading economists banded together to publicly refute the government's confection. They rejected the very concept of the budget emergency, in a statement that read in part:


Australia does not face any present or imminent debt crisis. Australia’s deficit and accumulated debt are both low, relative to international experience and Australia’s own history.


They also warned that the way forward is investment in jobs, not harsh cuts. On this matter they say:


The most effective route to restored fiscal balance is to help more Australians find work, earn incomes, and pay taxes. But major and unnecessary reductions in government program spending and public sector employment would have the opposite effect.


This expert testimony shines a glaring light on how seriously overblown and dangerous the government's economic claims really are. But it seems those opposite will not let either expert advice or solid facts get in the way of their scaremongering. No-one is denying that we should be chartering a path to a more sustainable balance of incomings and outgoings, but to launch an all-out attack on the most vulnerable Australians in order to achieve this is shameful. This is not the only fabrication the government are spreading in order to justify these cruel bills. No, not content with talking down our economy, they have also turned to maligning Australia's solid welfare system, trying to convince us all that spending is spiralling out of control. Again, they have neither truth nor evidence to support this. 


The truth is that Australia's welfare bill is second lowest amongst OECD countries. In 2013 our welfare spending was just 8.6 per cent of our GDP compared to the OECD average of 13 per cent. This is a government that trades in fear in order to scare Australians into believing that its cruel and heartless agenda is the only way forward. Tony Abbott misled the Australian people to get into high office and now he is confecting a budget emergency and welfare spike in order to launch a systematic attack on millions of Australians. 


First in line for cuts are pensioners. In 2009, on the recommendation of the Harmer pension review, the age, disability and carer pensions increased to 27.7 per cent of male total average weekly earnings to ensure that real incomes did not go backwards as the years went by. But these bills would change this accepted formula. Instead, the government wants to link pensions to the usually lower consumer price index. To give you an idea of the impacts of this in the real world, if these indexing arrangements were put in place four years ago, a single pensioner would now be $1,500 a year worse off each year than they are today. It is very clear that those opposite do not understand the impacts of a $1,500 cut to a very modest income of around $22,000 on Australian pensioners. Although that is not surprising when you consider recent reports that one of the budget's greatest fans, Mr Christopher Pyne, thought nothing of splashing close to $1,500 of taxpayers' money on a day room in a swish London hotel. 


Looking forward, the Australian Council of Social Service, ACOSS, has estimated that, if it is passed, this measure would see pensioners $80 a week poorer in a decade's time. This adds up to over $4,000 a year. If this measure passes, the cost of living will continue to increase but the pension will fail to keep up. Over time this smaller pension increase will compound, making it even harder to make ends meet. Make no mistake: this is a cut, despite what those opposite might say—a cut by stealth, granted, but a cut nonetheless. If these bills pass, Australia's 2.9 million pensioners will see an ongoing erosion of their spending capacity and an ever-mounting burden just to stay on top of daily expenses. In Tasmania this will impact on close to 100,000 pensioners. Nearly 22,000 of these pensioners live in my home electorate of Braddon. These people have contributed all their lives to the social and economic wealth of the country, but they are now being treated as little more than an economic burden. 


The government's flimsy justification for these cuts relies on peddling that old rotten chestnut that our spending on pensions is out of control. Again, the facts are not on the government side. Australia spends just 3.5 per cent of GDP on the age pension, making us one of the lowest spending nations in the developed world. The OECD average of spending on pensions was 7.8 per cent of GDP in 2009. In fact, many nations—including Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Portugal and Slovenia—spend in excess of 10 per cent. 


Notably, these cuts will not be restricted to age pensions. The government also proposes to use the same indexing measures for the disability support and carers pensions, and the single parenting payment, ensuring that in total 3.2 million Australians will be worse off. Not only are pensioners being forced to suffer a continuing decline in their standard of living but this bill would also have them working until they are 70 years old. This would give Australia the highest pension age of any country in the OECD. This proposal is short-sighted, and it will unfairly impact on blue-collar workers, low-income workers and women. It also flies in the face of everything we know about the serious problem of age discrimination in Australian workplaces. If 50-year-olds are finding it hard to get work, how does the government think that the situation is going to magically reverse itself for 60- or 65-year-olds? 


Labor's decision to increase the pension age to 67 by 2023 was supported by a broad and thorough review of Australia's pension system. It also came with a significant improvement to the base rate for the pension and improvements to indexation. In contrast, this plan to increase the pension age to 70 is an ill-considered and ill-advised move that has been rushed through with no consultation or rational basis. 


To add insult to injury, the Abbott government is axing the National Partnership Agreement on Certain Concessions for Pensioner Concession Card and Seniors Card Holders. This will scrap $1.3 billion in Commonwealth assistance to the states and territories to provide seniors and Seniors Health Card holders with discounts on their rate notices; on their water, sewerage, electricity and gas bills; on their car registration; and on their public transport fares. The national seniors organisation estimates that these concessions can add up to $1,200 for seniors each and every year. This is clearly another cut that will mean that pensioners will have to pay more for essential services from already tight budgets. 


Tony Abbott promised solemnly before the election—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Williams
):  Order! Senator Urquhart, please refer to the Prime Minister by his correct title. 




Senator URQUHART:
  Prime Minister Abbott promised solemnly before the election that there would be no changes to the pension. Now he wants to keep people working longer before they get the pension, pay them less when they finally get there and rip away government support for essential services. Australia's pensioners have a right to feel betrayed by this government and its broken promises, but they are not the only ones. These shabby amendments would also slash $7.5 billion from the budgets of Australian families through changes to the family payments system. Firstly, the Abbott government is seeking to freeze the family tax benefit payment rates including the income-free area for people on the maximum family benefit A rate. This would see more than 370,000 families lose around $750 a year in 2016-17, which will compound over time making it harder and harder to keep up with the cost of living. Again, we are seeing another policy from this government that will hit the poorest hardest. 


The ACTU pointed out the unfairness of these cuts to family benefits when it said:


Many low- and middle-income working families rely on Family Tax Benefit to ensure they have a decent material standard of living. The expansion of family payments was a proud achievement of the Accord under the Hawke and Keating Governments.

"Seselja, Sen Zed",LP,2014-09-30,"



Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory) (19:19):  Before I talk about some great charities and local issues, I want to quickly reflect on the vote we had earlier today to establish this ridiculous inquiry into the Queensland government. I think it is an interesting precedent and I want to reflect on it for a moment. Now that Labor and the Greens support the inquiry, it will be interesting to see whether or not there will be those kinds of inquiries in the future. I imagine some of my South Australian colleagues would not mind seeing an inquiry into the South Australian Labor government. In the ACT we have a Labor/Greens government. There are many things that could be looked at with this ACT Labor/Greens government, such as the scandalous waste of $800 million on a light-rail line that no-one is going to use, and their plan to triple everybody's rates. There are other issues, too. We have seen the doctoring of hospital data. Someone might want to get to the bottom of that—12,000 records were doctored under the watch of this government. There is a range of things. I think a very interesting precedent has been set.


Interestingly, the principle of comity, which may be ruled on by the High Court, would of course not apply in the ACT's case, given that the ACT is a territory under section 122 of the Constitution. I will just put that on the record in terms of the new-found interest of the Labor Party and the Greens in investigating other governments.


But I would like to speak about some other issues. Last year I had the honour of opening the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation's 'Walk for a Cure' around Lake Burley Griffin. This year I am taking it up a notch and signing up for their 'Ride for a Cure', which will be held in January in South Australia. I do not yet own a bike, but I thought if I signed up that would force me to buy a bike and start training. I am very much looking forward to it. The Barossa is an attractive venue, but in the middle of January I understand that it can get quite hot. I am looking forward to that.


I was honoured to be the first ACT patron for JDRF. It is certainly a cause that is close to my heart. There are 122,300 Australians with Type I diabetes, with six new cases diagnosed every day. Type I diabetes is the fastest growing chronic disease amongst Australian children.


JDRF does an amazing job supporting children and their families. It was established in 1970 and coordinates global research strategically at a local level. We are the worldwide leader in funding research to cure, treat and prevent type I diabetes, which is an autoimmune disease that strikes children and adults and last a lifetime. At a local level, I have witnessed the fantastic work that they do. I would like to briefly recognise Mel Eveille, the ACT development coordinator, for all the work she does to raise awareness and much-needed funds.


There are a number of ways that people can get involved in supporting this great organisation. Throughout the rest of this year, there are Walk to Cure events happening across the country. In Canberra, there will be the Walk to Cure on Sunday 26 October down at the lake. As mentioned, we have the Ride to Cure from 16 to 18 January. I would encourage senators and members of the community to get behind this. Information can be found at JDRF.org.au.


Last Friday, I was honoured to represent the Assistant Minister for Defence, the honourable Stuart Robert MP, at the launch of the Defence Long Ride at the Australian War Memorial. I was joined by the head of the ADF, Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin; the ACT Leader of the Opposition, Jeremy Hanson; and the director of the War Memorial, Dr Brendan Nelson—amongst others. The ride is aimed at increasing the public awareness and Defence support to raise awareness and funds to combat prostate cancer in Australian men. The ride is travelling to Uluru over the next few weeks and is one of the biggest motorcycling events of its kind in the southern hemisphere. Last year, they raised over $250,000 and they hoped to break that record this year.


Prostate cancer has traditionally been a cancer that we do not talk about. Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia data indicates that one in five men is likely to develop prostate cancer by the age of 85. On this basis, thousands of the current Defence workforce could be affected by prostate cancer during their lives, as well as those in the wider community. Approximately 20,000 Australian men are diagnosed with prostate cancer each year. More than 3,300 Australian men die as a direct result of prostate cancer annually.


The Prostate Cancer Foundation is dedicated to raising awareness and also reversing these growing numbers. The goal of the PCFA is to reduce the impact of prostate cancer on Australian men, their partners, their families and their community and to represent the interests of all Australian men diagnosed with prostate cancer. I commend all those involved, particularly those involved in the Long Ride.
