"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-04-10,"—I oppose the motion. The government has the hide to bring before the Senate a motion with the anticipation that there will be no debate for the cut-off to be applied to six pieces of legislation when, in the House of Representatives, the government is refusing to debate and is placing a gag on the mandatory sentencing legislation which went through the Senate a couple of weeks ago. There has to be recognition by the government that the Senate regards mandatory sentencing legislation seriously and that it believes that the House of Representatives has a responsibility to treat it seriously. I am not saying anything other than that the government has put onto the House of Representatives a decision through numbers that mandatory sentencing will be dealt with by the executive and not by the parliament. In effect, it has created a situation whereby the Senate has wasted its time deliberating on a matter which it took to be important and which certainly the people of Australia are saying they believe is important. 
The government is simply shrugging its shoulders at that, cocking a snoot at the Senate, showing a cavalier attitude to public opinion in this country and simply saying, `Business as usual—except when it comes to the Senate's legislation.' What will be next? It is very clear that the government is saying that the Senate is a matter to be dealt with by the executive and no longer has a relationship with the House of Representatives, at least when the flow is from this place to the House. As a democrat, I will not except that. I believe there is a responsibility on the part of the government to discuss the mandatory sentencing legislation, to put it to debate and to do so as a matter of expedition. I do not believe we should be accepting a situation where, day in and day out, the government says, `Business as usual' in this house but in the other place would have a corruption of the democratic process, an affront to the Constitution and a denigration of democratic propriety. This is a serious matter, and it has been compounded by the fact that, every day last week, an opposition motion which gained majority support in this place, calling on the House of Representatives to debate the Senate's mandatory sentencing bill, has been totally ignored. Worse than ignored--when the opposition tried to have that motion from the Senate dealt with, to draw attention to the importance with which the Senate treats mandatory sentencing, the government simply used its numbers to prevent an adequate debate and to prevent the bill from being debated.
Had the government done the right thing, this matter would now be settled, at least as far as that legislation is concerned. I do not understand the tactics, but they are wrong. The House of Representatives is the proper place for the Senate to see its business done, the same as it is the responsibility of the Senate to do the House of Representatives' bidding. Here we have six pieces of legislation, and some of them are mightily important. The reason we are being asked to exempt them from the cut-off is that the government wants them through the parliament before we break for winter—hopefully, before the budget and, it would appear, certainly in the next week or two. This is urgent government and House of Representatives business. The Senate should treat it in at least a formal fashion. I am not going to take up the Prime Minister's position: there will be no debate. What would happen if we were to say, `Let's have tit for tat here: no debate in the Senate'? If the government of this country took the Howard line, it would grind to a halt. The Senate is more responsible than to fall to that low level of democratic response.
But nor am I saying we should just shrug our shoulders, go through a few manoeuvres and then say, `Well, business as usual.' This is too important. Mandatory sentencing is too important. Likewise, the relationship between the houses is too important. Remember that these pieces of legislation are not urgent because they are dealing with matters which have arisen urgently. Without exception, they are matters that the government has brought before the House of Representatives, dealt with there and then brought to the Senate in a tardy fashion. In one of the pieces of legislation, a tax bill which deals with fringe benefits and the Medicare levy surcharge, the government's excuse for urgency is:
The measures commence on 1 April 2000.
From my look at a calendar, that is a fortnight ago. It also says:
Passage of the legislation will provide employers with certainty about the details of the new measures.
Thank you very much! If they wanted certainty, the government should have had this legislation up here and passed weeks ago, so that the measures which commence on 1 April would have had the certainty that is required. The government has not done that.
On the A New Tax System (Trade Practices Amendment) Bill 2000, the government says: 
This Bill needs to be introduced and passed in the Autumn sitting of Parliament to ensure the ACCC has adequate powers to prevent businesses from using the GST to exploit customers. 
I know that this Senate is going to pass that legislation. I believe the government should have had that through here months ago, because consumers all over the country are worried that the GST is going to lead to business practices all over the place which will unfairly disadvantage them. This bill will pass the Senate. Is it more or less important than mandatory sentencing? You cannot measure these things. That, along with the other four pieces of legislation, are all important matters and they will be dealt with by the Senate. But if they do not meet the cut-off, it is the government's responsibility.
Finally, I point out that I am very concerned that the cut-off provision, which former Greens WA Senator Christabelle Chamarette had a lot to do with, and which the government supported—
—I made a good speech in support of it at the time.
—That would be one of many, Senator Faulkner. The cut-off provision was brought into this place for very good reasons: so that we did not have bills dropped on us at the leisure of the government with the Senate not having time to properly communicate with the electorate, get feedback and then deal with them in a properly informed fashion. That cut-off is there for very important reasons. The requests for exemptions need to come with very important reasons as well.
The exemptions being sought today, almost without exception, are simply due to tardiness by the government, a failure to get its business here in time to ensure that the cut-off was not required. For example, the government has been working on the legislation attendant on the GST since the last election two years ago. The rash of bills coming in now simply points to its own lack of preparedness for this major change to the taxation system, which the government itself has brought in and has prepared for years and which it should be carrying through in a more ordered and disciplined manner than we see here.
I do not believe that the Senate should be allowing the principle of the cut-off, which is to enable us to work in a better way for the electorate, to be serially downgraded, treated in a cavalier fashion, or not taken seriously at all, to the point where I know what is coming down the line. That is a move to rescind it, to get rid of it so that, in future, government measures, particularly contentious matters, will be able to be dumped on the Senate without adequate time and shoved through here under pressure without being adequately dealt with and without the feedback from the electorate which is so important to proper and informed debate. It is a serious matter to oppose this particular motion. But it comes out of the government's own delinquency, its own affront to the Constitution, its own derogation of duty to uphold the proper democratic procedures which are important if you are to work under the dictum that information is the currency of democracy, that the parliament is the houses of the people, and that matters as important as mandatory sentencing and indeed those that we have listed here under this motion not only have feedback from the electorate but have their fair and proper debating time in both houses.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,1,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2000-04-10,"—I want to speak briefly on the proposition before the chair. On this occasion, the opposition will be supporting the government's proposal for an exemption of certain bills from the provisions of standing order 111 or, as we better know it, the cut-off for legislation. But I want to say this. I do understand the sense of frustration that Senator Brown has in relation to the failure of the House of Representatives to deal with the mandatory sentencing bill which has been passed by this chamber and which has received a number of messages now asking the House to deal with the bill as a matter of urgency.
What we have to look at here is: what is an appropriate response for the Senate in the circumstances where the Senate has passed a bill in relation to a matter that is front and centre in terms of public policy debate in this country at this time and the House refuses to deal with it? I ask myself the question: what is an appropriate response in this circumstance? I suppose I ask myself whether eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth parliamentarianism is the way to go. My answer to that question is that it is not, that we have a situation where the Senate is obviously dependent on the goodwill and the decency of the Prime Minister to have the House of Representatives deal with a bill that has been passed by the Senate on mandatory sentencing. I think everyone in this chamber is well aware that goodwill and decency are not attributes of the current Prime Minister. His position on this important issue of mandatory sentencing is very clear to see. It requires the Prime Minister's goodwill and decency for the matter to be debated in the House of Representatives. 
The argument that we present here is not necessarily that the House of Representatives and the government have to fall over and agree with what the Senate puts up. But at least the Prime Minister should have the intestinal fortitude to allow the people's house, the House of Representatives, to debate an important bill which has been passed by this chamber, which this chamber has given priority to and which this chamber sees as very urgent. I think most Australians accept that the issue of mandatory sentencing is very urgent but, for some reason or other, the Prime Minister is either unwilling or unable, or both, to allow this matter to come on for debate. That is denying the exemption of bills motion before the chair an appropriate response. As far as the opposition is concerned, that is not an appropriate response.
We do not want to see the Senate engage in creating havoc in relation to the government's legislative program. As Senator Brown would probably point out, this is a far more responsible view of the world than the current government ever adopted when it was in opposition. As far as the Labor Party in opposition is concerned, we do try and maintain some consistency in the positions that we adopt. We would have argued the same in government as we are arguing now in opposition. There is no point vandalising the parliamentary procedures and processes. That is the sort of thing that the Liberal and National parties warmly embrace when they find themselves in opposition. There is a point in keeping the pressure right on the Prime Minister. I accept that there is a point in the Senate doing that. But this mechanism, which is just about causing havoc and very unreasonable obstruction to a government's legislative program, is something which the opposition simply cannot agree with and will not embrace. Our position on that will be consistent whether we find ourselves in opposition or in government.
That does not alter the fact that the significance of the substantive point that Senator Brown makes about the importance of mandatory sentencing and the need for the government to bring that bill on for debate in the House of Representatives is in no way lessened by the fact that the opposition will not agree to Senator Brown's proposal to oppose the cut-off motion in this instance. It is just that an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth approach is not the way to go. I do not want to descend into using the same tactics that the Liberals and Nationals so warmly embrace. I think that the obligation is on Mr Howard to allow the bill to come on for debate, but we need to be a bit more creative in finding other ways of encouraging that to occur. On this issue the pressure, in a political sense, is right on the government, right on Mr Howard, right on the cabinet and right on the Liberal and National Party party rooms to ensure that there is a decent outcome on the issue of mandatory sentencing. It would be a tactical error on the Senate's part to up-end the flow of legislation before both chambers of the Australian parliament as a response. We will keep the focus on Mr Howard and his lack of courage in allowing this matter to come on for debate. His gutlessness is indefensible, but you do not go to the extent that Senator Brown wants to go to in response. It is for those reasons that the opposition will support the motion that stands in the name of Senator Troeth.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2000-04-10,"—I speak on the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill 2000 on behalf of the opposition. This legislation seeks to ensure that the child support system applies fairly and equally to those living outside Australia, whether they be a payer of child support or whether they be a recipient. The bill also amends Australia's domestic law in order to enable Australia to fulfil its international child and spousal maintenance obligations. The proposed amendments provide for regulations to be made for matters relevant to the recognition and enforcement of child support and spousal maintenance liabilities.
The following are some examples of the changes: the enforcement of administrative assessments allowing the Child Support Agency to make an administrative assessment, even though the payer is not resident in Australia and does not have an Australian taxable income; in the case of New Zealand, providing that the creation and variation of liabilities will only be able to be undertaken in the country where the payee is resident; obliging each country to assist in locating payers, serving notices and providing advice so that maintenance liabilities can be enforced; allowing the Child Support Agency to collect overseas maintenance liabilities which have not first been registered in an Australian court under the Family Law Act 1975; and also requiring reciprocity in legislative presumptions of parentage. All these measures appear to the opposition to be uncontroversial in nature and, accordingly, we support the bill that is before the chamber today. I believe that the opposition have also indicated they are willing to see this matter be debated as uncontroversial legislation, if that was the wish of other parties and senators in the chamber. 
Let me make a few observations about the Child Support Scheme in indicating the support of the opposition for this bill. The introduction of the scheme a decade ago attempted to put in place a set of principles which very few could disagree with. Those principles are that parents share in the cost of supporting their children according to their capacity and that adequate support is available for all children not living with both their parents. Of course, the other important reason for the establishment of the Child Support Scheme was the principle that the government should not be expected to pay the costs of supporting a child where one or both parents have the wherewithal to do so unassisted.
The problems many currently have with the system lie in the judgments it makes about people's capacity to pay, in what circumstances exceptions should be made, and how the collection of payments is enforced. The difficulty lies in the fact that complaints about child support are divided evenly between those who pay and those who receive. For every aggrieved payer who argues they are forced to give too much to the upbringing of their child, there is a payee arguing they are struggling to meet these costs and they have not got their payments through on time. Some of the issues are resolvable if the government of the day is prepared to work through the issues and talk to the people whom the scheme makes requirements of or guarantees to. But it is important to recognise that the system will never have the capacity to resolve the disappointments and hurt that often go hand in hand with separation and divorce.
The successful resolution of these very human problems and issues lies outside the scope of the Child Support Scheme. I must say that I think this is an area in which the current government has failed to show leadership and support. Since 1996, the government has stripped around $5 billion of social services and other support from our community, creating a huge social deficit. These services, of course, directly assist people to cope with the personal dimension of separation. The government has introduced an unfair tax—the goods and services tax—that actively discriminates against low income earners. Child support payers and payees struggling to mend their lives and get on are going to be slugged by the GST. It will push up the cost of child support and it will put ordinary people under further stress. 
I think the parliament has an obligation to make the child support system as fair and as painless as we can, and I think we still have some way to go before we can truly say that child maintenance is being delivered in this way. But, as I have indicated to the Senate, the opposition is satisfied that the measures set out in this bill are a step in the right direction; and because they are a step in the right direction, the opposition takes the view that they are worthy of our support. It is for those reasons, as I have indicated, that the opposition will be supporting the bill.",SENATE,<title>CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-04-10,"—I would like to open my remarks by indicating, firstly, very clearly that Pauline Hanson's One Nation does support the requirements for parents to provide for their children in a separation process. The problems that we have with the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill 2000 that the government has before us move more towards its unconstitutional sections. I would like to speak to those sections at this point in time. These sections of the bill have the capacity to do two things: to produce a regulation that will be able to override the principal act, and I believe that that is not the intention of legislation within Australia. It will clearly give the regulations the ability to make sections of the act subservient. The other thing that this bill introduces is for the regulations, through international conventions, to enable an order that is derived in a foreign country to have legal effect in Australia without affording an Australian citizen the right of redress in an Australian court.
I believe the Attorney-General, in his process of improving the child support sections of the legislation, is actually introducing some draconian issues. Whether he is aware of them or not we will see in the responses from the minister. But I would like to ask: how long will the Senate wait before taking decisive action on what is the real head of power in this issue—the Family Law Court? How many more parents, predominantly fathers, must die from desperation after being alienated from their children? Is the Senate aware that in Australia each week more than 20 fathers who are subject to child support orders commit suicide? In actuality, there are more fathers who have died by their own hand than there are Australians who died during the landing at Gallipoli. That is an enormous indictment on our society: that, in an endeavour to provide for children—and, as I said earlier, that is what we as a society are required to do—we have placed on the non-custodial parent such pressures that they have no recourse other than to take their own lives.
Both men's and women's lobby groups are opposed to the way in which changes to the Family Law Act are being implemented. Social commentators such as Robert Kelso claim the existence of systemic corruption. The Auditor-General's most recent report is less than flattering, and the parliament's own committee, chaired by Roger Price, was scathing in its condemnation of the Child Support Agency and its policies, practices and conduct. Many argue that the proposals will be dangerous and counter-productive, to the point of increasing the already high suicide rate that I have already mentioned.
The draconian measures that are being implemented hide the real problem that sits behind the process. These processes lie in the disgraceful and dysfunctional nature of all that falls under the wider family law umbrella in Australia. They say that the CSA, in making quasi-judicial decisions that are virtually impossible to appeal, often has the effect of putting parents into debt unfairly—a debt that is unreasonable, false, contrived and without legal merit. Many may possibly have been jailed as a result of these unreasonable decisions. Many have been placed in the predicament where they cannot provide for themselves or, in cases where the non-custodial parent re-marries and there are children as a result of the second marriage, who are in the position where they cannot provide for their second family as well. The children of that second family do not have the same rights as the children of the first family. My colleagues from the Democrats appear to doubt in the efficiency of more draconian measures such as jailing. Some may say that Labor is completely in the pockets of the feminist lobby and the government and that it just wants to grab the cash from overstretched fathers, no matter in what the social on-costs may be.  
The debate over the possibility of jailing parents must consider how many more children will not be told the truth; that is, `Daddy has quietly closed the door and the windows, switched on the gas and gone away.' The Australian Democrats do not support imprisonment as a primary enforcement option. The Labor Party supports the jailing of those who fail to pay maintenance but not those who refuse to comply with parenting orders. The Family Court already has provisions for jailing and imposition of fines. The CSA can seize assets, impose penalties, and sweep bank accounts—and I will speak about that later. They can also impose initial prosecutions for a six-month jail penalty A re-evaluation of child support is happening around the world, and many men are facing mounting debts. I will use the name `Frank' for an example. Frank faces mounting debts and has found himself in a surreal world post-separation. The CSA is not bound by rules of evidence. If Frank is charged, tried and jailed, secrecy clauses mean his case cannot be reported. A Family Court ruling cannot be appealed on an error of fact. The Attorney-General, Daryl Williams, in introducing the Family Law Amendment Bill 1999, has reopened a broader debate and that is the dysfunction of family law, highlighted by the jailing initiatives. This has reignited calls for a non-adversarial tribunal system to replace the Family Court and to focus attention on the CSA. 
Six years ago a joint select committee made history for the number of submissions made to it—163 submissions. The exhaustive report of that committee said that there were many complaints about the CSA, including inconsistency of advice, administrative errors and refusal to verify data. It said, `The inaction or lack of service is inexcusable, and the end result is often appalling client service delivery.' Many of the report's 163 recommendations—including an external review of the CSA `as a matter of priority', close study of its social impacts, its impacts on families, disincentives to work, and the reassessment of the child support formula—have not, in those six years, been carried out. 
Mr Robert Kelso says that jailing would exacerbate the high suicide rate among parents separated from their children. He says the CSA is a self-contained bureaucracy whose clients—that is, the non-custodial parents—have `no way out of the legal system.' He says that the 1994 inquiry into the CSA, read in conjunction with the Hansard of the time, clearly indicates systemic corruption by public servants whose objective was to minimise the cost to the Commonwealth of supporting single parents by welfare by maximising revenue from their non-custodial spouses. He said,
Neither the Labor government nor its Liberal successors have been interested in examining the behaviour of these public servants.
The proposal to have overseas court decisions binding on Australian citizens, without right of redress in an Australian court, is totally unacceptable. It casts a shadow over the Attorney-General's well-intentioned attempt to reform family law. The federal government has already encouraged separating couples to avoid, where possible, the Family Court, in favour of mediation and counselling, and discouraged litigation by cutting legal aid. The Attorney-General's overall idea is to create a streamlined federal magistrate service with a hefty startup budget of $30 million, to begin operating midyear, to partially sideline the Family Court, then make court orders enforceable so children would not be denied money or a relationship with their non-custodial parent—the biggest beefs on either side of the custodial divide. The proposed laws have appeased no-one.
The Attorney-General has been asked to answer questions on the legality or constitutionality of the legislation. He has declined to say how many children will be ensured a continuing relationship with their non-jailed parent and why he is handing more power to the judges of the Family Court and the Child Support Agency. The Attorney-General also declines to say whether jailed parents will be placed on suicide watch. The rate of suicide of non-custodial male spouses is five times greater than that of youths or females. Griffith University research psychologist Susie Sweeper, an expert on separation, says there are high levels of stress associated with the Family Court and the CSA. She says, `The accumulation of stress from not seeing children, low finances, litigation and a low level of social support can lead to psychopathology such as suicide. Some parents are very angry—that is certainly expressed.' 
The policy director of the CSA, Sheila Bird, said that Australians have much to be proud of, with 90 per cent of liabilities having been paid since the agency's inception. She claims that this is the world's best. She disputes doubts raised by men's groups about the honesty of the agency's review officers, and she disputes claims made by many paying parents that the formula used by the CSA is inflexible and fails to take into account individual circumstances. Bird says she does not know the suicide rate among paying parents.
The chairman of the 1994 committee on the child support scheme, Roger Price, said that no-one should think the CSA was set up for the benefit of children. He said its sole rationale was to save taxpayers' money by clawing back social security payments, as each dollar paid by a parent reduces the amount of social security paid to the recipient, and so it is not indicative of what is in the best interests of the children. He said that we have to find a less battering, bruising and financial crippling system.
I would like to move now to some cases that have been brought to my notice. A person, who I will refer to as `James', has four children aged between 10 and 15 years, and he sees them for more than 40 per cent of the time. He said:
I have done the right thing by my children. When my wife left me, she said I was too much of a family man. The impact the CSA has had on my children's lives has been pathetic. It has to be held accountable. I believe the time will come when children will take the CSA to court.
James has a back debt of $40,000. About $27,000 of this is penalty for late payment. He says this is a false debt because it was accrued after he lost his job—an $80,000 a year job—but a review from the agency kept him on that same salary. Last year the agency took his $4,500 tax refund. On Christmas Eve he received a letter informing him that his bank accounts had been swept and the money had been seized, including money from one of the accounts that was in trust for his children—$2,000—which James said took the children five years to save. He was absolutely outraged, and I believe that he has every right to be. He said:
I told the Child Support Agency I want that money to go into a similar account with similar objectives. 
The CSA's response was that they did not know where the money went, but that it was probably sent to the custodial parent. James said that the children themselves had been asking about the money that they had saved. He said, `What really gets under my skin is the injustice.'
In closing, I again indicate that One Nation will be moving a series of amendments to the government's bill, not to affect the responsibility of parents in supporting their children but to make the bill accountable to this parliament. What this bill does, in effect, is to neutralise the Senate's ability to debate freely an act of parliament on behalf of the Australian people that we represent. I believe that it is grossly unfair that a regulation that will have effect on sections of this bill has not been produced. We have not seen the regulation. We do not know how the department is even going to make provisions for changes in the exchange rate.

"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,2000-04-10,"—I thank senators for their contributions to the debate on the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill 2000. I particularly welcome the comment by Senator Faulkner that these measures are a step in the right direction. The previous Labor government found, as we have also found, that we are very much in the position of King Solomon when dealing with child support matters. It is extremely difficult dealing with two upset parents, and children who are being shared—or not shared, as the case might be—between them. The issue of money adds fuel to the fire. 
Nevertheless, when we were in opposition we were supportive of the recommendations that were made by the Price committee, which reviewed in 1994 the operation of the child support legislation. Senator Harris has not been here for very long, so he may not be aware of this, but since we have been in government we have been moving constantly forward, trying to implement as many of the Price committee's recommendations as possible. I think it is now fair to say that, while some people would still feel that there is more to be done, this government has implemented the majority of the recommendations made by that committee, either in whole where it has been possible or in part where that has been necessary. Having said that, this bill does have support from the three parties in the Senate—the government, the Labor Party and the Democrats—and I am sorry to think that Senator Harris does not see this as a measure that will improve the situation. It certainly will, in my view. 
I will refer very briefly to the issues that Senator Harris raised, but I will first give a bit of an overview. Australia's existing international child support enforcement arrangements are designed to deal solely with court ordered maintenance, which is being gradually replaced in Australia by administrative assessments. New arrangements which apply to administrative assessments are desirable, and I think everybody would agree with that statement. The amendments made by the bill enable Australia to become a party to three international maintenance agreements, which extends the range of countries with which Australia has treaty arrangements, providing for the enforcement of Australian maintenance liabilities. These agreements will replace or complement existing arrangements for the enforcement of child support and spousal maintenance liabilities. They oblige each country to provide in its laws for the recognition and enforcement of such liabilities. It is important to understand in that context that since we have been in government—and, once again, Senator Harris may not know this—we have changed the way in which treaties are dealt with in the constitutional process. In my view, it has been a considerable improvement that treaties now have to come before the parliament. They have to be endorsed, there has to be a consultative process with the states and territories and the committee of the parliament scrutinises any treaty that Australia is looking at signing. So there has been a considerable improvement in that area.
I will now turn to the regulation making power which is inserted into the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988, the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 and the Family Law Act 1975. This allows regulations to be made prescribing, in relation to countries with which Australia has maintenance enforcement arrangements, all matters relevant to the recognition and enforcement of child support and spousal maintenance liabilities. Some of the matters for which the regulations may prescribe include: the enforcement of administrative assessments as well as the continued enforcement of court orders and registered agreements; allowing the Child Support Agency to make an administrative assessment even though the payer is not resident in Australia and does not have an Australian taxable income; in the case of New Zealand, providing that the creation and variation of liabilities will be able to be undertaken only in the country where the payee is resident; obliging each country to assist in locating payers, serving notices and providing advice so that maintenance liabilities can be enforced; allowing the Child Support Agency to collect overseas maintenance liabilities which have not first been registered in an Australian court under the Family Law Act 1975; and requiring reciprocity in legislative presumptions of parentage. If ever there were measures which go to the benefit of children, I would have thought, Senator Harris, that those measures are very directly related to the wellbeing of children. 
I just want to speak briefly in reference to the Family Court and the Attorney-General. Senator Harris has spoken at some length about the Family Court and the Attorney-General, but I just draw the Senate's attention to the fact that we are debating Child Support Agency legislation here. It is not Attorney-General's legislation; it is from my portfolio. Maybe Senator Harris is not aware of the fact that the Child Support Agency has always had the ability to go to the Family Court to get an order where a payer has, for example, failed on repeated occasions to provide necessary information. Theoretically, a breach of that order could have resulted in a jail sentence, but I also point out that, during the whole history of the Child Support Agency, no-one has ever gone to jail. That is quite separate from the argument that it would appear Senator Harris has with the Attorney and his proposed changes to penalties in the Family Court for breach of orders. There has always been the ability to do that under the child support rules. 
It is important that these facts be on the table, because if ever there was an area where there has been a great deal of misinformation and misunderstanding it is the child support area. This is a scheme which Labor introduced but which this government has supported in opposition and has tried to improve in government. The child support area is an area where a great number of people who have gone through unhappy times in the break-up of their relationship transfer some of that unhappiness to their view of their treatment by the Child Support Agency, and I think that is unfair. Senator Harris mentioned Sheila Bird, a very senior adviser in the Child Support Agency. She has disputed claims of dishonesty and inflexibility. I think it is appropriate for me now to say that I believe that Sheila Bird is a fine officer. She has served the families of Australia well. She has been enthusiastically involved with this government in trying to implement reforms and improvements to the child support system and is very sympathetic to the needs of all parties in child support disputes. I would urge Senator Harris to think before he names a public official, as he did today when he named her.
I think it is perhaps best if we leave the rest of the debate to actually addressing the only amendments to the bill, which come from Senator Harris on behalf of the One Nation Party. The government will not be supporting any of the amendments and I would be happy, as the committee stage progresses, to give my reasons why.

"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2000-04-10,"—I present the 88th report of the Committee of Privileges relating to a person referred to in the Senate.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted. 
—I move:
That the report be adopted.
This report is the 33rd in a series of reports recommending that a right of reply be accorded to persons who claim to be adversely affected by being referred to either by name or in such a way to be readily identified in the Senate. On 30 March 2000, the President referred a letter from Mr N. Crichton-Browne to the Committee of Privileges as a submission under privilege resolution 5. The letter responded to comments made by Senator Knowles in the Senate in December last year. The committee considered the letter at its meeting on 6 April 2000 and recommends that the response be incorporated in Hansard. 
The committee reminds the Senate, as it did most recently when I presented the 87th report, that it does not judge the truth or otherwise of statements made by honourable senators or persons who seek redress. Its sole duty is to recommend that a relevant response be incorporated in Hansard and it neither judges the merits nor endorses the content of any such response. I commend the report to the Senate.
The response read as follows—
APPENDIX ONE
RESPONSE BY MR N. CRICHTON-BROWNE AGREED TO BY MR CRICHTON-BROWNE AND THE COMMITTEE OF PRIVILEGES PURSUANT TO RESOLUTION 5(7)(B) OF THE SENATE OF 28 FEBRUARY 1988
Pursuant to Resolution 5 (7) (b) of the Senate of 28 February 1988, I wish to raise with you the matter of Senator Knowles' speech in the Senate on 8 December 1999.
Senator Knowles speech is an untruthful, vicious and personal attack upon me. Senator Knowles allegations against me are in part a repetition of allegations for which she has previously unreservedly retracted and apologised in the Western Australian Supreme Court. Senator Knowles' speech repudiates her previous admissions in the Supreme Court.
Senator Knowles states in her speech:
I wish to set the record straight on the many statements and allegations contained in the article. It, like so many other articles written by Burns, claims that I have apologised for alleging that Crichton-Browne has made death threats against me. I have not.
That statement is untrue. The following statement was read by Senator Knowles' lawyer in the Western Australian Supreme Court on 21 October 1998:
“Statements that I made to various individuals and on the radio during 1995 have been construed by some as meaning that Mr Noel Crichton-Browne has made threats upon my physical safety by telephone. It was not my intention to convey that meaning. I unreservedly withdraw and retract the allegation that Mr Crichton-Browne threatened me on the telephone and unreservedly apologise to him for any damage, distress or embarrassment caused thereby.”
Senator Knowles states:
There is no person I have spoken to or interview I have done that says anything other than the fact that I sought police advice on security matters following two unidentified phone calls in the middle of the night that contained threats.”
“The article claims that I told Mincherton that I “had received death threats from Crichton-Browne at her homes in Perth and Canberra and was under police protection. All I can say to that is that Mincherton is totally dishonest and manipulative and well known for it in the party in Western Australia.”
My Counsel made the following statement in the Supreme Court in presenting the minute consenting to orders being made:
“Prior to the reading of that apology, it is important that the causes of action identified in the apology are identified in court, for two reasons: firstly, to ensure that the plaintiff has proper vindication for the apology ... and of course that is also an important consideration for the defendant that the apologies granted are identified in open court, because it is to those publications that the apology relates.”
“The first publication, your Honour, appears at page 2 and the publication is an allegation of sIander and it is a publication made to a Richard Mincherton and it was made in or about May of 1995 at the defendant's West Perth office. I wont read it all out, but the essence of the publication was. “Noel Crichton-Browne made life threatening threats to me by phone, and as a result of that I have sought police protection.”
Senator Knowles states that:
“The article claims, “she did not lodge a defence,” referring of course to me. This suggests that I did not prepare one. Wrong again. My defence was presented to Crichton-Browne and he immediately sought to have the matter settled because he did not wish to have it made public.”
Senator Knowles did not lodge a Defence and she never intended to. After her unsuccessful application to extend the time for lodging her Defence, was rejected by the Master of the Supreme Court, Counsel for Senator Knowles handed a document to my Counsel less than 24 hours before the deadline. Her Counsel stated that it had been prepared as Senator Knowles Defence but that Senator Knowles wanted to settle.
My Counsel responded that I would not accept a further delaying tactic. Senator Knowles Counsel informed my Counsel that the settlement could be completed within 24 hours because he had written an apology for Senator Knowles some weeks previously.
Senator Knowles states:
“That leads me to another question: why is it that Crichton-Browne is running the case against me by instructing the prosecuting solicitor instead of the complainants? I believe that to be a very serious abuse of due process by him exercising complete influence over the deliberations and direction of the Committee.
The Appeals and Disciplinary Committee of the Liberal Party of Western Australia is chaired by the State President. The members are, the President of the Legislative Council, a previous senior Minister and Leader of the Legislative council, the Hon George Cash; a member of the Legislative Assembly, Mr Chris Baker B.A.,LL.B.(Hons), Ms Julie Reay, a member of State Executive and Chairman of the Selection Committee; Dr David Honey, Immediate Past president of the Western Australian Liberal Party; Mr Richard Mincherton, a member of State Executive and Mr Brian Pontiflex LL.B.
I am not a member of the Liberal Party. As with Senator Knowles other claims, this one is as absurd as it is untrue.
“Many supporters have asked why I paid $20,000 to Crichton-Browne and have made the observation that doing so gave the appearance of guilt. To that I would say two things. Firstly, given my time again, I would do no such thing. Secondly, I wish to make it crystal clear that I have not pleaded guilty to anything; a casual observation of the events will illustrate that ... I wish I had my time over again, because I would never make such a judgment.”
Senator Knowles not only again denies the apology, retraction and admissions she made in the Western Australian Supreme Court, but she claims the facts of the case will illustrate that. Senator Knowles statement in the Senate is totally untrue. Further, my lawyers have written to Senator Knowles asking her to contact them for the purpose of refunding her $20,000 and recommencing proceedings. Senator Knowles has not responded.
Senator Knowles states;
“Once he [Mr Crichton-Browne] saw my defence he did not wish to have it made public. He knew it was true. As a consequence he did not wish the matter to proceed to court, where witnesses to his behaviour and attitude towards me would be called to give evidence”
Senator Knowles so called unfiled “defence” is a litany of untruths. In light of Senator Knowles behaviour since I agreed to her request to settle my action against her, I enthusiastically look forward to having the matter fully litigated in the Supreme Court. I made no approaches, no requests and no suggestions that I had the slightest interest in settling the matter with Senator Knowles and none were made either directly or indirectly on my behalf.
Senator Knowles states:
“The next question I am asked is: why did I apologise? I already covered that earlier when I mentioned the exact words of the apology.”
Senator Knowles did not mention the exact words in her speech in the Senate. What she said was “statements that I had made to various individuals and on radio during 1995 that have been construed by some et cetera.” That is a part of the first sentence of her apology. Senator Knowles neglects to read out the relevant words of her apology which are that: 
“I unreservedly withdraw and retract the allegation that Mr Crichton-Browne threatened me on the telephone and unreservedly apologise to him for any damage, distress or embarrassment caused thereby.”
Senator Knowles states:
The other question is: why were the terms of the settlement not made public until after the 3 October election last year? The answer is that that is what Crichton-Browne agreed to.” 
The response to this remarkable explanation for deceiving the public is that Senator Knowles demanded that her apology and retraction not be disclosed prior to election day so as to conceal her admissions of untruthfulness in the Supreme Court from the voters. Senator Knowles knew the voters would vote against her if they were aware that she had admitted in the Supreme Court to dishonesty.
Senator Knowles' Counsel advised my lawyer that her apology and retraction were conditional upon her admissions not being made public prior to the election day. My Counsel responded that I would not consider such a condition under any circumstances, however I was subsequently advised that the settlement would not be completed prior to election day. With that advice I was happy to have that demand publicly disclosed.

"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,2000-04-10,"—Yet again this is a further attempt by Crichton-Browne to abuse me. I am now entering my 13th year of abuse, vilification and harassment from this man, and, as I said in this place on a previous occasion, many thought when the party made its third decision in support of me and against his malicious, deceitful and dishonest claims that it would be the end of the matter. Unfortunately, I know him better than a lot of other people who make that claim but, clearly, it is not the case; and I have to resign myself to the fact that I will have this dishonest convicted criminal harass me until the day he dies. But at least the party and the public recognised long ago what he was attempting to do to me. 
Quite frankly, as the standing orders go, I do not see this material until it is tabled. Just a cursory glance at it now shows me that he is just rehashing everything that he has rehashed before, time and time again. Quite frankly, I cannot even be bothered responding in detail to this last truckload of abuse. No doubt he feels better, having done what he has done, and I am sure it will not be his last contribution. He is a particularly vicious, bitter and nasty man whose sole motivation in life is to harass and intimidate anyone who disagrees with him, his modus operandi, his conduct and his behaviour, and I am proud to be one of those people—one of a very large group. 
I advise the Senate that no amount of continual harassment will make me think otherwise or behave differently to this criminal, who just keeps on assaulting me in every way he possibly can. I just make those comments; I cannot even be bothered reading the letter because I can just see from a very brief look at it that it is all the same stuff trotted out over and over again —the same lies, the same dishonesty. If he wants to respond to that little lot, he can do so because I am fully expecting it and it will go on for years.

Ordered that the report be printed.
—by leaveI move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
In accordance with the reference from the Senate, the committee's inquiry was limited to the actual provisions of the bill itself. The bill, of course, is only one element in the package of government responses to the employee entitlements question, and the committee itself may have initiated a wider ranging inquiry. Indeed, on the same day as the Senate referred the provisions of the bill to the committee, I circulated to members a much broader number of questions into which the committee could inquire. Nevertheless, the committee's inquiry produced a wide range of opinions, which are reflected in its report. The committee advertised for submissions immediately it received its reference and, despite a very short time span in which it was required to report, received 14 submissions from a variety of individual organisations. Because of the short time available, the committee could only hold one public hearing on the bill. However, our hearing was lengthy, with eight members questioning the witnesses. Two of the groups of witnesses each appeared for more than an hour, with all of the participants being given the fullest opportunity to express their different views.
In summary, the committee believes that it received the broadest possible variety of opinion on the bill and is grateful for the detailed and comprehensive submissions and evidence. The committee is confident that the report reflects fully the extent and diversity of those views. I thank the committee secretary, Mr David Creed, and his staff for their work on this inquiry and the report, particularly given the very short time frame that the committee had to deal with the matter of this bill. They worked assiduously, efficiently and competently in assisting me to conduct the inquiry and put the report together. I commend the report to the Senate.

I advise the chamber that I will not be moving the fourth group of amendments as they relate to the first two groups that were defeated. In speaking to the third group of amendments, which I have just moved, I refer to what are normally described as the Henry VIII clauses. The government's proposed amendments, as they stand, will allow for the regulations to have a greater head of power than the bill from which they derive their head of power. I will be asking a series of questions of Senator Newman towards the latter part of my remarks. The regulations will result from a departmental order to implement the act. When that is done, the regulations will come into the chamber and be laid on the table for a period within which any senator can move a disallowance motion. But the problem is that we cannot make any amendments to the regulations. The regulations may contain beneficial provisions, but if there is one section that we find unacceptable the only recourse that we have is the ability to disallow them. The regulations will be prepared by the department and it is this department that causes me great concern. We have not seen the details of the proposed regulations. How can this chamber, in all good conscience, pass a bill which directly impacts on the content of legislation with little or no ability to dispute it?
I refer to Senator Faulkner's earlier comments which included a pretence to not understand some of the points that I was making. Whether this represents an inability to grasp them or whether it is simply a lack of interest is not easy to determine. However, I am grateful—as I am sure the Australian people are—to the senators who are highly informed for their input into the subject. Senators wax lyrical about deaths in custody and stolen generations and pour inappropriate scorn on Senator Herron, but they are indifferent to the deaths that are the result of decisions by the CSA—a suicide rate that is more than five times greater than that of indigenous Australians. It is a very serious problem that comes before the chamber, and senators should take a proper and reasonable interest in it.
I would now like to turn to the Henry VIII clauses and bring to the Senate's attention that the CSA is currently not bound by the rules of evidence. Indeed, CSA officers can, at their complete and unilateral discretion, create a case file which, once created, records information on a payee and a payer party without proof of evidence or corroboration. It cannot be that the government now wishes a domestic system such as this to now be exposed to the international arena. The Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills Alert Digest says:
Since its establishment, the committee has consistently drawn attention to Henry VIII clauses. While the explanation put forward in this case for this bill may provide a justification for including these particular provisions, the committee nevertheless remains concerned wherever subordinate legislation takes precedence over the primary legislation that creates it.
So the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills also has concerns about this section of the regulation. 
I would also like to quote from a section of the Australian Family Law Child Support Handbook in which it says in section PD97/1: 
The purpose of a conference is to allow each party to fairly and properly present the case to the senior case officer in an informal manner so that the senior case officer gains maximum relevant information.
It goes on to say under 4:
The proceedings are not officially tape recorded and there is no statutory requirement that an official record be taken by the decision maker.
I have concerns in relation to a communication from the Child Support Agency in which it states: 
The taping of changes of assessment hearings are not officially recorded, and private tape recording is specifically not permitted under practice direction PD97/1. CCU Australian Family Law Child Support Handbook. 
Due to copyright restrictions, extracts from the CCU handbook are not able to be supplied. It goes on to say:
However, you may make your own inquiries through avenues such as local libraries.
The point I am raising is that Senator Newman, through the bill that she is introducing, is going to give to this same agency far greater powers, I believe, than they have at the present moment.
I would also like to raise a couple of cases and, in doing so, put on the record that a good deal of the information and content on the issues that I have brought forward today were also raised by John Stapleton in the focus section of one of the newspapers yesterday. Let me briefly relate to the chamber some of the decisions that this agency, which is going to be charged with the responsibility of writing these regulations, made. These are some case examples that relate to its other decisions. This case was filed with the CSA by a mother who nominated a payer father—and in this case it was her husband—who was at the time living at home with the family and paying all the bills. The mother declared that separation had actually taken place some nine months prior to lodging the claim. 
With this information, which included only the mother's say-so and nothing else, the CSA Deputy Registrar took a position which deemed that not only did the father owe the relevant amount of child support but also he was already in default. To add to this deceit, the mother declared that her living-at-home husband was `whereabouts unknown'. So we have a situation in which the mother files the action and then lists the husband, who is residing in the same home, as `whereabouts unknown'. As a result, the CSA quietly accrued the debt against the father, who at no time had any knowledge that this was occurring. The CSA made no effort to investigate or verify the mother's claims and nor did it, in this instance, seek any proof. In addition to this important point, the CSA made no effort to contact the father.
I would like to put some questions to Senator Newman: is it responsible of the government to allow this agency to be involved to such a large degree in the development of regulations we have not even seen yet? I ask also whether, in the preparation of this bill, the department have made any provision for, or have they even assessed, the impacts on currency that may occur in relation to these regulations, because of changes in the exchange rate, when we have a payer who is a non-resident? Have the department assessed in any way the impacts of that? I would bring to the attention of the chamber some of the problems that the pastoral industry got into recently when applying for loans, et cetera, where they were caught not by the changes in interest rates but by the changes in the exchange rate. Senator Newman, how many times have these Henry VIII clauses, as we refer to them, been implemented previously in relation to legislation?",SENATE,<title>CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,2000-04-10,"—I will start and then get some more information for Senator Harris as I go on. I will just put on record what the history of this issue is. This bill we are debating tonight was intended to include the measures that are now going to be tabled as regulations. But, as most senators would recognise, there has been huge demands on the Office of Parliamentary Counsel over the last few months with the pressure of legislation, and they were unable to complete the work in time for a 1 July start-up for these measures. The problem was caused by an agreement between our Prime Minister and the New Zealand Prime Minister. They had agreed that the new arrangements would start up on 1 July. 
In order to honour that commitment, Australia is bringing forward some of the details by way of regulation. However, we have made it clear that these measures will be tabled, and Senator Harris will be able to scrutinise them. But they will also be brought into the legislation later in the year. If he does not like them then, Senator Harris will have the opportunity when they come forward later in the year in amending legislation to debate the issue and to move amendments if he chooses. I think that is not an unreasonable way of proceeding in what is a very tight timeframe not for the government but for the legislative draftsmen and also for Australia's reputation in making agreements with heads of other governments.
I think it is a practical solution. Having been a member of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee for a few years when I first came into the Senate, I am very familiar with the Henry VIII clause that Senator Harris read out. I can assure him that it is by no means unusual for the Scrutiny of Bills Committee to make that statement. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee has quite regularly said just what you read out tonight, Senator Harris, but it does not mean to say that there is something dreadfully devious about taking the action we are proposing. These are special circumstances, it will be for a very short period, until the legislative draftsmen can get what will come forward as regulations into an amending bill later on this year. I would have thought that was not unreasonable at all. You will certainly have that opportunity later in the year to deal with them when they come forward as amendments. I would suggest that by that stage, if they have been introduced as regulations, you will have had an opportunity to see how they actually work as well. Once again, I think that is eminently reasonable, and I hope you would agree. In addition, I am advised that where an overseas order—this is in relation to a specific query you made—is registered in Australia, the exchange rates at the time of registration apply. That is the existing law, and it will not change.",SENATE,<title>CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-04-10,"—I would just ask Senator Newman for clarification on that last point—that, when the order is initiated, there will be, I understand, a fixed rate of exchange. But my question went very specifically to the effects at a later date if that exchange rate changes. Does the order stay in relation to the initial exchange rate, or is it subject to variation?",SENATE,<title>CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,2000-04-10,—The existing law is that the exchange rate is as it is when the order is registered in Australia. The existing law will not change and the existing arrangements do not change. They will stay at the exchange rate at the time of the registration of the order.,SENATE,<title>CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-04-10,"—I would like to ask Senator Newman to bear with me, because I would like to have some assurance from her about provisions of the bill. I refer to section 163B of the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989, and the Henry VIII section of that bill; the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988 and the government's proposal under section 124A in relation to the Henry VIII clause; and section 124A of the Family Law Act 1975, and again the section referring to the Henry VIII clause in that act. Can Senator Newman assure the committee that the Child Support Agency will not be able to use those sections that carry the Henry VIII clause and implement them in respect of any other section of any of those three acts?",SENATE,<title>CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,2000-04-10,"—As you heard, Mr Temporary Chairman, this was a very long question and it was difficult to take it all in. Senator Harris had the benefit of having it in front of him; we were listening. Nevertheless, I am advised to draw his attention to regulation 21, conversion of currency, under the Family Law Regulations, part 2, General, where it says: 
21(1) Deemed reference to Australian currency rate of exchange. For the purposes of these regulations, an overseas order, including a provisional order or a certificate or notice originating in an overseas jurisdiction that refers to an amount of money expressed in the currency of the overseas country in which that jurisdiction is located, shall be deemed to refer to the equivalent amount in Australian currency on the date on which the order, whether by registration, confirmation or otherwise, becomes an enforceable order in Australia on the basis of the telegraphic transfer rate of exchange prevailing on that date.
All I can add to that, Senator—and that would be as difficult for you to take in as your question was for me to take in—is that I am advised that I can certainly assure you that there is no intention to change those arrangements.",SENATE,<title>CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-04-10,"—It is possibly that the complexity of what I was asking of Senator Newman may have caused her not to clearly understand, so I will try to articulate again. The question was not about currency. I was asking whether the minister can assure the committee and the Australian people that the Child Support Agency will not be able to use subsection (3) in relation to the Henry VIII clause in the government's proposed amendments in the three acts that I have read out. My understanding is that that pertains only to that section of the regulation. What I am seeking from Senator Newman is clarification that the Child Support Agency cannot use that ability to override the head of power of the act in any other section of the act.",SENATE,<title>CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,2000-04-10,"—I would try to answer Senator Harris to this effect: on page 3 of the Child Support Legislation Bill 2000, Schedule 1—Amendments, clause 2, subsection (3), it is proposed that:
Regulations made for the purposes of this section:
(a) may be inconsistent with this Act;
It is in the circumstances which we have just been talking about. I was explaining the reasons for it. I can give you an assurance that it applies in relation to the heading, `163B Regulations in relation to overseas-related maintenance obligations etc'. Is that the answer you are seeking?
—Yes.
—Right. I think we have come to finality. Thank you.",SENATE,<title>CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-04-10,"—Thank you, Senator Newman. That does clarify that very clearly for me. I would also like to seek clarification from Senator Newman in relation to the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. Under section 49A, it says:
... except as provided by this subsection, make provision for or in relation to a matter by applying, adopting or incorporating any matter contained in an instrument or other writing as in force or existing from time to time.
I cannot see any reference to section 49A of the Acts Interpretation Act in Senator Newman's bill. My question is: do the Henry VIII clauses in those three acts require in any way that they refer to section 49A of the Acts Interpretation Act? If they do, is there a requirement for an amendment to acknowledge that that is where it attains its head of power from?",SENATE,<title>CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,2000-04-10,"—I thought that the Clerk might have understood these matters better. Essentially, Senator Harris is asking for me to give him a legal opinion. Of course, that is not my role and nor should I attempt to do so. If he has any concerns about the legalities of these measures, then that is a matter for another forum and not for the Senate today.",SENATE,<title>CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-04-10,"—Just for clarity, I was in no way asking Senator Newman for a legal opinion. It is obvious that the senator is not aware of that section of the Acts Interpretation Act. I was merely asking whether she understood, or whether her advisers knew, whether that section of the bill complies with that sanction. I am not asking for an answer. I am clearly stating that I was not asking for a legal opinion but whether the government's proposed amendments are in compliance with 49A. ",SENATE,<title>CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,2000-04-10,"—Out of courtesy to Senator Harris, I will say once more—this is surely for the last time—that this is not a matter for determination and advice. You essentially are asking for a legal opinion in the chamber, but I must rely, as would any minister, on the expertise of the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. Their job is to take such matters into account and not bring forward legislation which contravenes the Acts Interpretation Act. Beyond that, I cannot advance your discussion. Perhaps we have taken a lot of time on this issue that cannot be taken further in this forum.

"Denman, Sen Kay",ALP,2000-04-10,"—I rise to speak on the A New Tax System (Family Assistance and Related Measures) Bill 2000, which is part of the government's package to change the tax system and to do away with the profound effects on many families. The families in my area of the north-west coast of Tasmania represent a disproportionately large section of lower income recipients. There are many factors influencing this. Economic restructuring has often unintentionally resulted in what could be called a geographical void of economic activity and thus opportunity. Therefore, we have many families reliant on social security—unskilled workers, low paid workers and seasonal and temporary workers. This often means that their incomes vary from week to week. As this does not fit nicely into the bureaucratically arrived at demands, they will be disadvantaged.
These families are not in the position to assess their incomes in advance. At present, fee relief is based on income in the last completed tax year, but from 1 July this will have to be done for the year ahead, with no margin for error. How can those on the north-west coast who are low income earners or casual or part-time workers do this? On the north-west coast of Tasmania, a large proportion of the work is seasonal. This is directly related to a rural based economic structure, thus for those people with jobs such as picking and grading brussels sprouts, potatoes, onions, apples and pears, it is difficult to assess their incomes because there is no set hour. Many things can interfere with it. Often the amounts they earn are calculated by the amount picked or graded. Inclement weather can stop work, and so can the breakdown of machinery. All this can affect the income not only from week to week but from day to day, thus forward projections of income are impossible.
As their incomes are so variable, one could reasonably assume that, when the forward estimates of incomes starts, seasonal and casual workers are highly likely to be exposed to bureaucratic errors that could cause undue and unreasonable stress on them and their families. Currently 32 per cent of all family payments received have been found to be in error. This figure has arisen because something is wrong with the system. It has nothing to do with the honesty of Australian families. These numbers are most likely to increase because the workers concerned have no way of knowing how long their hours will be. Thus the most likely scenario for the many of the workers on the north-west coast of Tasmania will be a debt to Centrelink—a present at tax time. Remember that this debt will be incurred due to ill-conceived bureaucratic demands that are unable or unwilling to take into account the needs of many of the workers in rural communities—so much for client centred services. 
The government have, time and time again, campaigned on a family values platform. Surely one of the principal foundations of stability in an essentially capitalised based economy is a guaranteed access to capital. Many of us have heard accounts of families under real stress due to what amounts to a few dollars a week. Many of these families that I am speaking of in the area where I live really do live from week to week. They do have very basic incomes, they do not have permanent employment, and this causes a lot of concern for them. Will this mother be one of these mentioned on the 7.30 Report by Pam Cahir from the Early Childhood Association? Pam Cahir said:
Some parents are being forced out of the workforce. We do know that. They don't want to be out of the workforce, they want to be in the workforce, but it costs too much and it's cheaper for them to cut back days and to stay at home.
Some of the families in my area have cut back days and some of them have given up work because, firstly, they do not want to use backyard care—care that is not accredited—for their children, nor do they want to make too many demands on grandparents. They do not mind leaving their children with a grandparent maybe one day a week, but they really do not want to leave them. They feel that it is unfair, and I have had many people in the office who have told me this. The government's voice of mutual obligation is extremely feeble. They do not want welfare dependent people but they are unwilling to adequately fund the structures and supports needed to maintain independence with dignity.
Child Care Australia reports closure of 280 centres since 1996 and a Productivity Commission report shows a reduction of just over 10 per cent in spending on child care per hour between 1995-96 and 1997-98. The implications of the government's response to child care are further supported by Roberta Ryan from the University of New South Wales who said on the 7.30 Report:
We became very aware that the changes that the Government made for funding arrangements for child care were having significantly negative effects ... Average income earners are increasingly finding child care unaffordable.
Why are numerous parents, industry representatives and academics complaining when, according to the minister, there has been a growth in places and centres? Are all these people simply making it up to annoy the minister? Remember the minister's response: 
Well, they should believe me, because I'm from the Government. 
If we are to believe the minister, why were the figures showing a drop in numbers of child-care services and places from June to December 1998 not mentioned?
The opposition is not convinced that the GST compensation provided in the family assistance legislation will be sufficient to compensate families for the increased costs they will face from 1 July. For that matter, families are already paying GST on services, such as insurance policies which extend beyond 1 July. Having heard and read evidence from the community groups, consumer advocates, academics and expert witnesses, I do not believe that the government's compensation measures are based on realistic assumptions about how families spend their meagre amounts. As a tax on consumption, the GST will hit families particularly hard. A whole range of goods and services has never been taxed before, including school uniforms and bus fares. These will be taxed at 10 per cent. The tax will also apply to utility bills. Families on ordinary incomes already find gas, electricity and phone bills are major items in their budget. Having 10 per cent added to these bills will not be eased much by an additional $350 a year.
One of the inherent problems with the ideologically driven economic agenda is the inability to allow for the specific needs of distinct economic regions. Tasmania has individual economic needs, largely through no fault of its own. Small economies are disadvantaged by efficiency drives as the scope for savings is not as great due to the laws pertaining to the economic scales. Community based not for profit providers largely serve our child-care industry. They actually account for the needs of 80 per cent of those requiring child-care services in my state. Thus the claims of 20 per cent fee increases are not dishonest in the Tasmanian context, as the minister, Senator Newman, would have us believe. The minister rightly stated that the 20 per cent increases are based on only one of the small and more expensive community sectors. Minister, in Tasmania, they represent 80 per cent of the providers. 
Since the removal of the operational subsidy, many centres in Tasmania have had to increase fees. The first increase was $20 a week in 1996, followed by increases of $5 a week every year after that. Thus fees in Tasmania have increased by as much as $40 a week since the government came to power. One parent on the north-west coast said, `We have two children in full-time care which costs us twice what we would pay if we sent them to a private school. I cannot understand the logic of the proposed increased funding for private schools when the cost of child care is not addressed.' The family tax benefit and the child-care benefit, which are the central focus of this bill, will simply not compensate families for their GST losses and fail yet again to give back what the government has taken away.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FAMILY ASSISTANCE AND RELATED MEASURES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-04-10,"—I rise to speak at the second reading stage of the A New Tax System (Family Assistance and Related Measures) Bill 2000, which is a piece of legislation that predominantly builds on the family assistance act that was passed last year around the end of June and is obviously built into and related to the new tax system. At that time the Democrats supported that legislation as part of a positive component of the new tax system that the government was putting forward. It was positive for a range of measures, not least of which was the simplification that was involved in its bringing together, into a smaller number of payments, a large number of existing payments. It pulled them together into just two or three payments.
The purposes or aims of this bill, according to the explanatory memorandum put out by the government, are to provide the administrative infrastructure to support the payment of child-care benefit, to clarify the operation of various aspects of the family assistance law, to replace regulation making powers with substantive provisions, to insert relevant savings and transitional provisions, and to make other miscellaneous technical amendments. That is a very general way of describing what is a very large piece of legislation, going to a little bit over 300 pages. Virtually all of those aims or purposes the Democrats would support as building on the initial legislation, the purpose of which the party also supported.
There is one issue relating to the new family tax benefit and how it will be applied in shared caring arrangements. That is an issue of particular interest and concern to the Democrats that will be explored further, I am sure, in the committee stage of the debate. I know that some amendments have been circulated by the opposition in relation to that. I think the other issues raised as part of that are significant ones. They are ones that I will not comment on at the moment because they are more appropriate for in-depth exploration at the committee stage, where aspects of them could do with further elaboration, exploration and clarification. I expect the overall aspect of the legislation comes under the description of `clarifying the operation' of various aspects of the family assistance law. That is a nice general phrase but what it means in practice, in terms of its impact on people, is something that it is important to make clear before such measures are passed. Certainly, the committee stage of the debate is more appropriate for that aspect of this bill.
Given the enormity of the change—and it is a very significant change, shifting such a large number of payments into a smaller number and in many ways increasing the interface between the social security system and the tax system—it is not surprising that we do get, and have to deal with, a large piece of legislation. Indeed, this bill, which is meant to be—or purported to be—and was put forward as a predominantly administrative bill, has nonetheless about 300 pages. When we look back at the predominant act that it is relating to and the very significant and wide-ranging changes that were made in that, it is not surprising that attempts to try to assess all the various ramifications of such changes can prove very difficult. From the Democrats' perspective, as often is the case with bills amending social security law, we have received a number of representations, some of which relate to quite minor matters in the grand scheme of things. Nonetheless, any issue that may negatively impact on a small number of people still needs proper clarification and examination. 
In relation to this bill, the Democrats have chosen to take an approach where, while we recognise most of those issues as areas of potential concern, we also recognise the potential urgency of this matter and also the complexity of the overall primary legislation and so have chosen not to pursue a lot of those through amendments or indeed even through extensive questioning in the committee stage of this debate. With virtually every piece of legislation, let alone social security legislation, governments tend to suggest that every bill is urgent, every bill is immediate, every bill would be facing impending peril if it were not passed forthwith and that they really cannot afford to have things mucked around by the parliament putting forward proposed amendments to improve it or to address potential negative consequences or anomalies. Normally, I look on such claims very sceptically. But with this particular bill, because of the need to ensure that the new family assistance regime does operate as smoothly as possible and is in place and ready to go on 1 July, I will give that a bit more credence than I normally would.
Obviously, the enhanced family assistance regime is integral to the overall package of measures that is meant to ensure positive outcomes overall for people when we move to the new tax system. Whilst it is probably not correct to describe some aspects of the family assistance regime as compensation measures, nonetheless, when we look at the whole tax package and all the various modellings that were done by a range of people—at the time and subsequently—about the impacts of the new tax package, the effect of the GST and related measures, we see that one central component of modelling the overall, final outcome of winners and losers relates to the family assistance package and particularly the new family tax benefit. That being the case, it is appropriate on this particular occasion not to impede the progress of that over some of the areas of concern. Some of them relate to such issues as residency, access by people in particular circumstances under particular visas to be able to get certain payments, and some of the changes in approach that may occur in dealing with a payment that is now, in effect, being deemed to be a payment through social security.
Even though people can claim it through the tax system at the end of the year, there will undoubtedly be circumstances where some anomalies and changes of circumstance will apply to people. That is inevitable when you are collapsing 12 payments down to three. But I think some of those are ones that can be considered in an ongoing way, whether through further amending legislation or through other processes internally within the government. In that context, hopefully the government will recognise that the Democrats have chosen not to raise a range of amendments to areas that are linked to concerns that have been raised. However, the particular issue of shared care arrangements is one that seems to us to be quite a significant change that at this stage we cannot ascertain as being present in the primary legislation or as being flagged in any way at the time through second reading speeches or any other clear mechanism of the government that made people aware of the significance of the change. 
The initial act was put through at a time when obviously very major changes were being made to the overall tax system and the ability to scrutinise all its potential impacts was somewhat more limited. Nonetheless, as I said, if there are potential negative impacts to small areas, they are ones that can be assessed once the scheme comes into operation. But it does seem, on examination of the issue by the Democrats to date, that the proposed changes affecting shared care arrangements specifically contained in this bill that, as far as I can ascertain, were not contained in the original bill are ones that do deserve significant examination and they are ones that we would be keen to see elaborated on further and scrutinised further during the committee stage of this particular debate, that being one of the primary purposes of having a committee stage of a debate: to examine a bill and its impacts in detail on any area of concern. So I certainly flag that as an area that we are strongly interested in. I also re-emphasise that, whilst other areas may be of concern to us, we have chosen not to pursue them at this time because of the nature of the bill and the time lines. I recognise the inevitable complexity of making a change of this nature, so they are changes we will pursue at a more leisurely pace, if you like, without in any way suggesting that we are ignoring them or not prepared to continue to follow them through.  
We do flag an interest and a particular concern in relation to the impact of the carer arrangements for the family tax benefits and what effect that may have on the overall entitlements of quite a significant number of people in the Australian community. In all the modelling that was done before, during and after the agreement on the tax package, as far as I am aware there was no modelling done that took into account the impact of a reduction in overall family tax benefit payments for primary care givers in shared care arrangements. That is something that I think needs to be examined further, because obviously those people that agreed with the tax package did so after having paid very close attention to the modelling that was done at that time and ensuring that people—particularly in some of the more disadvantaged groups, and sole parents are clearly amongst those—were not going to be in a position where they were worse off. The potential impact on sole parents of a change in the entitlement to shared care arrangements does link specifically to whether or not those people would be worse off overall, and that is something that does need appropriate scrutiny before the change is agreed to. Clearly in this bill that change is proposed, and that is something that does need scrutiny. I look forward to being able to do so further in the committee stage of the debate.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FAMILY ASSISTANCE AND RELATED MEASURES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-04-10,"—This bill, the A New Tax System (Family Assistance and Related Measures) Bill 2000, is the last in the package of family assistance bills. The main legislation passed last year established the new family tax benefits A and B and the child-care benefit. This final bill has no real central theme but makes a large number of amendments to existing legislation, particularly the family assistance and family assistance administration acts, to specify administrative arrangements particularly for the child-care benefit and to correct anomalies that have been discovered since the 1999 legislation was enacted. I noticed as I sat here that there were some extra amendments to be moved by the government along the way as well.
While there may not be a dominant central theme to the bill, Labor's view of the family assistance package is that it fails to counterbalance the increased costs that the GST will impose on family budgets or to compensate for the higher child-care costs that have resulted from four years of funding cuts to that program by this government. The bill must be seen in the context of the GST and of the government's record on family services since 1996. Viewed in that perspective, the gains for families look much less generous than the government would have people believe. When examined in detail, a number of particular problems with the payment systems become apparent. I note Senator Bartlett's comments, because I think there is a problem in trying to deal with some of those issues in this bill. The complexity of the package and the fact that a lot of the legislation has already passed make it very hard to try and pull out particular measures.
Labor will not oppose the bill, but we are convinced, on the evidence that has already been considered by the Senate in the GST inquiry and elsewhere, that the compensation that the bill provides is grossly inadequate. The GST will impose a major new tax burden on family necessities such as clothing, many foods, public transport fares and utilities—things that have never been taxed before. The compensation is based on assumptions about price increases that the Treasury has already been forced to revise upwards. The real impact of the GST will be known in three months time.
We have opposed this tax from the beginning, and we put on record again our belief that this massive tax mix switch to consumption taxes will have a serious impact on low- and middle-income families who have to spend most of their income. Compared to the scale of the GST, which will tax necessities of life that have never been taxed before, the benefits introduced by the family assistance legislation package are inadequate. Labor supports the simplification of child-care benefits but is not convinced that the small increase in benefits will be enough to restore the child-care fee relief that has been ripped off parents in the last four years. The government's tax package brings a massive tax mix switch from low- and middle-income earners to higher income earners in Australia.  
The government has channelled all its energies into the delivery of a package which makes life tougher for Australian families. Make no mistake: the insidious GST is a tax on families. At the same time, this government hands out its tax relief disproportionately to the well off. It puts a new tax on gas and electricity bills, on school lunches and uniforms, on baby bottles and breast pumps, on haircuts and public transport. The tax will also apply to utility bills. Families on ordinary incomes already find gas, electricity and phone bills a major item in their budget. Having 10 per cent added to these bills will be a major burden which will not be eased much by the sort of money that the governments is offering in compensation. The GST reaches into every corner of Australian family life. The poorer the family, the more income they devote to life's bare necessities, and the more that is clawed away from them.
Before the Democrats say that their deal improves the lot of low-income families, they should check the numbers. The Democrats' deal with the government improved the lot of the poorest family with two kids by 99c per week. The deal makers and the Democrats were prepared to settle for an extra dollar per week, and then claimed that the gain of $1 made the original ANTS package fairer for families. We think the government have frittered away a surplus on tax cuts to the wealthy. It is important to ask whose surplus they have grandly thrown away. This was a surplus generated by families. It was built from harsh cuts to child care, health, education and community services. They took services away from the families in greatest need of support and handed the proceeds to the rich—a straight redistribution of funds from the poor to the rich.
—Why do you mislead the Senate? You constantly repeat that lie.
—Minister, would you like to have a go?
—Yes.
—At the end of my speech, please join the debate. You are not proud of your record on child care because you have been rolled in cabinet time and time again. You take away from the poor and you redistribute to the rich. All of the tax cuts, all of the benefits, go to the top end of town. We have found out in the last few weeks—as shown by all those ads you are putting on TV—that the benefits are not being delivered as you promised and that a lot of assumptions have been proved to be false. I shall come to that soon and, Minister, you will have your turn later. It is the low- and middle-income families, working families, who have made sacrifices for years, who have borne the burden and have suffered the government cutbacks. On 1 July, they will be thumped again. Australians on low and middle incomes have been asked to take on trust the assertion that the government's compensation measures will not be rapidly eroded by inflation over time. Yet Treasury officials have, effectively, confirmed that compensation to pensioners will disappear over time. Australian families have been asked to take on trust that the GST will stay at 10 per cent forever. The commitment denies the international experience. Wherever the GST has gone, its rate has risen. Moreover, the idea that the need for a unanimous agreement between the states and the Commonwealth will protect families from a creeping GST is dishonest in the extreme. A Commonwealth law can be changed by the Commonwealth parliament, and the states' opinions will, of course, be irrelevant.
The opposition do not believe the government's claim that the GST will, on average, increase prices by less than two per cent. We are not alone in that view. The host of expert witnesses who gave evidence to the tax inquiry do not believe it. Leading economists have dismissed this assumption and have shown that, by underestimating the price increase, the government has overstated the gains and understated the losses arising from the tax package. In their evidence to the Senate hearings, Professors Ann Harding and Neil Warren, charged by the committee to examine the distributional implications of the package, showed that there would be hidden losers from the tax package. The opposition were not surprised to hear that chief among the hidden losers would be those on low incomes. Nor does the Australian public believe that prices will rise by only 1.9 per cent. As 1 July draws closer, the government is losing the faith. The Prime Minister promised before the last election that the price of the average new car would fall by eight per cent, but his industry minister, Senator Minchin, told the Senate estimates on 7 February this year: 
We do not dictate prices. It is a matter for the manufacturers and the dealers and everybody else in terms of their pricing as to what the ultimate price will be. 
The Prime Minister also promised that there would be no more than a 1.9 per cent rise in ordinary beer, but Treasury officials have admitted that beer prices over the bar will rise by more than seven per cent. Australians cannot afford to take this government and its assumptions and claims on trust.
The benefits that this legislation introduces are feeble compensation for such a far-reaching tax. Family tax benefit A, which replaces family allowance and family tax payments, provides up to $140 a year more for each dependent child. The government also claims that family tax benefit B, which replaces assistance for parents who are caring for children, provides approximately $300 extra per annum for single income families with dependent children aged under five. But, having heard the evidence given by community groups, consumer advocates, academics and other expert witnesses, I do not believe that the government's compensation measures are based on realistic assumptions about how families spend their income. The noted Australian National University demographer Professor Peter McDonald calculated that the GST compensation was based on the premise that a child will cost a family only an extra 30c a week in GST costs. As a tax on consumption, the GST will hit families particularly hard. Behind the pro-family rhetoric of the government are distinctly anti-family policies such as this new tax on the necessities of life. Labor will pass the compensation measures contained in this bill, but we continue our opposition to the introduction of the GST.
While Labor is not convinced that the government is providing adequate compensation for the price effects of the GST, there are also some quite specific problems with the GST compensation mechanisms, particularly for family tax benefit part B. Three months before the introduction of the GST, the measures which are supposed to provide compensation for price effects are being exposed as inadequate. Only last week it was revealed that family tax benefit B, which will replace the parenting payment for single income families, contains what one newspaper called with considerable understatement `an unintended consequence of the new simplified system'. In fact, tens of thousands of women on maternity leave will not receive family tax benefit part B because of the design of the income testing system. The payment is worth a maximum of $101 per fortnight and is available to both two-and one-parent families. The upper income threshold for the payment is $10,416 per annum.
The problem arises because family tax benefit B will be based on an estimation of income in the current financial year rather than the fortnightly assessments which apply to parenting payment. In a case study prepared by the opposition, the effects of this relative inflexibility are illustrated. If a woman takes a year's maternity leave from December 1999 and returns to work in January 2001, she notifies Centrelink that she expects to earn more than $10,416 in the 2000-01 financial year. Because of her earnings in the first half of 2001, when she will be back at work, she will be denied family tax benefit part B throughout the 2000-01 financial year, even though she will not be receiving any wages in the first half of it—that is, in the period July to December 2000. Under the current system her income would be assessed fortnightly, so she would not be penalised in the second half of 2000 for income she has not yet received. The inequity of this measure is illustrated by the fact that a woman whose maternity leave coincides with the financial year avoids the income test altogether. Labor see this measure as unfair and ill designed. Given the complexity of the family assistance package, however, it seems impossible to be able to amend this provision. We urge the government to have another look at this issue to see how it might be solved. 
Labor also has some serious concerns about the bill's impact on the family tax benefit entitlements of custodial parents whose care of a child is shared with the estranged partner. These measures are not connected with the GST so much as with policy on the interaction of the child support and social security systems. Senator Bartlett alluded to them earlier in his contribution. Previously, family payments could be divided only once the non-custodial parent had a share of at least 30 per cent of the care. As I understand it, this was not enshrined in legislation but in regulation. A successful Federal Court challenge to these regulations has meant that, in practice, sharing of payments has occurred once any sharing of care takes place. This bill seeks to legislate for a minimum 10 per cent threshold. 
The most critical issue raised by this measure is the level of care at which sharing of payments should commence. There is a number of precedents and arguments for standardising the threshold at 30 per cent. Child support payments are not reduced until the non-resident parent is providing care for the child or children for 30 per cent of the time. The current family tax initiative also operates with a 30 per cent threshold test. Labor believe that family payments should be brought into line with these standards. We are yet to see a justification for putting the rules for family tax benefit part B out of line with the other family payment systems. This measure represents a decision on the part of the government to set the threshold at 10 per cent as opposed to 30 per cent. 
Labor remain opposed to this change on several grounds. Firstly, we recognise that the overwhelming burden of costs in raising a child will be borne by the custodial parent in most cases unless care is shared to a significant extent. Where children spend less than 30 per cent of their time being cared for by the non-custodial parent, it can reasonably be expected that the custodial parent will provide a room, clothes and all the other supports. This will extend to the provision of support for a travelling child—that is, when the child visits the non-custodial parent, clothes and other items will be supplied by the custodial parent and cleaned by the custodial parent. Therefore, we are concerned that the government's lowering of the threshold for shared care will reduce the financial means of custodial parents despite their having to meet the great majority of the costs of raising that child.
A second issue arises from reducing the threshold. The government claims this measure will give effect to 1996 family law reforms. Labor's view, however, is that far from encouraging a non-custodial parent to take a significant caring role—that is, 30 per cent or greater—the measures will financially reward those who undertake a minimum level of care. Practically, sharing of care will often be less disruptive where the non-custodial parent is able to provide a greater, rather than a lesser level of care. This measure does not encourage non-custodial parents to take on a greater level of care. 
In the committee stage, Labor will move to amend the bill to set the threshold for shared care at 30 per cent. Senator Bartlett has flagged the interest of the Democrats in the proposition, so it will be interesting to hear a fuller explanation from the minister as to justification of the government's proposal for a 10 per cent threshold. Our amendment would establish 30 per cent as the normal threshold for shared care, but we would allow the department to split family tax benefit entitlements for care burdens of less than 30 per cent, provided that a number of conditions were met. The secretary would have to determine that the child was eligible for family tax benefit, that a claim had been made by the non-custodial parent, that the claim was justified and that both parents agreed to the claim. The requirement for agreement is in line with current administrative practice, where the department does recognise care burdens of less than 30 per cent, but only if both parents agree that this is a fair division of responsibility. Agreement is obviously a key element that is missing from the government's bill. It is unlikely that a financial inducement to share care is the basis for more effective parenting where partners are separated. These matters need to be negotiated in good faith. 
Another of the provisions in this bill concerns the social security appeal rights. The government is making yet another attempt to hamper the appeal rights of Centrelink clients. The opposition and the Democrats have successfully defeated such attempts in the A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Bill 1999 and the Social Security (Administration) Bill 1999 in respect of time limits on internal appeals and appeals to the SSAT. This bill would require any new evidence that came before the Social Security Appeals Tribunal to be referred back to the original decision maker. We think that adding this extra step will only make appeals more time consuming and complicated. Nor are we convinced that referring evidence back to the original decision maker is necessary in order that the evidence be properly examined. If the tribunal is qualified to examine the appeal case, then it is capable of examining any new evidence on that case. In committee we will move an amendment to preserve the current arrangements whereby the tribunal would consider any new evidence on its merits.
In addition to the specific problems with the family tax benefit part B and maternity allowance, and with the appeal rights issue, Labor has serious concerns about the requirement for families to estimate their annual income when applying for family tax benefit. Technically, no-one will be forced to make an estimate; people can opt to receive the FTB in a lump sum at the end of the year. But in reality all but high-income families will need to receive the benefit fortnightly, and that will require them to estimate their future income. Increasingly, workers' hours are becoming more unpredictable and estimating income has become much harder.
The government seems to have learned nothing from the debt problem caused by income estimation for other family benefits. An audit of DSS debts in the December quarter of 1998 found that more debts were raised for family payments than for any other payment type. Thirty-two per cent of family payments were found to be in error, and the average debt for each family was $1,000. The government has been criticised in reports by the Ombudsman and the Auditor-General for placing an unfair burden of compliance on families in respect of the extremely complex rules which govern their payments. 
Furthermore, current Centrelink rules allow a 10 per cent margin of error. Labor is particularly concerned that this bill would allow no margin of error whatsoever. I place on record that the estimation provisions of the legislation are likely to increase the problems of families facing debts to Centrelink. This is not our idea of tax and welfare reform. We think we will need to monitor it closely, but I think the government ought to have a rethink about that issue as well.
If I had more time, I would address some comments to the child-care benefit changes that the government is introducing. They are an important part of the legislation in this package. Because I am running out of time, I would like to say that, while we support the general thrust of the changes regarding the amalgamation of child-care assistance and the child-care cash rebate, I have a number of concerns about some of the claims made by the government on behalf of those measures. I suppose the best thing for me to do is raise those in the committee stage to get an explanation from the minister, but my central point is that these changes have to be taken in the context of the government's overall policy in relation to child care and its record over the last few years, particularly in relation to indexation. Effectively, three years indexation has not been passed on to families and will be wrapped up as an increase in funding in this measure but, in fact, we are only compensating them for indexation denied previously.
In conclusion, Labor will be supporting the thrust of the bill, but we have a range of concerns, some of which are not able to be addressed by amendments, but those which can will be addressed by amendment in the committee stage.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FAMILY ASSISTANCE AND RELATED MEASURES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2000-04-10,"—In rising also to speak on A New Tax System (Family Assistance and Related Measures) Bill 2000, I wish to focus my comments this evening on the implications of the bill for child-care services for Australian families. The bill makes a number of changes to the way families receive support for child-care services. The bill changes the current child-care assistance and child-care cash rebate structures, which will be rolled into one payment—the child-care benefit. Labor supports the amalgamation of the two payment structures into one. The other simplifications in the bill, including the elimination of the fee ceiling and the minimum fee, will simplify payment arrangements. We will also support the institution of the 10 per cent increase in support for part-time care, acknowledging the impact that reduction to 50 hours work related care had, especially on the long day care sector. I am aware of many day care centres which stopped providing part-time care after 1996 because of the costs associated with staffing for that care, even though the reality is that more and more families are requiring and demanding part-time care. 
The bill changes the rate at which child-care benefit will be paid. Through this bill, the government has raised the level of payment for child-care benefit. The result of the amendments has been assessed by Don Siemon and Greg Ford in their article `Improving child care subsidies', published in Brotherhood Comment in 1999. They say the net benefit for lower income families using long day care centres will be $1—yes, only $1—per week. Since the election of the Howard government, the average weekly cost of child care has risen by at least $20. This bill realigns the support for families to the level that was provided in 1995. Unfortunately, it does not recognise or redress the erosion of support in the intervening four years. Unfortunately, the bill does not take the opportunity to redress the problems in the child-care sector originating from this government's introduction of the 50-hour cap on work related care. This measure has effectively resulted in families not having support for one-fifth of the care they have to pay for. Consequently there have been many cases where families have had to remove children from formal care arrangements or move children to care arrangements that they would prefer not to use.
This brings me to the issues around the funding of child care over the past few years. Senator Newman regularly stands up in this chamber and tells us that child-care funding has not been cut over the last four years. This is patently untrue, as her own annual reports attest. Actual spending has fallen from $1,066 million in the government's first budget in 1996-97 to $999.4 million in the second 1997-98 budget and fell again in the most recently completed budget to $935.7 million. In answer to a question on notice in Senate estimates in 1997, the Howard government confirmed that it intended to cut funding to child care over the period from 1996 to 2001 by a total of $851 million. It is wrong and it is unfair to the sector and to its user families that Senator Newman continually and incorrectly fudges the figures. It is time the government faces up to the fact that it always had the agenda of decreasing funding to child care with impacts on families, on the small businesses supplying child care—both those operated by the community sector and those operated by private providers—and to the workers in the child-care sector.
Through the implementation of this bill, families will decide how they will receive their child-care benefit—either paid directly to an approved child-care service or paid annually in arrears directly to the parents. It is our view that almost all families will opt for having their child-care benefit paid directly to the child-care service. Most families using child care are strictly managing budgets on a week-to-week basis. They are not able to wait until the end of the financial year to receive one payment for their child-care support. 
The bill will require families to predict their annual income for the purposes of claiming their child-care benefit. This provision requires families to estimate their annual income in advance with no margin for error. The government is well aware of the difficulties this structure provides, especially for families on low and middle incomes. It is very clear that only families on high incomes—that is, some of the families who currently receive only the child-care cash rebate—will claim support for the year past. They can afford to pay their child care on a weekly basis without the support measures included. They will be able to avoid the errors in their claims, but those who are required to predict their income will unfortunately make mistakes in estimating their incomes with the result that they may end up with a debt to the government. The government knows the dangers that estimating income in advance brings to families. Existing income estimation rules have resulted in tens of thousands of debts being incurred by low and middle income families who have not intended to deceive the government but have made errors in the assessment of their income. 
—They were your rules. They are different rules now. They are quite different. You haven't done your homework.
—It is quite different. It is the family support measures. The government is not accommodating the reality that many people's incomes change and the fact that people who are on low incomes often move in and out of the work force and have a high rate of casualisation in their work patterns. They have varied patterns of income, which makes income estimation difficult, if not impossible. These families will be disadvantaged at the end of the year when they file their return and find out that their estimation of income was incorrect. Of those families who were reviewed for the financial year 1998-99, the rate of error for families receiving family payment who had to estimate income in advance was 35 per cent. These are not families who are misleading the government about their level of income. They are simply making inaccurate estimations of their income with the result that they will have to find those resources in a lump sum in order to clear the debt. These are families who do not have access to large amounts of cash sitting in a bank account to pay off a potential debt to government. I am yet to be convinced that moving from the current system, where the last financial year is used as a basis for assessing the child-care benefit, will be simpler for families.
The bill corrects the anomaly where families using outside school hours care will not be disadvantaged when they have a child at a long day care centre and at outside school hours care. The anomaly has affected the viability of many outside school hours care services and caused many long day care centres to take up the option of providing care to school age children. There have been some instances where school age children have been cared for alongside toddlers in child-care centres. This is not a good situation. It can now be avoided, and families will not be disadvantaged. Most of the measures in the bill are responding to calls from families, the child-care sector and the Labor Party to redress the impacts of changes that the government has introduced over the past few years, but it is unfortunate that they do not go far enough. In November last year, Senator Chris Evans, Labor's shadow minister, introduced a private senator's bill. The intent of the Child Care Legislation Amendment (High Need Regions) Bill 1999 was to reintroduce needs based planning for long day care. It was well received by child-care providers and the sector across the nations. This bill has not been defeated and is still before the Senate.
The government's actions in abandoning needs based planning will call into question the viability of up to 100 child-care centres. It will allow new child-care centres access to child-care assistance in competition with existing child-care services. Competition in human services is fraught with danger. It will unnecessarily reduce the quality of care as centres have to cut costs in order to stay open. I call on the government to reintroduce needs based planning for long day care. At least 390 centres have closed since the Howard government was elected in 1996. The total number of centres has fallen from 4,170 in June 1998 to 4,013 in June 1999, a drop of 157 centres. The actual number of places in long day care has declined from 194,600 in June 1998 to 190,300 in June 1999, a loss of 4,300 places. These are the government's own figures. They clearly show that families have either had to change their access to work in order to care for children or have taken up unregulated options that provide reduced safeguards and monitoring of quality of care for their children. Further, it is evident that the number of low income families using child care has fallen. In 1999, there were 8,500 fewer children from lower income families using child care for preschool purposes than in 1996-97. Where are these children going to preschool? Are they receiving a preschool education? We all know that it is the preschool years that provide the sound basis for a successful education. If they are not receiving that essential preschool education, we are disadvantaging them in their future.  
Research undertaken by the office of the shadow minister, Senator Evans, has revealed that it is in the areas of lower income where most of the child-care centres have closed. This further supports Labor's view that it is the removal of access to child care through such measures as the introduction of the 50-hour cap on supported care and the growth in the gap between child-care assistance and fees—a gap currently about $20 more per week than in 1996—that have impacted more seriously on centres in lower income areas. The government needs to seriously address the problems that are being experienced in these areas and to act. Labor supports most of the intent of the bill but recognises that it does not go far enough in addressing the broader concerns of Australian families and the child-care sector.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FAMILY ASSISTANCE AND RELATED MEASURES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1
"Crowley, Sen Rosemary",ALP,2000-04-10,"—I rise to speak on this bill, A New Tax System (Family Assistance and Related Measures) Bill 2000. I want to speak to a couple of the areas covered by the bill. I would be interested, in particular, if in her comments Minister Newman could give flesh to the interjections that she was putting across the chamber, because there are some points of major concern.
Before I come to the child-care area, which is what I would like to principally concentrate on, I have to say that this is yet another bill that deals with matters of tax in the so-called new, simplified tax system. I cannot but expect that most citizens are becoming exhausted at the changes in this area. Indeed, figures given to me over the weekend—they were anecdotal and I have no guarantee or assurance that they were accurate, so I am not going to cite them—suggest that there is a very significant retreat from the accountancy profession by accountants who are exhausted by, if not overloaded with, the number of changes. I think this is a matter of significant concern. If the accountants are giving up exhausted, or at least finding it a bit overwhelming, it is nothing to what it is doing to Mr and Mrs Average Citizen who are having to cope with significant changes affecting the funding of their lives. They are, in many cases, extremely apprehensive.
—Thank you, Senator; that is true. The accountants are suffering stress. The citizens have not quite got to the point of being totally stressed; they are just in a state of great anxiety about what it all means for them. I remind the Senate that what it all means for them are significant changes and many people will be enormously out of pocket as a result.
The area that I particularly want to address is that of child care. I recall just what a savage attack child care has been under by this government. It is interesting that the government has now come around to a number of the points that it argued savagely against in the past and certainly argued vehemently against when it was in opposition. I, probably more than most, remember the colour of the accreditation debate with a certain wry smile. For a lot of us who campaigned so hard to have child-care provisions available for the community, it is a matter of great disappointment—and that is the kindest way I can put it—that there has been such a closing down of child care. Fewer families are now accessing child care in the way they were in the past.
—I cannot hear those interjections, Minister. Perhaps you can put them on the record later. I wonder whether you might—through you, Madam Acting Deputy President—address the contradiction, it seems to me, of a government culture or inclination to help families rear children by having at least one parent stay at home. There has not been a campaign overtly to suggest parents give away child care, but there has been a lot of inducement to assist families to understand the virtues of rearing children at home. There is assistance for parents who do that. Indeed, it has been argued as an emphasis to assist families to have one parent at home providing care for their children, as against the kind of care that is provided in child-care centres. If that is not your policy, Minister, I would be very pleased to hear a clear statement of that not being the case. Anybody looking in from the outside would have to say that child care has been seen as something second-class compared with a parent at home. 
There has been an interesting contradiction between the policy for two-parent families and the recent welfare document which suggests that single parents will be encouraged to get into the work force as soon as possible. I would have to ask the minister why it is that single parents are not being encouraged to have the same right of staying at home and caring for their children as two-parent families. That is a clear contradiction in policy and I would be very pleased if the minister would care to explain it. The whole point is that over the time of this government there have been major cuts, as figures from the estimates would tell us, in the child-care area. If I say that $851 million has been removed from child care between 1996 and 2001, I might hear oppositional groans. There is a silence which is interesting. It probably means: yes, we admit at last that these were the figures provided in estimates.
The clear implication and the clear understanding is that there were cuts made to child care. To put these reductions in perspective, the total cuts to current and planned spending amounted to some $850 million over five years, at about 85 per cent of the current annual budget. The 1996-97 budget included a cut as a result of the changes to the child-care assistance income tests. The abolition of additional income allowed for additional children saved $77.7 million. With the abolition of the operational subsidy to community based long day care centres, effective from 1 July 1997, there was an estimated saving by government of $108.8 million. The reduction of child-care assistance income cut-offs for second and subsequent children saved $13.2 million. Capping access to child-care assistance for work related care at 50 hours a week saved $106 million. Freezing child-care assistance and rebate ceilings for 1997 and 1998 saved $84.8 million. Reducing the rebate from 30 per cent to 20 per cent for families above the family tax initiative income threshold saved $34.7 million. The abolition of the new growth strategy for community and employer provided care saved $79.5 million. In the 1997-98 budget there was a move to pay child-care assistance fortnightly in arrears with a saving of $38.8 million. Broadbanding other family and children's services saved—if not a cut—$22.8 million. Capping non-work related care at 20 hours per week saved $80.7 million. I will not remind the minister of the arguments used in this place by herself and her colleagues in opposition about any caps on work related care. The number of new places was to be limited to 7,000 in 1998-99 to save $206.9 million. In 1998-99, the only budget measure was an additional $600,000 for an information campaign. In the 1999-2000 budget there were no new measures for child care. The family assistance bill increases for child-care assistance will not commence until the next financial year.
That brings me to another point I wish to raise and that is the underspend of child-care assistance. Those figures are fairly significant from year to year, and $180 million is underspent in the 1999-2000 budget.
—It is about a billion a year.
—About how much, Minister?
—About a billion a year.
—One million.
—About a billion a year of expenditure and you are talking about a shortfall—
—Of $180 million. That is nearly $200 million. I do not know the figures, but that is a fairly significant percentage.
—About 20 per cent.
—Yes, thanks very much. But what is interesting is that it means that families are not claiming child-care assistance to the extent that even this government anticipated they would. That is because other significant arrangements are happening for families using child care. The first and most important thing is that changes in funding arrangements by the government have meant that the gap on average has expanded by—depending on which bit of paper you read—$20 to $30 a week. This means that for most people child care is no longer affordable; it is just no longer affordable. It means that thousands of families are making the decision to not use child care. They are retreating from child care or they are using it two or three days a week—not the full time that they have done previously. Hence, one of the significant reasons that the child-care assistance is less than has been budgeted for. 
I think it is very important to realise what this means: for a very low income family, paying $20 or $30 a week for child care might have been manageable, but paying $50 is completely outside their range. So they have trimmed their child care to what they can afford. They are retreating from the child care, and if they are lucky they will get informal care. But what often happens is that they have to cut down their hours of work too. That, plus the change that has seen a very significant move to the casualisation of the work force, means that many families are not provided with the hours of work, and that has had a secondary spin-off in cutting back further the usage of child care, particularly long day care child care. So the cost pressures have seen a very significant pressure on families.
The second thing that has happened is that there have been closures of a significant number of child-care centres. As reported to me, many of those have been community based centres, and they have closed in the lower income areas. So one of the very important requirements or policy preferments of the previous Labor government for child care was that it was not solely concentrated on providing care for people in the work force; that it was also about providing a community facility; and that it was also about an opportunity for parents who had very little chance to get out of home and leave their kids to have a bit of time for themselves. Those opportunities are now significantly reduced in those communities that have a significantly high need or demand for such child care. I would be surprised if it were your intention for that to happen, Minister, but I am certainly clear on the figures that it is happening and I certainly think that it is a policy difference between us.
We were very concerned to make sure that child care was provided for working parents and for non-working parents. And we were also very concerned that child care was affordable, particularly for those lower income families. Both of those things are significantly altered under this government. I know the reasons, because I have read out the litany of cuts and changes in the financial arrangements in child care that have meant that there have been some very significant changes to the funding and affordability of child care. It is just not the same. I do not know how you cannot agree with it. These are official figures. These are not things that I have made up. These are official figures of what have been the changing cut-backs in the child-care area, and the consequences are exactly as I have described. 
I note my colleague Senator McLucas's concerns about the assessment of income for families based on current year income. As I understood it, the minister was interjecting at that time on Senator McLucas. I could not understand what she was saying, but I hope the minister might explain in a way that makes it clear. We can pursue in the committee stage of this legislation why she is sure that this is a better way to go. Certainly, those of us who have watched the way family income has been assessed for eligibility for payments over the last number of years have seen how wrong it has been and how we have had to change it. The Labor government appreciated that it had got it less than optimal and introduced its own changes in that area. I suppose we are raising a big concern about the current arrangements, which are, as we read it, on an annual assessment of income and not on a fortnightly assessment. That is maybe not the only factor but it is certainly one that means people have to come up with their best guess of what their income will be over the year. If they get it wrong—and the evidence shows already that many do—then they finish up with a debt. Most of these families are not flush. They do not have much money to play around with to pay back any overpayment based on their wrong assessment of their income.  
Certainly, Minister, if you can, either in your comments or in the committee stage, take us through that process and try to convince us that we are not wrong on this, I think that would be of use. But I certainly have to say that, so far, there is a very big caution from not only me but also others that this way of doing it has already been tried and has been found extremely wanting. These families are not at the top end of the scale. They are the families who, if they have a mortgage, according to the Daily Telegraph the other day, have just lost all the so-called benefits of the tax cuts that will be coming to them on 1 July. There will not be any savings for them because their money is already eaten up by the increased interest rates and the increased payments on their mortgages.
In child care and in a lot of areas related to it there is also a very significant increase in outlays because of the introduction of the GST. Families are right to be concerned. Most of the families that we are talking about—particularly those using child care and very finely balancing their income to make it stretch to cover the child-care costs that enable them to study, to work or to have some occasional care—are already, on the evidence, cutting back their hours significantly—witness the cut in the child-care assistance payments. Those families do not have spare money to adjust to the increased costs that will occur with the GST. One of the things that the government is trying to convince families of is that they do not need to worry because they will get this whacking great tax cut that will come with the introduction of the GST. According to all sorts of evidence, those families that have a mortgage have lost most of those tax cuts, if not all of them, with the interest rate rises.
So for families who are concerned, all I can say is that this piece of legislation is yet another bill in a very complex series on the tax package and the adjustments that go with it. These are very complex changes to child care. I think one should be very cautious about the changes in legislation. We have seen the costs of child care significantly increase. We have seen the usage of child care significantly decrease. We have seen the closure of a large number of centres, particularly community based centres and particularly in the lower income areas.
There is a major concern about the way the so-called family payment assessment will be made, which I have already alluded to, and I certainly think that we should advance very cautiously on barracking for these changes. They have been tried and found wanting in previous arenas and times. Certainly the Labor Party remains to be convinced that this is the way to go. If we are wrong, then perhaps you can spell that out for us, Minister. At the moment, I would be saying to families that there is very little comfort from the government, either in this piece of legislation or in the tax package altogether. I have argued at other times in this place and in other places that the tax changes this government is introducing will divide Australia into the haves and the have nots. The people I am talking about who are the users of the sorts of child-care centres we are talking about are those who are going to be hurt by the GST, not rolling in wealth and riches. They will struggle to continue to afford their child care.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FAMILY ASSISTANCE AND RELATED MEASURES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,2000-04-10,"—Well, that was a nice, vigorous debate, Senator Crowley. Thank you for your contribution—as always, plenty of vigour, not too much fact. But I would be very happy during the course of the time I have available to me this evening to set you straight if I can. First of all, I will respond to Senator Bartlett. There are two or three things that I thought would be useful to respond to quickly now. He referred to the 10 per cent shared care and suggested that there was no advance information about that. I think I am precising him accurately. That 10 per cent shared care measure was, of course, in the 1999 legislation. It was available for all senators to study and to debate. The measure was not disputed in the Senate. I acknowledge that that could be for a number of reasons, but it was in no way hidden from the Senate. I will obviously be ready to respond to some of the other comments on the shared care measure during the committee stage. 
Senator Bartlett also referred to the volume of amendments in this bill. He understood that there is a great deal of material coming through that is administrative and that goes to building on the material in the 1999 legislation. One of the things that is perhaps worth putting on the record is that there are something like 200 pages, out of the total 303 pages in this bill, that replace the child-care benefit regulation making powers with the substantive provisions—in other words, what we are trying to do now with this legislation, to the extent we possibly can, is to put regulations into the legislation instead of leaving them as regulations. I would think that most senators would find that a valuable exercise in itself, although that is what makes the bill we are debating today such a large one. Senator Denman was talking about child care and Senator Evans was talking about child care.
—I hope so.
—Yes. He was, but you would not quite recognise the child-care issues from your colleagues' contributions. They really related more to the land of fiction than fact, and it is hard to know quite where to start.
—Spending still up, is it, Minister? Child-care places still up, are they?
—I just thought I had better take you through some of those things, Senator Evans, as you clearly want to get the facts, and you do obviously need the facts.
—Let me just tell you that, over the last three years, this government has spent more than $3 billion on child care.
—Spent, not allocated.
—How much did you underspend the budget?
—No. We have spent, not allocated, $3 billion over the last three years. That is 20 per cent more than Labor spent in its last three years in government.
—How does it compare to your budget?
—Just let us get that clear.
—How does it compare to your budget? Come clean!
—It is my turn to hold the floor, now. You held the floor before.
 (Senator Sherry)—Senator Evans, please; the minister is responding.
—Senator Evans, you have made a contribution. It is the minister's turn to contribute.
—I will be interested in her answer.
—I had better repeat that in case he was not registering, because he was doing a lot of talking. The government over the last three years has spent more than $3 billion on child care, which is 20 per cent more than Labor's last three years in office. That is something you must take on board and think about, because it does not accord with what you have been claiming for a long time. You make much of the allocation issue. You allocated money that you did not spend. We have allocated money that we have not spent as well.
—That is the first time you have admitted that on the record.
—I have not walked away from that. I have given you reasons why this is so, and they are similar reasons to why it was so under your government. Let me take you through some of them. There is a declining population of nought to four-year-olds in this country—there is a declining birthrate so there are declining numbers of nought to four-year olds. In Tasmania, the population of preschools has gone down by 2,000 children since 1996, just in our tiny state. That is what child-care centres, private or publicly owned, are contending with: a declining population of nought to four-year-olds and a stable labour force of women with young children. More flexible family-friendly working environments have allowed women to choose to work, for example, three long days and not five short days, if that be their choice for their particular family needs. That has made a difference to how they use child care. For example, there is an increase in part-time work, and of course there has been a huge increase in women's full-time jobs as well. There has also been an increase in casual work. Women have been great winners out of the improvement in the economy. There has been a lowering of the preschool entry age in several states, and that has a very significant impact on child care. 
—You are right on that one.
—Thank you. I am right on all of these, I assure you. I am not misleading the Senate, you understand. I am telling you the facts here and now so you will understand once and for all. There is better targeting of assistance to rein in the unsustainable, unplanned growth encouraged under Labor. 
And here we come to the former minister, Senator Crowley. What did she preside over? She presided over a rort that meant that the taxpayers of Australia were being asked to fund child care that was not being used by Australia's families. That is the crummy system we inherited. What a stupid arrangement that was. Of course we stopped that. But we allowed families who actually use and need more than 50 hours for work related purposes to be able to access child-care assistance for it—but it was not open slather for child care they were not using. That is what it was under Senator Crowley and her colleagues. That was a desirable effort to be made in any well managed arrangements.
—But you abandoned planning.
—I am talking about your 50 hours cap.
—I will get onto that in a minute too, if you would like to sit and listen a little longer. There is now a much better match of service charging practices with family usage. That is good news for both families and taxpayers. Of course, the rate of growth of child-care fees under Labor was considerably in excess of the rate of growth of child-care fees since we have been in government. It is amazing, isn't it? Child-care centres were like the families that were using them: subject to enormous interest rates. Those families were using child care so they could work in order to pay the mortgage, and interest rates were up to 17 per cent under Labor. Plenty of families were working at that stage, out of sheer compulsion to keep a roof over their heads. Some of them do not feel the need to work as much now as they did then. So that is another element in this whole thing, and one I would have hoped that you would have taken into account in your thinking. 
One of the things we keep hearing is that there have been fee increases of 20 per cent since 1995. That is untrue. It is based only on the small and more expensive community sector, and it is why you need competition in child care, like in other areas. There are other suppliers who are accredited and who charge lower fees than the more expensive community sector. One of the problems in my home state is that there was little competition for the community based sectors. In other states there were more suppliers. We all know that the fees are set by the child-care operators, not by the government. During the Labor years, the rate of fee increases was 8½ per cent per annum. Since we have been in government, fee increases have continued, but it is at four per cent per annum.
I have tried to get through to the ALP that a taxpayer on a low income with two children in full-time care has a subsidy from the taxpayer of $12,500. A pensioner earns $9,500. So that is what the taxpayer is paying to a family to use child care. And yet opposition members come in here and have the hide to say this government has not supported child-care assistance for Australia's families. That is the magnitude of the assistance that we ask of Australia's taxpayers. 
I do not know how much more you need of this, but mothers are not dropping out of work due to rising child-care costs. Since June 1996 the participation rate of mothers with children under five has shown little change—from 47.2 per cent to 47.1 per cent in June 1999. There is no evidence for media claims that mothers are reducing their hours of work. The average weekly hours worked by mothers has been steady since 1996. 
—I am talking about hours of care.
—They are changing their arrangements.
—No, they aren't.
—Yes, they are. They are not working some of the long hours they did in the past, that is for sure, when they were desperate to keep the mortgage going.
—You may not have noticed that interest rates have gone up.
—To 17 per cent? Get real. Don't try that tack. You claim that children are being pulled out of formal child care, and there is no evidence for that. Child-care rebate figures, which of course will reflect children in informal care, show that the proportion of families claiming for informal care has fallen from eight per cent to five per cent since its introduction in 1994. That is where you would see if there were more children going into the informal sector. 
—Yes it would, because that is where they would be getting their assistance from. They do not get child-care assistance there; they get child-care rebate.
—You're not the first to tell us that the claiming rates are different.
—I assure you that that is the case. I tried to tell you that before, and you obviously did not take it in. That is not the first time I have told you.
—Just listen to this. Take this in properly; you obviously do not listen: the number of children using child care has increased significantly from 460,300 in 1994-95 to 544,700 in 1996-97 and 590,000 in 1999, which are preliminary data.
—Bodgying up the out-of-school-hours figures.
—You do not like these facts but the number of child-care services and places since we have come to government has increased. There has been a net increase in long day-care centres of 190, and an increase in out-of-school-hours-care places of 1,260. Between June 1996 and June 1999, the government has funded more than 115,000 extra places. The closures have been evenly spread between advantaged and disadvantaged areas, based on the ABS's index of relative socioeconomic disadvantage. You can say that these are not facts; I can assure you they are.
—You won't publish the latest figures. You've been hiding them for years.
—I gave you the latest figures that I have: 590,000 children in care in 1999, based on preliminary data. As far as the national planning system is concerned, we are still focused on areas of need. The previous government neglected shiftworkers. It is quite interesting to have so many people from the trade unions on the benches opposite, yet while in government they completely ignored the needs of shiftworkers. This government is determined to do better by shiftworkers than was done previously. In addition, rural workers had been totally ignored by the previous government.
—Cut it out!
—You did. We are already implementing measures to redress that problem as well. So a number of improvements have been introduced since we came into government. I am not walking away from what we have done, and what we have had to do; those are the facts about child care.
—Selective old stats.
—I know that Senator Evans does not like it because it does not fit in with the misinformation that he goes around Australia telling people.
—Publish the recent information. Publish the latest stuff. Come on: come clean with the latest stuff—1996 to 1999 comparisons!
—Those are the latest figures that are available, and they are preliminary figures. 
—Because those are the preliminary figures from the latest census, so that is the best that can be done so far. It is a hard job trying to knock some of this information into the senators opposite. I would be delighted if I thought they were educable, but I am trying to get through to them that this government has been assisting families in the child-care area just as we have been assisting families ever since we came into government. I once again remind the Senate about the interest rates of 17 per cent. Did the Labor government give families any compensation whatsoever for 17 per cent interest rates and the effect that had on their marriages, the effect it had on their homes? Not a cracker of compensation for those families.
When the ALP introduced tax increases—most of it by stealth, of course, with a wholesale sales tax that just went up and went up—was there any compensation given to Australia's families? Not a cent. In addition, the Labor Party ripped off the l-a-w tax cuts. Obviously that is what they would do now if they had half a chance—if they were in government.
—Who dropped the 60 per cent rate of tax?
—We know what your record is, and you are in no position to cast stones. Madam Deputy President, I do not know that there is a great deal more that would be useful to add tonight because we will get into some of these matters later in the committee stage. There is one thing I would like to mention, though, because the matter of estimating income has been discussed several times tonight. When I first became minister for social security, a consistent theme of letters to me was about the system we inherited from the previous government. The consistent theme was from people who had to estimate their income, and they were people who were self-employed: farmers and small business people.
—You'll be calling them tax bludgers this time next year.
—I beg your pardon?
—I will come to that another time.

"Tierney, Sen John",LP,2000-04-10,"—As Deputy Chair of the Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education References Committee of the Senate, I would like to take the opportunity to bring to the attention of the Senate a very serious incident involving the intimidation of a witness. I raise this topic firstly because I see the intimidation of a witness appearing before a Senate committee and its inquiry as an extremely serious matter. Secondly, given the importance of submissions to the inquiry into indigenous education, I believe that it is paramount that any witness to a Senate committee be able to provide any and all information that they wish to so that the best outcome can be achieved. The aim of public hearings of such committees is to find out why such problems exist and what has contributed to those problems and to lead to recommendations on the issue. Without the comments and submissions from people on the ground facing problems in indigenous education, the government cannot determine the best possible solution.
Let me start by telling the story behind the intimidation of a witness that appeared before a Senate committee. On 26 July 1999 the employment committee held a public hearing in Brewarrina in New South Wales. The hearing was part of the committee's inquiry into indigenous education. On that day we heard from a number of witnesses, but this particular incident involved two people: Mr Peter Felsch, the general manager of the Brewarrina Shire Council and Tony Wiltshire, a youth and community development officer from the council. At the end of the hearing, Mr Wiltshire told the committee he wanted to give more evidence in camera. After discussing the request, the committee suggested that Mr Wiltshire present a written submission because of the time constraints the committee was under at that stage, having held the hearing in Brewarrina in the morning and needing to move on to the town of Bourke in the afternoon. 
At the time the committee did not see any difficulties with the day's proceedings, and this is reflected in the Hansard record. It turns out, though, that Mr Wiltshire later raised with the employment committee the matter he had found concerning about that day, and that matter was then brought to the attention of the President of the Senate. The day after the Brewarrina public hearing, Mr Wiltshire told the committee that he had been subject to intimidation following his giving of evidence and his plan to write a submission. It turns out that there was a disagreement between Mr Wiltshire and the Council General Manager, Mr Felsch, over the written submission. A debate erupted between the two over the status of the document: would it be written as a public representation of the council's view or would it be a private view? The committee notified Mr Wiltshire that he could write a private submission if he wanted. In a letter from Mr Felsch to Mr Wiltshire, the general manager said that any representation of the council had to be approved, given that Mr Wiltshire was an employee of the council. So Mr Wiltshire's submission would have to be checked over by Mr Felsch. He also informed Mr Wiltshire that he would be placed on probation for six months and would not be allowed to undertake certain roles that he had undertaken in the past. He urged Mr Wiltshire not to make a private submission because Hansard had already recorded his concerns for the public record. He warned Mr Wiltshire that his position with the council was under review following an attempt to put a submission to the committee based on what Mr Felsch called `opinion and not fact'.
After receiving correspondence between the two men, the committee decided to take the matter to the President of the Senate and then later to the Committee of Privileges. The committee wrote to Mr Felsch on 2 August saying, and I quote from the Committee of Privileges report:
It appears to the Committee, from reports given to it by Mr Wiltshire, that its public hearing in Brewarrina and the aftermath have occasioned behaviour by you that may be considered an intimidation of a witness.
The employment committee informed both men of its decision to take the matter of possible intimidation of witnesses to the Committee of Privileges. After investigating the matter, the Committee of Privileges found that:
... Mr Felsch, General Manager, Brewarrina Shire Council, improperly interfered with, and penalised, Mr Tony Wiltshire, then Youth and Community Development Officer, Brewarrina Shire Council, as a consequence of Mr Wiltshire's participation in the proceedings of the Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education References Committee before, during and after hearings held at Brewarrina ...
That Mr Felsch, as General Manager of the Brewarrina Shire Council, had therefore committed a contempt of the Senate.
The Committee of Privileges decided that no penalty be imposed because the matter had already cost the council financially and through the inquiry. Mr Felsch was found guilty of improperly interfering with and penalising Mr Wiltshire. Mr Wiltshire, the witness behind the intimidation by his superior, was also without a job not long after this incident. It is ironic that so much fuss was made by the general manager towards Mr Wiltshire's comments. If Mr Felsch had left Mr Wiltshire go about his submission, I seriously doubt it would have attracted so much attention.
My main concern here is with the intimidation of a witness and its effects. The whole system of public hearings within committees would fail if it were not for evidence given by public citizens. Witnesses must feel that they can speak frankly and honestly to a committee without the fear of persecution. All witnesses must have the right to express their views to such committees or an important element of our democratic process will be at risk. It was pointed out quite clearly to Mr Felsch that, if he did not want comments made by Mr Wiltshire to be considered those from the shire council, all that was needed was a statement by him on the record saying that Mr Wiltshire's views were his own and did not represent the council's. Mr Felsch acted irresponsibly towards a council employee who, being a youth development officer in the region, could have provided valuable information to the committee that was inquiring into indigenous education. In the area of indigenous education, it is vital that people working with young students report to the committee on the type of problems their region is facing. How can we improve the situation unless we know all the facts?  
In the case of Brewarrina in western New South Wales, black and white relations are not good. There are many social problems in the town. Local schools can almost be described as de facto apartheid schools, where a local primary school's indigenous population is, for example, 97 per cent. A large majority of non-Aboriginal students tend to go to the Catholic school outside the town. Problems faced by these towns include: attendance levels—and this relates often to cultural factors; poor health, leading to ineffective learning; mainstream curriculums, without proper acknowledgment of indigenous culture; lack of indigenous teachers; and low levels of literacy and numeracy. 
I do not know why Mr Felsch acted in the way he did, but it is not in the best interests of improving the standards of indigenous education if information is repressed. Such repression can result in the committee overlooking certain perspectives. I see this offence by Mr Felsch as being most serious. Mr Wiltshire was treated unfairly by a superior of the shire council, and I see threats against this man as being inexcusable. In no circumstances should a witness's employment be threatened by their giving evidence to a Senate inquiry. I find it intolerable that, even though the Committee of Privileges found Mr Felsch guilty and did not impose a penalty, Mr Felsch did not feel that he should make any reparations for his actions. I want to put on the record my total lack of respect for this general manager of a council who, despite being given a warning by the Committee of Privileges, found it necessary to pursue his own vindictive agenda against a witness who did the right thing in the public interest.
I welcome the findings by the Committee of Privileges, but this is a matter which should be taken further by the New South Wales Minister for Local Government. I will be writing to the minister to request that he take this matter further. No minister should feel comfortable with the fact that within his department there are people who intimidate, harass and force onto the dole people who are whistleblowers before a parliamentary inquiry. I call on the New South Wales local government minister to act on this matter.
