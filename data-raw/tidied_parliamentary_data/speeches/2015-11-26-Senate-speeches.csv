Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (09:31):  I had to look very carefully to see the last time I had the honour of taking part in this discussion about freedom of information. When I checked the Hansard, I saw that I had made my first incredibly important three-minute contribution in this discussion on Thursday, 18 June. I know that people would be really interested to know where we are moving on this particular piece of legislation. It is quite simple. Senator Ludwig has, through his Freedom of Information Amendment (Requests and Reasons) Bill 2015, put forward a proposition to the Senate to make freedom of information more open and transparent and to allow the public to know exactly what is going on with applications across the range of government agencies. 


Many people in the chamber have had the opportunity to make a contribution on this bill, as the bill has arrived in private members' business on a few occasions. I think it is important to understand that the original designers of the bill had a very straightforward sense of what freedom of information truly is. When they began looking at these issues, particularly around the early 2000s, at both the federal and state levels, it was felt that we needed to have effective freedom of information mechanisms. In my own state of Queensland it was actually a bit earlier than that, in the late 1990s, that the Queensland state government acted in response to concerns from the community—the legal community and people who had been involved in the system. The concerns were that, whilst there had been attempts made to put systems in place to help people understand decisions, processes had not been stringent enough to effectively allow not only the applicant making the freedom of information request but also other people who might well have been interested in that issue to know what requests had been made and what the government's responses had been. That is indeed what Senator Ludwig is putting forward for the Senate to consider in this private member's legislation. 


We have the system. All departmental websites publicise information about their commitment to issues around freedom of information. You can go through the dot points on these websites that say how it operates, what the process is for applicants and what the time frames are for freedom of information requests and responses. They also tell you that in some cases the department will be able to charge for providing the information, based on the amount of time it would take. The websites also tell you that you may not always be able to get the information you are seeking, because there are some things that departments decide cannot be released. 


But there must be justifications for those decisions. That is one of the key elements of Senator Ludwig's private member's bill: that those explanations of why a request has not been successful should be articulated in a way that is understandable not just to the applicant but to other people interested in the issue—because the motivation for freedom of information requests varies across the board. Some people have very personal circumstances they are trying to obtain information about, but others are looking at policy areas that are of interest or are disputed—decisions of government or decisions of departments that they may want to question. When you are seeking information that you have not been able to get in any way other than a freedom of information request, there should be public notification about why the decision was made—why decisions were made to not allow access to information and indeed why decisions were made to allow access.


With this bill we are moving forward to strengthen the existing legislation, the act that is in place, the one that the Labor government committed to in our 2007 campaign—the commitment that we would strengthen freedom of information and make sure it operated as it was intended to. Indeed the title gives you a hint about what the whole idea was. It was to have information about government actions available freely to the public. Freedom of information, by its very nature and its very title, sets up an expectation in the community that you will be able to have access to information. That is what Senator Ludwig's bill addresses. The bill will strengthen the existing legislation to deliver on the original core principles which are enshrined within the act—the core principles that say there should be transparency, there should be understanding of decisions that have been made and there should be policy processes that are observed. 


I mentioned on 18 June that there are some areas, particularly around issues of security and anything that has the word 'ASIO' attached to it, where there is no way you are able to get the full detail of some decisions. There is probably an understanding that this is true because it is indeed linked to issues that are of national security sensitivity. But that should be clearly identified. It should not just be dismissed with a one-line explanation. If a request for information is put forward and a decision is made that it cannot be released because it has national security implications, that should be fully explained. Without going into any specific examples, that is what we are asking for. We understand that there are limits. We are not saying that every document should be released—no-one can say that. But what we are saying is that, when decisions are made, we should understand them.


Senator Ludwig's bill goes into detail. The whole idea is that we are allowing the public to see specific and detailed reasons as to why freedom of information requests have been denied. I do not think that is an unreasonable expectation. If we are committed to transparency of government, if people are to understand what decisions of government and parliament will mean for them and their community, when people exercise their right to access the system and put in an FOI application they should expect to get a reasonably detailed, focused and personal response. That was the expectation of the original legislation.


There were concerns raised by some on the government side about possible workload issues and difficulties in the operation of the system with the details in this legislation around the timeliness and amount of information that can be released. However, on balance, the expectation of having freedom of information legislation operational in government departments should mean that there will be decisions to make those resources effectively funded. Government departments already have a section that is linked to freedom of information—and they are often linked to other communication activities such as ministerial correspondence. But resource priority should be given to the responsibility of freedom of information in government departments.


In a time of budget restrictions in government departments—and I have no particular evidence of the current administrative arrangements in government departments—it may well be that administrative decisions around how many people are working in this area may have some impact on the timeliness of decisions and perhaps the fullness of information provided. If that is the case, Senator Ludwig's proposed amendments to the FOI Act would ensure that there will now be a legislative basis to make sure funding is provided. A clear definition of timeliness and the types of explanations that must be available to the public when they make an FOI request would be set out in the legislation so that government departments would have the stimulant to say, 'This is what we have to do and, therefore, we have to resource it effectively.'


That is a very important element of the legislation. If Senator Ludwig's private member's bill is accepted, people working in this very important area will no longer be free to not meet the deadlines—which is 10 days in this legislation—and the requirement to provide transparent and detailed responses to requests. That would be set out in the resourcing decisions that the department makes. They would know the volume of FOI requests they get—and that varies from department to department. Some departments receive a much larger number of FOI requests than others. Nonetheless, it is clearly the responsibility of government departments to provide this service.


I had a quick look at a range of government department websites. Their websites state that they provide an FOI service—as they must. Tightening up the time frames and the expectations around the type of response that must be made would be part of the government departments' decision making about their distribution of resources. We get complaints from the community about time delays in getting a response and, when you get a response, the limited nature of it. Therefore, the administrative processes would be strengthened so that there would not be a time delay or the very curt responses I have seen to some FOI requests.


The bill before us does not make a large number of changes. What it does is remind us of the original intent of freedom of information for government and the public sector. It puts in place the clear responsibility to make information available, to give an effective response to requests and also to engage with the person or group who has put in the request. That was the expectation when freedom of information was originally introduced in the Commonwealth and state parliaments. Over that time, people have had a chance to evolve in terms of the way it operates. There have been numerous discussions and conferences among professionals in this area to look at best practice and to examine how best the system should operate. Out of those discussions, particularly by professionals who work in the field and by the community, who have been requesting freedom of information responses over many years, has come a view that there needs to be tightening of the system; there needs to be a reinforcement of what freedom of information really means. There is also a clear expectation of the government that, when citizens—and this is a term used a lot in public sector discussions currently; talk of citizens accessing the services seems to have come into vogue over the last couple of years—put forward a request under freedom of information, they should be allowed to see specific and detailed reasons for the response to their request, and that there should be timeliness around when this information is provided.


Also—and this is one of the things I like about this bill—it would mean that, published on the websites, people would be able to see the nature of the requests and the responses. Another element has been that, when individuals access the system, sometimes that stimulates more action from other people in the community. So, on a particular issue, there could be a series of requests for information, and that could be built upon by seeing what had already happened by the website discussions around a particular issue. That seems to be a step forward in the way freedom of information should operate. It also seems that this shows genuine respect not just for the community but for the people who worked so hard to ensure that freedom of information legislation was introduced and implemented in our Commonwealth departments.

"Seselja, Sen Zed",LP,2015-11-26,"



Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory) (09:46):  I am very pleased to contribute to the debate today on the Freedom of Information Amendment (Requests and Reasons) Bill 2015. I, along with the coalition government, support the Freedom of Information Act and support transparency in government. It is one of our country's greatest strengths that we ensure the decisions of government are put under scrutiny and, where possible, are out in the open. This government has a strong record over the last two years of making the small improvements to regulations and legislation necessary to make the operations of government simpler and more transparent. But this bill does not do anything to help with transparency in government. It does not relieve the administrative burden of FOI requests. It will, in fact, increase the costs and complexity of FOI processing and result in significant processing delays. Of course, it certainly is an admirable intention to improve the FOI system wherever possible. This government would be quite happy to support such improvements if they are well thought through—but this bill is not well thought through. This is typical of the back-of-the-coaster policy style of the modern Australian Labor Party. One of the reasons we will not be supporting the bill is that it has a range of unintended consequences, which often arise when you have not properly done the policy work.


To explain why the bill will not work, we should take some time to consider what the bill intends to achieve. This bill seeks to amend the Freedom of Information Act 1982 to require government agencies and ministers to publish the exact wording of freedom of information requests. The amendments will also require agencies and ministers to publish a statement of reasons concerning the decision to allow or refuse the release of requested documents. The bill has the stated aims of: ensuring transparency and accountability are included within the framework of government decisions concerning freedom of information requests; allowing the public to view requests that have been made and the reasons why documents were or were not released; allowing applicants seeking similar documents to build upon previous requests; and reducing duplication of requests. Furthermore, the explanatory memorandum to Senator Ludwig's bill states:


Publishing the reasons for decisions will allow for scrutiny of departmental decisions and open the door to further reform to allow review of requests by parties other than the initial applicant.


Section 11C of the FOI Act currently requires agencies and ministerial offices to maintain an online disclosure log. The disclosure log must either publish information made available in response to an FOI request or provide details of how the public may obtain that information. Senator Ludwig's bill proposes to amend these requirements by: removing the option of providing the details of how the public may obtain information; requiring the publication of the exacting wording of the FOI request; and requiring publication of a statement of reasons concerning the decision to allow or refuse the release of the requested documents.


The current disclosure log requirements, together with the information publication scheme, or IPS, were part of the previous Labor government's package of FOI reforms in 2010. These reforms were intended to reduce the number of FOI requests over time, with the FOI Act providing access to information through agency driven publication, rather than only in response to requests for documents. Again, these are all pretty reasonable sounding goals and, on a cursory reading of the proposed legislation and seeing those intentions, this could be a bill worth looking at. However, as reported in the Hawke FOI review, implementation of the IPS and disclosure log requirements have, in many cases, increased FOI processing costs, with resources being diverted from other key areas to assist with FOI processing. As well as increasing the costs of FOI processing, these initiatives have not resulted in any reduction in the number of FOI requests received by agencies and ministers. In fact, since the FOI reforms commenced in 2010, the number of FOI requests have increased from 23,605 in 2010-11 to 28,643 in 2013-14. So a closer reading shows that what this bill proposes does not in fact work. So we on this side of the chamber do not support this bill—because we do not support legislation that says it will do one thing but, in fact, does the opposite.


Let us look, then, in some further detail at how this bill will work as opposed to what it intends. Item 1 of Senator Ludwig's bill inserts a new definition of 'working day' in the interpretation section of the act, which applies in relation to a requirement in a provision of the FOI Act to publish information to mean a day that is not a Saturday, a Sunday or a public holiday in the place where the function of publishing the information under the provision is to be performed. As the term 'working day' is only used in section 11C, it is difficult to see how this will 'eliminate confusion concerning time frames for publishing information' as is the suggested intent of the amendment. Items 2 and 3 of Senator Ludwig's bill remove the option for an agency or minister to publish details of how information may be obtained rather than the information itself. Currently subsection 11C(3) provides that the information disclosed in the request must be published on the agency or ministerial website by: making the information available for downloading from the website; publishing on the website a link to another website from which the information can be downloaded; or publishing on the website other details of how the information may be obtained. Items 2 and 3 of Ludwig's bill amend subsection 11C(3) to remove the option of simply publishing on a website details of how the information may be obtained rather than the information itself.


Senator Ludwig states that this amendment is designed to provide the public with easy access to documents released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982. The current requirement is for information that is released to be published to the public, generally on a website. Some agencies publish the documents released on their websites and the FOI request. What this will do is remove the flexibility, where the information cannot be readily published on a website, of providing details of how the information can be accessed. The current flexibility ensures that there is no impediment for those who are interested in accessing the particular information, while at the same time not imposing an onerous administrative burden on the agency.


It may not be straightforward for an agency or minister to publish some documents in accessible formats on a disclosure log or to convert documents to such formats within 10 working days. This may be an issue, for example, if information has been redacted from a document or where a voluminous document is only available as a hard copy or in a PDF format. Removing flexibility will impose an administrative burden on agencies and ministerial offices in preparing documents for publications within 10 working days of information being released. This could create challenges for agencies and ministers in managing increased FOI workload and impact on the processing of FOI applications


Item 5 of Senator Ludwig's bill amends the FOI Act to insert a new provision, section 11D. This proposed new section requires agencies or ministers: where access is given to the whole document, to publish the FOI request itself and the reasons for decision within 10 working days after the person is given access; where access is given to an edited document, to publish the FOI request itself and the notice that an edited copy has been prepared and grounds for deletion within 10 working days after the notice is given; if a request for reasons for decision is made for the refusal to the whole document, publish the reasons within 10 working days after the reasons are given; and where access is not given to a document at all, to publish the FOI request itself within 10 working days after the decisions and the reasons for decision within 10 working days after the reasons are provided. Essentially, this provision will require agencies and ministers to publish the exact wording of FOI requests.


New section 11D will also require agencies and ministers to publish a statement of reasons concerning the decision to allow or refuse the release of requested documents. Section 26 of the FOI Act currently provides for statements of reasons to be given where a decision is made to refuse access. Section 22 provides reasons to be given where an edited copy of a document is provided. The difference with the new provision is that a statement of reasons is also required when access is granted in full and that all statements of reasons, as well as the requests themselves, must now be published within 10 working days. Once again, this new provision will impose a substantial administrative burden on agencies and ministerial offices which could result in significant processing delays in other aspects of FOI processing. Senator Ludwig states that this measure will facilitate more practical use of freedom of information requests, will reduce duplication of requests and open the door for further reform by parties other than the initial applicant. But as I have already said, it is more likely that publishing reasons for decisions will result in overburdened agencies struggling to manage increasingly heavy FOI workloads, taking short cuts and adopting published reasons rather than making a decision based on the circumstances of the particular FOI request.


It is for all of these reasons outlined by me over the past few minutes that the coalition will not be supporting Senator Ludwig's bill.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2015-11-26,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (09:57):  I do support this bill for a number of reasons. I note that Senator Seselja has given an articulate exposition of the reasons why the government does not support this bill, and I respect that. It is a good thing that Senator Ludwig has introduced this bill because, at the very least, it puts FOI on the agenda. It may not be a very sexy topic, FOI, but it is absolutely crucial in the transparency and the good working of government. It is important that this topic is debated in this way, with good ideas coming forward. FOI is one of the few avenues that Australian citizens can access the information and documents held by government agencies. I believe Senator Ludwig's bill improves the quality and access to FOI decisions and makes that FOI framework more transparent and accessible.


The bill requires government agencies and ministers to publish the exact wording of FOI requests and a statement of reasons concerning the decisions to allow, refuse or edit the release of requested documents. In this way, it would set up a paper trail, an electronic trail of what FOI requests have been made and what happened to them. It improves the ability of FOI to ensure that information from government agencies is 'readily available to persons affected by those government agencies'. The bill will make it easier for applicants to build on the decisions of previous FOI applications and avoid unnecessary duplication of requests. So when the government says this is going to be unwieldy and it is going to cost more, in fact it will not. It will mean, by having this electronic trail of requests, fewer unnecessary FOI requests. People will be able to see what has been requested and what the response has been rather than putting in another application. This will reduce red tape—and I know that the government loves reducing red tape. I think Senator Ludwig is here to help the government to reduce red tape by having a more streamlined system of FOI. I believe it protects the privacy of individuals by making sure personal information is removed. The government needs to acknowledge that its record on FOI, since coming to office, is a very patchy record.


The government remains committed to defunding the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner—an office that provides oversight of large numbers of FOI decisions in a way that is far more cost-effective than having to go to the AAT, with all of the costs that involves. I am currently in the middle of an issue involving some Defence documents that I am looking for through the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner—and I have just reminded myself that I need to provide a response to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner's request to respond to Defence's position. Who knows, I may end up in the AAT over that request relating to defence issues arising from the Winter-White report that I believe ought to be disclosed to the people of Australia.


Office of the Australian Information Commissioner figures reveal that in the 2014-15 financial year it finalised 482 applications for review of FOI decisions and finalised 82 FOI complaints. If you consider what it does and what the costs would be if you went to the AAT, you can see it is a very cost-effective agency. It is a false economy to defund that office. I think it is interesting to reflect on an opinion piece by Sean Parnell, The Australian's FOI editor, headed, 'Open government? We’re still waiting'. He said:


The introduction of tougher security laws and secrecy provisions in Canberra has yet to be balanced out by any increase in government transparency or citizen engagement.


He made the point that:


While Malcolm Turnbull became Prime Minister promising to be “truly consultative” and support “open government,” any such change has so far been internal, with no obvious policy or cultural shift.


He refers to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner and the cuts to that office—the attempts to defund that office—which are very disturbing.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  Contrary to the will of parliament, too.




Senator XENOPHON:
  Contrary to the will of the parliament—that is right, Senator Collins.


It is interesting what the opinion piece of Mr Parnell makes of the whole issue of Australia joining the Open Government Partnership:


The former Labor government also committed Australia to join the Open Government Partnership, a global transparency and citizen engagement initiative. Under the Coalition, however, nothing has happened, with responsibility for the OGP shifting between ministers and becoming a “captain’s pick” for Abbott.


Mr Parnell concludes his opinion piece by saying:


While there are rumours Turnbull will soon have Australia re-embrace the OGP, cultural issues remain. Several requests last week for the Prime Minister’s office to clarify his position on the OGP failed to elicit any response, let alone a positive one.


I am hoping that this is something that the new Turnbull administration will consider. 


To be a truly consultative and open government, as the Prime Minister said—and I take him at his word about his desire to do so—embrace the OGP; embrace reform to the FOI laws, such as the bill that Senator Ludwig has put up, which I think will lead to greater transparency and greater efficiency in FOI; and ensure there is appropriate funding for the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner. I support this bill.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2015-11-26,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (10:03):  The Freedom of Information Amendment (Requests and Reasons) Bill 2015 builds on Labor's long commitment to the principles of freedom of information and the public's right to know, and on a 2007 pledge to reform freedom of information legislation to promote a pro-disclosure culture. I know some senators are cynical about major parties in government maintaining commitments to freedom of information, but I believe it can be clearly demonstrated that that is, in fact, what Labor has done. This bill builds on that work. Labor recognises that further reform is needed to meet current and future challenges to freedom of information legislation, and we will continue to advocate for such reforms in opposition and in government.


Good governance depends on integrity within government and the public's trust in the fair, accountable and transparent operation of government instruments and processes. This is where the current Abbott-Turnbull government falls down. Just to pick a snapshot, we see today issues in the press around Mr Brough and ministerial accountability, and issues around Senator Brandis' slush fund and the creation of that. Senator Xenophon has raised the issues around the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner and this government's attempt to defund that very important freedom of information agency, despite the will of this parliament. And the list goes on.


Perhaps the most stark example, in my mind, were the comments by Prime Minister Turnbull about cabinet ministers utilising non-official sources of communication. On the face of it, and in the discussion around metadata and sexy forms of communication, social media and the like, this may not seem that important. But I remind senators and those who closely followed our discussions on retention of metadata, it is quite contrary to this government's rhetoric in other areas, such as national security—and certainly with respect to freedom of information. Senator Xenophon, just before you leave, I hope that, in the matters you are pursuing with Defence, we do not find that this culture has permeated even organisations such as the Department of Defence and that the material you are seeking does not ultimately end up being encrypted and/or deleted, as the current Prime Minister is encouraging cabinet ministers to contemplate.


These are very serious matters and, if anything, they remind me of the reckless behaviour of the Prime Minister in his former role, before his position as Leader of the Opposition was terminated in the OzCar-Godwin Grech saga. Those senators who may not have followed this closely may not understand that metadata was a key issue in that case as well, as was access to freedom of information, or indeed this parliament's or this Senate's access to information. What occurred in that case was that the Senate Committee of Privileges in investigating that matter was provided with detailed metadata from the Treasury which identified quite reckless behaviour by the then Leader of the Opposition in relation to his direct communications with Godwin Grech and his pursuit of the OzCar affair. I had hoped that Mr Turnbull had learnt from that experience. But, in recent times, in hearing him talking about cabinet ministers utilising non-official sources of communication, those hopes were of course dashed. If he demonstrates further examples of recklessness like this, I suspect that the honeymoon will not last as long as some commentators think.


As I said, good governance depends on integrity within government and the public's trust in fair, accountable and transparent operation. And certainly while there is talk at the moment at the senior levels of government, we will see in the not-too-distant future whether this government can walk that talk. Good governance also requires balancing the need for confidentiality with the legitimate right of the public to know about departmental operations. In our previous reforms to freedom of information legislation, Labor has always strived to strike that balance. Unfortunately, though, as noted by Senator Ludwig when he introduced the bill in May this year, the Abbott—now Turnbull—government 'jeopardised the balance that Labor had put into the Freedom of Information Act to favour secrecy, which has led to less transparency in government'. Indeed, the Public Service Commissioner went as far as to suggest, in comments noted in the Canberra Times in March this year, that government changes to freedom of information laws were 'pernicious'. Can you imagine a Public Service Commissioner suggesting that the behaviour of the government of the day is 'pernicious'?—that is a good word for Senator Brandis, although I doubt that he has taken those thoughts into account. But these comments reflect broader concerns about the government's attempts to weaken freedom of information rights by introducing a 2014 bill to abolish the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner.


Let's move to a little bit more detail about how the government's behaviour with that office demonstrates its lack of commitment to freedom of information. That bill would remove the role of oversight from the independent Information Commissioner. The bill has not been debated in the Senate, because the government cannot progress it, cannot convince the crossbench that this is a measure that we should support. But Senator Brandis continues to avoid directly addressing concerns about the future of the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner. Can we take it that Senator Brandis's recalcitrance on these issues reveals a deeper distaste among his colleagues for the public's right to know how the Abbott-Turnbull government operates?


Despite numerous estimates sessions in which I have questioned Senator Brandis on these issues, and in light of the fact that the government closed the Canberra office of the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner in December 2014, almost 12 months age, leaving the Information Commissioner and the Freedom of Information Commissioner to work from home—in his kitchen, I recall, and I suggested that maybe he had the Thermomix in there to jumble up the data that the government seeks to conceal—there is still no sign of the government responding to these concerns and indicating whether it will proceed with this legislation or whether it will reaffirm the freedom of information culture that has been painstakingly fostered in Australia over many decades.


At least there are voices of reason urging them to make their position clear, such as a former New South Wales state Liberal Attorney-General John Dowd, who in August this year cautioned Senator Brandis that the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner can be abolished only by statute, not by defunding it—which is, of course, Senator Brandis's preferred method of operation, if you look at his experience with the Australia Council, setting up slush funds, and I can think of a few other agencies where this method applies. In his role as president of the Australian section of the International Commission of Jurists, which aims to protect the rule of law, John Dowd went on to warn the Attorney-General that attempts to undermine statutory authorities by executive government through non-legislative means threatened the separation of powers and—one of Senator Brandis's favourite phrases—the rule of law. How he can stand in his current portfolio and continue to utilise these sorts of methods astounds me.


But in reference to Senator Ludwig's bill, the fact that requests under the Freedom of Information Act can currently be refused or documents edited without explanation from agencies or ministers serves only to undermine public trust that government is adhering to those principles. This bill seeks to ensure transparency and accountability within the framework of government decisions concerning freedom of information requests by amending the Freedom of Information Act 1982. The bill's other main purposes include allowing members of the public to be informed about requests made and to receive an explanation as to why documents have not been released, allowing applicants seeking similar documents to build on requests, and reducing duplication in requests. It would achieve these goals by requiring government agencies and ministers to publish the exact wording of freedom of information requests. It will also require government agencies and ministers to publish a statement of reasons concerning their decision to allow, refuse or edit the release of requested documents.


Supporting these measures by passing this bill will make it clear that the government is as committed to good governance based on freedom of information principles as is the opposition. Either way, Labor will continue to defend transparency and accountability in government by protecting the public's right to know, keeping pace with modern challenges to freedom of information through reform.

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2015-11-26,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (10:13):  I rise this morning to speak on the Freedom of Information Amendment (Requests and Reasons) Bill 2015. This bill amends the Freedom of Information Act 1982, which deals with issues of FOI, to require government agencies and ministers to publish the exact wording of freedom of information requests. The amendment will also require agencies and ministers to publish a statement of reasons concerning the decision to allow or refuse the release of requested documents. The bill has the stated aims of ensuring that transparency and accountability are included within the framework of government decisions concerning freedom of information requests, allowing the public to view requests that have been made and the reasons documents were or were not released, allowing applicants seeking similar documents to build upon previous requests, and reducing duplication of requests.


Furthermore, Senator Ludwig's bill states:


Publishing the reasons for decisions will allow for scrutiny of departmental decisions and open the door to further reform to allow review of requests by parties other than the initial applicant.


Section 11C of the FOI Act currently requires agencies and ministerial officers to maintain an online disclosures log. The disclosure log must either publish information made available in response to an FOI request or provide details of how the public may obtain that information. Senator Ludwig's bill proposes to amend these requirements by removing the option of providing details of how the public may obtain information, requiring the publication of the exact wording of the FOI request and requiring the publication of a statement of reasons concerning the decision to allow or refuse the release of the requested documents.


The government does not support this bill for several reasons. One of them is that there is now going to be a new definition of 'working day'. Item 1 of Senator Ludwig's bill inserts a new definition of 'working day', in the interpretation section of the act, as follows:



working day, in relation to a requirement in a provision of this Act to publish information, means a day that is not:


(a) a Saturday; or


(b) a Sunday; or


(c) a public holiday in the place where the function of publishing the information under the provision is to be performed.


As the term 'working day' is used only in section 11C, it is difficult to see how this will eliminate confusion concerning time frames for publishing information, as is the suggested intent of the amendment.


I could go on and on about why this side of the Senate will not be supporting Senator Ludwig's bill. I know my colleague Senator Johnston has much to add to this debate. I will consider leaving my remarks there, and allowing Senator Johnston to make his contribution. Madam Acting Deputy President Lines, can I just get some clarification? Once I finish speaking, will we be going to Senator Ludwig, as the mover of the bill, to the close the debate?




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Lines
):  My understanding, Senator McKenzie, is that it is whichever senator is standing has the call.




Senator McKENZIE:
  Okay. Another reason why this side of the Senate will not be supporting the bill concerns issues in relation to publication of information and access to documents. Items 2 and 3 of Senator Ludwig's bill remove the option for an agency or a minister to publish details of how information may be obtained rather than the information itself. Currently, subsection 11C(3) provides that the information disclosed in the request must be published on the agency or ministerial website by making the information available for downloading from the website, under 11C(3)(a), or by publishing on the website a link to another website from which the information can be downloaded, under 11C(3)(b), or by publishing on the website other details of how the information may be obtained, under 11C(3)(c). Items 2 and 3 of Senator Ludwig's bill amend subsection 11C(3) to remove the option of simply publishing on the website details of how the information may be obtained, rather than the information itself.


Senator Ludwig states that this amendment is '… designed to provide the public with easy access to documents released under the FOI Act.' The current requirement is for information that is released to be published for the public generally on a website. Some agencies publish the documents released on their websites. I know Senator Johnston has a great interest in this area, so I might sit down.

"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2015-11-26,"



Senator JOHNSTON
 (Western Australia) (10:19):  This is a very interesting piece of private member's legislation requiring agencies and ministers to publish the exact wording of freedom of information requests or the answers thereto. The amendments, as I understand them, in the brief time that I have had to review them, will also require agencies and ministers to publish a statement of reasons concerning the decision to allow or refuse the release of requested documents. Of course, whenever someone is asked to present reasons, clearly those reasons will be the subject of judicial review at some further point in time, or pursuant to the review provisions contained in the Freedom of Information Act. Asking ministers to provide reasons that will be the subject of review is a very heavy burden and one which should not be undertaken lightly in terms of increasing and exposing the executive to legal process.


The bill has the stated aims of: ensuring transparency and accountability are included within the framework of government decisions concerning freedom of information requests; allowing the public to view requests that have been made and the reasons documents were or were not released. The current situation, as the law provides for today, allows for just that; allowing applicants seeking similar documents to build upon previous requests; and reducing duplication of requests. All of these appear, superficially, to be quite laudable objectives. One has to ask the question, given that the opposition were in power for six years in Australia from 2007-2013: why these amendments and changes were not brought forward then. I think I have a bit of an inkling as to why that was: transparency was not something that was high on their agenda at the time. Indeed, one just momentarily needs to reflect on the modelling for the carbon tax and how that was unavailable to any members of parliament or to the public and was continually denied in supporting the financial workings of that carbon tax. In six years, there was no change, no transparency, under Labor, and now we have a private senator's bill that seeks to put an enormous administrative burden upon the government of the day—namely, the Turnbull government.


Section 11C of the FOI Act currently requires agencies and ministerial officers to maintain an online disclosure log. The disclosure log must either publish information made available in response to an FOI request or provide details of how the public may obtain that information. Providing details to the public as to how to go about obtaining the information is a stock standard, usual and understood methodology in the accessing of government documents. Why would you want to muck around with that? That is a bit of a mystery that the good senator, Senator Ludwig, needs to explain to us.


Senator Ludwig's bill proposes to amend these requirements by removing the option of providing details on how the public may obtain the information. That seems to me to be a very retrograde, backward step. The bill is entitled 'freedom of information' and yet we are not going to tell the public how to access that information. Secondly, it requires the publication of the exact wording of the FOI request and, thirdly, it requires publication of a statement of reasons concerning the decision to allow or refuse the release of the requested documents. I have dealt with the matter of providing those reasons.


The current disclosure log requirements, together with the Information Publication Scheme, or IPS as it is called, were part of the previous Labor government's package of FOI reforms in 2010. These reforms were intended to reduce the number of FOI requests over time, with the FOI Act providing access to information through agency-driven publication rather than only in response to requests for documents. However, the Hawke FOI review found that the implementation of the Information Publication Scheme had, strangely, the completely opposite effect—that is, instead of making things easier, more accessible and more transparent, the IPS and disclosure log requirements in many cases increased the FOI processing costs, with resources being diverted from other key areas to assist with FOI processing. 


Of course, Senator Ludwig has a very illustrious record of asking page after page of quite superfluous questions at both Senate estimates and in FOI requests. As well as increasing the cost of FOI processing, these initiatives have not resulted in any reduction in the number of FOI requests received by agencies and ministers. So the Labor Party's reform measures of 2010 actually achieved, in my understanding and in my argument, the opposite of what was intended. Things became more process bound and more costly and it became more difficult for the government of the day to respond to and answer the FOI requests, which I would have thought was completely contrary to what was intended. Similarly, this private senator's bill is going to exacerbate the situation, because it simply has not been thought through properly. If it has been thought through, I think it has an ulterior motive to it. In fact, since FOI reforms commenced in 2010, the number of FOI requests has increased from 23,605 in 2010-11 to 28,643 in 2013-14.


I note that the bill seeks to change the definition of 'working day'. I find that very interesting and a little incongruous. 'Working day' has a common or garden-variety meaning in the minds of most normal people. A working day is a day where people are actually working. Monday to Friday is the Interpretation Act's assessment of what are working days, in my understanding. The term is only used once in the legislation, in section 11C. It is very difficult to see how an artificial, contrived definition of the words 'working day' will eliminate confusion concerning time frames for publishing information. As is usual with legislation that has not been thought through, this will be even more confusing. Accordingly, it is a significant flaw in this legislation. It provides for unintended consequences, which is rather typical of the sort of half-baked legislative understanding that comes to this place from the Labor Party from time to time—only rivalled, usually, by that of the Greens.


Items 2 and 3 of Senator Ludwig's bill remove the option for an agency or minister to publish details of how information may be obtained rather than the information itself. Currently section 11C(3) provides that the information disclosed in the requests must be published on the agency or ministerial website, by, firstly, making information available for downloading from the website—that is section 11C(3)(a)—and, secondly, publishing on the website a link to another website from which the information can be downloaded, which is in section 11C(3)(b), or, thirdly, publishing on the website other details of how the information may be obtained. That is found in section 11C(3)(c). Items 2 and 3 of the good senator's bill amend section 11C(3) to remove the option of simply publishing on a website details of how the information may be obtained, rather than the information itself.



I must say I find this legislation and the intent behind it very, very vexing and troubling. Why would you want to close off an avenue for members of the public to find and access further information? This is very, very peculiar. I am not sure what the good senator's intentions are here. Senator Ludwig states that this amendment is designed to provide the public with easy access to documents released under the FOI Act. The current requirement for information to be released is that it is published for the public, generally on a website. Some agencies publish the documents released on their websites together with the FOI requests. What this will do is remove the flexibility, where the information cannot be readily published on a website, of providing details of how the information can be accessed. And so references to the Australian Bureau of statistics and other annual reports where there is a wealth of other information—all of those sorts of things—apparently cause some angst to the senator in the presentation and motivate him to present these amendments. I must say I find all of that very, very confusing.




It may not be straightforward for an agency or minister to publish some documents on a disclosure law in an accessible format or to convert documents to such formats within 10 working days. 
Those difficulties and disabilities are not addressed in the legislation; as one would expect, the details have not been considered—to use a colloquialism: the whole thing is a bit half-baked.





This may be an issue, for example, if information ha
s been redacted from a document or where the voluminous nature of the document is only available as a hard copy
 or in a PDF format. Removing flexibility will impose an administrative burden on agencies and ministerial offices in preparing documents for publication within 10 working days of the information being released. This could create challenges for agencies and ministers in managing an increased 
FOI workload—and


I come back to the numbers that I gave previously: we started off with the Labor Party's amendments with 23,605 FOI requests in 2010, and the amendments have generated an increase to 28,643 in 2013-14. As I was saying, these amendments are going to generate challenges for agencies and ministers in maintaining an increased FOI workload and impact on the processing of FOI applications. That all converts to one thing: cost. 





We all know on this side of the chamber that the very last thing the Labor Party—and its senators—ever think of in legislation is the cost. They have absolutely no regard for the 
respect required for taxpayers' money in these crazy schemes that they seem to want to implement. 




Item 5 of Senator Ludwig's bill


amends the F
OI
 Act to insert a new provision—a new section 11D. This
 proposed
 new section requires agencies or ministers, 
firstly, 
where access is given to
 the
 whole document, to publish the 
FOI
 request itself, and the reasons for the decision, within 10 working days after the person is given access. 
Secondly, it
 requires agencies or ministers, where access is given to an edited document, to publish the 
FOI
 request itself and the notice that an edited copy has been prepared, and the grounds for deletion, within the 10 working days after notice is given. If a request for the reasons for the decision is made for the refusal to the whole document, 
they are
 to 
be 
publish
ed
 within 10 working days after the reasons are given. 
Thirdly, w
here access is not given to a document at all, 
they are
 require
d
 to publish the 
FOI
 request itself within 10 working days after the decision, and the reasons f
or the decision
 within 10 working days after the  reasons  are provided . Essentially, this provision will require agencies and ministers to publish the exact wording of FOI requests. If someone has ever seen some of these FOI requests, they go on for page after page after page.




The new section 11D will also require agencies and ministers to publish a statement of reasons concerning the decision to allow or refuse the release of requested documents. Section 26 of the 
act
 currently provides for statements of reasons to be given where a decision is made to refuse access. 
Whether you grant or refuse, it appears that you will have to provide reasons as to why you are granting.





Section 22 provides reasons to be given where an edited copy of a document is provided. The difference with the new provision is that a statement of reasons is also required when access is granted in full
—I would have thought that is completely ridiculous and quite stupid, but what am supposed to expect here? In addition,
 all statements of reasons, as well as the requests themselves, must now be published within 10 working days. 
What that means, given the change in definition of 10 working days, I am not sure. I think we are all left to wonder why we are taking the definition of 10 working days and turning it into something not readily understood. Ten working days—if it were Monday to Friday days—or two weeks are still not a lot of time.





Once again, this new provision will impose a substantive administrative burden on agencies and ministerial officers, which could result in significant processing delays in other aspects of 
FOI
 processing. 
Of course that is something which the good senator has completely ignored.





Senator Ludwig states that this measure will facilitate more practical use of freedom of information requests, reduce duplication of requests and open the door for further reform by parties other than the initial applicant. 
I would like to see that because, as I have said, having tried once at reform, we now know that those reforms and their unintended consequences made the process more difficult, more expensive, challenged schedules and generally achieved objectives in complete opposition to what the original intent of those reforms was. Once again, the Labor Party lived up to everybody's expectation that they really have no idea what they are doing when it comes to reform.





It is more likely that publishing reasons for decisions will result in overburdened agencies that are struggling to manage increasingly heavy 
FOI
 workloads
,
 taking shortcuts and 
adopting published reasons rather than making a decision based on the circumstance of 
each particular
 request. 
I think that is a very logical and likely outcome which I would emphasise to anybody listening to me speaking now.





In conclusion, the
 government is committed to being a transparent, accountable and open government. The 
FOI
 Act is an important accountability measure, which facilitates the open and tran
sparent operation of government, and the dealing with individual proprietary rights and privacy matters of people from time to time, as it must, in carrying out all of the heavy burden of the day-to-day activities of good government.





Rather than ensuring accountability and transparency, the measures in the bill will compromise the effectiveness of the decision-making processes under the 
FOI Act—and compromise in a very substantial way. 
It is 
very 
unlikely that the measures in the bill will reduce duplication of requests, as requests cannot be refused where information is publicly available free of charge or where information that would substantially address the subject matter of the request is regularly made available—for example,
 in annual reports or otherwise; and


I have dealt with that.



Nor can a request be refused if the request is substantially the same as another FOI request that has already been made. So every second day of every month of every year you can ask for the same information because it inconveniences the government. That, I think, is the nub of what this might be all about. An applicant will not need to provide a reason for making an FOI request. So what this does is open the floodgates to some form of process here that is designed to stand on the hose, to be expensive and to cause the government of the day a lot of administrative woe and problems. That is all very well but, at the end of the day, I think ordinary citizens of this country need the government of the day to work in a cost-effective and efficient manner and not be completely focused on the process of FOI requests.


This bill will not reduce duplication of requests and it will not reduce the number of FOI requests. As has been clearly set out, their reforms failed to deliver. Notwithstanding that they expressed an intent to reduce the number of requests, those requests have increased. Instead, the bill will impose further unnecessary steps and procedures into existing processes for access to government information under the FOI Act. This will increase the costs, as I have said, and will increase the complexity of FOI processing. Remember: FOI is for ordinary citizens. They are not lawyers; they simply want information. So this bill is seeking to increase the costs associated with processing FOI requests and increase complexity and will result in significant processing delays. I would have thought that that was completely in opposition to what we in this place should want to do. It is a mystery to me why a senator of Senator Ludwig's standing would want to come forward with such a nonsensical, stupid bill.


Debate adjourned.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Freedom of Information Amendment (Requests and Reasons) Bill 2015</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2015-11-26,"



Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (09:31):  I had to look very carefully to see the last time I had the honour of taking part in this discussion about freedom of information. When I checked the Hansard, I saw that I had made my first incredibly important three-minute contribution in this discussion on Thursday, 18 June. I know that people would be really interested to know where we are moving on this particular piece of legislation. It is quite simple. Senator Ludwig has, through his Freedom of Information Amendment (Requests and Reasons) Bill 2015, put forward a proposition to the Senate to make freedom of information more open and transparent and to allow the public to know exactly what is going on with applications across the range of government agencies. 


Many people in the chamber have had the opportunity to make a contribution on this bill, as the bill has arrived in private members' business on a few occasions. I think it is important to understand that the original designers of the bill had a very straightforward sense of what freedom of information truly is. When they began looking at these issues, particularly around the early 2000s, at both the federal and state levels, it was felt that we needed to have effective freedom of information mechanisms. In my own state of Queensland it was actually a bit earlier than that, in the late 1990s, that the Queensland state government acted in response to concerns from the community—the legal community and people who had been involved in the system. The concerns were that, whilst there had been attempts made to put systems in place to help people understand decisions, processes had not been stringent enough to effectively allow not only the applicant making the freedom of information request but also other people who might well have been interested in that issue to know what requests had been made and what the government's responses had been. That is indeed what Senator Ludwig is putting forward for the Senate to consider in this private member's legislation. 


We have the system. All departmental websites publicise information about their commitment to issues around freedom of information. You can go through the dot points on these websites that say how it operates, what the process is for applicants and what the time frames are for freedom of information requests and responses. They also tell you that in some cases the department will be able to charge for providing the information, based on the amount of time it would take. The websites also tell you that you may not always be able to get the information you are seeking, because there are some things that departments decide cannot be released. 


But there must be justifications for those decisions. That is one of the key elements of Senator Ludwig's private member's bill: that those explanations of why a request has not been successful should be articulated in a way that is understandable not just to the applicant but to other people interested in the issue—because the motivation for freedom of information requests varies across the board. Some people have very personal circumstances they are trying to obtain information about, but others are looking at policy areas that are of interest or are disputed—decisions of government or decisions of departments that they may want to question. When you are seeking information that you have not been able to get in any way other than a freedom of information request, there should be public notification about why the decision was made—why decisions were made to not allow access to information and indeed why decisions were made to allow access.


With this bill we are moving forward to strengthen the existing legislation, the act that is in place, the one that the Labor government committed to in our 2007 campaign—the commitment that we would strengthen freedom of information and make sure it operated as it was intended to. Indeed the title gives you a hint about what the whole idea was. It was to have information about government actions available freely to the public. Freedom of information, by its very nature and its very title, sets up an expectation in the community that you will be able to have access to information. That is what Senator Ludwig's bill addresses. The bill will strengthen the existing legislation to deliver on the original core principles which are enshrined within the act—the core principles that say there should be transparency, there should be understanding of decisions that have been made and there should be policy processes that are observed. 


I mentioned on 18 June that there are some areas, particularly around issues of security and anything that has the word 'ASIO' attached to it, where there is no way you are able to get the full detail of some decisions. There is probably an understanding that this is true because it is indeed linked to issues that are of national security sensitivity. But that should be clearly identified. It should not just be dismissed with a one-line explanation. If a request for information is put forward and a decision is made that it cannot be released because it has national security implications, that should be fully explained. Without going into any specific examples, that is what we are asking for. We understand that there are limits. We are not saying that every document should be released—no-one can say that. But what we are saying is that, when decisions are made, we should understand them.


Senator Ludwig's bill goes into detail. The whole idea is that we are allowing the public to see specific and detailed reasons as to why freedom of information requests have been denied. I do not think that is an unreasonable expectation. If we are committed to transparency of government, if people are to understand what decisions of government and parliament will mean for them and their community, when people exercise their right to access the system and put in an FOI application they should expect to get a reasonably detailed, focused and personal response. That was the expectation of the original legislation.


There were concerns raised by some on the government side about possible workload issues and difficulties in the operation of the system with the details in this legislation around the timeliness and amount of information that can be released. However, on balance, the expectation of having freedom of information legislation operational in government departments should mean that there will be decisions to make those resources effectively funded. Government departments already have a section that is linked to freedom of information—and they are often linked to other communication activities such as ministerial correspondence. But resource priority should be given to the responsibility of freedom of information in government departments.


In a time of budget restrictions in government departments—and I have no particular evidence of the current administrative arrangements in government departments—it may well be that administrative decisions around how many people are working in this area may have some impact on the timeliness of decisions and perhaps the fullness of information provided. If that is the case, Senator Ludwig's proposed amendments to the FOI Act would ensure that there will now be a legislative basis to make sure funding is provided. A clear definition of timeliness and the types of explanations that must be available to the public when they make an FOI request would be set out in the legislation so that government departments would have the stimulant to say, 'This is what we have to do and, therefore, we have to resource it effectively.'


That is a very important element of the legislation. If Senator Ludwig's private member's bill is accepted, people working in this very important area will no longer be free to not meet the deadlines—which is 10 days in this legislation—and the requirement to provide transparent and detailed responses to requests. That would be set out in the resourcing decisions that the department makes. They would know the volume of FOI requests they get—and that varies from department to department. Some departments receive a much larger number of FOI requests than others. Nonetheless, it is clearly the responsibility of government departments to provide this service.


I had a quick look at a range of government department websites. Their websites state that they provide an FOI service—as they must. Tightening up the time frames and the expectations around the type of response that must be made would be part of the government departments' decision making about their distribution of resources. We get complaints from the community about time delays in getting a response and, when you get a response, the limited nature of it. Therefore, the administrative processes would be strengthened so that there would not be a time delay or the very curt responses I have seen to some FOI requests.


The bill before us does not make a large number of changes. What it does is remind us of the original intent of freedom of information for government and the public sector. It puts in place the clear responsibility to make information available, to give an effective response to requests and also to engage with the person or group who has put in the request. That was the expectation when freedom of information was originally introduced in the Commonwealth and state parliaments. Over that time, people have had a chance to evolve in terms of the way it operates. There have been numerous discussions and conferences among professionals in this area to look at best practice and to examine how best the system should operate. Out of those discussions, particularly by professionals who work in the field and by the community, who have been requesting freedom of information responses over many years, has come a view that there needs to be tightening of the system; there needs to be a reinforcement of what freedom of information really means. There is also a clear expectation of the government that, when citizens—and this is a term used a lot in public sector discussions currently; talk of citizens accessing the services seems to have come into vogue over the last couple of years—put forward a request under freedom of information, they should be allowed to see specific and detailed reasons for the response to their request, and that there should be timeliness around when this information is provided.


Also—and this is one of the things I like about this bill—it would mean that, published on the websites, people would be able to see the nature of the requests and the responses. Another element has been that, when individuals access the system, sometimes that stimulates more action from other people in the community. So, on a particular issue, there could be a series of requests for information, and that could be built upon by seeing what had already happened by the website discussions around a particular issue. That seems to be a step forward in the way freedom of information should operate. It also seems that this shows genuine respect not just for the community but for the people who worked so hard to ensure that freedom of information legislation was introduced and implemented in our Commonwealth departments.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Seselja, Sen Zed",LP,2015-11-26,"



Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory) (09:46):  I am very pleased to contribute to the debate today on the Freedom of Information Amendment (Requests and Reasons) Bill 2015. I, along with the coalition government, support the Freedom of Information Act and support transparency in government. It is one of our country's greatest strengths that we ensure the decisions of government are put under scrutiny and, where possible, are out in the open. This government has a strong record over the last two years of making the small improvements to regulations and legislation necessary to make the operations of government simpler and more transparent. But this bill does not do anything to help with transparency in government. It does not relieve the administrative burden of FOI requests. It will, in fact, increase the costs and complexity of FOI processing and result in significant processing delays. Of course, it certainly is an admirable intention to improve the FOI system wherever possible. This government would be quite happy to support such improvements if they are well thought through—but this bill is not well thought through. This is typical of the back-of-the-coaster policy style of the modern Australian Labor Party. One of the reasons we will not be supporting the bill is that it has a range of unintended consequences, which often arise when you have not properly done the policy work.


To explain why the bill will not work, we should take some time to consider what the bill intends to achieve. This bill seeks to amend the Freedom of Information Act 1982 to require government agencies and ministers to publish the exact wording of freedom of information requests. The amendments will also require agencies and ministers to publish a statement of reasons concerning the decision to allow or refuse the release of requested documents. The bill has the stated aims of: ensuring transparency and accountability are included within the framework of government decisions concerning freedom of information requests; allowing the public to view requests that have been made and the reasons why documents were or were not released; allowing applicants seeking similar documents to build upon previous requests; and reducing duplication of requests. Furthermore, the explanatory memorandum to Senator Ludwig's bill states:


Publishing the reasons for decisions will allow for scrutiny of departmental decisions and open the door to further reform to allow review of requests by parties other than the initial applicant.


Section 11C of the FOI Act currently requires agencies and ministerial offices to maintain an online disclosure log. The disclosure log must either publish information made available in response to an FOI request or provide details of how the public may obtain that information. Senator Ludwig's bill proposes to amend these requirements by: removing the option of providing the details of how the public may obtain information; requiring the publication of the exacting wording of the FOI request; and requiring publication of a statement of reasons concerning the decision to allow or refuse the release of the requested documents.


The current disclosure log requirements, together with the information publication scheme, or IPS, were part of the previous Labor government's package of FOI reforms in 2010. These reforms were intended to reduce the number of FOI requests over time, with the FOI Act providing access to information through agency driven publication, rather than only in response to requests for documents. Again, these are all pretty reasonable sounding goals and, on a cursory reading of the proposed legislation and seeing those intentions, this could be a bill worth looking at. However, as reported in the Hawke FOI review, implementation of the IPS and disclosure log requirements have, in many cases, increased FOI processing costs, with resources being diverted from other key areas to assist with FOI processing. As well as increasing the costs of FOI processing, these initiatives have not resulted in any reduction in the number of FOI requests received by agencies and ministers. In fact, since the FOI reforms commenced in 2010, the number of FOI requests have increased from 23,605 in 2010-11 to 28,643 in 2013-14. So a closer reading shows that what this bill proposes does not in fact work. So we on this side of the chamber do not support this bill—because we do not support legislation that says it will do one thing but, in fact, does the opposite.


Let us look, then, in some further detail at how this bill will work as opposed to what it intends. Item 1 of Senator Ludwig's bill inserts a new definition of 'working day' in the interpretation section of the act, which applies in relation to a requirement in a provision of the FOI Act to publish information to mean a day that is not a Saturday, a Sunday or a public holiday in the place where the function of publishing the information under the provision is to be performed. As the term 'working day' is only used in section 11C, it is difficult to see how this will 'eliminate confusion concerning time frames for publishing information' as is the suggested intent of the amendment. Items 2 and 3 of Senator Ludwig's bill remove the option for an agency or minister to publish details of how information may be obtained rather than the information itself. Currently subsection 11C(3) provides that the information disclosed in the request must be published on the agency or ministerial website by: making the information available for downloading from the website; publishing on the website a link to another website from which the information can be downloaded; or publishing on the website other details of how the information may be obtained. Items 2 and 3 of Ludwig's bill amend subsection 11C(3) to remove the option of simply publishing on a website details of how the information may be obtained rather than the information itself.


Senator Ludwig states that this amendment is designed to provide the public with easy access to documents released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982. The current requirement is for information that is released to be published to the public, generally on a website. Some agencies publish the documents released on their websites and the FOI request. What this will do is remove the flexibility, where the information cannot be readily published on a website, of providing details of how the information can be accessed. The current flexibility ensures that there is no impediment for those who are interested in accessing the particular information, while at the same time not imposing an onerous administrative burden on the agency.


It may not be straightforward for an agency or minister to publish some documents in accessible formats on a disclosure log or to convert documents to such formats within 10 working days. This may be an issue, for example, if information has been redacted from a document or where a voluminous document is only available as a hard copy or in a PDF format. Removing flexibility will impose an administrative burden on agencies and ministerial offices in preparing documents for publications within 10 working days of information being released. This could create challenges for agencies and ministers in managing increased FOI workload and impact on the processing of FOI applications


Item 5 of Senator Ludwig's bill amends the FOI Act to insert a new provision, section 11D. This proposed new section requires agencies or ministers: where access is given to the whole document, to publish the FOI request itself and the reasons for decision within 10 working days after the person is given access; where access is given to an edited document, to publish the FOI request itself and the notice that an edited copy has been prepared and grounds for deletion within 10 working days after the notice is given; if a request for reasons for decision is made for the refusal to the whole document, publish the reasons within 10 working days after the reasons are given; and where access is not given to a document at all, to publish the FOI request itself within 10 working days after the decisions and the reasons for decision within 10 working days after the reasons are provided. Essentially, this provision will require agencies and ministers to publish the exact wording of FOI requests.


New section 11D will also require agencies and ministers to publish a statement of reasons concerning the decision to allow or refuse the release of requested documents. Section 26 of the FOI Act currently provides for statements of reasons to be given where a decision is made to refuse access. Section 22 provides reasons to be given where an edited copy of a document is provided. The difference with the new provision is that a statement of reasons is also required when access is granted in full and that all statements of reasons, as well as the requests themselves, must now be published within 10 working days. Once again, this new provision will impose a substantial administrative burden on agencies and ministerial offices which could result in significant processing delays in other aspects of FOI processing. Senator Ludwig states that this measure will facilitate more practical use of freedom of information requests, will reduce duplication of requests and open the door for further reform by parties other than the initial applicant. But as I have already said, it is more likely that publishing reasons for decisions will result in overburdened agencies struggling to manage increasingly heavy FOI workloads, taking short cuts and adopting published reasons rather than making a decision based on the circumstances of the particular FOI request.


It is for all of these reasons outlined by me over the past few minutes that the coalition will not be supporting Senator Ludwig's bill.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (09:57):  I do support this bill for a number of reasons. I note that Senator Seselja has given an articulate exposition of the reasons why the government does not support this bill, and I respect that. It is a good thing that Senator Ludwig has introduced this bill because, at the very least, it puts FOI on the agenda. It may not be a very sexy topic, FOI, but it is absolutely crucial in the transparency and the good working of government. It is important that this topic is debated in this way, with good ideas coming forward. FOI is one of the few avenues that Australian citizens can access the information and documents held by government agencies. I believe Senator Ludwig's bill improves the quality and access to FOI decisions and makes that FOI framework more transparent and accessible.


The bill requires government agencies and ministers to publish the exact wording of FOI requests and a statement of reasons concerning the decisions to allow, refuse or edit the release of requested documents. In this way, it would set up a paper trail, an electronic trail of what FOI requests have been made and what happened to them. It improves the ability of FOI to ensure that information from government agencies is 'readily available to persons affected by those government agencies'. The bill will make it easier for applicants to build on the decisions of previous FOI applications and avoid unnecessary duplication of requests. So when the government says this is going to be unwieldy and it is going to cost more, in fact it will not. It will mean, by having this electronic trail of requests, fewer unnecessary FOI requests. People will be able to see what has been requested and what the response has been rather than putting in another application. This will reduce red tape—and I know that the government loves reducing red tape. I think Senator Ludwig is here to help the government to reduce red tape by having a more streamlined system of FOI. I believe it protects the privacy of individuals by making sure personal information is removed. The government needs to acknowledge that its record on FOI, since coming to office, is a very patchy record.


The government remains committed to defunding the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner—an office that provides oversight of large numbers of FOI decisions in a way that is far more cost-effective than having to go to the AAT, with all of the costs that involves. I am currently in the middle of an issue involving some Defence documents that I am looking for through the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner—and I have just reminded myself that I need to provide a response to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner's request to respond to Defence's position. Who knows, I may end up in the AAT over that request relating to defence issues arising from the Winter-White report that I believe ought to be disclosed to the people of Australia.


Office of the Australian Information Commissioner figures reveal that in the 2014-15 financial year it finalised 482 applications for review of FOI decisions and finalised 82 FOI complaints. If you consider what it does and what the costs would be if you went to the AAT, you can see it is a very cost-effective agency. It is a false economy to defund that office. I think it is interesting to reflect on an opinion piece by Sean Parnell, The Australian's FOI editor, headed, 'Open government? We’re still waiting'. He said:


The introduction of tougher security laws and secrecy provisions in Canberra has yet to be balanced out by any increase in government transparency or citizen engagement.


He made the point that:


While Malcolm Turnbull became Prime Minister promising to be “truly consultative” and support “open government,” any such change has so far been internal, with no obvious policy or cultural shift.


He refers to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner and the cuts to that office—the attempts to defund that office—which are very disturbing.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  Contrary to the will of parliament, too.




Senator XENOPHON:
  Contrary to the will of the parliament—that is right, Senator Collins.


It is interesting what the opinion piece of Mr Parnell makes of the whole issue of Australia joining the Open Government Partnership:


The former Labor government also committed Australia to join the Open Government Partnership, a global transparency and citizen engagement initiative. Under the Coalition, however, nothing has happened, with responsibility for the OGP shifting between ministers and becoming a “captain’s pick” for Abbott.


Mr Parnell concludes his opinion piece by saying:


While there are rumours Turnbull will soon have Australia re-embrace the OGP, cultural issues remain. Several requests last week for the Prime Minister’s office to clarify his position on the OGP failed to elicit any response, let alone a positive one.


I am hoping that this is something that the new Turnbull administration will consider. 


To be a truly consultative and open government, as the Prime Minister said—and I take him at his word about his desire to do so—embrace the OGP; embrace reform to the FOI laws, such as the bill that Senator Ludwig has put up, which I think will lead to greater transparency and greater efficiency in FOI; and ensure there is appropriate funding for the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner. I support this bill.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2015-11-26,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (10:03):  The Freedom of Information Amendment (Requests and Reasons) Bill 2015 builds on Labor's long commitment to the principles of freedom of information and the public's right to know, and on a 2007 pledge to reform freedom of information legislation to promote a pro-disclosure culture. I know some senators are cynical about major parties in government maintaining commitments to freedom of information, but I believe it can be clearly demonstrated that that is, in fact, what Labor has done. This bill builds on that work. Labor recognises that further reform is needed to meet current and future challenges to freedom of information legislation, and we will continue to advocate for such reforms in opposition and in government.


Good governance depends on integrity within government and the public's trust in the fair, accountable and transparent operation of government instruments and processes. This is where the current Abbott-Turnbull government falls down. Just to pick a snapshot, we see today issues in the press around Mr Brough and ministerial accountability, and issues around Senator Brandis' slush fund and the creation of that. Senator Xenophon has raised the issues around the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner and this government's attempt to defund that very important freedom of information agency, despite the will of this parliament. And the list goes on.


Perhaps the most stark example, in my mind, were the comments by Prime Minister Turnbull about cabinet ministers utilising non-official sources of communication. On the face of it, and in the discussion around metadata and sexy forms of communication, social media and the like, this may not seem that important. But I remind senators and those who closely followed our discussions on retention of metadata, it is quite contrary to this government's rhetoric in other areas, such as national security—and certainly with respect to freedom of information. Senator Xenophon, just before you leave, I hope that, in the matters you are pursuing with Defence, we do not find that this culture has permeated even organisations such as the Department of Defence and that the material you are seeking does not ultimately end up being encrypted and/or deleted, as the current Prime Minister is encouraging cabinet ministers to contemplate.


These are very serious matters and, if anything, they remind me of the reckless behaviour of the Prime Minister in his former role, before his position as Leader of the Opposition was terminated in the OzCar-Godwin Grech saga. Those senators who may not have followed this closely may not understand that metadata was a key issue in that case as well, as was access to freedom of information, or indeed this parliament's or this Senate's access to information. What occurred in that case was that the Senate Committee of Privileges in investigating that matter was provided with detailed metadata from the Treasury which identified quite reckless behaviour by the then Leader of the Opposition in relation to his direct communications with Godwin Grech and his pursuit of the OzCar affair. I had hoped that Mr Turnbull had learnt from that experience. But, in recent times, in hearing him talking about cabinet ministers utilising non-official sources of communication, those hopes were of course dashed. If he demonstrates further examples of recklessness like this, I suspect that the honeymoon will not last as long as some commentators think.


As I said, good governance depends on integrity within government and the public's trust in fair, accountable and transparent operation. And certainly while there is talk at the moment at the senior levels of government, we will see in the not-too-distant future whether this government can walk that talk. Good governance also requires balancing the need for confidentiality with the legitimate right of the public to know about departmental operations. In our previous reforms to freedom of information legislation, Labor has always strived to strike that balance. Unfortunately, though, as noted by Senator Ludwig when he introduced the bill in May this year, the Abbott—now Turnbull—government 'jeopardised the balance that Labor had put into the Freedom of Information Act to favour secrecy, which has led to less transparency in government'. Indeed, the Public Service Commissioner went as far as to suggest, in comments noted in the Canberra Times in March this year, that government changes to freedom of information laws were 'pernicious'. Can you imagine a Public Service Commissioner suggesting that the behaviour of the government of the day is 'pernicious'?—that is a good word for Senator Brandis, although I doubt that he has taken those thoughts into account. But these comments reflect broader concerns about the government's attempts to weaken freedom of information rights by introducing a 2014 bill to abolish the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner.


Let's move to a little bit more detail about how the government's behaviour with that office demonstrates its lack of commitment to freedom of information. That bill would remove the role of oversight from the independent Information Commissioner. The bill has not been debated in the Senate, because the government cannot progress it, cannot convince the crossbench that this is a measure that we should support. But Senator Brandis continues to avoid directly addressing concerns about the future of the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner. Can we take it that Senator Brandis's recalcitrance on these issues reveals a deeper distaste among his colleagues for the public's right to know how the Abbott-Turnbull government operates?


Despite numerous estimates sessions in which I have questioned Senator Brandis on these issues, and in light of the fact that the government closed the Canberra office of the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner in December 2014, almost 12 months age, leaving the Information Commissioner and the Freedom of Information Commissioner to work from home—in his kitchen, I recall, and I suggested that maybe he had the Thermomix in there to jumble up the data that the government seeks to conceal—there is still no sign of the government responding to these concerns and indicating whether it will proceed with this legislation or whether it will reaffirm the freedom of information culture that has been painstakingly fostered in Australia over many decades.


At least there are voices of reason urging them to make their position clear, such as a former New South Wales state Liberal Attorney-General John Dowd, who in August this year cautioned Senator Brandis that the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner can be abolished only by statute, not by defunding it—which is, of course, Senator Brandis's preferred method of operation, if you look at his experience with the Australia Council, setting up slush funds, and I can think of a few other agencies where this method applies. In his role as president of the Australian section of the International Commission of Jurists, which aims to protect the rule of law, John Dowd went on to warn the Attorney-General that attempts to undermine statutory authorities by executive government through non-legislative means threatened the separation of powers and—one of Senator Brandis's favourite phrases—the rule of law. How he can stand in his current portfolio and continue to utilise these sorts of methods astounds me.


But in reference to Senator Ludwig's bill, the fact that requests under the Freedom of Information Act can currently be refused or documents edited without explanation from agencies or ministers serves only to undermine public trust that government is adhering to those principles. This bill seeks to ensure transparency and accountability within the framework of government decisions concerning freedom of information requests by amending the Freedom of Information Act 1982. The bill's other main purposes include allowing members of the public to be informed about requests made and to receive an explanation as to why documents have not been released, allowing applicants seeking similar documents to build on requests, and reducing duplication in requests. It would achieve these goals by requiring government agencies and ministers to publish the exact wording of freedom of information requests. It will also require government agencies and ministers to publish a statement of reasons concerning their decision to allow, refuse or edit the release of requested documents.


Supporting these measures by passing this bill will make it clear that the government is as committed to good governance based on freedom of information principles as is the opposition. Either way, Labor will continue to defend transparency and accountability in government by protecting the public's right to know, keeping pace with modern challenges to freedom of information through reform.

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2015-11-26,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (10:13):  I rise this morning to speak on the Freedom of Information Amendment (Requests and Reasons) Bill 2015. This bill amends the Freedom of Information Act 1982, which deals with issues of FOI, to require government agencies and ministers to publish the exact wording of freedom of information requests. The amendment will also require agencies and ministers to publish a statement of reasons concerning the decision to allow or refuse the release of requested documents. The bill has the stated aims of ensuring that transparency and accountability are included within the framework of government decisions concerning freedom of information requests, allowing the public to view requests that have been made and the reasons documents were or were not released, allowing applicants seeking similar documents to build upon previous requests, and reducing duplication of requests.


Furthermore, Senator Ludwig's bill states:


Publishing the reasons for decisions will allow for scrutiny of departmental decisions and open the door to further reform to allow review of requests by parties other than the initial applicant.


Section 11C of the FOI Act currently requires agencies and ministerial officers to maintain an online disclosures log. The disclosure log must either publish information made available in response to an FOI request or provide details of how the public may obtain that information. Senator Ludwig's bill proposes to amend these requirements by removing the option of providing details of how the public may obtain information, requiring the publication of the exact wording of the FOI request and requiring the publication of a statement of reasons concerning the decision to allow or refuse the release of the requested documents.


The government does not support this bill for several reasons. One of them is that there is now going to be a new definition of 'working day'. Item 1 of Senator Ludwig's bill inserts a new definition of 'working day', in the interpretation section of the act, as follows:



working day, in relation to a requirement in a provision of this Act to publish information, means a day that is not:


(a) a Saturday; or


(b) a Sunday; or


(c) a public holiday in the place where the function of publishing the information under the provision is to be performed.


As the term 'working day' is used only in section 11C, it is difficult to see how this will eliminate confusion concerning time frames for publishing information, as is the suggested intent of the amendment.


I could go on and on about why this side of the Senate will not be supporting Senator Ludwig's bill. I know my colleague Senator Johnston has much to add to this debate. I will consider leaving my remarks there, and allowing Senator Johnston to make his contribution. Madam Acting Deputy President Lines, can I just get some clarification? Once I finish speaking, will we be going to Senator Ludwig, as the mover of the bill, to the close the debate?




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Lines
):  My understanding, Senator McKenzie, is that it is whichever senator is standing has the call.




Senator McKENZIE:
  Okay. Another reason why this side of the Senate will not be supporting the bill concerns issues in relation to publication of information and access to documents. Items 2 and 3 of Senator Ludwig's bill remove the option for an agency or a minister to publish details of how information may be obtained rather than the information itself. Currently, subsection 11C(3) provides that the information disclosed in the request must be published on the agency or ministerial website by making the information available for downloading from the website, under 11C(3)(a), or by publishing on the website a link to another website from which the information can be downloaded, under 11C(3)(b), or by publishing on the website other details of how the information may be obtained, under 11C(3)(c). Items 2 and 3 of Senator Ludwig's bill amend subsection 11C(3) to remove the option of simply publishing on the website details of how the information may be obtained, rather than the information itself.


Senator Ludwig states that this amendment is '… designed to provide the public with easy access to documents released under the FOI Act.' The current requirement is for information that is released to be published for the public generally on a website. Some agencies publish the documents released on their websites. I know Senator Johnston has a great interest in this area, so I might sit down.

Senator JOHNSTON
 (Western Australia) (10:19):  This is a very interesting piece of private member's legislation requiring agencies and ministers to publish the exact wording of freedom of information requests or the answers thereto. The amendments, as I understand them, in the brief time that I have had to review them, will also require agencies and ministers to publish a statement of reasons concerning the decision to allow or refuse the release of requested documents. Of course, whenever someone is asked to present reasons, clearly those reasons will be the subject of judicial review at some further point in time, or pursuant to the review provisions contained in the Freedom of Information Act. Asking ministers to provide reasons that will be the subject of review is a very heavy burden and one which should not be undertaken lightly in terms of increasing and exposing the executive to legal process.


The bill has the stated aims of: ensuring transparency and accountability are included within the framework of government decisions concerning freedom of information requests; allowing the public to view requests that have been made and the reasons documents were or were not released. The current situation, as the law provides for today, allows for just that; allowing applicants seeking similar documents to build upon previous requests; and reducing duplication of requests. All of these appear, superficially, to be quite laudable objectives. One has to ask the question, given that the opposition were in power for six years in Australia from 2007-2013: why these amendments and changes were not brought forward then. I think I have a bit of an inkling as to why that was: transparency was not something that was high on their agenda at the time. Indeed, one just momentarily needs to reflect on the modelling for the carbon tax and how that was unavailable to any members of parliament or to the public and was continually denied in supporting the financial workings of that carbon tax. In six years, there was no change, no transparency, under Labor, and now we have a private senator's bill that seeks to put an enormous administrative burden upon the government of the day—namely, the Turnbull government.


Section 11C of the FOI Act currently requires agencies and ministerial officers to maintain an online disclosure log. The disclosure log must either publish information made available in response to an FOI request or provide details of how the public may obtain that information. Providing details to the public as to how to go about obtaining the information is a stock standard, usual and understood methodology in the accessing of government documents. Why would you want to muck around with that? That is a bit of a mystery that the good senator, Senator Ludwig, needs to explain to us.


Senator Ludwig's bill proposes to amend these requirements by removing the option of providing details on how the public may obtain the information. That seems to me to be a very retrograde, backward step. The bill is entitled 'freedom of information' and yet we are not going to tell the public how to access that information. Secondly, it requires the publication of the exact wording of the FOI request and, thirdly, it requires publication of a statement of reasons concerning the decision to allow or refuse the release of the requested documents. I have dealt with the matter of providing those reasons.


The current disclosure log requirements, together with the Information Publication Scheme, or IPS as it is called, were part of the previous Labor government's package of FOI reforms in 2010. These reforms were intended to reduce the number of FOI requests over time, with the FOI Act providing access to information through agency-driven publication rather than only in response to requests for documents. However, the Hawke FOI review found that the implementation of the Information Publication Scheme had, strangely, the completely opposite effect—that is, instead of making things easier, more accessible and more transparent, the IPS and disclosure log requirements in many cases increased the FOI processing costs, with resources being diverted from other key areas to assist with FOI processing. 


Of course, Senator Ludwig has a very illustrious record of asking page after page of quite superfluous questions at both Senate estimates and in FOI requests. As well as increasing the cost of FOI processing, these initiatives have not resulted in any reduction in the number of FOI requests received by agencies and ministers. So the Labor Party's reform measures of 2010 actually achieved, in my understanding and in my argument, the opposite of what was intended. Things became more process bound and more costly and it became more difficult for the government of the day to respond to and answer the FOI requests, which I would have thought was completely contrary to what was intended. Similarly, this private senator's bill is going to exacerbate the situation, because it simply has not been thought through properly. If it has been thought through, I think it has an ulterior motive to it. In fact, since FOI reforms commenced in 2010, the number of FOI requests has increased from 23,605 in 2010-11 to 28,643 in 2013-14.


I note that the bill seeks to change the definition of 'working day'. I find that very interesting and a little incongruous. 'Working day' has a common or garden-variety meaning in the minds of most normal people. A working day is a day where people are actually working. Monday to Friday is the Interpretation Act's assessment of what are working days, in my understanding. The term is only used once in the legislation, in section 11C. It is very difficult to see how an artificial, contrived definition of the words 'working day' will eliminate confusion concerning time frames for publishing information. As is usual with legislation that has not been thought through, this will be even more confusing. Accordingly, it is a significant flaw in this legislation. It provides for unintended consequences, which is rather typical of the sort of half-baked legislative understanding that comes to this place from the Labor Party from time to time—only rivalled, usually, by that of the Greens.


Items 2 and 3 of Senator Ludwig's bill remove the option for an agency or minister to publish details of how information may be obtained rather than the information itself. Currently section 11C(3) provides that the information disclosed in the requests must be published on the agency or ministerial website, by, firstly, making information available for downloading from the website—that is section 11C(3)(a)—and, secondly, publishing on the website a link to another website from which the information can be downloaded, which is in section 11C(3)(b), or, thirdly, publishing on the website other details of how the information may be obtained. That is found in section 11C(3)(c). Items 2 and 3 of the good senator's bill amend section 11C(3) to remove the option of simply publishing on a website details of how the information may be obtained, rather than the information itself.



I must say I find this legislation and the intent behind it very, very vexing and troubling. Why would you want to close off an avenue for members of the public to find and access further information? This is very, very peculiar. I am not sure what the good senator's intentions are here. Senator Ludwig states that this amendment is designed to provide the public with easy access to documents released under the FOI Act. The current requirement for information to be released is that it is published for the public, generally on a website. Some agencies publish the documents released on their websites together with the FOI requests. What this will do is remove the flexibility, where the information cannot be readily published on a website, of providing details of how the information can be accessed. And so references to the Australian Bureau of statistics and other annual reports where there is a wealth of other information—all of those sorts of things—apparently cause some angst to the senator in the presentation and motivate him to present these amendments. I must say I find all of that very, very confusing.




It may not be straightforward for an agency or minister to publish some documents on a disclosure law in an accessible format or to convert documents to such formats within 10 working days. 
Those difficulties and disabilities are not addressed in the legislation; as one would expect, the details have not been considered—to use a colloquialism: the whole thing is a bit half-baked.





This may be an issue, for example, if information ha
s been redacted from a document or where the voluminous nature of the document is only available as a hard copy
 or in a PDF format. Removing flexibility will impose an administrative burden on agencies and ministerial offices in preparing documents for publication within 10 working days of the information being released. This could create challenges for agencies and ministers in managing an increased 
FOI workload—and


I come back to the numbers that I gave previously: we started off with the Labor Party's amendments with 23,605 FOI requests in 2010, and the amendments have generated an increase to 28,643 in 2013-14. As I was saying, these amendments are going to generate challenges for agencies and ministers in maintaining an increased FOI workload and impact on the processing of FOI applications. That all converts to one thing: cost. 





We all know on this side of the chamber that the very last thing the Labor Party—and its senators—ever think of in legislation is the cost. They have absolutely no regard for the 
respect required for taxpayers' money in these crazy schemes that they seem to want to implement. 




Item 5 of Senator Ludwig's bill


amends the F
OI
 Act to insert a new provision—a new section 11D. This
 proposed
 new section requires agencies or ministers, 
firstly, 
where access is given to
 the
 whole document, to publish the 
FOI
 request itself, and the reasons for the decision, within 10 working days after the person is given access. 
Secondly, it
 requires agencies or ministers, where access is given to an edited document, to publish the 
FOI
 request itself and the notice that an edited copy has been prepared, and the grounds for deletion, within the 10 working days after notice is given. If a request for the reasons for the decision is made for the refusal to the whole document, 
they are
 to 
be 
publish
ed
 within 10 working days after the reasons are given. 
Thirdly, w
here access is not given to a document at all, 
they are
 require
d
 to publish the 
FOI
 request itself within 10 working days after the decision, and the reasons f
or the decision
 within 10 working days after the  reasons  are provided . Essentially, this provision will require agencies and ministers to publish the exact wording of FOI requests. If someone has ever seen some of these FOI requests, they go on for page after page after page.




The new section 11D will also require agencies and ministers to publish a statement of reasons concerning the decision to allow or refuse the release of requested documents. Section 26 of the 
act
 currently provides for statements of reasons to be given where a decision is made to refuse access. 
Whether you grant or refuse, it appears that you will have to provide reasons as to why you are granting.





Section 22 provides reasons to be given where an edited copy of a document is provided. The difference with the new provision is that a statement of reasons is also required when access is granted in full
—I would have thought that is completely ridiculous and quite stupid, but what am supposed to expect here? In addition,
 all statements of reasons, as well as the requests themselves, must now be published within 10 working days. 
What that means, given the change in definition of 10 working days, I am not sure. I think we are all left to wonder why we are taking the definition of 10 working days and turning it into something not readily understood. Ten working days—if it were Monday to Friday days—or two weeks are still not a lot of time.





Once again, this new provision will impose a substantive administrative burden on agencies and ministerial officers, which could result in significant processing delays in other aspects of 
FOI
 processing. 
Of course that is something which the good senator has completely ignored.





Senator Ludwig states that this measure will facilitate more practical use of freedom of information requests, reduce duplication of requests and open the door for further reform by parties other than the initial applicant. 
I would like to see that because, as I have said, having tried once at reform, we now know that those reforms and their unintended consequences made the process more difficult, more expensive, challenged schedules and generally achieved objectives in complete opposition to what the original intent of those reforms was. Once again, the Labor Party lived up to everybody's expectation that they really have no idea what they are doing when it comes to reform.





It is more likely that publishing reasons for decisions will result in overburdened agencies that are struggling to manage increasingly heavy 
FOI
 workloads
,
 taking shortcuts and 
adopting published reasons rather than making a decision based on the circumstance of 
each particular
 request. 
I think that is a very logical and likely outcome which I would emphasise to anybody listening to me speaking now.





In conclusion, the
 government is committed to being a transparent, accountable and open government. The 
FOI
 Act is an important accountability measure, which facilitates the open and tran
sparent operation of government, and the dealing with individual proprietary rights and privacy matters of people from time to time, as it must, in carrying out all of the heavy burden of the day-to-day activities of good government.





Rather than ensuring accountability and transparency, the measures in the bill will compromise the effectiveness of the decision-making processes under the 
FOI Act—and compromise in a very substantial way. 
It is 
very 
unlikely that the measures in the bill will reduce duplication of requests, as requests cannot be refused where information is publicly available free of charge or where information that would substantially address the subject matter of the request is regularly made available—for example,
 in annual reports or otherwise; and


I have dealt with that.



Nor can a request be refused if the request is substantially the same as another FOI request that has already been made. So every second day of every month of every year you can ask for the same information because it inconveniences the government. That, I think, is the nub of what this might be all about. An applicant will not need to provide a reason for making an FOI request. So what this does is open the floodgates to some form of process here that is designed to stand on the hose, to be expensive and to cause the government of the day a lot of administrative woe and problems. That is all very well but, at the end of the day, I think ordinary citizens of this country need the government of the day to work in a cost-effective and efficient manner and not be completely focused on the process of FOI requests.


This bill will not reduce duplication of requests and it will not reduce the number of FOI requests. As has been clearly set out, their reforms failed to deliver. Notwithstanding that they expressed an intent to reduce the number of requests, those requests have increased. Instead, the bill will impose further unnecessary steps and procedures into existing processes for access to government information under the FOI Act. This will increase the costs, as I have said, and will increase the complexity of FOI processing. Remember: FOI is for ordinary citizens. They are not lawyers; they simply want information. So this bill is seeking to increase the costs associated with processing FOI requests and increase complexity and will result in significant processing delays. I would have thought that that was completely in opposition to what we in this place should want to do. It is a mystery to me why a senator of Senator Ludwig's standing would want to come forward with such a nonsensical, stupid bill.


Debate adjourned.

Senator DAY
 (South Australia) (12:04):  Before asking that the motion be taken as formal, I wish to inform the Senate that Senator Lazarus will no longer be sponsoring this motion but I wish to add Senator Bernardi to the motion. I, and also on behalf of Senators Madigan, Wang, Leyonhjelm and Bernardi, I move:


That the Senate—


(a) notes that:


(i) over one million Australian tertiary students are forced to pay up to $286 per year as a Student Services and Amenities Fee (SSAF),


(ii) students at the moment have very little say in how the SSAF monies are spent by their universities and student associations, and


(iii) SSAF is levied regardless of students' need, willingness and ability to access the services and activities they are paying for; and


(b) calls on the Government to amend the Higher Education Support Act so That the SSAF can only be levied with the support of the majority of students at each university campus in a mandatory ballot conducted once an academic year.

Senator RYAN
 (Victoria—Assistant Cabinet Secretary) (12:05):  Mr Deputy President, I seek leave to make a short statement.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator RYAN:
  The coalition strongly opposed Labor's repeal of the voluntary student unionism laws passed under the Howard government. For many Liberals, guaranteeing students the basic right to freely associate and ensure they are not forced to join or contribute funds to an organisation merely because they are enrolled students has been a lifelong principle.


While the motivation behind this motion is commendable, it does not reflect the key principle of ensuring freedom of association for all students at all times. This motion supports creating the illusion of voluntary student unionism through the use of campus or institution-wide ballots. However, compelling all students to join and fund an organisation by a ballot of their peers is just as illegitimate on campus as if it happened in a workplace or anywhere else in our community.

Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (12:06):  Mr Deputy President, I seek leave to make a short statement.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator MOORE:
  Labor strongly supports effective and strong student representation and student services on university campuses. The student services and amenities fee and the SSAF help, as constituted, have enabled student services and culture to thrive on university campuses. The effect of the proposition advanced in this motion, if advanced, would be to see the defunding of student services at universities across the country, especially at regional and rural universities—an impact senators should keep in mind when voting on this matter.

Senator SIMMS
 (South Australia) (12:07):  I seek leave to make a short statement.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator SIMMS:
  The Australian Greens also oppose this motion. We are strong supporters of the student services and amenities fee. Indeed, the Greens voted against the push to bring in voluntary student unionism that the Howard gave made in 2005. I notice that this is being championed by Senator Day. Apparently putting families first means cutting their penalties and now slashing student services and representation on campus. The Greens do not support that. We are always going to stand here and advocate student services and representation on campus.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  The question is that general business notice of motion No. 955 be agreed to.

(a) notes that:


That there be laid on the table by the Minister representing the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Cormann, no later than 3.30 pm on 30 November 2015, all documents recording contacts between:


(a) the Commonwealth and New South Wales State Government relating to the purchase or lease of the old Gosford Public School site on the Gosford waterfront; and

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted.




Senator RYAN:
  The Australian government is not purchasing land in Gosford and is not constructing an office building in Gosford; therefore, it is not correct that there is a proposed Australian Taxation Office building development in Gosford. The ATO released an expression of interest in October 2014 to commence the procurement process. The EOI specified required dimensions for the commercial offices' premises within a 1.5-kilometre radius of Gosford city centre. The EOI noted the ATO would consider premises to be constructed, or refurbished, or in existing condition. The preferred tenderer, Doma Group, will construct the new building on a site that Doma Group has secured from the New South Wales government. The Australian government will lease premises for 600 employees, the majority being ATO staff. As the Australian government is not building on the old Gosford Public School site, or purchasing the old site from the New South Wales government, the Australian government holds no documents concerning contacts with the New South Wales government about the purchase or lease of the site. Doma Group will seek a development application approval from the local council.

(b) Australia’s 135,000 farmers provide 93 per cent of the domestic food supply, and support an export market valued at A$43.5 billion in 2014-15;


(c) Australia’s stringent biosecurity system and best practice farm safety standards underpin our agricultural export strength and our reputation as a producer of some of the highest quality produce in the world; and


(d) acts of illegal activism, that include ignoring a farmer’s right to say no to property invasions, which could lead to the potential spread of disease and/or pests which could jeopardise Australia’s hard won reputation for agricultural excellence, placing in danger the safety of activists, farmers and their families and the health of animals and crops.

"Lambie, Sen Jacqui",Ind.,2015-11-26,"



Senator LAMBIE
 (Tasmania) (12:31):  Yesterday Senator Abetz made an extraordinary contribution to this debate. He essentially tried to coerce me into voting for this legislation by using political standover tactics. As when Senator Abetz, Mr Whiteley and his Liberal mates tried to use mistruths and political blackmail with their unfair university deregulation, they have again been caught out using the same political tactics with their flawed shipping legislation.


Senator Abetz offered a promise of 40 extra jobs at the Burnie port through a proposed development. But he failed to mention that, with the Liberal shipping legislation, he is prepared to sacrifice 580 maritime jobs from his own state and, according to the maritime industry association, to place in jeopardy 31,000 Australian jobs and a $9 billion industry. I agree with the argument that Australian shipping must be reformed. The Burnie port proposal from DP World can still go ahead, but with changes that will not kill off our shipping industry. That is why I have been working very hard for the last six to eight months in meeting with maritime unions, Australian ship owners, captains of the Tasmanian industry and shippers—so that a consensus shipping reform package can be put before the parliament. The consensus shipping reform package will reduce shipping costs, promote efficiencies, open up domestic markets and enhance international markets while protecting Australian jobs and our national interest.


Senator Abetz is the senator who has single-handedly strangled Tasmania's economy for decades. This is the man who stood by and allowed an RET tax system to be imposed on our heavy industry, despite the fact they used almost 100 per cent renewable hydro energy. For nearly two decades, Senator Abetz's RET tax has cost our biggest employers almost $30 million a year in addition to their normal taxes—and now he has the gall to use his cheap, grubby, standover threat on me! I am glad that Senator Abetz has been preselected at No. 1 on the Liberals' Senate ticket, because with the Jacqui Lambie Network Senate candidates the people of Tasmania will have an opportunity to express their opinion of the party and the politician who tried to kill off our heavy industry and has now been caught out trying to kill off Tasmania's, indeed Australia's, maritime industry. They will be given an opportunity to vote for senators who will always put their state first—before any political party that is receiving funding from big corporate mates. I can assure you that, unlike the Liberal Party, I will not be taking political funding from people closely associated with the Chinese government.


A sitting royal commissioner, Commissioner Heydon, has told us that he discovered a grave threat to the power and authority of the Australian state during his investigations. He will not share that threat with the 'naughty' Senate because, apparently, we cannot be trusted with state secrets; but Commissioner Heydon will share that information with state premiers. Despite all those real threats to Australian sovereignty, security and national interests, politicians like Nationals Deputy Prime Minister, Warren Truss, present to the Senate this treasonous document with a grin, a bit of straw on one side of the mouth and a chuckle like Goofy coming from the other side, saying, 'She'll be right, mate!' If this legislation passes then she will not be all right, mate—especially for Tasmanians. We will be hit hard with maritime job losses if the Liberals' and Nationals' plan to change our shipping laws succeed.


After a meeting with union representatives on 5 November and having consulted more broadly within the maritime industry over many months, I have discovered that 148 seafarer and stevedore jobs at Toll, 96 at SeaRoad and 436 jobs at TT-Line are being placed at risk by the Liberal shipping plans that the member for Braddon, Brett Whiteley, and other government representatives are trying to push through the Senate. A total of 580 direct Tasmanian maritime workers' jobs will be threatened by Mr Whiteley's plans for our nation's shipping industry, and the majority of those workers—400—will be from Mr Whiteley's own electorate. I wish him the best of luck in the next election.


I have not even begun to calculate the flow-on effect should our maritime workers lose their jobs to foreigners. In Tasmania alone, thousands of direct and indirect jobs will be lost if the Liberals have their way. Official proof this legislation does not protect our maritime workers is buried on page 156 of the government's own explanatory notes, where it clearly states what will happen if the Senate passes this legislation:


Many of the operators currently operating under the Australian General Register would likely re-flag their vessels in order to compete with the foreign operators who enjoy the benefit of comparatively lower wage rates. Australian seafarer jobs would be adversely affected as Australian operators re-flag from the Australian General Register.


Ship [owners] are likely to replace Australian seafarers (paid under EA rates) with foreign seafarers (paid under ITF rates).


That is why I urge my fellow crossbench senators to vote down this legislation on the second reading vote. This legislation is beyond saving with amendments. It does not deserve to be allowed through to the committee stage.


It is worthwhile to note what the overall state of shipping is like in the world at the moment, and what the big players and countries are doing. Examination of the big world picture will show again just how negligent and irresponsible our government is with its management and protection of our maritime and shipping industries. I will quote from a very interesting article examining different forms of world shipping in a recent Economist magazine article on 31 October:


The article, under the title 'The big-box game', opens by stating:


Since the financial crisis, the tide of recovery has not lifted all boats equally. Demand for oil tankers has boomed: a combination of weak spot prices, driven by the assumption that supply and demand for crude will eventually rebalance, has encouraged traders to hire tankers to store oil at sea and cash in on the price gap.


Meanwhile, bulk carriers - which carry such things as iron and coal, has been hit by massive over capacity, as Chinese demand for such commodities has collapsed.


Until the start of this year, container shipping business - which carriers around 60% by value of all seaborne trade in goods - looked more like that for oil tankers.


And the article continues:


But since, the industry has been rattled by renewed weakness in freight rates, prompted by a fall in the volume of seaborne trade.


The cost of sending a container from Shanghai to Europe for instance has almost halved since March, according to the Chinese city's shipping exchange.


And the absence of the usual pre-Christmas pick-up is worrying both analysis and investors, according to Rhul Kapor of Drewry.


The article goes on to paint a picture where the big players in world shipping, Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd, are investing hundreds of billions in building new and bigger container ships, which will depress freight rates and profitability even further in a corrupt world shipping market which is falling. They have described this business strategy of building bigger and bigger ships as a 'flight to scale'. 


The predicted winners from the flight to scale will be the world's largest three lines: Maersk, Mediterranean Shipping Company and CMA CGM. The losers in this highly competitive economic environment will be maritime workers and future generations in counties whose governments fail to protect their national shipping industry and national job security. China knows the importance of a state owned and controlled shipping industry. The shipping article in the Economist from 31 October illustrates that point, stating :


China's two biggest lines China Shipping Group and Cosco, were losing money before the current downturn started. They have recently swung back into profit, but only thanks to generous state aid to help them scrap old vessels.


The government regards it as vital to have a merchant fleet, so it will not let the two go to the wall. But it plans to merge them to save money, and to stamp out corruption at Cosco which, according to internal documents leaked this week, is another reason for its poor performance.


As you begin to study the world shipping market, it becomes apparent very quickly that it is not as the Liberal and National parties would have you believe: a free market governed by fair and free market forces. The world shipping market is highly subsidised, regulated, protected, monopolized and, in some cases, as we have heard, corrupted. America realises that fact and has strongly regulated with the Jones Act to protect their ship building industry and the jobs of maritime workers. And China realises that fact and uses her fat wallet to protect the Communist Party's interests and to cover-up the massive corruption and inefficiencies caused by the Communist Party bureaucrats.


But Australia refuses to acknowledge the world shipping game is rigged and wants to play by the rules, when quite clearly there are no rules. It is like a lawn bowler accidently hopping in the ring with a cage fighter. Australia is an island nation. Tasmania, my home state, is an island state in an island nation. If we destroy the maritime skills of our merchant marine and destroy our shipping capacity, and this legislation will surely do that, then we undermine and attack Australia's national security. 


Why would any politician in their right mind degrade our ability to provide our families, business and industry with fuel and keep vital trade links open, especially in times of war and conflict, which we are now experiencing? Unfortunately, at this time in world history, we do not have to look far to see serious threats to Australia's national sovereignty. Firstly, we are at war with Islamic State and preparing for their next slaughter of innocents, in God's name. Secondly, China has threatened the lives of Australian and American sailors participating in freedom of navigation exercises in international waters. Thirdly, according to Royal Commissioner Hayden in a secret interim report, he has discovered 'a grave threat to the power and authority of the Australian state'. This is not a time when we should pass laws which weaken Australia's national security; indeed, the opposite should occur. 


The Australian Institute of Marine and Power Engineers, AIMPE, the registered organisation which represents qualified marine engineer officers throughout Australia says this about the government's legislation:


Firstly, AIMPE submits that the 2012 legislation, the Coastal Trading (Revitalising Australian Shipping) Act 2012 has failed in its objective to revitalise Australian shipping. The 2012 package has not revitalised Australian flag shipping. Australian flag shipping has continued to decline since 2012.


Secondly, the impact of the proposed Shipping Legislation Amendment Bill 2015 would be adverse for the few remaining Australian companies engaged in the shipping sector and adverse for the employment opportunities for Australian Marine Engineer Officers, Deck Officers and other Australian seafarers.


The most significant consequence of the enactment of the Shipping Legislation Amendment Bill 2015 would be to remove any priority for Australian flag ship operators over foreign flag ship operators.


Thirdly, because foreign shipping operators are effectively free from the payment of corporate income tax and because foreign seafarers are very often exempt from the payment of income tax, allowing foreign shipping to participate in the coastal shipping sector would place Australian shipping operators at an enormous disadvantage.


Australian shipping companies pay Australian company tax and employ Australian seafarers who pay Australian personal income tax.


Fourthly, the measures in the Bill which appear to favour the retention of a token presence of Australian Deck and Engineer Officers would be easily avoided by ship operators.


Fifthly, less frequent reporting requirements would reduce the transparency of the sector and provide Parliament with diminished insight into an industry which is generally 'out of sight, out of mind'.


For these reasons AIMPE urges Senators on the Committee to recommend that the Bill be rejected and that new legislation be drafted to require all commercial vessels consistently operating in Australian waters to be registered in Australia and comply with all Australian laws.


The Maritime Union's opposition to the Shipping Legislation Amendment Bill 2015 is strong and detailed. In correspondence to me, the MUA states in relation to Schedule 1:


The MUA's principal concern with the proposed amendments to the CT Act contained in the SLA Bill is that they are specifically designed to eliminate any role for Australian ships in the Australian coastal trade.


The Bill removes support for Australian shipping as an Object, and it removes the right of an Australian ship to contest for coastal cargoes. It eliminates fair competition which the CT Act was designed to achieve.


The MUA submission and critique is comprehensive and measured, and I will not have time to speak to all its listed concerns. However, this is an important point: a major omission from the bill is that it does not seek to amend the Tax Laws Amendment (Shipping Reform) Act 2012—which amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997—to address a major flaw in the 2012 tax laws amendment act that has meant the Australian shipping tax laws remain inferior to foreign registries like Singapore, which has been the major reason why no ships are registered on the AISR and so few shipowners have taken advantage of the tax incentives. A solution for that problem has been put forward. It says:

"Lambie, Sen Jacqui",Ind.,2015-11-26,"



Senator LAMBIE
 (Tasmania) (12:31):  Yesterday Senator Abetz made an extraordinary contribution to this debate. He essentially tried to coerce me into voting for this legislation by using political standover tactics. As when Senator Abetz, Mr Whiteley and his Liberal mates tried to use mistruths and political blackmail with their unfair university deregulation, they have again been caught out using the same political tactics with their flawed shipping legislation.


Senator Abetz offered a promise of 40 extra jobs at the Burnie port through a proposed development. But he failed to mention that, with the Liberal shipping legislation, he is prepared to sacrifice 580 maritime jobs from his own state and, according to the maritime industry association, to place in jeopardy 31,000 Australian jobs and a $9 billion industry. I agree with the argument that Australian shipping must be reformed. The Burnie port proposal from DP World can still go ahead, but with changes that will not kill off our shipping industry. That is why I have been working very hard for the last six to eight months in meeting with maritime unions, Australian ship owners, captains of the Tasmanian industry and shippers—so that a consensus shipping reform package can be put before the parliament. The consensus shipping reform package will reduce shipping costs, promote efficiencies, open up domestic markets and enhance international markets while protecting Australian jobs and our national interest.


Senator Abetz is the senator who has single-handedly strangled Tasmania's economy for decades. This is the man who stood by and allowed an RET tax system to be imposed on our heavy industry, despite the fact they used almost 100 per cent renewable hydro energy. For nearly two decades, Senator Abetz's RET tax has cost our biggest employers almost $30 million a year in addition to their normal taxes—and now he has the gall to use his cheap, grubby, standover threat on me! I am glad that Senator Abetz has been preselected at No. 1 on the Liberals' Senate ticket, because with the Jacqui Lambie Network Senate candidates the people of Tasmania will have an opportunity to express their opinion of the party and the politician who tried to kill off our heavy industry and has now been caught out trying to kill off Tasmania's, indeed Australia's, maritime industry. They will be given an opportunity to vote for senators who will always put their state first—before any political party that is receiving funding from big corporate mates. I can assure you that, unlike the Liberal Party, I will not be taking political funding from people closely associated with the Chinese government.


A sitting royal commissioner, Commissioner Heydon, has told us that he discovered a grave threat to the power and authority of the Australian state during his investigations. He will not share that threat with the 'naughty' Senate because, apparently, we cannot be trusted with state secrets; but Commissioner Heydon will share that information with state premiers. Despite all those real threats to Australian sovereignty, security and national interests, politicians like Nationals Deputy Prime Minister, Warren Truss, present to the Senate this treasonous document with a grin, a bit of straw on one side of the mouth and a chuckle like Goofy coming from the other side, saying, 'She'll be right, mate!' If this legislation passes then she will not be all right, mate—especially for Tasmanians. We will be hit hard with maritime job losses if the Liberals' and Nationals' plan to change our shipping laws succeed.


After a meeting with union representatives on 5 November and having consulted more broadly within the maritime industry over many months, I have discovered that 148 seafarer and stevedore jobs at Toll, 96 at SeaRoad and 436 jobs at TT-Line are being placed at risk by the Liberal shipping plans that the member for Braddon, Brett Whiteley, and other government representatives are trying to push through the Senate. A total of 580 direct Tasmanian maritime workers' jobs will be threatened by Mr Whiteley's plans for our nation's shipping industry, and the majority of those workers—400—will be from Mr Whiteley's own electorate. I wish him the best of luck in the next election.


I have not even begun to calculate the flow-on effect should our maritime workers lose their jobs to foreigners. In Tasmania alone, thousands of direct and indirect jobs will be lost if the Liberals have their way. Official proof this legislation does not protect our maritime workers is buried on page 156 of the government's own explanatory notes, where it clearly states what will happen if the Senate passes this legislation:


Many of the operators currently operating under the Australian General Register would likely re-flag their vessels in order to compete with the foreign operators who enjoy the benefit of comparatively lower wage rates. Australian seafarer jobs would be adversely affected as Australian operators re-flag from the Australian General Register.


Ship [owners] are likely to replace Australian seafarers (paid under EA rates) with foreign seafarers (paid under ITF rates).


That is why I urge my fellow crossbench senators to vote down this legislation on the second reading vote. This legislation is beyond saving with amendments. It does not deserve to be allowed through to the committee stage.


It is worthwhile to note what the overall state of shipping is like in the world at the moment, and what the big players and countries are doing. Examination of the big world picture will show again just how negligent and irresponsible our government is with its management and protection of our maritime and shipping industries. I will quote from a very interesting article examining different forms of world shipping in a recent Economist magazine article on 31 October:


The article, under the title 'The big-box game', opens by stating:


Since the financial crisis, the tide of recovery has not lifted all boats equally. Demand for oil tankers has boomed: a combination of weak spot prices, driven by the assumption that supply and demand for crude will eventually rebalance, has encouraged traders to hire tankers to store oil at sea and cash in on the price gap.


Meanwhile, bulk carriers - which carry such things as iron and coal, has been hit by massive over capacity, as Chinese demand for such commodities has collapsed.


Until the start of this year, container shipping business - which carriers around 60% by value of all seaborne trade in goods - looked more like that for oil tankers.


And the article continues:


But since, the industry has been rattled by renewed weakness in freight rates, prompted by a fall in the volume of seaborne trade.


The cost of sending a container from Shanghai to Europe for instance has almost halved since March, according to the Chinese city's shipping exchange.


And the absence of the usual pre-Christmas pick-up is worrying both analysis and investors, according to Rhul Kapor of Drewry.


The article goes on to paint a picture where the big players in world shipping, Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd, are investing hundreds of billions in building new and bigger container ships, which will depress freight rates and profitability even further in a corrupt world shipping market which is falling.

Senator SINODINOS
 (New South Wales—Cabinet Secretary) (15:03):  I would like to add to a couple of answers I gave during question time.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  Nudge, nudge!




Senator SINODINOS:
  I will come to that as well. In relation to Australian pulp and paper, the ICT Sustainability Plan 2010-2015 was a diverse package of measures that aimed to reduce the environmental impact of Australian government activities. The plan included increasing use of recycled content in office copy paper by departments. It reached 100 per cent by July 2015. The plan has lapsed. It is no longer active, and further questioning on the plan should be referred to the Department of the Environment, who had responsibility for this policy. On 10 October 2012, the previous government announced a $9.5 million grant towards a $90 million project to establish a delinked pulp facility at Australian Paper's Maryvale mill in Victoria. I understand the company is facing some intense pressures, and that is the background to the question.


Can I just add to another answer I gave. I can confirm, in relation to the nudge unit, that it is being funded from within existing resources, as I mentioned at question time.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  Yes, but what's not happening as a consequence?




Senator SINODINOS:

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (15:04):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Attorney-General (Senator Brandis) to questions without notice asked by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Wong) and Senator Collins today relating to ministerial standards.


Well, the days of Joh Bjelke-Petersen and his contempt for democracy have not faded in Queensland. The contempt for due process in Queensland, the contempt for the law by politicians in Queensland and the contempt for the parliament by politicians in Queensland are there to be seen from the behaviour of the member for Fisher, Mal Brough, and the member for Longman, Wyatt Roy.




Senator Brandis:
  On a point of order, Mr Deputy President, the senator is plainly reflecting upon those two members of the House of Representatives. This is a flagrant breach of the relevant standing order, and he should be brought to order.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Cameron, I remind you of the standing order that forbids members adversely reflecting on members of the other place, and I would ask you to consider that in your contribution.




Senator CAMERON:
  Thank you, Mr Deputy President. If there is any view that I am reflecting on the member for Fisher or the member for Longman and breaching parliamentary standing orders, I withdraw. Let me indicate clearly that there is a lineage in Queensland—a lineage that comes from Joh Bjelke-Petersen and Russ Hinze—and that lineage is straight back down into the current Liberal National Party in Queensland. We see how this party has contempt for due process and how this party in Queensland has contempt for the law and contempt for the parliament—the same contempt that Joh Bjelke-Petersen and Russ Hinze exercised in their standing over democracy in Queensland. And we have the same contempt for due process and democracy being seen right now. We have two judges of the Federal Court who have indicated that Mr Brough did conspire in his—




Senator Brandis:
  Mr Deputy President, I raise a point of order. That is a reflection upon Mr Brough. It is also, I take it, an intended reference to judicial proceedings, which, as you know, Mr Deputy President, ought not to be commented upon in the Senate.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  The difficulty for me, Senator Brandis, is that Senator Cameron directly referred to a matter before the court and a statement allegedly made by a judicial officer. It is not a matter for me to determine whether that is true or not, and at this point I do not think Senator Cameron is actually in breach of the standing order that I think you refer to, which would be 193(3). So, Senator Cameron, you can continue.




Senator CAMERON:
  Thank you, Mr Deputy President. I am always very aware of how sensitive this is to Senator Brandis, why Senator Brandis would be so sensitive about the behaviour of his colleagues in Queensland and why the lineage from Joh Bjelke-Petersen and Mal Brough seems to have filtered down quite significantly into the activities and behaviour of current Queensland politicians and the Liberal Party in Queensland. What is going on is quite disgusting. Two of four Federal Court judges found that Mr Brough had engaged in a conspiracy to bring down the federal government through legal action. That is on the public record.




Senator Brandis:
  Mr Deputy President, I raise a point of order—and, please, Senator Cameron, what I am sensitive about is your contempt for the standing orders of the Senate. Mr Deputy President, rule 193(3) provides:


A senator shall not use offensive words against either House of Parliament or of a House of a state or territory parliament, or any member of such House …


It goes on to say:


… all imputations of improper motives and all personal reflections on—


among other things—


… members … shall be considered highly disorderly.


Senator Cameron has told us enough now for it to be perfectly apparent that he is both using offensive words in relation to Mr Brough and reflecting upon him and casting an imputation. There have been no criminal or civil proceedings against Mr Brough. There have been proceedings concerning the Ashby matter which have been a matter of public record. Having read the reasons for decision in those matters, I can tell you, Mr Deputy President, that neither Federal Court judge who dealt with those matters said of Mr Brough what Senator Cameron has said of him, so he is not quoting the words of a Federal Court judge. He is attributing words to a Federal Court judge which were not uttered by that judge, and in doing so he is reflecting upon Mr Brough.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Again the difficulty I have, Senator Brandis, is that I am unaware of the case and the matters referred to. I do not know whether Senator Cameron is accurately reflecting or not. As you say, in your view he clearly is not. But in any case it is not a matter for the chair to determine the truth or accuracy of statements made by senators. That is a matter for debate.




Senator Brandis:
  On the point of order, Mr Deputy President: I accept that. I entirely accept that it is not for you to determine the truth or accuracy. The point I make to you, sir, is that, if a statement that would be within the standing orders because it quotes from a judgement of a federal judge were in fact a misattribution of words to that federal judge so that it is therefore not protected by the standing orders, it therefore falls within standing order 193(3). I can tell you, Mr Deputy President, that no federal judge has said of Mr Brough the words that Senator Cameron has attributed to him. If Senator Cameron wants to be honest with the Senate, he should read from the reasons for judgement.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Cameron, did you want to also speak to the point of order?




Senator CAMERON:
  In relation to the point of order, it is quite clear that what I was doing was discussing and putting forward what two Federal Court judges have indicated in relation to Mr Brough, and I am not surprised that there is a bit of panic in relation to Senator Brandis on these issues.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  It is true that simply repeating something that is unparliamentary that is said by somebody else here in the chamber does not make it any less unparliamentary. But I have been listening carefully, and I am not sure—you see, I think I am limited to look at offensive words, and I am not sure—that anything Senator Cameron has said in repeating some of the judgements goes to those offensive words. Going to the issue of improper motives is again asking me to judge whether Senator Cameron is either interpreting or quoting the federal justices accurately, and I am not sure I am in a position to do so, Senator Brandis, but I am happy to hear more.




Senator Brandis:
  Thank you very much, Mr Deputy President. I think this is an important point. The word in standing order 193(3) which is, if I might say so with respect, too often overlooked is the word 'imputations'. Imputations, like innuendos, include what might broadly be called suggestions of impropriety. An outright allegation of impropriety is not the operative concept. An imputation of impropriety may be made other than by direct allegation.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  How I intend to proceed is that I will now take advice on this matter, and it may be something that the President wishes to give further consideration to and a more substantial ruling on in due course. Senator Cameron, before I take the advice?




Senator CAMERON:
  I would seek your indulgence in relation to the point of order so that if you are taking advice you have a full understanding of my position on this. I just draw your attention to Thursday, 29 November 2012, when Senator Brandis said in this place, 'You're the ones with a criminal in the Lodge.' That was the position Senator Brandis took in this place, and he defended that position and would not withdraw. So the pot calling the kettle black is a bit rough.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  We are now probably moving too far towards debate. Regardless of that matter, Senator Cameron, all I can deal with is the question and the point of order that is before me at the moment. So the Senate might just bear with me for one moment while I take advice. My advice is that I will in fact uphold Senator Brandis's point of order. As I said earlier, it may be something that the President may wish to revisit and make a more substantive ruling on down the track. I simply ask you at this point, Senator Cameron, to ensure that your comments do not impugn the motives of a member in the other place.




Senator CAMERON:
  Let me go to some statements that were made in the other place by Mr Mark Dreyfus MP in relation to this issue. He said in that place that between 23 March—and he was quoting a so-called visit to Mr Brough's property—




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  A raid.




Senator CAMERON:
  which was actually a raid on Mr Brough's home. It says:


Between 23 March and 13 April 2012, Malcolm Thomas Brough, born 29 December 1961, counselled and procured James Hunter Ashby, being a Commonwealth officer, to disclose extracts from the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr Peter Slipper's 2009 to 2012 official diary, and provide those extracts to third parties without authority, contrary to section 70(1) of the Crimes Act …


It also outlined:


Between 23 March and 13 April 2012, Malcolm Thomas Brough … counselled and procured James Hunter Ashby, to access restricted—




Senator Brandis:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Plainly, what is now being imputed to Mr Brough is criminality. Senator Cameron is quoting language which he said was used by the shadow Attorney-General in the House of Representatives. But he has not identified the source of the document which Mr Dreyfus was quoting. I believe that the document was a search warrant, which is not a document that constitutes a charge or allegation of the commission of a criminal offence. But the implication in Senator Cameron's remarks is that it is. It therefore is plainly in breach of standing order 193(3).




Senator CAMERON:
  On the point of order: these are exact words quoted word for word, used in the House of Representatives and not challenged by the coalition in the House of Representatives. I am not imputing anything; I am detailing what that search warrant said.




Senator Brandis:
  So you admit it is a search warrant?



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  In any case, let me just say that in quoting a document a senator is not permitted to utter words which would not be permitted under the rules of debate. This principle ensures senators cannot circumvent the rules of debate by simply quoting documents. That is one element of what is being said. But Senator Brandis, do I take it you are arguing that if the origins of the document Senator Cameron was quoting from were clarified, you may not have a point of order?




Senator Brandis:
  Close. The point I was making was this: Senator Cameron did not, until his intervention a moment ago, make it clear that what he was quoting from was Mr Dreyfus quoting from a search warrant. As I think all honourable senators know, for a person to have a search warrant executed on their premises is not an allegation against them of criminality. By quoting words from the search warrant—




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  We cannot even quote a search warrant now? This is how farcical you are, George.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order!




Senator Brandis:
  By quoting words from a search warrant without identifying the document from which he was quoting as a search warrant, Senator Cameron was imputing guilt against Mr Brough in respect of the language that he quoted without identifying the source.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  If he has now in fact identified the source, I am less concerned about a potential breach—




Senator Brandis:
  I would not have taken the point of order had he identified the source at the start.




Senator CAMERON:
  Just to clarify the situation even further, I seek leave to table the search warrant.


Leave granted.




Senator CAMERON:
  This is a member of parliament who has indicated that the police visited his home. If we want to talk about being accurate: according to Mr Brough, this was a 'visit' to his home, but really it was a search warrant being implemented at his home. This is a situation where we have a Prime Minister who has appointed an individual to one of the most important offices in this country—that is, minister of state. The Special Minister of State is supposed to act with integrity and is supposed act completely in line with the rules and regulations that apply to that office. This is a real problem for this government. This minister should resign. (Time expired)

  The innuendo from Senator Cameron against Mr Brough is that Mr Brough has been guilty of wrongdoing. In fact, at the very end of his contribution Senator Cameron actually explicitly said that. He actually explicitly said that for some unspecified reason Mr Brough should resign from the ministry. That is plainly an allegation of wrongdoing. What I want to do is expose the paucity of Senator Cameron's allegations against Mr Brough, because all Senator Cameron was able to do—although he did not identify it until pressed—was to quote from a search warrant. It is, as Senator Cameron acknowledges, a matter of public record that Mr Brough, and other individuals as well, were the respondents to search warrants executed by the police in investigating what has been called 'the James Ashby affair'.


Let me put this as simply as I can. For a person to be the subject of a search warrant by the police is absolutely no indication of wrongdoing. None whatsoever. The bases upon which the police may apply for a search warrant are well known. They are, to use layman's language, circumstances which might assist the police in identifying material or a document which may assist an investigation. If the police believe or reasonably suspect that there is such material located at a particular premise, they may seek a search warrant and execute the warrant at that premise. It does not for a second, not for a moment, suggest that the occupier of that premise is guilty of the crime or the offence or the wrongdoing which is the subject of the investigation, merely because a search warrant is executed upon their premises. What Senator Cameron did first by innuendo and ultimately by explicit assertion was to submit in the debate that we should conclude from the fact that a search warrant was executed at premises of which Mr Brough and his family are the occupants that Mr Brough is somehow guilty of wrongdoing. That does not follow. That does not follow, and I am sure Senator Ludwig, who is a member of the Queensland bar, if he contributes to this debate—




Senator Cameron:
  Mr Deputy President, I raise a point of order in relation to the allegations that are being made here against what I have been doing. This is a minister—not Senator Brandis but Minister Brough—who was asked: did he procure copies of Peter Slipper's diary, and he said, 'Yes, I did.' That is illegal, and the minister should stop trying to colour what did happen. This minister tried to procure diaries illegally.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  We have now moved on to debating it. 




Senator BRANDIS:
  Mr Deputy President, on the point of order: that again is a plain, flagrant breach of standing order 193(3). He has just accused Mr Brough of acting illegally. He has quoted some words Mr Brough used and then stated the conclusion that Mr Brough has acted illegally. That is a matter for a court to determine in the event that the matter comes before a court.




Senator Cameron:
  Mr Deputy President, on the point of order: again I am being positioned unreasonably. What I put was clear—that Mr Brough actually conceded the point publicly. He conceded the point that he did try to procure Peter Slipper's diaries, publicly.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Again, it is not for the chair to determine the facts of these matters. It is really only a matter for me to judge, in this case, on standing order 193(3). But that applies both ways and people cannot accuse other senators of having improper motives with their contributions either. To be honest, I am not even sure what I have been asked to rule on now.




Senator BRANDIS:
  Mr Deputy President, the point I make to you is that to assert, as I do, that Senator Cameron is in breach of standing order 193(3) is not to accuse him of an improper motive; it is merely to ask you to rule on whether or not remarks he has made are against the terms of that standing order.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I think the best I can do right now is again remind senators of the standing order. I will listen quite carefully. Senator Cameron, I remind you that you are not to make imputations of improper motives or personal reflections on members of the other House.




Senator Cameron:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on that point of order.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I have just ruled on that point of order.




Senator Cameron:
  I rise on a further point of order. I want to indicate that the person that is being impugned in this is me by Senator Brandis.




Senator BRANDIS:
  You have breached the standing orders.




Senator Cameron:
  I have not breached the standing orders. I have simply quoted documents and facts that are on the public record in relation to allegations and admissions from Mr Brough on his behaviour.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Brandis.




Senator BRANDIS:
  I was going to resume my contribution to the debate. May I do that?



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Yes.




Senator BRANDIS:
  Thank you. To sum up, Senator Cameron has done two things. He has quoted from words in a search warrant that he did not initially identify as a search warrant though ultimately he did. He has quoted from some words which, I believe, Mr Brough used in a television interview. On the basis of those two sources, and those two sources alone I might say, he has asserted that Mr Brough is guilty of wrongdoing. The points that I simply make to the chamber are: firstly, the fact that a person has a search warrant executed on their premises is no indication whatsoever, none whatsoever, that they are guilty of wrongdoing and, secondly, to quote the words that were attributed to Mr Brough in a press interview is not an admission either. It is not an admission. It does not produce the conclusion, which Senator Cameron, who of course is not a legally trained member of this chamber, asserts that it supports. The innuendo and the claims against Mr Brough are disgraceful.




Senator Cameron:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Again, the Attorney-General is reflecting on me. That is in breach of standing orders. All I have done is clearly indicate the actual words that Mr Brough himself said, and what Mr Brough did was concede that he tried to procure the diaries of the former speaker, and that is illegal and a breach of law.




Senator BRANDIS:
  I am sorry, I do not mean to be tedious, Mr Deputy President.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  You are being tedious.



Opposition senators:  You are!




Senator BRANDIS:
  That is the most predictable interjection I have heard in 15 years, Senator Collins.



Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order!




Senator BRANDIS:
  The fact is that Senator Cameron cannot, without violating standing order 193(3), keep asserting that Mr Brough or any member of the House of Representatives has broken the law. He can quote what Mr Brough said in a media interview. He can invite people to draw whatever conclusions they may wish to draw, but to assert on the basis of those words, assuming it is an accurate quote from a media interview, that Mr Brough or any member of the House of Representatives has broken the law, when they have not been charged with any offence at all and where the only process to which they have been subject is the execution of a search warrant, which, for reasons I explained before is no indicator of culpability or guilt at all, cannot be other than a breach of standing order 193(3).



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Had you finished your contribution?




Senator BRANDIS:
  I had and that, as I say, was the point of order in relation to what just fell from Senator Cameron.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Again, I remind senators of the standing order, and I think what has been put on the record will suffice. Senator Collins.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (15:34):  I rise to speak on the same matter. One can understand why Senator Brandis is so sensitive to this issue, because, after the question that I asked in question time today, one piece of evidence of his knowledge or involvement emerging in the current police investigation or any subsequent proceedings ends the career of the Attorney-General. This is why he is so sensitive. It reminds me, since he referred to his tedious time-wasting interventions here, of the occasion when he sought to do far worse but very similar when the issues around Senator Sinodinos were first raised in the Senate.


As I recall, a statement that I was making during what is now called senator's interests was interjected, or points of order were made, to the extent that at that point in time I did explore the standing orders over what were tedious time-wasting interventions, because Senator Brandis demonstrated his excess, and I would encourage any senator to look at the coverage of it. He was slathering in the coverage on that occasion. So now we see him being very sensitive over the discussions around what should occur in relation to Mr Brough and the confessions that he has made. I remind the Senate that the discussion we are having now—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Collins, resume your seat. Senator Brandis on a point of order.




Senator Brandis:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. It should be remembered by the way that Senator Collins was in the chamber for the entirety of the last half hour, so she has heard what you have had to say in relation to the points of order taken concerning Senator Cameron. The use of the word 'confession' in this context is utterly inappropriate, because it is the plainest of innuendos that Mr Brough has confessed to a wrongdoing which he has not done and nothing is alleged against him.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  On the point of order: the confession that I was referring to was the one that was made on 60 Minutes, which Senator Cameron referred to also, which was that Mr Brough confessed that he sought to procure Mr Ashby's diary. I make no further point.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I have taken advice and, at this point in time, I am not going to rule in favour of the point of order. But I will continue to listen very carefully. 




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
   I was just about to go on to my point, which was to remind the Senate that this debate is actually about ministerial standards, not the time wasting and the tediousness of Senator Brandis's interventions. The discussion is about ministerial standards, so let me remind the senators of some of the issues that led to the raised eyebrows of many who follow these important issues when they looked at the ministerial appointments that occurred from Prime Minister Turnbull.


I think that the best way to characterise these, although it is not as funny as this suggests really—it is quite a serious matter—is the commentary today about 'nudge, nudge, wink, wink' and the new 'nudge unit' in the Prime Minister's office. To me, in one sense, that says it all about the discussion during question time today. It is very, very rare for me to side with Senator Sinodinos, who is now my counterpart, but let us look at the double standards that apply to Senator Sinodinos. When I made that statement in the Senate some time ago about his involvement with Australian Water Holdings, I was not making any allegations. I was going through a series of concerns that had been aired publicly and calling on the opposition of the day to respond. What we saw ultimately—and it took an awful lot of time—was that Senator Sinodinos was required to respond to the very serious concerns that were being aired about his role at Australian Water Holdings. He had to stand down.




Senator Back:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. In rising to take note of answers to questions, Senator Cameron indicated to you that he wanted to take note of answers by the Attorney-General to questions from himself and from Senator Collins. Senator Collins's questions related to the Ashby affair, what knowledge the Attorney-General had beyond it and whether the Prime Minister stands by those statements. Senator Collins is now venturing into topics associated with Senator Sinodinos which caused nothing of the questions asked by Senator Collins to the Attorney-General in question time. I ask that you bring Senator Collins back to the topic upon which she asked the Attorney-General questions.




Senator Polley:
  Mr Deputy President, there is no point of order. Senator Collins was making her comments in relation to the questions that were asked today in question time. There is no point of order.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  The motion is to take note of the answers to questions asked by Senator Wong and Senator Collins, so, as long as the discussion is in relation to the question and/or answer, I think it is well within the standing orders. As the debate continues on, senators introduce more and more into the debate, which entitles other senators to respond to those things, so we actually have this diversion—



Senator Payne interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Well, an expansion of the realm, as things are introduced. Senator Collins, you have the call.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  The point I was making was about the double standard that applies between the current Turnbull response to this situation and what was required of Senator Sinodinos. I know we have seen his resurrection, even though we have yet to see any report from ICAC on the matters that affected him. But the other questions raised, I think, are the questions about some of the other appointments. The raised eyebrows were at the time about the appointment of Mr Brough as Special Minister of State, given that there was a general understanding, even aside from some of the more recent issues raised, about his participation in the Ashby affair. That was the raised eyebrow that I was referring to and comparing to the double standard that applied to Senator Sinodinos.


But it was not the only raised eyebrow. There are a range of appointments where the 'nudge, nudge, wink, wink' principle applies. People are astounded that Senator Brandis is the Leader of the Government in the Senate. He is the only minister I know who has united non-government senators in a censure motion. People can see from the debate today why that is so. He frustrates us. He seeks to make tedious interventions in debate and waste time when we are addressing important issues. But, worse than that, today he refused to answer Senator Wong's question. He did not take on notice to check with the Prime Minister what assurances he had sought around these critical appointments, particularly that of the Special Minister of State. Instead, he made just a blanket glib assertion that it would have been okay—'Nudge, nudge, wink, wink'. (Time expired)

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales—Assistant Minister for Multicultural Affairs) (15:43):  I will just pick up on what Senator Collins basically said here, that this debate today is about ministerial standards. I would like to take the Senate to that basic point that should be the subject of this motion to take note of answers to questions. Mr Brough is cooperating with the police, and there is nothing, I think, at this stage to suggest that he should stand aside in accordance with the Statement of Ministerial Standards. I think in any situation like this, any investigation should be allowed to take its course. I remind the Senate of the statement which Mr Brough made and issued on 19 November:


I can confirm reports that the AFP visited me on Tuesday requesting any documentation relating to allegations involving the disclosure of diary notes of Mr Slipper.


I can also confirm that I provided the exact same material to the AFP as I previously provided to the Federal Court.


Furthermore I advised the AFP that I would be happy to meet with them at any time in the future if need be.


On that same day, the Prime minister indicated—as Mr Brough has stated, and I have got no reason to doubt him—that the material that they have received is the same as has been already made public, so there is nothing new in that. There is an ongoing inquiry, and the answer is: yes, I do have confidence in Mr Brough, but of course there are rules relating to ministers and cabinet ministers. However, there is at this stage nothing to suggest that Mr Brough should stand aside or do anything of that kind. Naturally, he is providing complete cooperation in the investigation as he should.


The conduct in question occurred prior to Mr Brough's return to the parliament and his appointment as Special Minister of State and Minister for Defence Materiel and Science. The statement on ministerial standards provides that ministers will be required to stand aside, if charged—and I underscore 'charged'—with any criminal offence. 


So let's go back to the appalling way, I have to say, that Senator Cameron this afternoon is seeking to prosecute this situation. As the Attorney has indicated, the simple fact that a person's premises are searched as a consequence of a search warrant does not lead to any conclusion. One cannot draw the assertion of any allegation of criminality but, I think, that is what Senator Cameron is seeking to do here. He is coming to this place, casting an aspersion on a member of the other place by saying, 'This person has had a search warrant issued against them. The police have come to search his premises'—the innuendo being that an imputation of criminality has occurred, which is absolutely wrong. Having listened to the debate earlier, I think that Senator Cameron certainly is sailing very, very close to the wind in relation to section 193(3).


I want to reiterate the comments made by the Prime Minister in the other place earlier this afternoon:


The facts and circumstances of this matter, all of which occurred prior to the last election and have been well known for considerable time …


As I have indicated, there are ministerial— (Time expired)

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland) (15:48):  What is clear in the debate we are now having is that there are questions to be answered by this government and by Mr Brough in the other place as to what involvement he has or has not had in respect of the matter.


I know and understand that the statement Mr Brough has made has been quoted at length but it remains to be seen as to what actions were done, what his involvement was in what has come to be known as the Ashby affair. What is required, particularly for the important that role Mr Brough plays as the Special Minister of State, in holding a ministerial portfolio, is more than a statement in response to the issue raised. We see that with the question in the other House by Mr Dreyfus, who put the question very bluntly to the Special Minister of State. He said:


How does the minister respond to the following words contained in an AFP search warrant, which I quote in part: 


Between 23 and March and 13 April 2012, Malcolm Thomas Brough counselled and procured James Hunter to access restricted data, namely the former Speaker of the House of Representatives … official diary, contrary to Section 478.1 of the Criminal Code 1995 …


The answer given by Mr Brough was:


I refer the member for Isaacs to my statement of the 18th. I have nothing further to add, and what you are referring to are of course allegations.


What is important in this place is, if there are allegations raised, that they are dispelled. Mr Brough has all of the opportunity to go into the House to make a full explanation of the circumstances. As always, I am not making any criminal allegation against Mr Brough—nor would I, in this place. It is not up to me to do that. What is important though for Mr Brough is to make a fulsome statement about what his involvement is in the Ashby affair so that we do not jump to conclusions and try to make assertions that could be considered in this place.


It is clearly a case where Mr Brough should come into the parliament and make a full explanation of what his involvement is or was not in respect of the Ashby affair, because we only have snippets from his own statements, which are reported in the paper. I do not know whether they are accurate statements of what he did or did not say. I can only go on what has been reported.


In an interview last year, the journalist Liz Hayes asked Mr Brough:


Did you ask James Ashby to procure copies of Peter Slipper's diary for you?


To which Mr Brough responded:


Yes, I did.


This information is also contained, as I indicated, in the Australian Federal Police search warrant.


I cannot say—and nor would I—that that is a clear admission of any criminal activity. It would be wrong of me to say that. The Leader of the Government in the Senate has said, you could not make that statement at all—to which I agree. As I understand it, Mr Brough is offering to cooperate with the Federal Police in that investigation—and so he should. We should all do that. It is important to uphold the principle in this place and, if he is cooperating with the Australian Federal Police in relation to an AFP investigation, he should—as has been done many times before—stand aside while the AFP conduct their investigation. I am not saying that he should; what I am saying is that that opportunity is there for him to do that. (Time expired)

Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (16:00):  At the request of Senator Siewert I move:


That the Senate—


(a) notes:


(i) the ongoing conflict in Syria, which has led to over 250 000 deaths, and the fleeing of 4 million refugees, over half of whom are children, and


(ii) Australia's ongoing military involvement in Syria and Iraq, the scale of which is second only to the United States of America; and


(b) calls on the Government to:


(i) increase the intake of refugees from the Syrian crisis,


(ii) support legislation passed in the Senate that would remove children and their families from detention, and


(iii) de-escalate Australia's military presence in Syria and Iraq, and explore political, economic and diplomatic avenues that will work toward a peaceful settlement to the conflict.


My interest in this particular topic is the humanitarian impact, particularly the Syrian conflict. We know that this has been a long stretched civil war inside Syria. It has been going on for over five years. It was 18 months ago, in January 2014, when I first visited the Jordan refugee camp—one of the world's largest refugee camps now—the Zaatari refugee camp. I also visited the various refugee settlements in Lebanon. Of course, both Jordan and Lebanon are bordering countries to Syria and have had to cop the bulk of the very real human need of people who have been fleeing this conflict.


When I was in the Jordan camp walking around and talking to the UNHCR—that is, of course, the UN refugee agency experts—they explained to me that, when they first established the camp, it had been believed that it would only need to cater for 20,000 people and perhaps for six to 12 months maximum. Five years on that is just not the case. It is now one of the world's largest refugee camps. There are over 300,000 refugees in that camp, and many of the people who are there have been there for four or five years. We have heard direct appeals from the UN in relation to a lack of resources and to fund these operations properly. We know that various things such as food vouchers have had to be rationed because they simply do not have the resources to ensure that everybody who is in the organised camp has access to food on a regular basis. That is one of the reasons cited for why people are continuing to move on.


While there might be 300,000 people in the formal camp in Jordan, there are over a million in the Jordanian community. According to the ambassador from Lebanon and the briefing that was given by the Jordanian, the Turkish and the Lebanese ambassadors in this place only two weeks ago, there is now a situation in Lebanon. The population of refugees in Lebanon makes up 40 per cent of the total population inside Lebanon. That is more than one in three people in Lebanon now seeking asylum as refugees.


The biggest concern of all in this is that this is a children's crisis. Out of what is believed to now be four million people who have fled Syria as refugees there are another seven million people internally displaced inside Syria. Out of the four million people who have fled across the border more than half of those are children. It is a horrific situation that we have children—many of them very young children—living in very delicate and unsafe conditions, particularly in those countries bordering Syria.


It is to that point that there is a continued growth of people moving from those bordering countries because they simply cannot put their lives back together. They do not have the resources. The UN bodies and the various partner agencies do not have the ability to help cater for the four million people living in the bordering countries. So people continue to move and that is what we are seeing in terms of the influx of people seeking protection throughout Europe. Just because they got out of Syria has not meant that these children and their families are necessarily safe, or, indeed, that they have any ability to put their lives back together.


It was only two months ago when the world was shocked and heartbroken by the image of the little boy whose body washed up on the coast in Turkey, little Aylan. It was that image which really brought home to so many of us, right around the world, that those who are copping the brunt of this conflict in Syria, those who are suffering the most are indeed the most vulnerable—that is, the children. As the world was shocked and shaken into action, countries right around the globe were saying, through grief and through the human response of wanting to help, that more needs to be done to offer humanitarian assistance to the hundreds of thousands, the millions of people who have had to flee Syria. It is incredibly heart warming and wonderful to see that our own Australian community stood up and demanded that we, too, as far away as we are from the Syrian crisis, take some responsibility in helping to give shelter and protection to those in need. That was, of course, despite the initial position of the government under former Prime Minister Tony Abbott that Australia did not need to do any more. That was the original position: Australia had already done enough and we did not need to help any more. Thankfully, sanity prevailed and the heart of the nation forced the Prime Minister's hand at the time. Then we saw the extension of our humanitarian program to take an extra 12,000 Syrian refugees. I think that is a very proud achievement of the Australian community—to ensure that, despite the initial opposition, we were able to offer this humanitarian assistance.


To this date, however, one of the biggest issues facing the humanitarian organisations, who are trying all they can to manage this humanitarian crisis and children's crisis, is a lack of funding and support. It shocks me, to be honest, that here in Australia we spend more than double the amount of money running Australia's detention system, in our offshore camps and in our onshore detention centres, than the UN Refugee Agency has to help those who are fleeing war in Syria. The statistics are very stark. The UN budget for helping Syrian refugees is just under a billion dollars at US$931 million and Australia spends $2.1 billion locking up refugees. I find it incredibly galling to hear in this place that Australia is doing everything we can, that we are more generous than any other nation. It is simply not true. I would like it to be true. I would like to think that the generosity and warm hearts of Australians is extended into this parliament and that we had a government that spent our money more wisely.  Imagine what we could do to help the very real humanitarian needs of those fleeing the war in Syria if we were not spending $2.1 billion locking up the very same people in Australia and in our offshore detention camps.


The UN has appealed directly to Australia many times for us to pledge more money to help in this crisis. Our fair share, if we were to be picky about it, if we were to only do our fair share in comparison to other countries, not going above and beyond, would be, as cited by the United Nations, $150 million this year. We have not come anywhere near that. We gave very little to the UN in previous years to deal with the humanitarian crisis from the Syrian conflict and now we have pledged $44 million, when in fact our bare minimum fair share would be $150 million. So we are still a long way behind. 


I appeal to the government directly today. I think we can be doing much more. I think we could easily find a way. If we released children from detention here in Australia, perhaps we could spend $150 million helping to feed Syrian refugees in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey refugee settlements, so that people do not have to continue to flee. We know that offering direct humanitarian assistance through resettlement is important. It is important symbolically. It tells the rest of the world that Australia is prepared to be part of our global community, that we share the burden of ensuring that people are given safety. It is an incredibly important thing to do. The 12,000 people who will be given protection here are going to become wonderful Australian citizens. They will get jobs. Their kids will go to school. They money will be spent in our local communities and they will be forever grateful for being given a chance to live in safety and an opportunity to rebuild their lives. I think we could be offering more people that opportunity. 


I appeal to the government: let us use the current 12,000 increase as a down payment and, in fact, let us take many more people than that. We have the ability to. We have one of the strongest screening programs in the world for refugees. We know and can trust our systems. We know who people are when they come to Australia, and we are able to ensure community safety. We can do all of that, and we can offer more assistance to people who are in great need. Offering up the money the humanitarian organisations need on the ground is vital. Opening our hearts and our doors to those who are in need now is doable. We are strong enough as a nation to do this; we have proven that already. We should continue it.


To that point I would like to note that I know there are some people in this parliament—Senator Cory Bernardi is one of them, but there are members in the other place as well—who in recent days have suggested that we should 'close the borders'; that we should not take even the 12,000 Syrian refugees we have pledged to help. They can have their opinions, of course, but I am very thankful that the Australian community has shown far more grace and far more compassion than those few here in this place who advocate the benefits of fear as opposed to the benefits of human kindness and compassion. We can take in more people. We should be helping to fund the agencies better. But we also need to have a look at what we are doing in our own backyard. It puzzles many Australians that we have a program to welcome more refugees who are having to flee the Syrian crisis while at the same time we are leaving Syrian and Iraqi refugees locked up in detention. It does not make any sense. We already know who these people are—they are legitimate refugees. They deserve protection, and just because they happen to make their own way out does not diminish their need for safety or their need for dignity and respect from our policies.


I was incredibly heartbroken when I heard the story of one Syrian refugee who is currently in detention here in Australia. The rest of his family is hiding in a rubbled town in Syria as we speak. His two young daughters, who are under the age of six, and his wife are effectively trapped in their home. They are too afraid to go out because of the bombings, and they are obviously frightened of the rise in extremism and violence that is ripping their country to pieces. Meanwhile we have the father locked up in an Australian detention centre and every day we are spending money on his detention—it costs $2,000 per day to keep someone locked up on Manus and Nauru. We are spending money to keep him locked up and separated from his family when what we could be doing is helping to safely reunite his family with him in Australia. The fact that we have these two parallel positions from the government, two parallel policies that work against each other, is madness. It does not make sense at all. Australians are puzzled as to why we would be spending money locking up Syrian refugees in Australia at the same time as we are saying that we care and that we understand that people fleeing Syria need protection because they cannot just go home. This man's case is a good example, but there are also many others who have come here—Iraqis and Syrians who are being kept separated from their families because they happened to arrive on a boat rather than been hand-picked by the immigration minister and the department. We need to see the end of this ludicrous situation.


The last point of this motion goes to the issue of the amount of money Australia is spending to lock up children in our detention centres. How do we advocate on a global stage that Australia is willing to participate in a humanitarian response to the Syrian crisis when we have a system that spends money locking up children who have done nothing wrong, but are victims of the circumstances they were born into, the country they were born into or the nationality of their parents? There are 112 kids who are locked behind bars here in Australia. It is time we did something about letting them out, and I hope we could see them out in time for Christmas.

"Smith, Sen Dean",LP,2015-11-26,"



Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (16:21):  I also rise to speak on this motion that relates directly to Australia's national security interests which, as we all know, is the highest responsibility of government. But it also requires that this government, under the new leadership of Mr Turnbull, takes responsibility to balance those important national security interests against our very strong interest in upholding and maintaining our very defensible record with regard to humanitarian support.


It is far too big a responsibility to be playing politics with, and I want to note Senator Hanson-Young's very measured contribution to this debate. I would not agree with everything in Senator Hanson-Young's contribution, but it was indeed very measured. But this is something that is beyond the issue of politics and my concern is that aspects of this motion will seek to try to do that. When you look at the motion, it is important to understand what it says in its entirety. My attention was drawn to (b)(iii) of Senator Siewert's motion, which calls for a de-escalation of Australia's military presence. For me, the problem with that proposition is that no such change has been sought by anyone other than the Australian Greens, as far as I have been able to ascertain. But, to put it bluntly, when it comes to strategic and military matters, this government will proceed on the considered and professional advice of its Australian Defence Force rather than the whims and wishes of the Australian Greens and others.


I note the motion also calls on the government to explore political, economic and diplomatic avenues in response to the Syrian conflict. What I think needs to be emphasised at this point is that those things are actually not inconsistent with having some military involvement. This is not and should not be a question of either or. We can all agree that what is occurring in relation to the Syrian conflict is a human tragedy. I do not doubt the sincerity of the Australian Greens, or anyone else for that matter, in this chamber on that particular point. But, clearly, we are not going to agree on all aspects of the best solution. I accept that; I know that others will accept that. Of course, if there was an easy answer, the world would have found it and we would be rushing towards that easy answer. But that is not available to us.


I do not think it is helpful to adopt political postures or try to claim a moral high ground in regard to this very complex matters. It should not be about moral posturing or posing. The policy has to be determined and, ultimately, judged by its outcomes. I note aspects of Senator Siewert's motion touch on border protection. That is the policy area where I would like to demonstrate that point. 


The position adopted by the Rudd Labor government when it won office eight years ago, this very week, I might add, was not one based on evidence or experience; it was based on moral posturing—feelgood statements about ending the Pacific solution. In fact, many of the Rudd government's policy positions were about feelgood rhetoric rather than careful planning and examination of the evidence of what might be effective. But that is a discussion for another time. For my point, I am using this particular issue to demonstrate the earlier point I make. The reality is we cannot remove ourselves from a debate and understanding of the border protection policies if we are to properly understand the predicament that we find ourselves in with regard to refugee intakes, humanitarian issues and, of course, the conflicts across the Middle East.


Here are some of the facts about border protection. The day that Kevin Rudd took office, there were just four people in immigration detention who had arrived illegally by boat. None of them were children. That was the impact of the Howard government's so-called harsh and cruel Pacific solution, as the opposition and the Greens have tried to describe it. Then Labor set about changing the policy with the active encouragement and support of the Australian Greens. They took a solution and worked to create a problem. They put the people smugglers back in business. 


Let us fast forward to July 2013, two months before Labor lost office. What do we find? Under the supposed compassionate policies of those of the sort advocated by many of those opposite, by July 2013 there were 1,992 children in immigration detention. Labor changed the Howard government's policies and the result was that the boats started coming again. They came to such an extent that over the life of the Rudd Gillard Rudd Labor government over 8,600 children were put into detention as illegal maritime arrivals. Under this coalition government, as I stand here today, that number is now under a hundred. Any dispassionate assessment of the policy and its outcomes, would come to the same conclusion: it was difficult policy to have to embark upon, but it was a policy that delivered on outcomes. The number is fewer than under Labor, but it is still under a hundred. I do not mind going on the public record saying that I find that objectionable, and I am sure there are other senators who would agree with me. That is still too many but the government continues to work responsibly to further reduce that number. 


I accept that Labor and the Greens had the best of intentions when they cooperated in changing the nation's border protection policies in the early days of the Rudd Labor government I do not think it is in anyone's interest or anyone's good use of time to be arguing that there was any deliberate ill-intent. But I do not, for one moment, doubt that the policy did not work. As I have demonstrated, good intentions are not enough. Good intentions do not automatically ensure good outcomes and that is the basic problem with this particular motion this afternoon.


We are not going to improve the situation by de-escalating our military involvement and focusing just on diplomatic avenues. We need to have both. The decision the government made last year to support US-led international military efforts to counter Daesh were not made on a whim. They reflected an assessment that Daesh represented a significant threat not only to the people of Iraq but to the wider region and, ultimately, to our own domestic security here in Australia. 


It is also important to remember that the Iraqi government itself asked for our assistance to defeat this menace. In doing so, Australia is a part of a group of around 60 nations working together to counter Daesh and prevent the spread of violent extremism, including to our region and, indeed, to our country. In the year that has passed since we began that involvement, Australia has made a substantial and proportionate contribution to international coalition efforts to degrade and dismantle Daesh's capability—one, I venture to say, is broadly supported across the Australian community. Simultaneously, our own forces have been working assiduously to build the capacity of local forces on the ground and take up that fight. 


An ADF withdrawal from Iraq and Syria, which is effectively what this motion is calling for when you read it to its end, would weaken, not strengthen, international efforts to combat Daesh and it would not be in the interests of the Australian people or the people across our region. The Iraqi military is making progress in the current campaign against Daesh. Could it be quicker? Of course it could be quicker; nonetheless, it is making progress. The mission, however, is very far from over. Iraq needs continued support from the international community, including Australia, to build the capability of its security forces to conduct offensive operations against Daesh and to deny this terrorist movement a safe haven. This is why the government supports continuing our missions to develop the capacity of the Iraqi security forces and continues to contribute an air task group at the request of and to support the Iraqi government.


Again, I appreciate the sincerity and the intentions of those who have moved this motion today, but good intentions are not solid enough. It is very, very difficult to work diplomatically towards a peaceful solution, as the motion calls for, when those on the other side of this conflict frankly are not interested in peace. They measure their successes, unfortunately, in terms of the body count—and, unlike with our own forces, I do not mean that they aim for the lowest possible number of deaths. The more they kill, the more they terrorise, the happier they are and the closer they are to their outcomes. That is the reality of what we are up against.


The problem with this motion is that it assumes we are working with rational actors or that we are dealing with people motivated by a common humanity, a humanity common to all of us. I wish we were, but with respect to Daesh that is simply not the situation we find ourselves in. Its savage ideology is clearly demonstrated in its statements calling on supporters to target civilians of Western nations wherever they can be found. Martin Luther King spoke of the day when people of different races and creeds would sit together at the table of brotherhood. Well, ISIS or Daesh and its associated groups are not interested in a seat at that table. They are not interested in nuanced arguments and negotiations. They seek total victory through total terror obtained through more and more violence.


At the beginning of this month, I attended a rally in Perth that was a demonstration of support for the people of Israel in the light of what has been occurring in that country recently in terms of murderous attacks from extremist groups. I was pleased to be joined on that particular day by many from Perth's local Jewish community, state members of parliament, local councillors like Brent Fleeton and indeed my Labor Senate colleague Senator Joe Bullock, because, however Australians choose to vote come election time, there are certain values that unite us, and chief among those is our enduring belief that the citizens of a democratic nation have the right to live peacefully and be secure within their own borders.


What has been occurring recently, with the campaign of incitement to violence and the murder of Israeli citizens at the hands of terrorists, offends every value that decent Australians hold dear. No Australian of good conscience could possibly hold sympathy with or defend the outrageous behaviour of some Palestinian clerics, who actively encourage their followers to murder Jews at random on the streets of Afula, Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. No Australian of good conscience could possibly support the words of Palestinian President Abbas, a self-proclaimed 'moderate', who has told his people, 'Every drop of blood spilled in Jerusalem is pure,' and said that murderers will be 'rewarded by God'—not the words of a moderate. No Australian of good conscience should be happy with a situation where new generations of Palestinians are having their minds poisoned through vile, anti-Semitic propaganda campaigns that only serve to make the already difficult goal of peace even more difficult—perhaps even more unlikely.


To those Australians who think that what is happening in Israel or Paris is a long way away and does not affect them, I simply point out that the values for which Israel and France both stand—personal freedoms and democracy above all else—are also the values for which Australia stands and which Australians have fought and died to protect for generations. If we want to preserve the values that underpin our open, democratic societies, we will have to work resolutely with each other to defend and protect the freedoms we hold dear.


The military campaign the US-led international coalition is undertaking in Iraq is essential to these efforts and has helped slow Daesh's advance. Without these military efforts in Iraq and Syria, Daesh would present an even greater threat to Iraq, the Middle East region, the Europeans and, indeed, the world, including us. In that context, what is being suggested through this motion, a de-escalation or drawing-down of our military contribution, would simply not be responsible.


The motion also goes to the issue of Syrian refugees, and I am pleased to be able to discuss just briefly, in the time available to me, that particular point. In September 2015, as we know, Minister Dutton met with representatives of the UNHCR and other international partners to discuss how Australia could best contribute to the international response. Following on from those discussions, the government announced a generous package of assistance in response to the Syrian and Iraqi humanitarian crisis. This included a total of 12,000 additional humanitarian program places, which are being made available for people displaced by the conflict in Syria and Iraq. I think at the time of the announcement it was generally agreed by most commentators and in the community that that was a necessary and indeed generous response. These places, of course, come on top of Australia's existing humanitarian program of 13,750 places, which itself will rise to 18,750 places in 2018-19. People who fall into these categories will include both Syrians and Iraqis.


The additional places will not be offered to people in Australia or regional processing countries who travelled to Australia illegally by boat. What we mean by that is that they will be offered to genuine refugees displaced by the Iraqi and Syrian conflict. This goes back to the point I made earlier in my contribution. It is by stopping the boats and restoring integrity to our humanitarian program that the government has now been able to respond generously to this crisis to assist the most vulnerable offshore. Had the boats still been arriving at the rate they were arriving at under the former Labor government, I think you would have to question whether there would have been such wide-scale community support for Australia taking additional humanitarian refugees. I think it is fair to assume that, if we had not tackled the issue of border protection, the level of sympathy and generosity by Australians in meeting the humanitarian crisis in Iraq and Syria would have been less. It is not that people would not want to be generous, but they would hold to the view that we should be getting our own house in order before offering the hand of assistance to others.


We can afford to be generous because we have got our borders back under control, a situation that some in this chamber and some across the community said in the lead-up to the last election was impossible. In fact, Australia has consistently been ranked among the top three countries that resettle refugees referred to them by the UNHCR. When measured on a per capita basis, we resettle the most UNHCR refugees of any nation.


Minister Dutton officially provided the first ImmiCards to the first families granted visas through the additional 12,000 places in Jordan at the start of this month. The first of the families have since arrived, and I am pleased to say that the first arrivals have been welcomed in my home state capital of Perth, in Western Australia. They will be very, very welcome in Western Australia. We look forward, of course, to welcoming more families to our country in the weeks and months ahead.


As has been the consistent position of the government, the focus of the intake of 12,000 is on persecuted minorities and those assessed as being most vulnerable, women, children and families with the least prospect of returning to their homes. Before I go on to talk about the selection process, I would like to make this point. The government has committed to making the focus of the intake of 12,000 refugees persecuted minorities and those assessed as most vulnerable, women, children and families. I would just like to talk briefly about the issue of persecuted minorities.


I was pleased to read that in August the United Nations Security Council held its first ever briefing on attacks against LGBT people in the Middle East by militants from the Islamic State group, also known as ISIS or ISIL. I have been genuinely perplexed that some people or some political parties in Australia who champion the issues of LGBTI Australians have not said more or have not drawn attention to the most atrocious of incidents and attacks that happen from these violent extremist groups in the Middle East against LGBT people. I hope that this government, in finding safe refuge for persecuted minorities, will find places amongst those 12,000 refugees for LGBT people whose lives are being put at risk because of their sexual orientation and because of the existence of these violent extremist groups across the Middle East.


That United Nations Security Council meeting or discussion that happened in August 2015 was reported in this way. This media report says:


While it was not the first time the persecution of gays and lesbians has been mentioned before the 15-member council that includes the U.S., Britain, China, France and Russia as permanent members, the panel had never convened to talk specifically about attacks on LGBT people anywhere in the world. The Security Council has previously discussed the impact of Islamist terrorism on global peace, but acknowledging sexual minorities in this way was an ""important step"" for expanding human rights, said Samantha Power, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., who sponsored the meeting with her diplomatic counterpart from Chile.


I will be asking the new Prime Minister to make a place in that intake of 12,000 refugees for LGBTI people being persecuted in the Middle East—in Iraq, in Syria—by terrorist organisations like Daesh.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2015-11-26,"



Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland) (16:41):  I too rise on the motion put forward by Senator Siewert today. The motion notes that the war in Syria has led to more than 250,000 deaths, and millions of people have become refugees fleeing this war-torn country. I think it is worth just going back a little bit to where this particular issue started. It started as pro-democracy protests during the Arab Spring, which have now turned into a bloody civil war and sectarian war. While it looked like the regime in Syria was going to fall as part of the domino effect that had taken hold in nearby Tunisia, Egypt and Libya, Yemen and Bahrain, the same did not eventuate in that regime changing in Syria. The ongoing conflicts and uprising across the Middle East since that event started in 2011 I think have been described by some as the Arab winter, with no end of the violence in sight.


After the brutal crackdown by the Assad regime, many opposition forces took up arms to defend themselves. It did start, I think, as something that could be described as a two-dimensional conflict between those supporting the Assad regime and the rebels opposing it, but now I think it is very clear that the conflict has taken on a sectarian angle, with fighting also pitching President Assad's Alawite Shiah against the majority Sunni population. It is also being further complicated with the appearance of the Islamic State terrorist group, which is looking to carve out territory for a so-called caliphate. The conflict now is a multifaceted web of sectarian, rebel and terrorist groups vying for control of this country, while, sadly, the people of Syria suffer under the strain of a five-year-long civil war.


The human rights violations have been mounting since the start of the conflict. They include murder, rape and torture. The Assad regime has been accused of blocking access to humanitarian aid such as food, water and medical supplies. The use of chemical weapons such as the nerve agent sarin has also been widely documented and has added to the bleak nature of this conflict. The Assad regime has been condemned resoundingly by Western nations. It does seem to be a regime that does not care about the welfare of its own people. It is a regime that has broken the social contract between the people and those in power, and if anyone considered that it did have any legitimacy, it certainly does not have it now.


The complexity of the conflict has been added to further with the involvement of Russia, and that has added to the tension in the region not least because its air strikes have largely been focused on targeting anti-Assad rebel groups instead of the Islamic State terrorist group. The recent downing of the Russian passenger jet, which Islamic State claimed responsibility for recently, and the shooting down by Turkey of a Russian warplane demonstrates not only the complexity of the area, which it now is, but also the increasingly crowded and dangerous area that is the Syrian conflict. In response to that, it goes without saying that as a citizen in the world Australia does have a role to play.


I want to go through some of these issues in Syria in seriatim, but I will deal with the refugees from Syria first. This is a reaching out from Australia's heart in a conflict which at this point knows no end. It is appropriate that Labor welcomes the government's announcement that it will provide an additional 12,000 places for people fleeing persecution in the Middle East. It is an appropriate response from the government, and we support it on the basis that these would be genuine humanitarian places offered as quickly as possible. Australia and Labor called on the coalition to do more, and this response is welcome in that regard.


Australia does have a role to play in dealing with significant humanitarian crises that have seen the biggest number of displaced persons since the Second World War, and it continues to be vital for Australia to play that role on an as needed basis without qualification and without discrimination. And, of course, with all of this Australia remains guided by the UNHCR, as they see appropriate. The coalition have indicated—I think more strongly than they need to in some parts—how they will meet this challenge, and I welcome and congratulate them for doing that. But it is an area which I think needs more clarity from this government. According to the UNHCR, the number of displaced people fleeing from war, conflict or persecution is the highest since World War II, and Labor's view is that by the close of 2014 there would be an estimated 59.5 million individuals forcibly displaced around the globe as a result of persecution, conflict, violence and human rights violations. Labor does believe, as I said, that Australia can do more to address this global humanitarian crisis. Labor is compassionate and outreaching in this respect. Our approach to asylum seekers enables refugees to progress their claims safely and securely.


By 2025, we on this side think the increase in Australia's humanitarian intake should be 27,000, almost double the current intake of 13,750 under this government, and, as part of our commitment to demonstrate leadership in our region, a portion of the program would be dedicated to resettling refugees from the region. Notwithstanding that, we also believe that the UNHCR should have additional funding to assist them in this work. It is not going to solve the problems. With all due respect, and I know everyone is dealing with this in a sensitive and sensible way, one of the issues with this motion, and I think it stands out, is that we are suggesting in the motion that we all work towards a peaceful settlement to the conflict. It goes without saying that everybody would want to work towards a peaceful settlement of the conflict. I do not think the way the Greens have put that forward is sustainable to achieve, but I do think it does not exclude the ability for Labor to put forward a plan to deal with the results of the conflict and to deal with assisting the UNHCR to work with and through humanitarian needs and find solutions in that regard.


One of the ways we can work towards the ultimate goal of collective peace is in taking a leadership role in South-East Asia and the Pacific to build a regional humanitarian framework to improve the situation of asylum seekers. It would of course include supporting the UNHCR in providing health and education and services. And in dealing with the broader issue of ensuring the protection of the interests of children in detention, Labor is committed to providing a strong, independent voice with the government to advocate for the interests of children seeking asylum.


In this area, it is important to then talk about what the Greens would ultimately want out of this motion, which is to de-escalate Australia's military presence in Syria and Iraq. I do not think anyone would disagree with a de-escalation of Australia's military presence in Syria and Iraq if there were peace in that region, but there is not. Unfortunately, Australia does have a role to play as a global citizen. There is no more important a duty of a government than to keep its people safe and no more serious a decision to take than to deploy our armed forces and place them in harm's way. The peace, security and stability of our region and the world is in Australia's national interest.


It is also in Australia's national interest to be a good international citizen, and Australia has a long record of contributing to a secure and stable international order. No-one underestimates the complexity that is Syria and Iraq today. The extent of the conflict is enormous, and Australia has been asked to help Iraq defend itself. We do need to consider carefully not only the implications of assisting Iraq but also the consequences of doing so. I think it was best summarised in a speech by Mr Bill Shorten, the member for Maribyrnong, when he said:


Today the crisis unfolding in Syria presents us with a new and important decision, a decision that Labor never takes lightly.


What he was describing was how our involvement in this issue would play out. He went on to say that there was: 


clear advice that Iraq has the right to defend itself against cross border attacks, given that the Syrian government is unable or unwilling to prevent such attacks by Daesh. Iraq also has the right to request help from other nations, under the United Nations principle of collective self-defence, and has done so. 


Mr Shorten reaffirmed, on 9 September, Labor's bipartisan support for Operation OKRA and paid tribute to the brave professional soldiers that are serving on that mission. It is not an easy mission. Notwithstanding the complexities I have outlined, any conflict comes with significant challenges. In fulfilling our duties as good international citizens, it demands the respect of the United Nations. We are members and we are, I think, obligated to meet those reasonable requests. 


I think it is fair to say that there is not unanimity on this issue. People do have concerns. They have concerns about the extent of the mission, how long the mission will be and, of course, whether there is an exit strategy around the mission. These are all legitimate questions that should be asked, debated and discussed. There are many who are concerned about how Daesh will recruit and drive its agenda, and these concerns have to be met and discussed as well. It is clear that there is much to be debated here today and as we go forward. So I do not complain about the motion by the Greens. I think it is an area where we all should think very deeply and seriously about what is happening in that country, what our response should be to the unfolding humanitarian crisis and, of course, in responding to the humanitarian crisis we also should consider carefully what our response should be militarily. 


The key reason for Australia's military engagement in Iraq and Syria and our participation in an international mission against Daesh comes down to a clear responsibility as a global citizen to respond to the Iraqi government's request for assistance in the fight against Daesh. We have seen the unfortunate results of Islamic State's work and we condemn it. We stand, as the Prime Minister has said, shoulder to shoulder with France in condemning those horrendous attacks. I think it goes without saying that in putting our soldiers in harm's way we should acknowledge that and thank the brave men and women of the Australian Defence Force for the professionalism with which they are carrying out their duties. They are a true credit to this country.


Labor's support for the campaign in Syria and Iraq is fundamentally based on the humanitarian requirements that are unfolding in Syria today. The figures in the motion underscore how important it is to make a contribution. As the Prime Minister said yesterday and as Labor has consistently argued, ultimately we all want a solution in this region. It is not one that is going to come from Australia de-escalating its military involvement and suddenly peace will jump out from behind a wall in this region. As the Prime Minister said, a political solution is needed in Syria and only this will allow attention to turn more fully to eliminating ISIL as a military force.


We do want, and the government should articulate, a clear strategy for Syria and Iraq, a plan to defeat Daesh and a plan for the day after that, to support a government and to support in a humanitarian sense the people in that region to form a viable, vibrant democracy. This strategy does need to include a strong and coordinated military response to prevent Daesh perpetrating horrendous crimes against humanity. As I said, a political solution in both Syria and Iraq ultimately guarantees the rights and privileges of ethnic communities, minorities and humanitarian support which underpins that. As Hillary Clinton said recently, 


If we have learned anything from 15 years of war in Iraq and Afghanistan, it's that local people and nations have to secure their own communities. We can help them, and we should, but we cannot substitute for them. But we can and should support local and regional ground forces in carrying out this mission.


I think that goes without saying. I think Hillary Clinton has summarised that in a way that says in one short comment what would probably take me 20 minutes to say. 


I would add, though, that we do have to have a clear objective for this assistance—a plan for now and a plan for when we leave. I am hoping that during this debate the government can articulate some of that plan as to how this will play out. We have seen terrorist attacks this month and this year which painfully show that we must all combat the threat of terrorist attacks within our borders and, more globally, assist those outside our borders, because we all have a common cause of encouraging peace and ensuring that people can have a vibrant democracy, can live safely and securely, and can feel secure within their own borders. In my closing seconds I send a welcome to France. (Time expired)

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2015-11-26,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia—Co-Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (17:01):  In my comments I would also like to join in thanking Senators Smith and Ludwig for the constructive and respectful way in which they have conducted the debate. Given its difficult nature and these difficult times, these are hard arguments to have, but it important that we have them.


On 17 September this year the then defence minister, Kevin Andrews, tabled his first and, as it turned out, only ministerial statement on Australia's military deployments into Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. That document is what passes for parliamentary consideration of one of the most important decisions that any government can make. The document was anodyne, devoid of detail and entirely lacked any analysis of the political or humanitarian consequences of opening a new front in our endless wars in the Middle East. 


But it did not particularly matter. That document was tabled at the tail end of a week consumed by the overdue removal of the Prime Minister who was himself responsible for the deployment. The document was only given four minutes of debating time before the chamber clocks signalled that it was time to talk about motor sports instead.


This statement, now consigned to the irrelevance that it deserves, is chiefly valuable for what it does not contain. Australia even today has no overarching plan or political strategy to bring peace to Syria or Iraq. We have outsourced it, as we have the larger fraction of our foreign aid and defence policy, to a conflicted and exhausted superpower that seems increasingly helpless as ghosts of past decisions have proliferated into nightmares.


Tonight's debate takes place in the shadow of violent attacks on innocent people all over the world. We grieve with those families and friends who lost loved ones in the horrifying attacks on the people of Paris nearly two weeks ago tonight. Some 130 people lost their lives and 368 people were injured, some of them very seriously. We offer our condolences to the families of those 43 people who lost their lives in twin bombings in a busy residential and commercial district in Beirut, Lebanon; the 27 who died when gunmen opened fire at the Radisson Hotel in Bamako in Mali; the 34 innocent people dead at a farmers market bombed in Yola, Nigeria; the 224 innocent victims of the bombing of the Russian Metrojet flight 9268 over the Sinai Peninsula; and the more than 100 who died when suicide bombers attacked a peace rally in Ankara in Turkey.


These high-profile attacks seized the attention of the world's news organisations for a period of time, but others barely break the surface tension. In October this year, 714 Iraqis died in acts of violent terror. Our parliament is unlikely to take the time to pause in condolence for these innocent lives lost, because perhaps we think this is the new normal in Iraq.


What unites these horrific attacks is that they are carried out against civilian targets—people going about their ordinary lives. Whether claimed by al-Qaeda affiliates, Boko Haram or Islamic State itself, these are not military targets. They are ordinary people in markets, live music venues or their own homes. What could possibly motivate these atrocities has long bewildered Western defence and security planners. Most commonly they are described as senseless or simply incomprehensible.


There is, however, a cold logic at work. These attacks are not senseless—they are calculated. It is the same strategy that al-Qaeda in Iraq—AQI—used to ignite a horrific sectarian war in Iraq in 2006 and 2007. Their attacks on Shiah civilians were designed to provoke an escalation of violence against the Sunni, who would then, it was reasoned, turn to al-Qaeda for leadership.


David Kilcullen's brilliant and provocative Quarterly Essay article 'Blood Year' describes it in this way:


… AQI's campaign was driven by a brutal political logic: in provoking the Shi'a, Zarqawi hoped to back the Sunni community into a corner, so that his group would be all that stood between Sunnis and the Shi'a death squads, giving people no choice but to support AQI, whatever they thought of its ideology. This cynical strategy—founded on a tacit recognition that AQI's beliefs were so alien to most Iraqis that they'd never find many takers unless backed by trickery and force—meant that Shi'a killing Sunni was actually good for AQI, and so they'd go out of their way to provoke the most horrific violence against their own people.


AQI—al-Qaeda in Iraq—was one of the progenitor organisations that went on to form the core of Islamic State. It may seem hard to accept that, but the long-range targets in the attacks on Paris are ordinary Muslims, who Islamic State are desperately hoping will be now subjected to increased surveillance, harassment and violence at the hands of Western governments. That is how Islamic State is attempting to claw its way from the extremist margins to a kind of twisted legitimacy as the most viable protector of Islam.


Quite recently a group of US Air Force service members with more than 20 years experience between them of operating military drones wrote an impassioned plea to the Obama administration calling for a rethink of the military tactic that they say 'has fuelled the feelings of hatred that ignited terrorism and groups like ISIS, while also serving as a fundamental recruitment tool similar to Guantanamo Bay'. These are the drone operators—the individual men who fly these devices. They argue that the killing of so many innocent people, unreported by most Western media organisations, has acted as one of the most devastating driving forces for terrorism and destabilisation around the world. Waleed Aly must have hit something of a nerve last week when he called Islamic State out on this hideous strategy, because millions of people have shared his plea to focus our response rather than engaging in precisely the kind of indiscriminate backlash that these violent criminals are trying to provoke.


To his credit, in his national security speech in the other place a few days ago, Prime Minister Turnbull largely refused to take the bait. His contribution, which I thought was quite measured, focused largely on unity, social cohesion and targeted intelligence gathering and disruption of the violent extremist networks active here in Australia rather than, for example, calling for more mass surveillance or new police powers over ordinary people. But the measure of the value of such a statement lies not just in the tone in which it is delivered but the actions that underlie it. The government's so called Allegiance to Australia Bill, for example, seems almost deliberately counterproductive and is perhaps a relic of the old Abbott approach. Boasting, as the Prime Minister did, about the scale of our military involvement in Syria also seems almost deliberately counterproductive. In 2015, 13 countries engaged in bombing a country smaller than the state of Victoria. And the situation on the ground is more complex still as nuclear armed superpowers and regional actors are drawn into an increasingly violent regional conflict.


Rodger Shanahan, an associate professor at the Lowy Institute, said Australia's announcement to bomb Syria was 'long on rhetoric but short on detail and lacked any semblance of strategic vision or acknowledgment of the potential impact on the situation inside Syria'. Defence Minister Andrews himself conceded that he could not estimate how long the deployment would last and he had no idea how the Syria conflict would end. He acknowledged that the West needs 'a clearer strategy' for the Middle East. To revisit the last time the West had a clear strategy for the Middle East, we could sample a quote attributed to the then US Deputy Secretary of Defense, Paul Wolfowitz, in 1991. Speaking to General Wesley Clark on the subject of regime change in Iraq, Syria and Iran, Mr Wolfowitz said: 'We've got about five or 10 years to clean up those old Soviet regimes'—Syria, Iran, Iraq—'before the next great superpower comes on to challenge us.'


Of course, the consequence of attempting to bomb—or otherwise implant—liberal democracy and Western priorities into the ancient rivalries and allegiances of the modern Middle East now speaks for itself. Iraq is balanced on the edge of apocalypse, Libya is the world's newest failed state and Syria is emptying into Europe as millions of refugees overwhelm its immediate neighbours. This is the edge of the abyss into which the Bush-Howard-Blair war on terror has taken us by taking the bait of a global war of civilisations that was offered by a tiny handful of al-Qaeda extremists. By responding to violence with more escalated violence, this is where we now stand. Tony Abbott, who sat in the cabinet when John Howard signed Australia up for the catastrophically misconceived and illegal invasion of Iraq in 2003, now demands a ground invasion of Syria from the backbench—from where, it is hoped, he will never return.


Our military actions undermine the potential of our diplomatic role as an engaged and activist middle power. Australia has good diplomatic standing with Turkey, Saudi Arabia and, more recently, thanks to recent interventions by Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, Iran. Australia has proved that we can be constructive diplomatic players in difficult and protracted conflicts. We have had successes at the United Nations Security Council under foreign ministers of both political stripes—most recently Ms Bishop, who last year was able to co-author a unanimous Security Council resolution allowing access for cross-border humanitarian aid into Syria without the consent of the Assad regime. The recent Iran nuclear agreement shows how progress on intractable problems can be made where coercion and threats of force have failed. This has opened new diplomatic space between Iran, Russia and the United States—the three countries that could arguably do the most from the outside to support expanded ceasefire zones inside Syria—enabling humanitarian assistance to be delivered, cutting off the supply of weapons and ultimately isolating Islamic State.


The single most urgent priority of the international community needs to be a political solution to the crisis in Syria and Iraq, because every military solution proposed thus far has simply made the situation worse. Iran, Saudi Arabia and Turkey need to be the key players in urgent deliberations facilitated by a neutral party that can bring these nations together to expand the narrow common ground and restart the failed Geneva process of negotiations. Our place as a US proxy probably means Australia cannot be that neutral moderator, but we can still play an active part in encouraging these powers to come to the table. Ironically, the bitter evacuation of hundreds of thousands of refugees into Europe and the premeditated attacks in Paris have breathed life into the so-called Vienna talks toward a peace settlement in Syria. On 1 January 2016 these negotiations will be restarted. But this time regional players, including Iran, will be at the table and the intention is to have regime figures and opposition leaders in the room. We understand how formidable the hurdles are which lie in the way of such a process toward a ceasefire and political settlement in Syria, but it is equally obvious to all that there is no military solution to the violence in this tragic part of the world. The criminals who are clearly attempting to provoke the world to greater violence in their own lands may instead have moved the world closer to a peace settlement in Syria. Any such progress will be unspeakably fragile, but this is where Australia should play its part.


This space for resolution also needs to be created on the ground. Political negotiations will only bear fruit if and when the fighting stops. Localised truces offer a starting point for de-escalation and, when successful, they allow much needed humanitarian aid to get to those in the midst of the conflict. Syrian civil society leader and astrophysicist Rim Turkmani has highlighted that a truce in Barzeh led by civilians resulted in tens of thousands of internally displaced people returning to their homeland. He said: 'Many people went back to their areas after [the ceasefire]. They settled back in their houses. They're not internally displaced persons anymore. There was a revival of modest economic activities. There was some progress.' It is obvious, however, that groups like al-Qaeda and Islamic State will remain outside such ceasefire processes and are likely to attempt to undermine any attempts at a peace settlement in Syria that might unite presently fractured parties against them. Islamic State has exploited the disintegration of Syria and the foreign boots on the ground in Iraq to stake its claim over a huge swathe of territory. The last thing it wants is for these warring factions to adopt a more singular focus on the territory it holds.


Unlike al-Qaeda's distributed franchise structure, Islamic State exists to hold territory; it is given life through a war economy heavily focused on oil revenues and other illicit financial flows. In February 2015 the Financial Action Task Force, based in the United States, reported on the financing of the terrorist organisation ISIL. They analysed how Islamic State acquits the monthly payroll of thousands of foreign fighters and how it generates funds, and proposed important measures for the international community to choke off the money supply. The FATF propose a number of strategies for doing this, but they also point out that 'a number of the funding tactics that ISIL employs have not yet been assessed'. This is essential research which remains incomplete, and the strategies they outline have thus far been subordinated to reflexive demands for increasingly futile military escalation. The Financial Action Task Force annual budget, in financial year 2013-14, of around US$3.5 million represents about 120 hours of flying time for a single Global Hawk UAV. Where are our priorities?


Australia can play a powerful role in ensuring that governments around the world follow through on UNSC resolutions—that we helped draft—making the financing of terrorist groups a crime, freezing the assets of those in the supply chain and ending illegal oil sales by identifying customers and how it is being traded. The time for debating Australian deployments in theatres of war is before the deployment, not after, so that the parliament and the public can weigh the benefits of military action against other actions which seek to de-escalate conflict.


No coalition speaker will come into this parliament and admit that they were wrong to carry us into war in Iraq—that tearing down an inconvenient regime and leaving chaos in its wake provided the proving ground in which Islamic State gestated. The war on terror has been a failure; we are less safe now than we were before President Bush stood on the deck of the USS Abraham Lincoln and declared, 'Mission accomplished.' The Liberal-National coalition, having played their part in this vast escalation of violence around the world, now assure us that yet more violence is the only way to prevail.


Australia can be a key actor in moves to demilitarise this horrific conflict, but we need to put the needs of the immediate region first. Rather than adding more fuel to the fire, we must encourage our allies and our friends to, once and for all, cease the reflexive lunge to further militarise this conflict—actions for which ordinary Syrians and Iraqis continue to pay an unimaginable price.

Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia) (17:17):  I, too, rise today to speak on this motion on the absolutely devastating tragedy that continues in Syria and Iraq—a situation the scope of which is too large for us here to truly comprehend the scale and the impact that it is having on millions of people, not just those in Syria and Iraq but those in the many other nations that religious extremism, in this case Islamic jihadism, is impacting on. The death of more than a quarter of a million people in such a short period of time and the enormous tide of hundreds of thousands of displaced people fleeing their homeland is truly heartbreaking for all of us in this place and across our country. It, once again, highlights that the world is a messy and complicated place. Daily, we see the best and the worst of humanity. The worst often has its roots in centuries-old conflicts; similarly, the best often springs out of those same circumstances. This is the situation we see in the Middle East today. To pick up Senator Ludlam's point, to suggest that the current conflicts in the Middle East and the current battle that rages between Sunni, Shiah and the minority sects are the fault of Australia and its allies is hubris at its finest—or, indeed, at its worst. Nothing in the Middle East has ever been or is ever likely to be so simple and so binary. In circumstances as complex as these, there are no right or wrong policy answers for Australian and other policymakers. There are simply differences of opinion about what needs to be done. What all of us, I believe, in this place share as human beings and as Australians is the sorrow, anger, disbelief and great frustration that we feel for the millions of victims of this and other conflicts. As I have said in this place before, none of us have a mortgage on compassion or humanity, but we do not always agree on the right policy solutions and what Australia should do in these circumstances


What is very clear to me, personally, is that the current threat from Daesh and other Islamic terrorist organisations is real and is growing. I do not believe that withdrawing to our own international borders will make us safer—in fact, I think quite the opposite is true. Enemies no longer just attack us over our land, sea or air borders; they attack us electronically, they can recruit and incite to violence remotely, and they can attack our citizens overseas. As this threat is complex, so too must be our response. That does not just mean, in the current circumstance, political actions; it also means military intervention. I believe that any approach that involves retreat from the current situation and support that we are providing is actually the cruellest of all humanitarian options for the millions of Syrians and Iraqis who continue to suffer in Iraq and Syria and where they have fled to overseas. I think it is the responsibility of everybody, none more so than the governments and leaders here in Australia and overseas, to do everything we can to rid the world of this violence.


Here in Australia, we certainly have it better than most. Though we are a relatively young nation, we have a stable civil society, we are more prosperous than most and we have one of the world's most responsible and robust democracies. For those reasons—though not just for those reasons alone—I think we have always felt we have an obligation, and we continue to have an obligation, to help not only Australians but others overseas when they are in trouble, as, clearly, Syrians and Iraqis are at the moment. Not only is it the right thing to do; it is the just thing to do. Our democracy rests on the foundation that it is the right of all of our citizens to observe and express opinions and beliefs in society without fear of intimidation, violence or death. The plurality and contest of ideas are what makes us grow and strengthen as a nation. There are many other nations who today share our democratic ideals and the belief that ideas and opinions can always be improved through vigorous debate. Eventually, from that, the best ideas and opinions, in a collaborative way, morph into our cultures, our institutions, our laws and, ultimately, the fibre of our nation.


Here in Australia and in many other democracies, we value freedom—freedom of speech, freedom of religion and freedom of association. But sadly today, as I reflected last night in this place, not all Australians value those freedoms as we do. We have far too many Australians here and overseas who are now actively working to undermine these very freedoms and the values that we all hold so dear. The rational world view is that nations have much more to gain by encouraging and engaging in a peaceful and constructive war of words to achieve their ends and not by physical violence. I am firmly of the belief that war itself is neither logical nor rational yet it still occurs. Human nature itself does not change, which is why we should always work and strive for peace.


We must always be ready to defend Australians from wherever an attack may come. Today there is a very real threat and enemy—that is, Daesh. They have chosen to go to war with us. It is a war of values. We value freedom, we value democracy and we value life but those who support Daesh do not. They do not respect compassion, freedom or the values that we hold; instead, they see that in us as a vulnerability to ruthlessly exploit. Like others in our recent past—people smugglers, criminals—they attempt to exploit our vulnerabilities. The challenge for all of us in this place is: how do we deal with those who would exploit our compassion and attack our values without actually undermining those very values and principles that we are fighting to uphold? But to achieve Daesh's downfall, we have to take the fight to them, which we are, and we have to win. We cannot retreat by our own land borders or expect others to carry and shoulder the burden for us.


What Daesh does is truly evil. They kidnap, they enslave, they attempt to intimidate through indiscriminate barbaric acts of terrorism people of any ethnicity, of any nationality and of any religious belief. They carry out systematic human rights abuses, mass executions and extrajudicial killings. They deliberately target, kidnap, torture and kill civilians. They persecute individuals and entire communities and they forcibly displace other minority communities. They kill and maim children. They rape women, they rape children and they carry out other forms of indescribably horrible crimes against others. This has to be their undoing because the rational civilised people of the world who value freedoms and who value life know that this organisation and this value system has to be stopped. That is why Australia has joined the coalition of 60 other nations to counter this threat at its source—at the moment in Syria and Iraq. But to do that we have to destroy the tentacles which extend far beyond the Syrian and Iraqi borders right into our own homes and into the homes of our children through the internet. Yes, we are the second-biggest contributor. But, again, as I said, it is not just because we can; it is because it is simply the right thing to do.


This war of ideas is not constrained by geography. Daesh presents a global terrorist threat. They have recruited thousands of fighters from all around the world to Iraq and Syria and many of them will never return home. They do that and they use technology to spread their hate filled violent and extremist ideology. It shames me and upsets me to concede that several hundred Australians have heard that siren song and have been recruited from their very homes to this cause. We are kidding ourselves if we do not think that they represent a grave security threat to our own citizens here in Australia. Those that they have recruited overseas learn to kill. Australians are proving to be very effective killers of others and that is also why we have a responsibility to deal with this problem.


The international coalition is currently conducting airstrikes in Iraq and Syria. They are supporting Iraqi forces and they are providing humanitarian assistance. The aim is not to prolong war, to sustain war; it is to stop war. The aim is to restore peace and good governance in both nations so eventually Syrians and Iraqis who have survived this conflict can return home in peace to start rebuilding their countries. I believe any calls to withdraw forces at this current time is naive at best, dangerous at worst and an abrogation of our responsibilities to protect our own citizens and to protect our citizens from our own citizens who are over there to kill. Any withdrawal at this time of Australian forces, as the second-largest force of 60, would weaken international efforts to combat Daesh—again, an organisation we have to defeat. It would also signal to like-minded international partners that we are not committed to doing our part to tackle extremism, terrorism and violence that, again, is a threat to Australians within our borders, and those Australians that have gone overseas to kill are also a threat. Therefore, we will not abandon our commitment to support the Iraqi and Syrian people. We will continue to work with the United States and the international coalition to defeat Daesh—because they can be defeated—and, along with it, defeat its medieval and abhorrent ideology.


It is also important to remember that—and you do not quite get this message from those opposite—in addition to taking military action, we are taking comprehensive political action to try to resolve this. But, again, it is not a binary situation. It is a complex political environment, just as complex as it is in a military environment. We are also providing a great deal of humanitarian assistance. We are welcoming 12,000 displaced people from this conflict to Australia, in addition to the 13,750 places already allocated in our humanitarian program. We are dealing with it politically, militarily and also through other civilian policing methods. These additional 12,000 places are being offered to the most vulnerable people affected by this conflict, to the women, children and families of the persecuted minorities, who have all suffered unimaginable horrors. But—and I think quite rightly—all applications are being rigorously assessed on an individual basis. Despite the urgency of the process, security and character checks will not be compromised. We have recently seen the consequences of the lack of that kind of scrutiny in Paris, sadly, and we are possibly seeing it in the outcomes of the terrorist raids in Belgium.


Australia's response to this humanitarian crisis has been made possible by the government's streamlined approach to border protection and to the improvements we have made since coming to government. All of this discussion on violence, sadness and suffering is, I think, a very stark reminder to all of us in this place that we all have a role to play, even in our own daily lives, to ensure not only that our own communities are safe—whether it is safe from terrorism or domestic violence—but that every single Australian gets to exercise the freedoms that we are fighting so hard to protect.


As I talked about in this place last night, last week I attended a forum of Asian women parliamentarians in Brussels. It was on the role of women in peace and security. Certainly the backdrop of the lockdown and terrorists raids in Brussels at the time brought this topic into sharp relief. It was clear to me from the discussions and from listening to the stories of my Asian colleagues that not only gender equality but the ability of people to live their lives in a way that they deserve to live their lives will only occur when there is peace. Without peace, you cannot have a strong and just civil society. With the military intervention at the moment, that is what we are doing. We are trying to get peace so that we can start to assist the Syrians and the Iraqis in rebuilding their lives.


Many of my Asian parliamentary colleagues shared stories with me of the challenges they face as women living under Islamic rule and subject daily to the implications of jihadi violence. That is verbal abuse; it is physical abuse. One of my colleagues, Afghani member of parliament Shukria Barakzai, was the target of a suicide attack 12 months ago last week in which nine people died and 35 people, including her, were injured. Yet she perseveres. She and other women like her are the good amidst the evil. But to support them and to support the good, we have to first destroy the evil. At the moment, that resides both in their homelands and in ours. They were very clear in discussing this with me and our European parliamentary colleagues. They deal with these terrorists and live under the threat of these terrorists all the time. In Afghanistan, you have the Taliban, but you also have Daesh. They were very clear that inaction is death. But we cannot let—and they are fighting not to let—the evil that they are perpetrating change their way of life or their fight for women in Afghanistan and in Pakistan. So they were very clear: we must fight them and we must defeat them—there is no other way. And we have to do it together. There is nobody more qualified than these women to give us that advice.


In conclusion, we cannot defeat this enemy by withdrawing behind our borders and leaving the fight to others. We must assist them and others around the world to defeat this enemy, to achieve peace, to rebuild institutions, to re-implement the rule of law and to defeat ideological and religious violence and extremism. To do that, we have to fight politically and we have to fight militarily, and we have to use any other tools available to us. I think that is the right thing and the only just thing to do.

"Gallacher, Sen Alex",ALP,2015-11-26,"



Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (17:36):  This debate on Senator Siewert's motion about the conflict in the Middle East is a very important one. Very clearly, there is a divergence of views—and that is probably quite appropriate in the vibrant democracy that we enjoy here in Australia. It is a bit of an irony that it is probably not available to those people in conflicted areas.


I just want to go to Senator Siewert's motion, and, in particular, two points. The first is (a)(i):


… the ongoing conflict in Syria, which has led to over 250 000 deaths, and the fleeing of 4 million refugees, over half of whom are children …


The second is (a)(ii):


… Australia's ongoing military involvement in Syria and Iraq, the scale of which is second only to the United States of America …


I want to put on the public record a more complete picture than those two fairly succinct points.


By the by, I must admit that I did not know the population of Syria, and I am often asking the library for information like this, but it is about 21.9 million, estimated in 2013. That just puts into perspective the following report:


The Syria conflict is the biggest humanitarian, peace and security crisis facing the world today. Intensified fighting and a deteriorating humanitarian situation continue to cause massive people flows within Syria and into the region.


The UN estimates 12.2 million people in Syria need humanitarian assistance while 4.1 million have fled to neighbouring countries, including Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, Iraq and Egypt.


I think that is really important, because if you just watch the media reports you get the idea that people are fleeing to Europe, or they are fleeing completely out of the area. There are 4.1 million in the neighbouring countries—Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, Iraq and Egypt. The report continues:


Australia has provided $190 million in humanitarian funding since the conflict began in 2011. This includes $83 million for assistance to people inside Syria and $107 million to help the refugees in the region and their host communities.


This funding has been delivered through United Nations agencies, international humanitarian organisations and Australian non-government organisations to reach people in need. By working with these partners, Australian funding has been able to provide shelter, protection, food, water and sanitation, education, health and medical services in response to the crisis.


The key statistics remain: 12.2 million people in need of humanitarian assistance inside of Syria, 7.6 million internally displaced people inside Syria, 4.6 million living in hard-to-reach areas inside Syria, and 422,000 living in besieged areas. There are 4.1 million Syrian refugees in the region, 2.1 million of which are children. And 89 per cent of Syrian refugees are residing in host communities. Appallingly, 320,000 have been killed since the start of the conflict.


So, just to put a little bit more substance to the first point, it truly is a global humanitarian crisis that we are seeing in Syria. And if we look at Australia's ongoing military involvement we know from our own defence department's website that Operation OKRA is the Australian Defence Force's contribution to the international effort to combat Daesh, known as ISIL, the terrorist threat in Iraq and Syria. Australia's contribution has been closely coordinated with the Iraqi government, Gulf nations and a broad coalition of international partners. What this translates to is that about 780 ADF personnel have been deployed to the Middle East in support of Operation OKRA. These personnel make up the Air Task Group, or ATG; the Special Operations Task Group, or SOTG; and Task Group Taji, or TG Taji. Approximately 400 personnel have been assigned to ATG, 80 personnel are assigned to SOTG and about 300 personnel are assigned to TG Taji. Further information about the international effort to combat Daesh and the terrorist threat in Iraq can by found by simply examining either the US defence department's website or our own. The ATG consists of six Royal Australian Air Force F/A-18 Hornets, an E-7A Wedgetail airborne early warning and control aircraft and a KC-30A multirole tanker transport. Clearly we are part of a coalition, if you like, and our contribution is significant. But I just want to highlight the point that Australia's ongoing military involvement in Syria and Iraq is of a scale that is second only to that of the United States of America. I just want to put that in absolute perspective: it is six aircraft, with an early warning and control aircraft and a Wedgetail.


But we do know that those people have been extremely busy. We know from the reports of Defence that they have flown a lot of hours and a lot of sorties, and we know also that the RAAF C-17A Globemaster has successfully delivered 40,000 pounds of crated weapons from Albania to Erbil in Iraq. On 24 September it carried 11½ tonnes of weapons. So, the C-17A has been involved in logistics, so to speak, in making sure that our people are well-resourced to do their job and ensure that their contribution is 100 per cent. We also know that the RAAF C-130J has delivered 15 bundles of Australian humanitarian supplies to isolated civilians at the Iraqi town of Amirli, and this effort has been continual and ongoing. Finally, with respect to the military contribution, we know that the Special Operations Task Group has been deployed to the Middle East region and is providing military advice and assistance to the counter-terrorism service of the Iraqi security forces. These forces are taking the fight to ISIL, or Daesh. The legal protections required for the deployment of the SOTG have been agreed with the Iraqi government, and the advise and assist mission is being conducted with direct support of Iraqi security forces.


That just puts a little bit of perspective into the military involvement in Syria and Iraq. We know that Task Group Taji is a combined Australia and New Zealand military training force located at the Taji military complex north-west of Baghdad. So, TG Taji has been deployed to Iraq to support an international effort to train and build the capacity of the regular Iraqi security forces. A common term for this international training mission is building partner capacity. So, that is just a little bit more detail on the scale of the conflict and the size of the Australian contribution.


To take a very broad view of the next point in the motion,—increase the intake of refugees from the Syrian crisis—if you were to walk up any street in Australia you would get five different views on this, and some of the views are probably not worth repeating. But the reality is that we cannot not fail to place on the record that Australia has a long history of accepting humanitarian refugees from all parts of the globe. Australia's postwar migration program has seen over 800,000 refugees and displaced persons settled in Australia. We do it better than anybody else, but we also have to be mindful and careful. We face new challenges and threats every day.


I accept the right of all people to come in here and put their particular viewpoints. I could probably have a debate with Senator Bernardi at times on a lot of issues but, as he eloquently put it, he may be the canary in the mine. There are plenty of people in the community who share his view. I personally do not have as many misgivings as Senator Bernardi but, then again, I am not in total support of where the Australian Greens want to go. I want to make sure that in this debate we do have firmly on the record that I do not think there is a nation in the world that has done better at helping with humanitarian issues and displaced people, particularly since World War II, than Australia. That has been a tremendously successful effort. It is something that the nation should be extremely proud of, and we are. Genuinely, over time, it has probably been a fairly bipartisan effort. In the last six to eight years we have fallen into vigorous debate and there has been criticism hurled across the chamber both ways about the outcomes that we have had. I think bipartisanship in this area is extremely important to Australia. After all, it is the government's prerogative under the Westminster system to commit troops and to deal with these sorts of things, so it is not a parliamentary decision, it is only a parliamentary debate. In my view we have reacted very strongly to the Syrian conflict.


There has been some debate about what part the regions are playing. I want to restate that 4.1 million people have fled the violence in Syria to neighbouring countries, including Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and Egypt. In Lebanon, refugees make up one-quarter of the population, which is the highest per capita concentration of refugees in the world. About 90 per cent of the refugees in the region are residing in host communities, which is, quite obviously, placing a strain on their local infrastructure and services.


On 9 September 2015, the Australian government announced a further $44 million in humanitarian assistance in response to the Syrian-Iraq crisis. I know the party that I am a member of suggested that figure should be closer to $100 million. It welcomed the $44 million, but it said it would be better if the figure were increased to $100 million. We are not in government, so that is a decision of the government. The $44 million includes $20 million to UNHCR for countries neighbouring Syria, $9 million to WFP for Iraq and countries neighbouring Syria, $3 million to UNICEF for countries neighbouring Syria and $12 million to other international humanitarian partners operating inside Syria and Iraq. This brings, as I said, our humanitarian response in Syria to a total of $190 million since 2011. That is not an insignificant contribution.


We see the call for an increase in the intake of refugees from the Syrian crisis. Syria's population is 21.9 million. In 2010, it had a GDP of $60 billion. In 2011, it was $53.7 billion. In 2012, it was $41.5 billion. In 2013, it was $35.2 billion. They had inflation go from 4.4 per cent in 2010 to 4.8 per cent in 2011, to 37 per cent in 2012 and to 91 per cent in 2013. Clearly the economy and the place has completely collapsed. Apart from the obvious danger of being maimed, injured, killed, beheaded, or all of the other unmentionable things that happen in war, there is no opportunity for anyone to function in that economy. We know that the neighbouring countries have absorbed tremendous numbers of people. Were we to say that we would take 20,000 or 30,000 Syrian refugees, there would probably be people who, on top of the obvious reasons for wanting to come to Australia with its enormous economic pull factor, would do whatever it takes to get to the economic security of Australia.


In regard to what the government has done in relation to 12,000, let us evaluate that, let us carefully work through that and let us see how that is working. I note Senator Smith's contribution was that the first refugees would be warmly welcomed in Perth. I think we will warmly welcome all of those people who qualify and make the journey to Australia. I think they will reward the country with their undying loyalty and contribution to the economy, because we are doing an immensely powerful thing for them. To simply increase the numbers without the careful, prudent strategies in place to ensure Australia's safety, security and viability in these areas would be a little adventurous to say the least.


The simple facts are that 12,000 places will be given to people displaced in Syria and Iraq who are the most vulnerable, which are women, children and families with the least prospect of ever returning safely to their homes. They are located in Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey. People who fall into these categories will be both Syrians and Iraqis. While subject to review, it is anticipated that a significant number of places will be available for both Syrians and Iraqis, noting the widespread displacement of people from those countries.


Applications for resettlement will be required to meet all the criteria for a refugee and humanitarian visa, including health, character and, most importantly, security checks. These checks must be completed before people enter Australia. It is a very prudent and bipartisan strategy. Any Australian government takes our national security extremely seriously, and it has been made clear that, from the outset, security and character checks of the additional 12,000 humanitarian refugees will not be compromised. Rigorous security checks will be conducted prior to arrival in Australia at a key number of visa-processing points. This includes the collection and checking of biometric data such as facial images and fingerprints. The Department of Immigration and Border Protection works closely with the relevant Australian agencies and international partners in conducting these security checks, including the checking of biometric data.


We clearly have a situation of enormous gravity. We are clearly a nation that has always had a reputation for stepping up to the plate, contributing and assisting in these areas. We have a security force that is trained, capable and able to be deployed. It carries out its tasks with extreme professionalism and is second to none, in my view. Its contribution should always be recorded in this chamber. I want to spend a couple of minutes going to the issue of de-escalating Australia's military presence in Syria. It is not a terribly large-scale presence. It is a terribly professional and effective presence, and it is probably meeting the needs that it has been invited there to meet. Of course, it will always be evaluated, and our chiefs of defence—Air Force, Army and Navy—will always give us the best advice as to what that escalation or de-escalation should be, and I will probably leave that there.


Finally, no-one wants children in detention. Clearly that is the view of all the senators in this place. I do not think anybody has a view that children should be in detention. We have had the debate today about where we started and where we are today, with around 100 children in detention. Hopefully, through the involvement of a select committee in this place, we will be in a much better position with the 100 children that remain in detention. Hopefully they are getting treated in a manner that is consistent with Australia's normal way of dealing with children. I am hopeful that there will be more disclosure in respect of their treatment. Their education should have improved. Improvement in their ability to seek medical treatment and all of that, after the enormous debates we have had in this chamber, should be well underway. It will not sort out the fact that they are not in Australia, but they should at least be guaranteed Australian conditions wherever they are—Australian freedom, protection, education, access to proper health facilities, access to decent schooling, access to proper food, comfort and security and the ability to go to sleep every night in a safe place.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2015-11-26,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (17:56):  With the remaining four minutes, Mr Acting Deputy President, I just want to ask some questions—a bit of homework for you, me and everyone else in this chamber for the weekend and, I think, for some years to come. There is no doubt there is a very big divergence of opinion in how we answer these questions. The first question that I have is: is it actually possible to destroy ISIS and other violent extremist groups in the Middle East? We have been at it for a while now. When I asked Defence this at estimates, they said they were going to stick at it for as long as it takes. I heard the previous government say the same thing. We are doubting whether our current strategy is working, because we are having a debate about putting boots on the ground and significantly increasing our ground forces. It was even raised in Paris last week with Prime Minister Turnbull and Barack Obama. The answer that Obama gave was that that is not a suitable option, because it is hard to beat an ideology.


The next question is: if we do destroy ISIS and other violent extremist groups—and we all want that; I think everyone in this chamber agrees we would like to see an end to them—what takes their place? If we were to get to that point, what cost are we prepared to pay? I noticed Senator Reynolds said that we needed to do whatever it took to destroy ISIS and other violent extremism, but she was not prepared to say to the chamber at what cost she was prepared to see that happen. How many lives would be lost if we did put boots on the ground? How long would it take? How much money would be expended and how long would we have to occupy these countries to keep a lid on violent extremism, in an area we know this has existed, for religious and sectarian reasons, for hundreds if not thousands of years?


The other question is: will it make matters worse? Will it make matters worse if we go in in a much bigger way or we continue to attempt to bomb our way to peace under a philosophy of peace through superior firepower—which I point out has not worked to date? Lastly, are we giving violent extremists exactly what they want? They want a global jihad. They want more violence. All the evidence to date shows that the types of awful, horrible, horrific acts that we have seen—such as in Paris, in Bali, in Beirut recently and all around the world—are occurring because these groups are able to recruit, and often the basis of that recruitment is a dissatisfaction with the West and our foreign policy in these countries, especially over the last 20 years.


These are big questions that we have not been able to come up with answers for and we have not got the policies in place for, but we do need to continue the debate. The only thing that I am really happy about, that helps me sleep at night, is that at least in this country we are now having a debate and there is a frame out there, thanks to the leadership of the Greens and a Prime Minister who has more sensible and progressive views. We are at least talking about how we might have a geopolitical solution as well as a military solution, if one even exists, to this incredibly complex and horrifying issue that we face in the Middle East. We will continue to talk about that.

Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (18:02):  The Community Affairs References Committee report, Availability of new, innovative and specialist cancer drugs in Australia, was a very, very important report. I will leave it to others to talk more in depth about the report but I will talk tonight about the impact that the GST is being considered by the Turnbull government would have on medical expenses—medical expenses for all Australians would increase.




If you have a serious illness—like cancer and other disabilities, or people who suffer from MS, arthritis or anyone of those terrible diseases—then it is going to cost you more to fulfil your prescriptions. It will cost you more to go to the doctor. A GST of 15 per cent will mean that you are going to pay more, if you have to go to hospital.





It is very easy for the government—and they do not like us talking about the GST and the fact that they are considering raising it to 15 per cent. They can very clearly just rule it out. The Prime Minister has had every opportunity to rule it out, and he has not done so because it is under serious 
consideration. We on this side, the Labor opposition, will never support a GST of 15 per cent, because we know the real impact it is going to have on every Australian. It does not matter whether you are talking about a suburban family with a couple of children because, every time they go and buy their school uniforms, it is going to cost more. Every time they pay their school fees and levies, it is going to cost more. Every time they pack the children's lunches, it is going to cost more. Not only is it going to cost more but, if they put—which, hopefully, they do—fresh fruit into that lunchbox, it is going to be 15 per cent more.





This is what the government has in store for the Australian people. No wonder they are cynical about politics, because Tony Abbott said before the last election: there would be no increase in taxation; no new taxes. This is a very big new tax that those on the other side have under the table ready to pull out. 





This government believes that they are just cruising along and they can pull the wool over the people's eyes. Well, they will not pull the wool over the Australian people's eyes. No matter how much they believe that they are just cruising and can do anything, we on this side know, and the Australian people are a wake-up to them.



You can change your leader—and that has been done before: we should know; we did it. The real test is that Mr Turnbull sat around the ministerial table in the cabinet room and supported every one of their unfair taxes—every one of their unfair cuts—to those who are most vulnerable in our community.


I have spoken before in this place and other places about what a GST increase will mean to older Australians. They are people, who, we on this side have always been very concerned about. It took those on the other side two years and a new Prime Minister to even appoint anyone in the ministry to deal with aged care. The problem is: they only see older people as a problem, because they only think of it as aged care. They have no consideration of ageing and how we need to embrace older Australians, keep them in the work force and develop policies so they can transition out of full-time employment.


Those on the other side—I do not know what it is but I actually do not think that they like old people. I certainly know that they do not like poor people. I also know that they do not like anyone who belongs to a union—we have seen what they have done to unions in this country by having a political witch-hunt.



Senator Sinodinos interjecting—




Senator POLLEY:
  Then we see the double standards—and, thank you, Senator Sinodinos; I will take your interjection. You, my fellow colleague, have been treated very badly by your comrades over there. You stood aside when you were under investigation but, no, what do we have now? We have the Special Minister of State and we had that debate during motions to take note of answers—I think it was the longest taking note I have experienced in the last decade with all the interjections from the Attorney-General, trying to defend the indefensible.


Politically speaking, I would have thought that the Special Minister of State would have done the decent thing and stood aside until this whole episode was cleared up. As Senator Ludwig said in his contribution in the taking note debate this afternoon, I am not making any assertions about the Special Minister of State and his role in the Slipper affair—with the Ashby allegations and all the drama around that—but there are questions that need to be answered and there are questions that need to be asked.


The new Prime Minister says he is going to be the Prime Minister of the 21st century government, and those opposite come into this chamber every day and talk about how agile and nimble they are. But what we have seen from this Prime Minister calls his judgement into question. So I am not so sure that he is as smart as he thinks he is—and I certainly know the Australian people are a lot smarter than what this government gives them credit for. The government is very bolshy at the moment because it is leading in the opinion polls. But we all know what the media do and we know that opinion polls come and go and everyone uses them to their own advantage. 


I can tell you that the people who ring my office and those who come to see me when I am out in the community are not fooled at all. They know that what we have is a government that is so out of touch with how difficult it is for families and for people to make ends meet each and every week. So an unfair, great big new tax—a 15 per cent GST—is not the solution. It is certainly not the solution that the Australian people thought they were getting when they voted for Tony Abbott. They certainly did not get the government they thought they were getting. This government made cuts to health and education, and the only people who have looked after Australian pensioners in recent times, by giving them at least a step up to an income that is a little bit more to help them try to manage, was the former Labor government.


We now have a government that is bereft of any real vision. We have a Prime Minister who talks an awful lot—and I have to say he is very good at it; he talks and talks and talks—but he does not say anything. In fact, he has been referred to as having a medical problem because he runs off at the mouth and talks a lot. It seems that he thinks that everything is fine if he looks good and is well presented. Let's face it: everyone was relieved when Mr Abbott was deposed. They sighed, 'Oh, what a relief; we do not have to cringe like we did every time Mr Abbott headed off overseas or was somewhere publicly speaking.' But it takes more than a smart dresser. He is a self-made man, and I give him credit for that—that is great; we should all aspire to that—but, for someone who is self-made, it is really, really disappointing that he would even consider bringing in an increase to the GST when that is going to hurt those people who can least afford it. Low-income families and individuals who have less disposable income are the ones who are really going to pay the tax.


People out there are not silly. They know that a government never, ever changes a taxation system without expecting to get more money. So the promise of compensating people will not wash with the Australian people. Those who are on a limited income—and I know; I have been there and done that—do not have any extra disposable income. They are the people who we on this side will always stand up for and protect. We have those opposite talking about various state premiers. When you start to cut funding and put the screws into the states so they will not have any choice, of course they are going to come out and say, 'Maybe we should support it.' But we know what it really means and we will never desert the Australian community. We will always stand up against any increase to the GST. A 15 per cent GST is wrong. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

"Canavan, Sen Matthew",Nats,2015-11-26,"



Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (18:48):  Mr President, I have remembered my notes this evening!



The PRESIDENT:  Very good!




Senator CANAVAN:
  Tonight I would like to speak about the importance of our commercial fishing sector and also, of course, how important it is for all Australians to support that sector, particularly over this period of the year, when many of us will be tucking into very delicious seafood over the Christmas break. I wanted to remind everybody of the importance of buying Australian seafood over that period, because the sector does need our support. It employs thousands of Australians. It is both a huge producer of economic wealth domestically and quite a large export industry for our country. It does face some challenges, though, both economic and regulatory, and I will speak a little bit about those tonight.


But I first want to thank the organisers of our annual Nationals seafood barbecue. It has become a tradition that was first established by former Senator Ron Boswell, I believe the sixth longest serving senator in this place. He established a tradition of having a barbecue at the end of the parliamentary year to celebrate the seafood industry and to express our support for it. It started, apparently, in a small courtyard with probably only a few people—Ron's friends—and it has grown into quite a large turnout we have these days. We invite the media along and sell to them the importance of the industry as well. How it usually seems to work in seafood politics—and I have had a bit of experience with it now—is that they get you along, feed you lots of fish, prawns and Moreton Bay bugs, give you a bit of drink, and then turn around and say, 'Can you support us on this particular issue,' and it is pretty hard to refuse once you are full of their beautiful product. Hopefully this year's event will have the same effect on the media. It is very well supported. I want to thank those individual businesses in the seafood industry who helped us: A Raptis & Sons, Austral Fisheries, the Ocean King Prawn Company, Sydney Fish Market and Urangan Fisheries. They all helped provide the products which made the event such a success. I also thank IGA and Metcash, who helped with the beverages.


As I said, this is an incredibly important sector for our economy. It produces $2.4 billion a year. Of that, around $1.2 billion is exported every year. On average, each Australian eats around 25 kilograms of seafood every year, and that makes it the fifth most valuable food industry in the nation. So it is of very high importance. It also employs 8,608 people directly, and another 4,000-odd are employed in the processing sector.


Of all the states in Australia, Queensland has the largest seafood industry. In Queensland almost 3,000 people are employed directly in the seafood industry. It is of incredible importance to particular regional Queensland towns including Karumba; Cairns; Rosslyn Bay, near Yeppoon, where I live; and Mooloolaba as well, on the Sunshine Coast.


However, as you might be aware, Mr President, the numbers employed in the industry have fallen considerably over the last decade. Only 10 years ago, 14,000 or so Australians were employed in the sector, and that has reduced to 8,600, as I mentioned, a big reduction over 10 years. That has been caused by some importation of seafood from overseas but also by changes to government laws and regulations which have made it harder for the seafood sector to operate in this country. Some of those laws were certainly justifiable, but others that I have had experience with seem to have no justification in science. They seem to be based more on the emotion of locking up particular areas and selling it to the public as a kind of environmental sales pitch and also to try to get some of the recreational fishing industry onside.


We have had a recent example in Queensland. The now elected Queensland Labor government took a very ill thought through policy to the election—I think on the basis that they probably thought they were not going to be elected. A couple of weeks before the election they promised to lock up an area the size of the ACT, just off the coast of Rockhampton and Yeppoon. It is an incredibly productive area for seafood. It produces a third of the wild barramundi caught on our eastern seaboard, along the Fitzroy River and the associated Fitzroy delta—a third of the wild barramundi caught on the eastern seaboard. They have now locked up—they promised in the election to lock up—that entire area. It is no longer available for the commercial fishing sector.


Around 40 families in the region have lost their livelihoods. They have been offered compensation as paltry as $10,000 for that cost, and many of them now have not a lot of other options. Some of them have had to go up to the Whitsundays area, which is quite long way away and also an area which is already well tapped by other fishermen, so there is a competition now for that resource. That is having an impact, of course, on the fishermen in that region as well.


It is an extremely ill thought through policy because it has nothing to do with the science. It is not based on science at all; it is simply locking up an entire area. The sustainable catch of wild barramundi in the Fitzroy River is not zero, so the policy is not justified on science. The policy is justified because in their view it will lead to a boost in tourism in the sector. There has been no evidence presented at all that such a boost will occur. It has actually been tried in other states. The New South Wales government, the former Carr government, locked up areas in northern New South Wales. There have been university studies done of the impact of those net-free zones and no evidence, again, that they actually lead to an increase in tourism.


That is the evidence and data, but just in your gut you know that people are not going to spend thousands of dollars to come to the Fitzroy River on holidays to catch wild barramundi. There are plenty of other places in the country that they can go and fish. Obviously we would love them to come to Rockhampton and Yeppoon if they like, but having net-free ban areas in and of itself is not going to lead to some tourist mecca in central Queensland.


It is quite disappointing that we continue to shut down these areas, because we have so much potential as a nation to provide for the protein needs of our own country and our own people and those overseas as well. We have the world's third largest ocean territory. The third largest ocean territory exists in our sovereign state, in our sovereign waters, in our economic exclusion zone. We have the world's seventh largest coastline. I think Senator Ludwig—through you, Chair—mentioned that just in an earlier debate. We have the seventh largest coastline in the world.


Yet, despite those attributes of an island nation—you would imagine that we would be quite a large producer of seafood—we, of all countries, produce the 57th largest amount of seafood in the world. So 56 countries produce more seafood than we do, even though we have the third largest ocean reserves and the seventh largest coastline. It does not add up. We only produce around 28 kilograms per square kilometre of our ocean in marine catch. While that is one of the lowest in the world, and we have an enviable environmental record on seafood production, what ends up happening is that people still eat seafood in Australia; they just import it from other countries, and we just export the environmental problem to them.


Every import requires a corresponding ledger entry on the other side of the balance sheet, and by importing our seafood from overseas we are exporting the environmental issues to other countries, particularly in Asia and South-East Asia. So, while we extract 28 kilograms per square kilometre here in Australia, in China, in Thailand and in Vietnam, where much of our seafood is imported from, their extraction rates are more than 5,000 kilograms per square kilometre. We have 28 kilograms per square kilometre. In those countries it is more than 5,000, and they have the attendant environmental and other issues associated with such a large and intensive source of extraction.


We could quite easily increase our production in our waters and reduce our imports, and overall for the globe there would be a better environmental outcome. But unfortunately that does not appear to be the direction of many labour and green governments across the world. We had a debate just the other day saying that we should not allow a particular vessel into the country, because this industry continues to be demeaned, even though it is made up of hardworking Australians who produce the best things in this country, and that includes prawns on Christmas Day.
