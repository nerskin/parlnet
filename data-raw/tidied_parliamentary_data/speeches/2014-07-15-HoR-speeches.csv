Mr ROBB
 (Goldstein—Minister for Trade and Investment) (12:02): by leave—It is with great pleasure that I speak about the Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement and accompanying National Interest Analysis, which was tabled yesterday for parliament's consideration. Australia and Japan concluded negotiations in April during the Prime Minister's historic and very successful visit to North Asia. The Prime Minister signed the Agreement with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Canberra on 8 July.


As with all proposed treaties, the parliament's Joint Standing Committee on Treaties will now review the agreement and, in due course, provide its report. The tabling yesterday of the agreement will also give the public the opportunity to scrutinise the provisions of the treaty.


The signing of the agreement is a significant milestone for the government's economic diplomacy agenda. The Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement is an important step forward in our trade and investment relationship with Japan.


Japan is an economic heavyweight. It is the third-largest economy in the world, worth almost US$5 trillion in 2013, and our second-largest export market, our second-largest trading partner, and a major player in regional and global supply chains. Two-way trade between Japan and Australia stood at $70.8 billion in 2013, more than 10 per cent of Australia's total trade. Japan is a vital, longstanding and highly complementary trading partner for Australia.


Greater integration with the Japanese economy will create jobs and build our economy. The agreement gives Australian exporters significantly improved market access across the spectrum of the Australian business community, reflecting the importance of Japan to the Australian economy. It eliminates high tariffs on a wide range of Australian exports. More than 97 per cent of Australia's exports to Japan will receive preferential access or enter duty-free when the agreement is fully implemented.


The agreement gives Australian agricultural producers and exporters a significant competitive advantage. It makes Australia the first major agricultural exporting economy to conclude such a liberalising agreement with Japan. Australian beef exports to Japan, worth $1.4 billion in 2013, will benefit from a halving of the tariff, with a deep cut immediately on entry into force.


Industry modelling shows that the agreement will benefit Australian beef export sales by around $5.5 billion over 20 years and deliver an increase in the annual gross value of Australian beef production by up to seven per cent. The beef outcome affords Australia a major advantage over our fiercest competitors, including the United States.


The former US Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia—and a man who is spoken of as a future Secretary of State, Kurt Campbell—described the agreement as a 'massive victory' for Australia. And I quote further from Kurt Campbell:


Europe and the United States … have been trying to get this kind of agreement from Japan for 30 years.


Exporters of horticulture, wine and seafood will also benefit from tariff-free access to the Japanese market.


The agreement is of course not just about agriculture. Japan will eliminate tariffs on all of Australia's manufacturing, energy and resources exports. This will particularly benefit our exporters of transformed resource products.


Services outcomes are equal to, or better than, the best commitments Japan has made in any of its other trade agreements and extend beyond Japan's existing commitments to Australia under the World Trade Organization. The agreement guarantees Australian services suppliers access to the significant and well-developed Japanese market in key areas of commercial interest, including financial, education, telecommunications and legal services and a range of other professional services. For example, Australian financial services providers will benefit from new commitments by Japan, beyond those in its existing trade agreements. Japan will allow cross-border access for Australian fund managers providing investment advice and portfolio management services in Japan. Japan has also guaranteed access for Australian financial services firms to conduct cross-border securities transactions with Japanese institutions. These commitments by Japan will help secure and protect Australia's access to one of the largest funds management markets in the world.


Both governments will support work towards enhanced mutual recognition of professional qualifications. Australian professionals will also benefit from guaranteed visa access arrangements, including for their spouse and dependents, to enter and stay in Japan.


In the education sector, Australia and Japan have further agreed to cooperate bilaterally to promote the recognition of each other's education qualifications, improve access to graduate studies in each other's country and strengthen student mobility between both countries.


In all key areas of commercial interest, Japan will extend commitments it makes in future trade agreements with other countries to Australian services exporters and investors, helping ensure that the agreement will remain relevant for Australian services exporters and investors in the years ahead. The agreement improves investment protections for both Australian and Japanese investors. With $130 billion invested in Australia in 2013, Japan is our third-largest investor and our most important Asian investor. By raising the foreign investment screening threshold for Japanese private investors, the agreement will encourage increased and more diverse investment from Japan and deliver the clear message that Australia is open for business.


I acknowledge that some sections of Australia's agricultural community had hoped for stronger outcomes on the products that they export. The government pushed on all products. However, the fact is that Japan is traditionally a very highly-protected agriculture market, and on some products it deems as particularly sensitive due to food security concerns, it moved in a tentative way, and on rice it would not move beyond our existing WTO access levels. The choice for Australia was continued stalemate and no agreement—or to secure a deal now that delivers considerable competitive advantage and keep pushing for further reform. So we fought for the best possible deal and made sure that the agreement also included mechanisms for future liberalisation. Scheduled renegotiation of outcomes for our key agriculture exports, and also a commitment to renegotiations should Japan give a better deal in the future to one of our competitors, means that the agreement has positioned Australia well for driving future gains. And, of course, the government will keep pushing for further liberalisation with Japan in other trade negotiations, including through the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations.


Let's be very clear—no other country has managed to negotiate such an ambitious agreement with Japan. No other country! For once Australia is ahead of the curve. We needed the Korea Free Trade Agreement to help level the playing field, given the advantage the United States and the European Community had because of their deals with Korea. We were playing catch-up. Under the agreement with Japan, Australian exporters will have the advantage. And I am confident Australian exporters will be able to make the most of this extraordinary opportunity.


As part of our commitments, Australia will remove its remaining tariffs on Japanese goods on entry into force or over several years. This will benefit Australian consumers and industries which rely on imported Japanese products. Tariffs on some products that compete with Australian-made goods, including some vehicles and automotive parts, steel, plastics, copper and textiles, clothing and footwear, will be phased out in staging periods to allow industry to adjust. The bottom line is with one in five Australian jobs linked to trade, this agreement will provide an important boost to Australia's economy. It is part of the government's broader push on trade. The agreement is the second of a series of bilateral trade agreements we are committed to concluding with major trading partners, following on the heels of the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement.


Now that the agreements with Korea and Japan are finished, we are intensifying our negotiations with China. This suite of agreements is significant for deepening these important bilateral relationships, as well as reinforcing our connection to North Asia, which is becoming integrated through increasing trade flows and supply chains. China, Japan and Korea together currently purchase 51 per cent of Australia's exports.


The economic benefits of Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement to our businesses and consumers—and to the Australian economy more broadly—will start to flow once the agreement enters into force. We aim for entry into force in early 2015 to allow Australians to reap the benefits from this agreement as early as possible. Implementation of the agreement will require a number of legislative amendments, and I urge members and senators to give favourable consideration to these amendments when they are introduced.


This is an agreement that took a long time to negotiate, and I commend the achievement of officials from various agencies led by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. There is bipartisan recognition of the crucial importance of Japan as a trading partner, and governments from both sides of the House worked on this agreement. In that light, I acknowledge the contribution of former trade ministers Craig Emerson and Simon Crean, as well as the Deputy Prime Minister, Warren Truss, who was Trade Minister when negotiations commenced in 2007. We should also recognise the vision of former Prime Minister John Howard. When he launched these negotiations with Prime Minister Abe in 2007, many said that a meaningful agreement with Japan was not possible. But Australia now stands as the first major agricultural producer to have secured such preferential access into the Japanese market. I would also like to acknowledge all of those officials and negotiators from my department who have worked so diligently over a very long period of time to help arrive at this outcome, including and especially Jan Adams, Frances Lisson, Peter Roberts, Simon Farbenbloom and many others.


I commend this agreement to the parliament, and hereby table the Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement with its national interest analysis.


I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to speak for 11½ minutes.


Leave granted.




Mr ROBB:
  I move:


That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Ms Plibersek (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) speaking in reply to the ministerial statement for a period not exceeding 11½ minutes.

"Plibersek, Tanya, MP",ALP,2014-07-15,"



Ms PLIBERSEK
 (Sydney—Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (12:14):  On behalf of the opposition I welcome the tabling of the signed Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement and the related national interest analysis. The opposition appreciates the acknowledgement by Trade Minister Robb of the efforts of former trade ministers Simon Crean and Craig Emerson in progressing this trade agreement with one of our largest trading partners. Those negotiations were part of Labor's embrace of our region.


In our Australia in the Asian century white paper we mapped out significant opportunities—and some challenges—for Australia in our region. Increased trade in goods and services is one of the key opportunities. Japan and Australia have a good, strong and stable relationship. We have been reliable trading partners for decades. In 2013, Japan was our second largest trading partner, with two-way trade valued at $70.8 billion. We are also reliable investors. Japan has been a long-term investor in Australia, with investment stock of $131 billion at the end of 2013. This investment has been critical to enable Australia to capitalise on the demand for our resources and to provide jobs and economic growth. Australia is also invested in Japan, with Australia's stock of investment in Japan at $50 billion at the end of 2013.


For four decades—since the Whitlam government lowered postwar tariff barriers—Australia has progressively opened its economy to the world. Whitlam, then Hawke and Keating set our nation on a course to greater productivity and competitiveness, delivering the high standard of living that we enjoy today. Japan has been much slower to embrace trade liberalisation. The concessions made during the course of negotiations on this agreement are welcome, as a first step on the path to more open trading arrangements.


Labor supports comprehensive trade agreements that are in our national interest. Preferential agreements should support a multilateral framework. In this agreement, Labor welcomes the proposed increase in the Foreign Investment Review Board threshold to over $1 billion for non-sensitive investment from Japan. This puts Japanese investment at the same standard as non-sensitive sector investment from the US, New Zealand and South Korea.


We note, however, the proposed carve-out of agricultural investments from the higher investment threshold—a shameless concession to the National Party and a shining example of why the government mantra of 'open for business' is little more than a brand on a banner. Many agricultural industries have not welcomed this agreement. Reactions have ranged from 'substandard' and 'not a major winner' to 'falls short of the mark' and 'another kick in the guts'.


Labor welcomes the fact that the Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement does not include an investor-state dispute settlement provision. With investment between two countries with developed legal systems, there is no need for such a provision. However, we want to better understand the practical implication of the various ISDS review mechanisms embodied in the agreement. It is difficult to see why the signing of a future agreement by either country that includes an ISDS provision would trigger a review under the agreement.


We also want to explore some of the content behind the sales pitch. For example, the government has boasted that the agreement will deliver immediate tariff elimination and reduced levies for high-polarity—international standard—raw sugar. However, Australia's principal sugar export to Japan is a different kind. It is a special low-polarity grade sugar, worth over $235 million in 2013, which receives no benefit under this new agreement. Tariffs on this type of sugar remain at 70 per cent.


There is much more capacity to deepen our trading relationship with Japan. A key test of the agreement signed by the government is how much of that capacity will be realised. All Australians have a stake in our trading relationship with the world. In tabling the signed agreement and national interest analysis, the minister has finally given the parliament and the Australian community the opportunity to subject the agreement to scrutiny. Labor will embrace that opportunity, including through the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. Labor notes with disappointment that the government published the text of the agreement just after signing, an act of defiance of the Senate order to table the text of the agreement 14 days before signing.


The minister made reference to the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement. I note that parliamentary consideration of the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement is underway, with over 60 submissions received by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties and a further 56 submissions received to date by the inquiry being undertaken by the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee.


The first public hearings on the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement were held by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties early this week. It is clear that there is a great deal of community concern about the investor-state dispute settlement provisions included in the Korea agreement, with much scepticism about so-called ISDS 'carve-outs' negotiated by the minister. There is also concern from business about the commercial workability of the Korea agreement related to red tape and confusing use of nomenclature. Reducing red tape, improving harmonisation and implementing domestic measures to support the growth of our small, medium and large exporters is essential to secure Australia's growth.


Labor wants to hear from individuals, community groups and business in connection with the free trade agreements before the parliament. We urge the government to tone down its triumphalism and start listening to Australians with concerns about some of the decisions made by the government in concluding these deals. The government has a responsibility to convince Australians that trade deals are in the national interest. In this, as in other areas of public policy, three-word slogans are not good enough.


Labor will work with the government constructively, but not uncritically, in ensuring the proposed treaty before the House is in our national interest. Finally, I acknowledge the work of the minister and previous trade ministers and the contribution of the many officials who have played an important role in the negotiations on the Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement.

 (Longman) (12:22):  On indulgence, I congratulate the Minister for Trade and Investment on the work that he did in concluding the Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement. It is the first agreement that Japan has signed with a major economy and it is a significant achievement for our nation.


On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present the committee's report entitled Report 141: Treaties tabled on 19 March and 13 May 2014. 


Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).




WYATT ROY:
  by leave—Today I present the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties' Report 141, containing the committee's views on treaties tabled on 19 March and 13 May 2014.


This year we commemorate the 100th anniversary of the start of the First World War and the 70th anniversary of D-Day, both of which are significant events in our military relationship with the United Kingdom. It seems appropriate, therefore, that this year the committee should find itself supporting the proposed treaty between the government of Australia and the government of the Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for defence and security cooperation, a treaty that will support our robust military relationship into the future.


The treaty was negotiated with a common understanding between Australia and the United Kingdom that the current economic environment and emerging global security issues requires the close cooperation of like-minded states. 


Both States recognise that the benefits of a strong defence relationship over time are best served through a formal treaty. The proposed treaty will complement the existing agreements and annual ministerial consultations that constitute our defence relationship at present.


Cooperation occurs across a wide range of defence related issues, including science and technology, capability development, logistics, personnel exchanges and security of information.


The proposed treaty creates a greater solidity and touchstone for engagement between Australia and the United Kingdom by providing a legally binding framework through which to develop the relationship.


In summary, the proposed treaty will:


•   provide a single overarching legally-binding agreement;


•   provide strategic direction for our relationship into the future;


•   re-energise the bilateral cooperation between Australia and the United Kingdom on military capabilities and military equipment development;


•   enable interaction on materiel projects of common interest, particularly where military requirements align;


•   provide opportunities for collaborative procurement in the future; and


•   cement our bilateral defence relationship.


The committee has no hesitation in recommending that binding treaty action be taken in relation to this proposed treaty.


Report 141 also contains the committee's views on the Agreement Between the Government of Australia and the Government of the United States of America to Improve International Tax Compliance and Implement FATCA.


This agreement ensures Australian financial institutions are able to avoid paying a United States withholding tax of 30 per cent on their United States sourced profits, while meeting the requirements of the United States Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act at a significantly reduced compliance cost.


The committee previously tabled a short report, Report 140, recommending that binding treaty action be taken in relation to the agreement to ensure that the provisions of the agreement were in place by 1 July 2014.


Report 141 also contains statements relating to nine minor treaty actions.


On behalf of the committee, I commend the report to the House and move:


That the House take note of the report.

Mr MARLES
 (Corio) (12:49):  I move:


That the Migration Amendment (Repeal of Certain Visa Classes) Regulation 2014, dated 29 May 2014,  made under the Migration Act 1958 and presented to the House on 2 June 2014, be disallowed.


Australia's migration program has always reflected the values of a diverse multicultural society. We owe a great deal to our migration program in shaping the country we have become today. Equality, respect and understanding are all values which speak to modern Australia. Sadly, they are not the values that are upheld by this government. This government does not believe in respect. This government does not believe in equality. Through the Migration Amendment (Repeal of Certain Visa Classes) Regulation 2014, this government fails to value the contribution of our multicultural communities.


This decision by the Abbott government to axe the non-contributory and other family visa categories shows a reckless disregard for our multicultural communities and, quite clearly, exposes the twisted priorities of this cruel government. Visas that will go under this regulation if it is allowed to stand include the parent visa subclass 103, the aged parent visa subclass 804, the aged dependent relative visas subclasses 114 and 838, the remaining relative visas subclasses 115 and 835, and the carer visas subclasses 116 and 836.


The government made these changes under the cover of darkness. Although the changes appeared in the budget papers, it seems even the minister's department were in the dark when it came to the regulation's implementation. When asked during the Senate budget estimates on 27 May when these changes would take effect, the minister's department meekly answered that they were 'not sure'. Yet, miraculously, a mere week after these comments were made, the Migration Amendment (Repeal of Certain Visa Classes) Regulation was tabled in the House of Representatives, on 2 June. The minister tried to sneak through the repeal of these visa classes, which will hit low-and middle-income earners in multicultural communities and it will hit them hard.


This is a minister who has form when it comes to operating under a thick fog of secrecy. It clearly suits this minister's political objectives to keep the Australian people in the dark about his actions. When we see the cruel impact of a decision by the Abbott government such as this, we know why. It is time that this minister was up-front with the Australian community about his cuts to the visa program. There was no warning. There was no consultation. No-one knew that this was coming. In fact, it appears that even the minister himself is confused by the changes. When Labor asked the Prime Minister in question time on 24 June about why the government is abolishing the carer visa, the minister answered on his behalf:


… current claims for a number of family visas have been suspended until we can work through the backlog.


If these visa classes have only been suspended, why is this government seeking to repeal them by way of this regulation?


It is clear that this minister has no regard for anything outside the border protection part of his portfolio. He loves his slogans so much that he has now decided to turn his focus to 'stopping the parents'. Why does the minister so badly want to stop the parents? In his response to the same question, the minister repeatedly talked about a backlog of claims. While it is true that the popularity of the program led to increased waiting times, the minister's assertion that the government would 'start to work through the backlog of claims' is simply disingenuous. This is demonstrated by the government's own budget papers and was even confirmed during Senate estimates, when the department was asked about the migration program allocations for the 2014-15 financial year.


Like so many other parts of this minister's portfolio, it would seem that his command of the detail around this policy area is in a shambles as well. In fact, the government have reduced the allocation of non-contributory parent visas by 750 places. Likewise, the government have reduced the allocation for the other family category—which is also being abolished by this regulation—with 85 fewer places in the 2013-14 financial year. While these numbers may seem small to some, there is no doubt the reduction will have a severe impact on those who are affected by it.


Anyone who had been hoping to lodge an application for any of these visa classes will now be faced with the ultimate decision of either abandoning any hopes of being permanently reunited with loved ones or paying up to a reported $120,000. Apparently, the minister does not have a problem with this. In fact, he seems proud of the fact that he is deliberately hurting low- and middle-income earners. Why is this minister punishing families that have given so much to this country? Why is this minister punishing families that have worked so hard and given so much to build a life in Australia? Why is this government persisting with a mean-spirited attack on a program that allows families to be reunited with overseas relatives, often elderly parents?


Taking the axe to the non-contributory parent visa is a cruel and heartless attack on our ethnic communities. For tens of thousands of ethnic families spread across our country, including in my electorate of Corio, their hope of being reunited with family will be slammed shut unless they can afford to fork out more than $100,000. One of the main concerns those families that would be affected by this abolition of the parent visa have expressed to me is a feeling of genuine shock and despair as to why the Abbott government would close the door on any hope they have of a reunion with family members. For many in our ethnic communities, there is a strong culture and deep tradition in caring for the elderly. Taking in elderly relatives when they can no longer care for themselves is an ingrained cultural tradition that comes from a place of deep respect.


Under this government, there seems to be no room for these values of caring and compassion. This mean-spirited attack on our ethnic communities says volumes about the cruel and twisted priorities of this minister and the Abbott government. Why is this government turning its back on migrants who have given so much to Australia? Today, Labor puts on the record its absolute opposition to the Abbott government's assault on our ethnic communities. Today, Labor puts on record its absolute opposition to the Abbott government's mean-spirited attack on all those families that have worked so hard to make Australia the wonderful place it is today by cruelly denying them of the ability to share this country with their families.


When I asked the Prime Minister in question time on 24 June why his government was punishing low- and middle-income Australian families, the minister shamelessly responded:


… under our migration program we invite people into the country who are able to come and to pay their way.


The arrogance and the insensitivity from this minister and this government he represents is quite simply breathtaking.


I am sure there are members of the government who represent culturally and linguistically diverse electorates who are, indeed, fearful of the impact the repeal of these visas will have on their future tenure in this place. Labor is extending to you an opportunity to stand up for your electorates and show that you will not allow this minister to summarily dismiss the needs of your communities.


The parent (subclass 103) visa is a permanent visa for people who have children who are Australian citizens, permanent residents or eligible New Zealand citizens who have settled in Australia. This visa requires a sponsor, usually a child or spouse. They must have lived here lawfully for at least two years before the application is made. Applicants have to meet the balance-of-family test, and an assurance of support is also required. Despite the waiting periods, demand in the non-contributory parent category actually increased by more than 50 per cent between 2011-2012 and 2012-2013. People understand they have to wait longer if they pay less. But waiting times ought not to be the indication of the success of a program. It is certainly no answer to simply abolish programs either.


Let history show today as the day this government, on a mean-spirited crusade led by the Prime Minister and this minister, abandoned our ethnic families and communities. Let history show today as the day this government cut ethnic communities loose. Any hope of a family reunion is now out of reach for all but those with the means to pay more than $100,000. This is a breathtaking betrayal from those opposite. Cast aside all the chest beating, bluff and bluster and what you are left with is a cruel and heartless government that has today callously closed the door on family visas and, in doing so, slammed the door shut on many families ever being able to look after their loved ones in this country. Today Labor stands for all ethnic families around Australia. Today those opposite have betrayed them, and that is a disgrace.

"Rowland, Michelle, MP",ALP,2014-07-15,"



Ms ROWLAND
 (Greenway) (13:02):  I second the motion. I support this disallowance motion on the Migration Amendment (Repeal of Certain Visa Classes) Regulation 2014 and I congratulate the member for Corio for bringing it to the attention of the House. This disallowance motion has strong community support. I will take just a cursory look at one of the petitions in our community and quote from it. This is from Change.org. It says:


I have been waiting to finish my studies and get a job so that I can bring my parents to look after them. Just as soon as I was completing my studies, they announce that the visa options are abolished! This is a disaster for me as my whole life plan depended on it. I had much faith in Australia and gave up everything I had to follow this dream. This situation has left me helpless.


This mean and tricky decision by the Abbott government to axe the non-contributory parent visa and other family visa categories—including the aged dependent relative, remaining relative and carer visa categories—is an absolute disgrace. It is now incumbent on those opposite to show where they stand on this. They cannot hide on it now. The minister tried to sneak this through by legislative instrument, but now members opposite have to show their hand. It was a sneaky move.


I quote from Senate estimates on Tuesday, 27 May. The question was asked by Senator Singh of the departmental representative: 'When will these changes take effect?' The answer was, 'I am not sure. That is a matter being sorted out.' These regulations to repeal certain visa classes are dated 29 May, so two days later they had been determined.


Those members of the government who represent culturally and linguistically diverse electorates, including the member for Reid, the member for Banks and the Member for Barton, just to name a few, now have the opportunity to stand up for their communities and support this disallowance motion. Anything less will be a complete and utter betrayal of their communities. These are new members opposite who directly appealed to migrant communities in the lead-up to the 2013 election. I cannot recall them or any other Liberal candidate ever telling their prospective constituents that they would be shutting the door on the non-contributory visa scheme.


The non-contributory parent visa allows a sponsor to apply for their parent to come to Australia. The sponsor is required to have lived in Australia lawfully for two years and must be able to supply a small bond to be refunded after the parent has lived in Australia for two years. This visa category allowed some 2,150 people to be reunited with their immediate family in 2012-13. At very low cost, it gives hardworking migrants the hope and opportunity for their parents to one day join them in Australia.


There can be up to a 13-year wait for this visa to be granted. However, for many low- and middle-income families it is the only way to have their parents join them in Australia. It opens a pathway for these people. Without this visa category the only other option for migrants' parents to come to Australia is through the contributory visa category. The contributory parent visa category can reportedly cost up to $120,000. I can guarantee that the vast majority of people who would be applying for the non-contributory category would not have a spare $120,000 lying around. The government is completely out of touch if they expect these people to pay for this alternative. These sponsors are hardworking people who are already paying their bills and taxes. I know for a fact that many of my constituents whose parents who could have benefited from this visa category will no longer be able to apply for visas for their parents because of this absurd cost. It reflects the unfair nature of this budget.


The benefits of the non-contributory category cannot be discounted by this government. It has already been so beneficial to working and middle-class migrants, including those in my own community. But it is quite clear that this minister and this government do not understand how important these visa categories are for many newly arrived Australians. Indeed, the minister's own performance during question time, as demonstrated by the member for Corio, shows that even he does not appear to understand this decision. In response to a question from the shadow immigration minister on this issue on 24 June, the minister said:


… we have reduced the number of places for the non-contributing scheme. … It has not gone to zero, at all …


This is completely wrong. The minister is either deliberately attempting to hoodwink the public or he is not across his own portfolio.


You even see the minister release an explanatory note that clearly outlines the visa categories that have been savaged:


The effect of these amendments is that persons are no longer able to apply for these visa classes from 2 June 2014.


That certainly sounds like zero to me. This government is betraying ethnic communities through this move, and it is another betrayal to add to their long list since September last year.


It is my strong concern that these measures by the government could be in breach of certain human rights, including the right to protection of the family. This is guaranteed by articles 17 and 23 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and article 10 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Under these articles, the family is recognised as the natural and fundamental group unit of society and, as such, is entitled to protection.


And I ask the minister this. How is this compatible with our human rights obligations, specifically regarding the right to protection of the family? The opposition, the community and I are appalled at the process that went into producing this amendment. There was very limited community consultation. In fact, most people did not know at all. Those most affected have met this with shock and anger. This government should have made it a primary concern to understand why this category is so important to communities throughout Australia.


One of my constituents, Mandeep Bhatti contacted me regarding this decision. He is one of many impacted in my community. He said:


This all started when the coalition government announced on 13 May 2014 in its budget that new applications for Other Family and Parent (non-contributory) visa categories will be ceased. This announcement was followed by the Department of Immigration and Border Protection (DIBP) announcing that the cessation date would be announced shortly.


However suddenly and to most people's complete and utter disbelief, without any further announcement, the Minister for Immigration made the migration amendment on 29 May 2014 which repealed the visa subclasses from June 2nd, 2014, The last day to make a valid application was 30th of May, which effectively gave applicants less than 10 hours to lodge a valid application.


He went on to say:


I think this constitutes as clear abuse of power. When the decision was made on 29 May, why was this not made public by the Department of Immigration on the same day or a day in advance, which would have given a fair go to everyone who had their applications ready and could send applications on time. Making decisions and hiding it from public until the day when the regulation was effective dearly shows the government abused their power.


I personally feel cheated and don't understand the logic of this cancellation in the first place; parents who come on the non-contributory categories are people who have families to care for and provide for them, they don't get or even expect to live on benefits, they are harmless people who just want to join their families.


This is an utter disgrace from a government so out of touch. For the backbenchers opposite there is no flying under the radar now. Your minister cannot save you from voting on this issue. There is no sneaky and underhanded way to get around this any more. All those opposite will get a chance to vote on this issue today and they should know that they will be held accountable in their local communities on how they vote on this disallowance. Their communities will not forget.


I close by quoting from Mary Crock and Kate Bones, who wrote, very validly, in The Sydney Morning Herald under the heading 'Coalition's new visa laws make family reunion a preserve of the rich'. Among other things, they note:


The Immigration Department’s policy manual stated that these visas reflected 'immigration principles relating to reunion of relatives in recognition of kinship ties and the bonds of mutual dependency and support within families'.


This disallowance is about this principle. Is parliament now going to vote against this principle, which we have held so dear for so long in Australia?


I will point out again the very valid issue I mentioned: the immense economic and social benefits in family reunion. Again I quote from the preceding article in The Sydney Morning Herald:


Parents and grandparents can provide childcare, allowing sponsors to go from being one-income to two-income households. They give physical and emotional support. Remittances that would otherwise be sent overseas stay and are spent in Australia. Carers bring huge savings, taking pressure off the welfare and healthcare systems.


I know for a fact that just in my own community, in Blacktown, where the most popular surname is Singh, older migrants shop locally, buy services, contribute to child care, and pick up the kids from school. It is a false economy to suggest that these people are not producing savings and are not contributing to Australian society. This is exactly the kind of Australia we want—one where everyone is contributing. That is why this disallowance is so important here today.

"Morrison, Scott, MP",LP,2014-07-15,"



Mr MORRISON
 (Cook—Minister for Immigration and Border Protection) (13:12):  I note the opposition's motion and I note that they have sought to bring much politics to this debate, but they have failed to grasp the reality of the very program they left to the government that succeeded them after the last election. As was flagged in the budget, there was a very clear statement about the policy the government introduced, on 13 May, under which new applications under eight family-stream visa subclasses have ceased. That was the announcement in the budget, and the government then took action to implement the announcement that was in the budget. That is the way these matters are handled every single year when a migration program is announced and is given effect to subsequent to the budget.


What has occurred is that applications have ceased as a result of this regulation, but places under these programs continue to be provided, which is something the opposition refuses to acknowledge. All applications made prior to the change continue to be queued and processed in accordance with existing legislation and policy. The government recognises that these changes will be disappointing to many people, but we are committed to a migration program that meets the needs of modern Australia and that can respond to the applications that are provided. These changes will ensure family migration is focused on the entry of close family member—of parents, of partners, of children.


The repealed visa program simply had become unsustainable, just like the budget. Those opposite seem to take no responsibility for the mess they have left behind, with applications significantly outstripping available places, creating extremely long queues. There are currently over 36,000 applications on hand in the non-contributory parent visa category, and that equates to a waiting list period of 13 years. In the other family category there are 7,600 applications on hand, which equates to around a four-year wait for carers and a 16-year wait in the case of aged dependent relatives and remaining relatives. 


The ceased visa classes were ultimately unsustainable and, indeed, given the queues that had developed, it would be inappropriate to accept further applications and give people the false expectation that visas could be granted soon. What those opposite are suggesting is that we should continue to take applications for which people on the parent and aged parent non-contributory visas will pay $4,435 and $5,585, and they will get no result. They will pay that money with an expectation that their visa will be able to be processed and granted, and they will be waiting 13 years. I think that is dishonest—to go and tell people that they have a pathway when the pathway has a waiting time that will see their application either lapse or be unable to be fulfilled. If we are going to create programs and if we are going to run programs then the people who apply for them and who pay thousands of dollars to lodge their application should be able to have an expectation that their visa will be assessed and processed and, if they meet the requirements of the scheme, that they will gain a place. That is simply no longer possible under the way that these schemes have blown out over recent years. It is my sincere hope that I will be in a position to reinstate applications in these places, but once we have been able to get the backlog under control. 


The 835 places that have been reduced in the parent and other family program have been increased, I stress, in the partner program, where there are an additional 300 places for partners who are also waiting for visas—partners of those who are seeking those visas; 35 extra children visas; and 500 for the contributory parent scheme. Under the previous government the contributory parent scheme was slashed and the non-contributory parent scheme was increased. This government has restored the arrangement that was in place previously, under the former government. And 1,500 non-contributory parent visas will be provided this year. There will be 500 visas provided for carers and remaining relatives and aged dependent relatives. Those visas will be provided this year. So to suggest that the number of these places is reduced to zero shows a complete lack of understanding by those opposite about how the program works. 


We need to work through the backlog of cases to ensure that, for those who have already paid their money, who are already counting on a pathway and have a reasonable expectation that will be considered, we can move through that. But, if you keep adding to the list, then working through the caseload of those cases that are already in the queue becomes more difficult. The implication of what the opposition is putting forward is to make those who have already made those applications, who are already waiting, wait even longer. That would be the consequence. 


Once we have been able to work through the backlog in the caseload, I would give priority first to ensuring we can get an increase in the number of carer places that are going into this program and to ensure that that is done. But we currently have a four-year wait on those carer visas. I want to see that cut significantly. I want to be able to ensure that we can recommence the carer program with suitable places to make sure that, when people make an application for a carer visa—and I stress that that visa application costs them $3,515—and pay that money to have a carer come under the program, then they have a reasonable expectation that will be handled expeditiously and that there will be a result to their application.


Parents will still be able to migrate to Australia under the contributory parent visa program, and we support the contributory parent scheme. Those who have worked their entire life in this country and have entitlements to benefits as a result of their living and working and paying taxes their whole life in this country can enjoy those benefits. Under the non-contributory parent scheme, people access those benefits more or less immediately. It is our view that, if we are going to have a balance in these programs, then we have put the balance towards the contributory parent scheme, which enables those who are coming to be reunited with family to be able to make a contribution to the support and entitlements they would receive when coming to Australia. 


Those opposite disagree with that position, and they are entitled to do that. When they were in government they reversed this. They cut the numbers of places for contributory parents, which has a much-reduced waiting list time of 12 months to two years, and they decided to decrease those places and increase the places for the non-contributory parents, which places a cost on the taxpayer. 


The overall saving to the budget from what has been done in this year's migration program is $31 million, a saving that was necessary to address the budget mess that was left to us by the previous government. What these initiatives do is address the budget mess and also the immigration mess not just on our borders with people smuggling but in the administration of these programs, which has seen these caseloads and queues grew longer and longer and longer.


It is important that we run a program that is fair, that we run a program that is affordable and that we run a program that is efficient, and it is important that people can have a reasonable expectation that they will be able to make an application and actually get an answer. What those opposite are doing is holding out a false hope, a false promise. They are going out into all of the electorates and saying: 'You can make your application, but don't even think about actually getting an answer to it. Hand over your $5,000. We'll take your money. But don't expect to see a parent visa any time soon within the next 13 years.' That is the inconvenient truth that those opposite will not confront. They are going to ask for people's money and then not give them an answer for 13 years. I just think that is dishonest, and I was not prepared to allow that process to continue. I think we need to get on top of the backlog. 


We will continue to provide the places year in, year out for all the categories of visas for which applications have now ceased. We will continue to provide those places and we will continue to work through the long queue, which is up to 16 years in some of these visa class cases. We will continue to ensure that we can get the program back on track. But, if the opposition wants to simply whip up fear and play politics and play what is effectively a race card on this issue, then I think that is very disappointing.


We saw it last year when they were in government on the issue of 457 visas. They attacked the 457 program and they refused to acknowledge the incredible contribution made by 457 skilled migrants, particularly by those who go on to become permanent residents. The greatest number, in terms of the growth of that program, are in the Indian population, who the member for Greenway pretends to suggest she has some empathy for. She was not supporting them when it came to 457s last year. She was happy for the previous government to slag and bag the 457 program and skilled migrants then and now she pretends to be in favour of migrants. She is a fraud.

Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (13:22):  I rise to support the motion to disallow the Migration Amendment (Repeal of Certain Visa Classes) Regulation 2014. The other family category of visa has now been cut by the Abbott government. This category included carer visas for people who need a family member as a carer and who have demonstrated that they cannot access sufficient care in Australia, sole remaining relative visas for someone with no family anywhere in the world but in Australia and aged dependent relative visas, which are for elderly non-parents overseas who are dependent on sponsors in Australia. Parent visas have also been cut, so now the only parent option is for people who can pay $50,000 per parent or $100,000 for two parents, which are the contributory parent visas.


My office has worked with many Melbourne constituents who under these cuts would remain separated from family members. We have spoken with constituents who now will not be able to sponsor family members who are in very difficult circumstances overseas to come to Australia. We have advocated for other constituents who are facing long, long waits to be reunited with loved ones. This comes on the back of actions by the previous government, where the Labor government cut the number of other family visas in 2013-14 from 1,285 to 585. Because of these cuts, already long waiting times got even longer. Carer visas for people to care for Australians in high need went from two years to three years to around five years and sole remaining relative visas and aged dependent relative visas went up to over 15 years.


One thing that the minister did not say in his contribution is that the government says it is still processing applications, but it has cut the number it is processing per year from 585 to 500. It may be that the already long waiting queues take even longer. Ultimately, it is very clear that for people who are here it is much better for them, it is much better for those close to them and it is much better for the Australian community if they are able to have their carers and families here. That is why the Greens will continue to advocate for an expansion of the numbers that are being processed in these categories and for them to be processed much more quickly, so that the waiting times that we have seen under previous governments and under this one are shortened.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(

"Marles, Richard, MP",ALP,2014-07-15,"



Mr MARLES
 (Corio) (12:49):  I move:


That the Migration Amendment (Repeal of Certain Visa Classes) Regulation 2014, dated 29 May 2014,  made under the Migration Act 1958 and presented to the House on 2 June 2014, be disallowed.


Australia's migration program has always reflected the values of a diverse multicultural society. We owe a great deal to our migration program in shaping the country we have become today. Equality, respect and understanding are all values which speak to modern Australia. Sadly, they are not the values that are upheld by this government. This government does not believe in respect. This government does not believe in equality. Through the Migration Amendment (Repeal of Certain Visa Classes) Regulation 2014, this government fails to value the contribution of our multicultural communities.


This decision by the Abbott government to axe the non-contributory and other family visa categories shows a reckless disregard for our multicultural communities and, quite clearly, exposes the twisted priorities of this cruel government. Visas that will go under this regulation if it is allowed to stand include the parent visa subclass 103, the aged parent visa subclass 804, the aged dependent relative visas subclasses 114 and 838, the remaining relative visas subclasses 115 and 835, and the carer visas subclasses 116 and 836.


The government made these changes under the cover of darkness. Although the changes appeared in the budget papers, it seems even the minister's department were in the dark when it came to the regulation's implementation. When asked during the Senate budget estimates on 27 May when these changes would take effect, the minister's department meekly answered that they were 'not sure'. Yet, miraculously, a mere week after these comments were made, the Migration Amendment (Repeal of Certain Visa Classes) Regulation was tabled in the House of Representatives, on 2 June. The minister tried to sneak through the repeal of these visa classes, which will hit low-and middle-income earners in multicultural communities and it will hit them hard.


This is a minister who has form when it comes to operating under a thick fog of secrecy. It clearly suits this minister's political objectives to keep the Australian people in the dark about his actions. When we see the cruel impact of a decision by the Abbott government such as this, we know why. It is time that this minister was up-front with the Australian community about his cuts to the visa program. There was no warning. There was no consultation. No-one knew that this was coming. In fact, it appears that even the minister himself is confused by the changes. When Labor asked the Prime Minister in question time on 24 June about why the government is abolishing the carer visa, the minister answered on his behalf:


… current claims for a number of family visas have been suspended until we can work through the backlog.


If these visa classes have only been suspended, why is this government seeking to repeal them by way of this regulation?


It is clear that this minister has no regard for anything outside the border protection part of his portfolio. He loves his slogans so much that he has now decided to turn his focus to 'stopping the parents'. Why does the minister so badly want to stop the parents? In his response to the same question, the minister repeatedly talked about a backlog of claims. While it is true that the popularity of the program led to increased waiting times, the minister's assertion that the government would 'start to work through the backlog of claims' is simply disingenuous. This is demonstrated by the government's own budget papers and was even confirmed during Senate estimates, when the department was asked about the migration program allocations for the 2014-15 financial year.


Like so many other parts of this minister's portfolio, it would seem that his command of the detail around this policy area is in a shambles as well. In fact, the government have reduced the allocation of non-contributory parent visas by 750 places. Likewise, the government have reduced the allocation for the other family category—which is also being abolished by this regulation—with 85 fewer places in the 2013-14 financial year. While these numbers may seem small to some, there is no doubt the reduction will have a severe impact on those who are affected by it.


Anyone who had been hoping to lodge an application for any of these visa classes will now be faced with the ultimate decision of either abandoning any hopes of being permanently reunited with loved ones or paying up to a reported $120,000. Apparently, the minister does not have a problem with this. In fact, he seems proud of the fact that he is deliberately hurting low- and middle-income earners. Why is this minister punishing families that have given so much to this country? Why is this minister punishing families that have worked so hard and given so much to build a life in Australia? Why is this government persisting with a mean-spirited attack on a program that allows families to be reunited with overseas relatives, often elderly parents?


Taking the axe to the non-contributory parent visa is a cruel and heartless attack on our ethnic communities. For tens of thousands of ethnic families spread across our country, including in my electorate of Corio, their hope of being reunited with family will be slammed shut unless they can afford to fork out more than $100,000. One of the main concerns those families that would be affected by this abolition of the parent visa have expressed to me is a feeling of genuine shock and despair as to why the Abbott government would close the door on any hope they have of a reunion with family members. For many in our ethnic communities, there is a strong culture and deep tradition in caring for the elderly. Taking in elderly relatives when they can no longer care for themselves is an ingrained cultural tradition that comes from a place of deep respect.


Under this government, there seems to be no room for these values of caring and compassion. This mean-spirited attack on our ethnic communities says volumes about the cruel and twisted priorities of this minister and the Abbott government. Why is this government turning its back on migrants who have given so much to Australia? Today, Labor puts on the record its absolute opposition to the Abbott government's assault on our ethnic communities. Today, Labor puts on record its absolute opposition to the Abbott government's mean-spirited attack on all those families that have worked so hard to make Australia the wonderful place it is today by cruelly denying them of the ability to share this country with their families.


When I asked the Prime Minister in question time on 24 June why his government was punishing low- and middle-income Australian families, the minister shamelessly responded:


… under our migration program we invite people into the country who are able to come and to pay their way.


The arrogance and the insensitivity from this minister and this government he represents is quite simply breathtaking.


I am sure there are members of the government who represent culturally and linguistically diverse electorates who are, indeed, fearful of the impact the repeal of these visas will have on their future tenure in this place. Labor is extending to you an opportunity to stand up for your electorates and show that you will not allow this minister to summarily dismiss the needs of your communities.


The parent (subclass 103) visa is a permanent visa for people who have children who are Australian citizens, permanent residents or eligible New Zealand citizens who have settled in Australia. This visa requires a sponsor, usually a child or spouse. They must have lived here lawfully for at least two years before the application is made. Applicants have to meet the balance-of-family test, and an assurance of support is also required. Despite the waiting periods, demand in the non-contributory parent category actually increased by more than 50 per cent between 2011-2012 and 2012-2013. People understand they have to wait longer if they pay less. But waiting times ought not to be the indication of the success of a program. It is certainly no answer to simply abolish programs either.


Let history show today as the day this government, on a mean-spirited crusade led by the Prime Minister and this minister, abandoned our ethnic families and communities. Let history show today as the day this government cut ethnic communities loose. Any hope of a family reunion is now out of reach for all but those with the means to pay more than $100,000. This is a breathtaking betrayal from those opposite. Cast aside all the chest beating, bluff and bluster and what you are left with is a cruel and heartless government that has today callously closed the door on family visas and, in doing so, slammed the door shut on many families ever being able to look after their loved ones in this country. Today Labor stands for all ethnic families around Australia. Today those opposite have betrayed them, and that is a disgrace.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER

Mr Mitchell
):  Is the motion for disallowance seconded?

",HoR,<title>MOTIONS</title>,<title>Disallowance</title>,MOTIONS,4,2,speech
"Rowland, Michelle, MP",ALP,2014-07-15,"



Ms ROWLAND
 (Greenway) (13:02):  I second the motion. I support this disallowance motion on the Migration Amendment (Repeal of Certain Visa Classes) Regulation 2014 and I congratulate the member for Corio for bringing it to the attention of the House. This disallowance motion has strong community support. I will take just a cursory look at one of the petitions in our community and quote from it. This is from Change.org. It says:


I have been waiting to finish my studies and get a job so that I can bring my parents to look after them. Just as soon as I was completing my studies, they announce that the visa options are abolished! This is a disaster for me as my whole life plan depended on it. I had much faith in Australia and gave up everything I had to follow this dream. This situation has left me helpless.


This mean and tricky decision by the Abbott government to axe the non-contributory parent visa and other family visa categories—including the aged dependent relative, remaining relative and carer visa categories—is an absolute disgrace. It is now incumbent on those opposite to show where they stand on this. They cannot hide on it now. The minister tried to sneak this through by legislative instrument, but now members opposite have to show their hand. It was a sneaky move.


I quote from Senate estimates on Tuesday, 27 May. The question was asked by Senator Singh of the departmental representative: 'When will these changes take effect?' The answer was, 'I am not sure. That is a matter being sorted out.' These regulations to repeal certain visa classes are dated 29 May, so two days later they had been determined.


Those members of the government who represent culturally and linguistically diverse electorates, including the member for Reid, the member for Banks and the Member for Barton, just to name a few, now have the opportunity to stand up for their communities and support this disallowance motion. Anything less will be a complete and utter betrayal of their communities. These are new members opposite who directly appealed to migrant communities in the lead-up to the 2013 election. I cannot recall them or any other Liberal candidate ever telling their prospective constituents that they would be shutting the door on the non-contributory visa scheme.


The non-contributory parent visa allows a sponsor to apply for their parent to come to Australia. The sponsor is required to have lived in Australia lawfully for two years and must be able to supply a small bond to be refunded after the parent has lived in Australia for two years. This visa category allowed some 2,150 people to be reunited with their immediate family in 2012-13. At very low cost, it gives hardworking migrants the hope and opportunity for their parents to one day join them in Australia.


There can be up to a 13-year wait for this visa to be granted. However, for many low- and middle-income families it is the only way to have their parents join them in Australia. It opens a pathway for these people. Without this visa category the only other option for migrants' parents to come to Australia is through the contributory visa category. The contributory parent visa category can reportedly cost up to $120,000. I can guarantee that the vast majority of people who would be applying for the non-contributory category would not have a spare $120,000 lying around. The government is completely out of touch if they expect these people to pay for this alternative. These sponsors are hardworking people who are already paying their bills and taxes. I know for a fact that many of my constituents whose parents who could have benefited from this visa category will no longer be able to apply for visas for their parents because of this absurd cost. It reflects the unfair nature of this budget.


The benefits of the non-contributory category cannot be discounted by this government. It has already been so beneficial to working and middle-class migrants, including those in my own community. But it is quite clear that this minister and this government do not understand how important these visa categories are for many newly arrived Australians. Indeed, the minister's own performance during question time, as demonstrated by the member for Corio, shows that even he does not appear to understand this decision. In response to a question from the shadow immigration minister on this issue on 24 June, the minister said:


… we have reduced the number of places for the non-contributing scheme. … It has not gone to zero, at all …


This is completely wrong. The minister is either deliberately attempting to hoodwink the public or he is not across his own portfolio.


You even see the minister release an explanatory note that clearly outlines the visa categories that have been savaged:


The effect of these amendments is that persons are no longer able to apply for these visa classes from 2 June 2014.


That certainly sounds like zero to me. This government is betraying ethnic communities through this move, and it is another betrayal to add to their long list since September last year.


It is my strong concern that these measures by the government could be in breach of certain human rights, including the right to protection of the family. This is guaranteed by articles 17 and 23 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and article 10 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Under these articles, the family is recognised as the natural and fundamental group unit of society and, as such, is entitled to protection.


And I ask the minister this. How is this compatible with our human rights obligations, specifically regarding the right to protection of the family? The opposition, the community and I are appalled at the process that went into producing this amendment. There was very limited community consultation. In fact, most people did not know at all. Those most affected have met this with shock and anger. This government should have made it a primary concern to understand why this category is so important to communities throughout Australia.


One of my constituents, Mandeep Bhatti contacted me regarding this decision. He is one of many impacted in my community. He said:


This all started when the coalition government announced on 13 May 2014 in its budget that new applications for Other Family and Parent (non-contributory) visa categories will be ceased. This announcement was followed by the Department of Immigration and Border Protection (DIBP) announcing that the cessation date would be announced shortly.


However suddenly and to most people's complete and utter disbelief, without any further announcement, the Minister for Immigration made the migration amendment on 29 May 2014 which repealed the visa subclasses from June 2nd, 2014, The last day to make a valid application was 30th of May, which effectively gave applicants less than 10 hours to lodge a valid application.


He went on to say:


I think this constitutes as clear abuse of power. When the decision was made on 29 May, why was this not made public by the Department of Immigration on the same day or a day in advance, which would have given a fair go to everyone who had their applications ready and could send applications on time. Making decisions and hiding it from public until the day when the regulation was effective dearly shows the government abused their power.


I personally feel cheated and don't understand the logic of this cancellation in the first place; parents who come on the non-contributory categories are people who have families to care for and provide for them, they don't get or even expect to live on benefits, they are harmless people who just want to join their families.


This is an utter disgrace from a government so out of touch. For the backbenchers opposite there is no flying under the radar now. Your minister cannot save you from voting on this issue. There is no sneaky and underhanded way to get around this any more. All those opposite will get a chance to vote on this issue today and they should know that they will be held accountable in their local communities on how they vote on this disallowance. Their communities will not forget.


I close by quoting from Mary Crock and Kate Bones, who wrote, very validly, in The Sydney Morning Herald under the heading 'Coalition's new visa laws make family reunion a preserve of the rich'. Among other things, they note:


The Immigration Department’s policy manual stated that these visas reflected 'immigration principles relating to reunion of relatives in recognition of kinship ties and the bonds of mutual dependency and support within families'.


This disallowance is about this principle. Is parliament now going to vote against this principle, which we have held so dear for so long in Australia?


I will point out again the very valid issue I mentioned: the immense economic and social benefits in family reunion. Again I quote from the preceding article in The Sydney Morning Herald:


Parents and grandparents can provide childcare, allowing sponsors to go from being one-income to two-income households. They give physical and emotional support. Remittances that would otherwise be sent overseas stay and are spent in Australia. Carers bring huge savings, taking pressure off the welfare and healthcare systems.


I know for a fact that just in my own community, in Blacktown, where the most popular surname is Singh, older migrants shop locally, buy services, contribute to child care, and pick up the kids from school. It is a false economy to suggest that these people are not producing savings and are not contributing to Australian society. This is exactly the kind of Australia we want—one where everyone is contributing. That is why this disallowance is so important here today.

"Morrison, Scott, MP",LP,2014-07-15,"



Mr MORRISON
 (Cook—Minister for Immigration and Border Protection) (13:12):  I note the opposition's motion and I note that they have sought to bring much politics to this debate, but they have failed to grasp the reality of the very program they left to the government that succeeded them after the last election. As was flagged in the budget, there was a very clear statement about the policy the government introduced, on 13 May, under which new applications under eight family-stream visa subclasses have ceased. That was the announcement in the budget, and the government then took action to implement the announcement that was in the budget. That is the way these matters are handled every single year when a migration program is announced and is given effect to subsequent to the budget.


What has occurred is that applications have ceased as a result of this regulation, but places under these programs continue to be provided, which is something the opposition refuses to acknowledge. All applications made prior to the change continue to be queued and processed in accordance with existing legislation and policy. The government recognises that these changes will be disappointing to many people, but we are committed to a migration program that meets the needs of modern Australia and that can respond to the applications that are provided. These changes will ensure family migration is focused on the entry of close family member—of parents, of partners, of children.


The repealed visa program simply had become unsustainable, just like the budget. Those opposite seem to take no responsibility for the mess they have left behind, with applications significantly outstripping available places, creating extremely long queues. There are currently over 36,000 applications on hand in the non-contributory parent visa category, and that equates to a waiting list period of 13 years. In the other family category there are 7,600 applications on hand, which equates to around a four-year wait for carers and a 16-year wait in the case of aged dependent relatives and remaining relatives. 


The ceased visa classes were ultimately unsustainable and, indeed, given the queues that had developed, it would be inappropriate to accept further applications and give people the false expectation that visas could be granted soon. What those opposite are suggesting is that we should continue to take applications for which people on the parent and aged parent non-contributory visas will pay $4,435 and $5,585, and they will get no result. They will pay that money with an expectation that their visa will be able to be processed and granted, and they will be waiting 13 years. I think that is dishonest—to go and tell people that they have a pathway when the pathway has a waiting time that will see their application either lapse or be unable to be fulfilled. If we are going to create programs and if we are going to run programs then the people who apply for them and who pay thousands of dollars to lodge their application should be able to have an expectation that their visa will be assessed and processed and, if they meet the requirements of the scheme, that they will gain a place. That is simply no longer possible under the way that these schemes have blown out over recent years. It is my sincere hope that I will be in a position to reinstate applications in these places, but once we have been able to get the backlog under control. 


The 835 places that have been reduced in the parent and other family program have been increased, I stress, in the partner program, where there are an additional 300 places for partners who are also waiting for visas—partners of those who are seeking those visas; 35 extra children visas; and 500 for the contributory parent scheme. Under the previous government the contributory parent scheme was slashed and the non-contributory parent scheme was increased. This government has restored the arrangement that was in place previously, under the former government. And 1,500 non-contributory parent visas will be provided this year. There will be 500 visas provided for carers and remaining relatives and aged dependent relatives. Those visas will be provided this year. So to suggest that the number of these places is reduced to zero shows a complete lack of understanding by those opposite about how the program works. 


We need to work through the backlog of cases to ensure that, for those who have already paid their money, who are already counting on a pathway and have a reasonable expectation that will be considered, we can move through that. But, if you keep adding to the list, then working through the caseload of those cases that are already in the queue becomes more difficult. The implication of what the opposition is putting forward is to make those who have already made those applications, who are already waiting, wait even longer. That would be the consequence. 


Once we have been able to work through the backlog in the caseload, I would give priority first to ensuring we can get an increase in the number of carer places that are going into this program and to ensure that that is done. But we currently have a four-year wait on those carer visas. I want to see that cut significantly. I want to be able to ensure that we can recommence the carer program with suitable places to make sure that, when people make an application for a carer visa—and I stress that that visa application costs them $3,515—and pay that money to have a carer come under the program, then they have a reasonable expectation that will be handled expeditiously and that there will be a result to their application.


Parents will still be able to migrate to Australia under the contributory parent visa program, and we support the contributory parent scheme. Those who have worked their entire life in this country and have entitlements to benefits as a result of their living and working and paying taxes their whole life in this country can enjoy those benefits. Under the non-contributory parent scheme, people access those benefits more or less immediately. It is our view that, if we are going to have a balance in these programs, then we have put the balance towards the contributory parent scheme, which enables those who are coming to be reunited with family to be able to make a contribution to the support and entitlements they would receive when coming to Australia. 


Those opposite disagree with that position, and they are entitled to do that. When they were in government they reversed this. They cut the numbers of places for contributory parents, which has a much-reduced waiting list time of 12 months to two years, and they decided to decrease those places and increase the places for the non-contributory parents, which places a cost on the taxpayer. 


The overall saving to the budget from what has been done in this year's migration program is $31 million, a saving that was necessary to address the budget mess that was left to us by the previous government. What these initiatives do is address the budget mess and also the immigration mess not just on our borders with people smuggling but in the administration of these programs, which has seen these caseloads and queues grew longer and longer and longer.


It is important that we run a program that is fair, that we run a program that is affordable and that we run a program that is efficient, and it is important that people can have a reasonable expectation that they will be able to make an application and actually get an answer. What those opposite are doing is holding out a false hope, a false promise. They are going out into all of the electorates and saying: 'You can make your application, but don't even think about actually getting an answer to it. Hand over your $5,000. We'll take your money. But don't expect to see a parent visa any time soon within the next 13 years.' That is the inconvenient truth that those opposite will not confront. They are going to ask for people's money and then not give them an answer for 13 years. I just think that is dishonest, and I was not prepared to allow that process to continue. I think we need to get on top of the backlog. 


We will continue to provide the places year in, year out for all the categories of visas for which applications have now ceased. We will continue to provide those places and we will continue to work through the long queue, which is up to 16 years in some of these visa class cases. We will continue to ensure that we can get the program back on track. But, if the opposition wants to simply whip up fear and play politics and play what is effectively a race card on this issue, then I think that is very disappointing.


We saw it last year when they were in government on the issue of 457 visas. They attacked the 457 program and they refused to acknowledge the incredible contribution made by 457 skilled migrants, particularly by those who go on to become permanent residents. The greatest number, in terms of the growth of that program, are in the Indian population, who the member for Greenway pretends to suggest she has some empathy for. She was not supporting them when it came to 457s last year. She was happy for the previous government to slag and bag the 457 program and skilled migrants then and now she pretends to be in favour of migrants. She is a fraud.

Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (13:22):  I rise to support the motion to disallow the Migration Amendment (Repeal of Certain Visa Classes) Regulation 2014. The other family category of visa has now been cut by the Abbott government. This category included carer visas for people who need a family member as a carer and who have demonstrated that they cannot access sufficient care in Australia, sole remaining relative visas for someone with no family anywhere in the world but in Australia and aged dependent relative visas, which are for elderly non-parents overseas who are dependent on sponsors in Australia. Parent visas have also been cut, so now the only parent option is for people who can pay $50,000 per parent or $100,000 for two parents, which are the contributory parent visas.


My office has worked with many Melbourne constituents who under these cuts would remain separated from family members. We have spoken with constituents who now will not be able to sponsor family members who are in very difficult circumstances overseas to come to Australia. We have advocated for other constituents who are facing long, long waits to be reunited with loved ones. This comes on the back of actions by the previous government, where the Labor government cut the number of other family visas in 2013-14 from 1,285 to 585. Because of these cuts, already long waiting times got even longer. Carer visas for people to care for Australians in high need went from two years to three years to around five years and sole remaining relative visas and aged dependent relative visas went up to over 15 years.


One thing that the minister did not say in his contribution is that the government says it is still processing applications, but it has cut the number it is processing per year from 585 to 500. It may be that the already long waiting queues take even longer. Ultimately, it is very clear that for people who are here it is much better for them, it is much better for those close to them and it is much better for the Australian community if they are able to have their carers and families here. That is why the Greens will continue to advocate for an expansion of the numbers that are being processed in these categories and for them to be processed much more quickly, so that the waiting times that we have seen under previous governments and under this one are shortened.

Ms RYAN
 (Lalor—Opposition Whip) (13:25):  I have deep concerns about the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2014. I saw the negative impact of Work Choices and celebrated the introduction of the Fair Work legislation by Labor. Since September last year, this government has broken many promises, election commitments have been tossed aside, and taxes and cost-cutting measures that were never dreamed of have been introduced. Here we are again. Before the election, the Abbott government made a commitment to regulate registered organisations in the same way as corporations. This bill does not implement the coalition's election promise. This bill makes provision for higher penalties on corporations and registered organisations will have a more onerous regime to deal with.


There are new criminal provisions which, if enacted, mean that registered organisations, employer bodies and unions will have difficulty in persuading people—often in a voluntary capacity—to take on official responsibilities. It is not just Labor saying that. The AIG states:


If the proposed criminal penalties and proposed massive financial penalties for breaches of duties are included in the RO Act, this would operate as a major disincentive to existing voluntary officers of registered organisations continuing in their roles, and would deter other people from holding office.


These are genuine concerns that have not been addressed by the government. Unions have also raised quite legitimate concerns about the impacts of the proposed laws. Usually, when you have industry bodies and unions lining up on a unity ticket against a proposition, there is something very wrong. This is apparent here.


I have seen workplaces disrupted by employees making a point on legitimate concerns. As a former teacher, there have been disputes over conditions and funding. Very rarely have I seen frivolous claims. With three young adult sons, I hear about workplace conditions in the building, transport and warehouse industries. I know there are some workers and indeed some bosses that could behave better, take workplace safety more seriously and ensure that correct rates of pay, especially overtime, are adhered to. As I move around my community, people discuss unfair dismissal and other workplace matters. Safety and dignity at work are paramount in the electorate of Lalor. Union membership is valued.


Many make the point that they would prefer to be in a unionised workplace, as their rights and their safety are protected. As a mother and someone who has worked with young adults, I can speak firsthand to the peace of mind it brings. I do, however, read the paper and watch the news. I know that not everybody acts with integrity in the workplace. That is why the Labor Party has no tolerance for corruption by union officials or officers in employer bodies. We support tough penalties for those who break the law and we support appropriate regulation for registered organisations, including a properly empowered regulator and consequences for those who do not follow the rules.


Labor is committed to ensuring financial accountability by unions and employer organisations. That is why in 2012 the now Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, as Minister for Workplace Relations, toughened the laws to improve financial transparency and disclosure by registered organisations to their members. As a result, the regulation of trade unions in Australia has never been stronger, accountability has never been higher and the powers of the Fair Work Commission to investigate and prosecute for breaches have never been broader and, with a tripling of penalties, they have never been tougher.


What we are not hearing from those opposite about this legislation is that the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act already prohibits members' money from being used to favour particular candidates in internal elections or campaigns. It already allows for criminal proceedings to be initiated where funds are stolen or obtained by fraud. It already ensures that the Fair Work Commission can share information with the police as appropriate, and it already provides for statutory civil penalties—

 (Ballarat) (13:30):  Over the last six months we have seen this Prime Minister and this government start to dismantle our universal healthcare system as we know it. The Abbott government wants to slug families, pensioners and patients with a $7 GP tax every time they visit the doctor, get a blood test or get an X-ray. They have ripped $50 billion out of our public hospital system, and they want to increase the costs of medicines, and they are telling state governments that they should charge you a tax every time you go to visit the emergency department. The government is intent on creating a two-tiered healthcare system in this country, an American-style healthcare system where your credit card is more important than your healthcare card. These lazy policies hurt middle- and low-income earners, and they hurt the most vulnerable in our society.


Members on this side of the House have been speaking to our electorates right across the country about the importance of Medicare.    In my own electorate, people are rightly worried about what these changes will mean to them if they get sick. Nearly 67,000 Australians have signed our Save Medicare petition, voicing their concerns at this attack on the universal health care system. They want to tell the Prime Minister that he cannot get away with imposing an unfair $7 GP tax every time people visit a doctor. Australians want the Prime Minister to know that gutting our public hospitals of $50 billion means an increase in elective surgery and emergency department waiting times. I seek leave to table a document that represents the 67,000 people who have signed our Medicare petition— (Time expired)

I have said very clearly to this House that this government has had significant success in dealing with these matters. The reason we have had that success is that we have been adamant that, on every occasion that may present, we will apply all of the policies we have to ensure that no venture successfully reaches Australia. Those are the policies that we are applying, whether it is in this instance or in any other instance. I know that those opposite like to denigrate the fact that there has been no successful people-smuggling venture to Australia in seven months, but it means that there has been no loss of life for people at sea as a result of those ventures since last September.

They are ensuring that any persons who are in their care are well looked after, because that is the nature of the people that we have put our trust in on our borders.

The government is not watering down any consumer protection and it is not scrapping the best interest duty or reintroducing commissions. We have no plans to reintroduce commissions.

"King, Catherine, MP",ALP,2014-07-15,"



Ms KING
 (Ballarat) (15:07):  I rise today to talk about the healthcare emergency that has been created by this government's $50 billion worth of cuts to our public hospital system, and the effect that these cuts will have on the hundreds and thousands of nurses and midwives across Australia, some of whom are in the gallery today, and the millions of patients that they care for every day in GP practices, in community health centres, in home based nursing care and in our public hospital system.


When it comes to health care, Australians are being let down by the most uncompassionate government since Federation, and they are being let down by the most ineffective health minister this country has ever seen. These $50 billion cuts are the equivalent of cutting one in five nursing positions across the country—one in five nursing positions across the country! These are front-line services, people who are caring for some of the most sick and vulnerable in our communities, who are keeping older people within their own homes. And it comes at a time when Health Workforce Australia has estimated there is already a shortage of some 20,000 nurses in this country, and more shortages to come. Indeed Health Workforce Australia has said:


… without nationally coordinated reform Australia is likely to experience limitations in the delivery of high quality health services—


as a consequence of a highly significant shortage of more than 109,000 nurses.


So what is the government's response to this nursing workforce crisis? The government's response is to: abolish Health Workforce Australia, and the Senate is considering those bills this week; cut $142 million in funding for health workforce planning; and to get rid of more than 140 jobs in South Australia. This is at a time when public hospitals across the country are struggling to meet their emergency department waiting times and their elective surgery waiting times.


And it is not just the Labor Party that is saying it. Australia's most ineffective health minister has managed to unite the entire health sector against the government with his cruel cuts and lack of any compassion. It takes a pretty special health minister to unite the entire healthcare sector against you and against the government's unfair budget. He likes to be critical of this side of the place, but what he does not seem to understand is that there is every health expert in the country saying your budget is a dud. It is an absolute dud and will damage the healthcare system in this country. It fundamentally undermines the universal principles of Medicare and it actually changes the entire way in which our healthcare system operates. Fifty billion dollars being cut and ripping up the national partnership agreements that saw the relationship between the Commonwealth and the states starting, for the first time, to actually begin to focus on health policy reform—reform that is needed to make the system more efficient. Ripping up those agreements and ripping $50 billion out of public hospitals—it is an absolute disgrace.


The Australian Medical Association President, Associate Professor Brian Owler, last month summed up the health sector's response to this government's backward, inequitable and unfair vision for health care in this country. He said:


The message is clear: the measures add up to bad health policy.


Professor Owler went on to say:


The health measures in the federal budget are almost universally opposed by the people who provide health services in Australia. The [Australian Medical Association] is at the forefront of this opposition.


And we know what the impact will be on nurses and midwives across the country and on the patients that they care for. The Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation has said these are cuts that will damage the healthcare system. They are cuts that the acting secretary of the ANMF said:


… ripped the heart out of the Australian health system and as a former Health Minister, [the Prime Minister] should be ashamed of that.


And it is not just nurses working in hospitals who will be affected by these changes. Nurses working in general practice across Australia and in private practice will be hit by these cuts. In particular, I want to refer to some correspondence from a GP practice in Ingham and the effect that these new taxes will have on that practice. It said:


We as a practice currently make a loss per dressing we perform. We offer this service as a benefit to the community and to the patients of our practice. We charge no dressing fee to patients due to our belief that this would cause unreasonable hardship for these 'at risk' patients … We perform 20-30 dressings per day.


These are often older patients suffering from things like leg ulcers, wound care that sometimes requires up to three visits a week. Dr Elliott goes on to detail the cuts in this budget to MBS items and then said:


This is clearly not affordable for the practice to absorb these costs. This would result in our practice ceasing to offer this service which would result in patients having to attend Ingham Hospital for these dressings where the costs would be borne completely by the taxpayer at a higher rate. We then would reduce our nurse numbers.


This is not the Labor Party saying it.




Mr Whiteley:
  That is you saying it!




Ms KING:
  These are GPs delivering frontline services not in my electorate, not in Labor Party electorates, but in Ingham. This is one of the smaller, more remote communities in Queensland.



Mr Nikolic interjecting—




Ms KING:
  And I note that we continue to have significant interjections from the members who represent seats in Tasmania.




Mr Whiteley:
  That's right!




Ms KING:
  You represent some of the poorest seats in this country.




Mr Whiteley:
  Yeah, and do you know why?




Ms KING:
  I have visited those seats many, many times and every single time you have failed to stand up for those people in your community—



Mr Whiteley interjecting—




Mr Nikolic:
  What a shameful thing to say!



Government members interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  We will have some decorum, thank you, from both sides!



Ms Butler interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The member for Griffith is not in her seat and will not speak!




Ms KING:
  who need to access general practice, who need to access health care, and you have failed the members of your communities.


And what will that affect? From the GP in Ingham we know what the effect on nurses will be if the government gets its way and also introduces a tax on hospital visits.


Stephen Duckett from the Grattan Institute—someone who knows something about the health system and how to increase efficiency—has stated:


If just one in four patients chose to go to a hospital emergency department, the Commonwealth will save no money because of the much higher costs of emergency department care; costs that the Commonwealth government now shares.


And this is precisely what this government's GP tax will do.




Mr Nikolic:
  You ruined Tasmania and then you stand there all pious. Good on you!



Government members interjecting—




Ms KING:
  I see those experts over there, those grand experts of health policy, representing some of the poorest electorates in our communities—blah, blah, blah they go; off they go again—failing to represent the people of their communities. I am looking forward to campaigning every single day until the next election on your failure to stand up—



A government member:  Bring it on!




Ms KING:
  to provide healthcare services to your community. I am looking forward to doing that every day.


We know that the support that this government is providing for nurses working in general practice has been poor. Consistent with the lack of transparency, lack of compassion and incompetence that has characterised this government, a fortnight ago this government tried to sneak through changes to the way health assessments are conducted by nurse practitioners in GP practices. Without any warning, the government reinterpreted the role of nurses and determined that practice nurse time does not count in Medicare Benefits Schedule health assessment items. Consistent with the way this government does business, the change was announced without any consultation whatsoever and the president at that time of the Australian Primary Health Care Nurses Association described this as having 'a devastating impact on the ability of general practice to provide high-quality preventive care.' Not long after this announcement was made, the government was shamed into backing down on yet another ill-conceived health policy idea.


The government should now back down on some of its other ill-conceived policies that will result in less places for nurses, less places for doctors, less hospital beds, blowouts in emergency department waiting times and elective surgery, and bed closures. The government should back down from its $50 billion cuts to public hospitals. It should back down from ripping up national partnership agreements that saw increased funding going into public hospitals in every community across this country. It should back down on its $7 GP tax. It should back down on its $1.3 billion hike to the cost of medicines and its unfair changes to the Medicare Benefits Schedule and the PBS safety nets. It should back down on its $367 million cut to the National Partnership Agreements on Preventive Health. If the government wants to try and change the healthcare system, it has to make sure that the healthcare system is focussing on prevention. But what it has actually done is cut all of the money from preventative services. I have been involved in healthcare policy development all of my working life, whether it was working within the Department of Health, whether it was working as a consultant in health consulting or whether it was working in direct care in allied health.




Mr Nikolic interjecting.




The SPEAKER:  We will have some silence on my right.




Ms KING:
  I have worked in health policy all of my career and I have never seen a sector so united against a government as it is with this particular budget. The inequitable changes in the budget are the biggest attack on Medicare in 30 years. Indeed, when the changes were first announced the AMA Vice President, Professor Geoffrey Dobb, described them as setting back health care 50 years in Australia. The government's arguments that these cuts are making Medicare sustainable is an absolute mockery because the money is not going back into the system. The government knows it, and it should be honest with the Australian people and keep its hands off Medicare.

"Dutton, Peter, MP",LP,2014-07-15,"



Mr DUTTON
 (Dickson—Minister for Health and Minister for Sport) (15:18):  I acknowledge the nurses' union officials within the gallery today. I hope they have been impressed by the performance of their subjects over there. I hope the effect of the puppets' strings work as well from the gallery as they do for the preselection processes that take place around the country. Of course, some of them have not been preselected from the nurses' union. We have Manser up there who is presumably a product of the CFMEU. Given all the talent and class of the CFMEU that he brings into this place, it needs to be put on the record that he needs to be recognised for the marvellous contribution he makes on a daily basis. 


All that you have heard from the Labor Party over the course of the last 10 minutes reflects what we have heard from the Labor Party over the course of the last six years—that is, an attack on those people who are on the front-line services in a desperate cause taken up by Labor at a state and federal level to set up health bureaucracies all around the country to siphon money away from front-line services and to put it into bureaucracies. Why? Not because it is of benefit to patients and to people who are on waiting lists but because it pleases the union bosses.


If you want to know why the Labor Party over the course of the last six years was completely incompetent in government, have a look at the people who fill the benches now compared to those who filled the benches in the Hawke-Keating years. People who had real-life experience served in the Keating and Hawke cabinets, not people like the member for Ballarat, who reported before that she had a lifetime as a bureaucrat within the department and served as a consultant—with all due respect to bureaucrats and consultants. But, just like those behind her, it does not bring professional experience to this place and, frankly, it is reflected when they are in government. They are completely incompetent in the modern age of managing government. That is why they say 'yes' to everybody, they write cheques to everybody who comes through the door, they take money away from front-line services and they rack up record amounts of debt. That is the modern Labor Party. That is what we have seen over the course of the last six years. And that is why, when the election is held in two years' time, the Australian public will make the only decision that they can: that is that the Labor Party has not learnt the lessons of the last six years. People who come from normal nursing backgrounds or normal teaching backgrounds or normal policing backgrounds or backgrounds otherwise cannot get into the modern Labor parliament. They cannot do it because they cannot get past the union secretaries. They cannot get past the union bosses who reward their fellow spirits. It shows in the policy that they put forward and it shows in the way in which they manage. And it has been on display again today. It is not good for democracy in this country.


I ask those on the other side: who has had small business experience? On the other side, put your hand up if you have had small business experience. Just one hand? No, not one hand.




Mr Mitchell interjecting.





Mr DUTTON:
  Oh, you have worked on the fringes as a union hack marching your way into small business. That does not count. That does not give you the opportunity to say that you put your house on the line. It does not give you the opportunity to say that you employed people and that you understand the hard lessons of business. It does not say that you have life experience—that is demonstrated in these constant interjections and ridiculous contributions.



The SPEAKER:  This is most unusual for a point of order. What is the point of order?




Ms King:
  It is normally, but he should refer to people by their seats.



The SPEAKER:  This is a wide-ranging debate. It really is a nonsense to do that sort of thing in this matter of public importance.




Mr DUTTON:
  Why is it that Labor presided over ripping money out of frontline health services and putting it into bureaucracies? Because of the union bosses. What have we done in relation to this most recent budget? I can tell you what we have done in the national context in terms of state-by-state budget funding for public hospitals. New South Wales it increases by 7.2 per cent from 2013-14 to 2014-15. It is 7.3 per cent in Victoria, 12.8 per cent in Queensland, 13.6 per cent in WA and seven per cent in Tasmania. In Tasmania the budget shows, in black and white, that it will go up by 15 per cent. If you listen to the Labor Party you would think that we had cut hospital funding. Next year and the year after in New South Wales it is an increase of 9.8 per cent and 8.7 per cent. If you look at Queensland over the years of this budget, there is an increase of 36.6 per cent over those four years. In New South Wales it is 36.7 per cent; in Tasmania, 30.8 per cent; and in WA, it is a 44 per cent increase in hospital funding over the course of the next four years. So do not listen to this nonsense from the Labor Party. These people are playing up to the union bosses who are visiting the parliament today—nothing more, nothing less. 


All I want to do is put the facts on the table. We increase hospital funding in each and every year under this budget. We put it on a sustainable path, because Labor racked up debt. They pretended they could give everything to everybody for free. Well, do you know what? The hangover of the party now needs to be dealt with. People in their household budgets know that you can only spend for so long more than what you earn. People in small or large business now that you can only spend more than what you earn for so long before the banks move in to take over.


My colleagues from Tasmania—who are particularly passionate about health and have seen Labor preside over the worst health mismanagement at a state level over the course of the last six years; exactly the reason Labor was swept from power in Tasmania—passed on a very interesting statistic to me before. And that is that this interest bill that we have been left with from the Labor Party is $1 billion a month. Without any changes it grows to $2.8 billion within 10 years. This is per month. That is money that we are borrowing to pay the interest bill. Imagine if you were running your household like that. If you had to borrow money each month to pay off the mortgage, people would go broke pretty quickly. The country is in exactly the same position if we do not put in place remedial action. What do you get for $1 billion a month? As we heard before from my colleagues from Tasmania, you could employ 10,000 nurses a year. That is 10,000 nurses a year for a single Labor interest bill in a month. 


So I say to the nurses in the gallery, 'If you wonder why we are having to take action to repair Labor's damage over the course of the last six years, it is because of the debt that they have racked up.' We have provided extra support for scholarships in relation to nurses and allied health care professionals in this budget. We provide $96 million for bowel cancer screening—early detection is very important in bowel cancer. We provide that support. We provide extra funding in addition to the fact that we can build a $20-billion medical research fund. Why? Because we know that for every dollar that we spend in medical research, $2.17 is returned. Why do we know that? Because of the independent report that Prime Minister Gillard commissioned that came back to the Labor government to say that the health system in its current form is unsustainable and we should be spending more in the areas of prevention, which we do in this budget. We spend more in relation to bowel cancer screening, as I say, but in many other areas as well. We spend more in medical research because, as a country, we punch above our weight. We have world-class medical researchers that other countries are desperate to poach. But we keep them here and we will find better techniques to care for patients as well as the cures for diseases of the brain, for cancers and other issues which will overtake us in decades and centuries to come if we do not do the research today—in a similar vein to the way in which we had to do research around penicillin and other discoveries that came from this country and others over the previous decades.


We are putting money into that space because it will save money long term in the health system. That is the advice that was given to the Labor government. The problem is that Labor mismanaged so poorly. The internal fighting that really engulfed Labor over the course of the last six years is still there. We saw the member for Sydney in the opposition leader's chair today absolutely determined to knock off Bill Shorten in the same way that Julia Gillard was determined to knock off Kevin Rudd. Mark my words, these people, when you scratch beneath the surface, are as bad today as they were six years ago. That is the reason they were never able to manage health properly—because they did not have an eye on patients and nurses and doctors. This government will make sure that we take care of our nurses, that we take care of our doctors, that we take care of our patients and we do that because we increased funding. We take it away from those bureaucratic structures and we put it back into front-line services.

Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (15:28):  If the longest queue in the building is the queue outside of the coffee shop at eight o'clock in the morning, the shortest queue in the building has got to be the queue of government MPs that are willing to line up here in this parliament and defend their own government's policy when it comes to their atrocious attacks on the health care system.



Mr Ewen Jones interjecting—



Mr Nikolic interjecting—




Mr STEPHEN JONES:
  I see Townsville's answer to Benny Hill has got a lot to say, I see 'Sergeant Strop' from Bass over there has got a lot to say, but none of them are willing to put themselves on the speaking list. They had an opportunity today to put themselves on the speaking list and defend their horrid attacks on the PBS system. But all we see is four people who are willing to stand up and defend their government's atrocious attacks on the health system.


Even the minister today had the opportunity—he was given 10 minutes—to say something nice about the nurses who labour day in and day out, caring for the sick in our hospitals. He was given 10 minutes to say something nice about them and he could not find it within himself to praise the men and women who labour day in and day out looking after the sick in our hospitals. Is it any wonder that he had nothing nice to say about them? From the cradle to the grave the nurses are copping it under this government. There is their deregulation of university fees. We heard during question time today that a nurse could expect to pay close to $98,000 to receive a university degree that would qualify them to practise. What did the Deputy Prime Minister have to say about this? He said, 'Don't worry about the $98,000 because we are giving you $500 back in the carbon tax.' With maths like that, is it any wonder he had to give up farming?


Nurses cop it from the beginning to the end under this government. Their penalty rates are in the fire because the minister for industrial relations has promised a comprehensive review—everything is going to be on the table. Under this government those people who work 12-hour shifts across the weekend and over 24 hours a day can look forward to an attack on their penalty rates, because it is in the government's DNA. If it is not enough that the government is coming after their university fees, coming after their penalty rates and making it harder for them to do their job, it is going to ask them to work longer. Only a government made up of people who have never had to work hard shift work in all their lives—nobody has done a hard job where they have had to stand on their feet for 12 or 14 hours a day—would suggest you could do that until the age of 70. That is what the nurses have got to look forward to under this government. It is an absolute and complete breach of faith.


We heard the minister say that there are no cuts to hospitals. We know they do not like to listen to union officials but here is one union official they might like to listen to. During question time today, the AMA said that Australia has 'one of the most efficient and high-performing health systems in the world'. The AMA has said that the health budget is not out of control. That is a complete contradiction of what the government has said. The government is trying to pull the wool over the eyes of the Australian people.


The government say that Medicare spending is out of control. I had a look at Medicare spending. They like to look at the figures over the last 10 years. The government outlay was 4.8 per cent in 2003-04 and 4.6 per cent in 2013-14. The government outlay has actually gone down. The AMA knows it and the nurses of Australia know it. The nurses, the AMA and everybody who has anything to do with the health system know that your rotten GP tax and your rotten plan for the health system just will not wash. (Time expired)

"Laming, Andrew, MP",LP,2014-07-15,"



Mr LAMING
 (Bowman) (15:33):  It really is a privilege for everyone in this chamber to speak on behalf of Australian nurses. That is what this MPI debate is really about. Without being a little self-indulgent and falling back on lists of talking points, shouldn't this be a moment for us to recognise this incredible profession? Often nurses are bound by paperwork, which I think is partly our fault in this chamber, and are sometimes short on energy and hands, but they are never short on caring. These people do an amazing job. I note also that in regional Australia they probably have the best workforce distribution of any profession. Nurses will go to the ends of the earth and every corner of Australia to deliver their great trade and their wonderful caring. I thank them.


This does raise the question: what provoked the debate today? The Minister for Health exposed the fact that we have some very important people in Canberra today. None of my nursing friends are in Canberra today, no. There are some senior ranking union officials in Canberra. That is why all of a sudden the spotlight is shining on nursing for the first time in years. This is the first time in years they have brought up nursing. There is no doubt about it: the Minister for Health exposed the puppet strings and the fact that they will jump for whoever will get them preselected.


In reality we have a complete disparity between what the union says and what the nurses say. I spent time last week with nurses working in remote Australia and I did not hear them singing from any of the song sheets they have over there. The more I listen to the politics over there the more I realise they do not know much about how a hospital works and when the visiting hours are around the corner. When you dig down and know what life is like working hard at delivering care on the wards, the one thing I think you would ask for—and I do not want to put words in anyone's mouth—is focusing the resources and the attention of the government on front-line health care, making sure that money is spent on patients.


Over the last six years that mob over there had every chance in the world to prove that they could do that but they set up another authority. They slipped it through the parliament. There was a deal with the Greens. What did we get? More high-rise buildings full of bureaucrats and a few more water bubblers, tea trolleys and lumbar supports. None of that was going to help patients, was it? That is the point. That is the raw test of the government's commitment to looking after the ill, the sick and the needy.


This government will never shirk making sure that those on the front line are looked after. That works right through the whole system. We do not employ large numbers of well-meaning people in authorities to tell us the answers we already know to questions. We certainly do not start getting spooked and worried that they are not going to become union members. That is not of any great concern to patients, is it? Patients do not want to know they are being cared for by a union member; they want to know they are being cared for by qualified nurses who are there in appropriate ratios and properly supported by our health system.



Ms Butler interjecting—




Mr LAMING:
  I will take that interjection from the member for Griffith. Queensland has shown a stunning turnaround in A&E waits and in waits for surgery that no-one ever thought was possible. What did they do? They did not do it by taking money off the front line, no. They sorted out corporate health and now we are seeing the money directed to where it is really needed.


The second thing is duplication. We want to know that between federal and state services we do not have ridiculous overlaps. We need a health department federally but we do not need one of 5,000 people where none of them treat patients. If you talk to ordinary, everyday Australians, they will say to you, 'I just want to know that when my child is ill I can be seen by a well-supported, qualified workforce in A&E; and, if I need to get an operation, I know that that will also be available.' Practice nurses are there thanks to coalition initiatives. We have got practice incentive payments there to look after the doctors that do the supervision. We have got the GP numbers increasing from 1,200 to 1,500. They are the real changes that make a difference.


How would we invest in health infrastructure to help those nurses to work? Let's compare and contrast again. How would Labor do it? They would build a superclinic. That is right, a great big Taj Mahal, like the one in Ipswich or the one in Redcliffe, with no doctors—empty, treating no-one. The lights are on but no-one is home. They have even illuminated the cross, but there is nothing going on inside. It reflects a little bit of what is happening on the other side of this House. What are we doing? It is a dollar-for-dollar investment. Practices around the country put up a dollar and we match the dollar with government funds. Then we know the clinicians have put their heart in it and they will use that infrastructure appropriately. You will see more changes and more improvements. Yes, we wave goodbye to authorities. No, we owe nothing to the unions. Yes, on this side, we will do everything we can to serve those on the front line, including nurses around Australia.

Mr CHAMPION
 (Wakefield) (15:38):  It is great to be here and it is wonderful that the government backbenchers have stuck around to discuss Medicare. I know their great hero John Howard said in 1987 he wanted to 'stab Medicare in the stomach', and that is what this back bench wants to do. They want to gut Medicare. They want to get rid of Medicare. That is what you are doing. There is absolutely no doubt that the essential parts of the Medicare workforce are its nurses, who are an essential front-line part of this system, along with doctors and allied health professionals. They are the sorts of people we should be listening to. But what do you get from the government back bench? You do not get them listening. You get this defence of the government's budget—at least sometimes you do—by interjection. It is not by speeches, not by standing up in the parliament and putting themselves on the record; it is just by interjections and by showing up for these debates.


The AMA, the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine, the Doctors Reform Society, the Public Health Association, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, the Consumers Health Forum, the Australian Healthcare and Hospitals Association and countless others are against the government's changes. What are they against? They are against the GP tax, which will cost $7 every time you walk into a waiting room and every time you get a blood test. Think about it: $7 every time is a cascading and compounding tax on Australian families. Those opposite are out there giving their constituents the wrong impression by alleging there is some sort of safety net. We all know that safety net is not defined. We have seen neither hide nor hair of it. All we know is $7 every time you go to a waiting room, every time you get a blood test, every time you go anywhere near a doctor. That is the nature of this policy. That is why it smashes Medicare and it smashes preventative health care.


Dr Bruce Groves from Salisbury North, which is just outside my electorate, wrote to me. I used to go to his surgery. You might want to listen to this. This is not the Labor Party. He says:


To the honourable Nick Champion


Dear Sir


I wish to draw your attention to the massive reduction at my practice of patient numbers since the budget announcement re co-payments in general practice. Our practice of eight doctors, a noncorporate teaching practice, has noted a 30 per cent drop in attendance since this announcement. We are now trying to reassure patients that this measure will only come in if passed by both houses of parliament in July 2015. Patients are confused and upset. We, the doctors, working in a working class suburb with many pensioners and concession card holders are angry and appalled by the proposed co-payment measure, which may well destroy our practice and others in the region, given the response already. The measure is heartless, bereft of social conscience and punishes those who can least afford it.


None of you are listening to your electorates, none of you are listening to the AMA and none of you are listening to general practitioners in your electorates. It is a serious problem because every time someone does not go to the doctor it creates bigger problems down the track. We all know they end up in the emergency departments and they end up in our hospitals, and that will put more pressure on those nurses, more pressure on the front-line services and more pressure on our hospital system. There will be no savings. All of the mythical savings that will go into this wonderful research fund that the minister talks about will not appear because this is simply a cost-shifting situation. If you charge at the GP end, then you will make our hospitals less efficient in the long term.



Government members interjecting—




Mr CHAMPION:
  We hear a lot of interjections from those opposite. But make no mistake, this GP tax, a cascading $7 every time, combined with the $50 billion worth of cuts, is going to cut some 4,300 hospital beds and one in five nurses. The government back bench might show up and they might interject, but we will not find any of them out in their electorates actually defending this policy come election time. They hope it is defeated in the Senate. They hope that the Labor Party successfully defends Medicare. They hope that this budget is not implemented.

Dr GILLESPIE
 (Lyne) (15:43):  When I saw this matter of public importance I thought: 'What is happening here? What are our wrong priorities towards nurses?' I had to scurry back to my office and look through all our documents that we had put through in the campaign and in the budget. To be truthful, I was hard pressed to find anything specifically that was not beneficial for nurses. Then today in question time we hear of visitors here from the Health Services Union and other unions. Then the penny dropped and, like most of you, I realised that this is a bit of a beat up for the people in the unions that are controlling far too many members on the other side of the House.


If you look at things rationally, maybe they are upset about the fact that, when we were in government previously, the coalition introduced practice payments for nurses. But surely they could not be upset about that. Maybe they do not like the idea of 500 scholarships for nurses for up to $30,000 to train, particularly, those in rural and remote areas. They keep going on about this mythical $50 billion worth of cuts, but when you look at it the payments to the states actually go up. What they are complaining about is that the increases are not as prodigious or unrealistic or unsustainable as the previous ALP government made out.


So, there are no cuts. To me, a cut means that what you get next year is less than what you got this year. But things are going up and up—as many speakers here today have pointed up, by nine per cent, nine per cent, six per cent, and then the usual precedent is by CPI and population growth. So, this idea of cuts is absolute rubbish, and these members on the other side should be held to account for scaring the bejesus out of half the people who depend on the health system for their wellbeing. I have worked for 33 years in the health system, and I do not know anyone in the health system who has ever complained about a cut in bureaucracy—and that is what we are doing. The last time I was in A and E and there was blood going everywhere and someone exsanguinating, I did not say, 'Quick, get me a clipboard!' or 'I need a few more paperclips!' or 'I need a new position statement!'


That is what we are doing. We are directing what precious money is in the health portfolio into front-line services. We also have a $331 million Practice Nurse Incentive Payment. Maybe they are complaining about $331 million being dedicated to getting more nurses in private practice, just like they are complaining about nine per cent more, nine per cent more, six per cent more. It is just ridiculous. It strikes me as quite confected anger. They do not have anything else to complain about, so they brew up this major storm about these mythical cuts, when in fact things are going up. There is also $80 million for clinical training programs for nurses. Who could complain about that? So, there is one policy after the other—funding that is going up—yet they are complaining.


In my area, what have we seen from the previous government? We have seen $7 million tied up in my home town for a superclinic that has been in construction for 3½ years and has not seen one patient yet. And you hear the stories all around the country of all these superclinics that are white elephants or are underutilised or not utilised. It is just ridiculous. Practice incentive payments for infrastructure are going to expand the capacity of existing practices rather than superclinics. They also make a big deal about the $7 co-payment. Sure, it is going to change the behaviour in general practices. Hello! That is why it is being introduced—because it was unsustainable. It is sending a price to both the doctor and the patient. And the system, if it is going to be sustained, needs it. (Time expired)

This is just another example of the Prime Minister's wrong priorities that leave shortfalls for the states to pick up that we know they are never going to meet. Those states are never going to pick up that additional cost, and that is just the start.


Across the board the Abbott Liberal government's budget takes the scalpel to health funding and healthcare programs. The introduction of the $7 GP tax hits everyone; we know that. It is going to hit pensioners, parents, the unemployed, low-income earners, people with a disability and even veterans. The tax will cost the people in my electorate of Newcastle more than $5 million a year in extra health costs.


They are hitting the Australian public again with a $1.3 billion increase into the cost of pharmaceuticals. And they are slashing all the preventive healthcare programs, like the Deadly Choices program run by the Awabakal Aboriginal medical service in my electorate of Newcastle.




Mr Stephen Jones:
  Shameful.




Ms CLAYDON:
  It is shameful, the attack on the sickest, the poorest, and the most marginalised group in my community of Newcastle. And there has been nothing but silence from those opposite. A preventive healthcare service for Aboriginal people, gone. And this is not something that is coming in the future; these cuts are hitting hard, and they are hitting now. Those opposite are living in some kind of parallel universe if they think there is no impact of these cuts already.


Remember the promise 'We'll shut no Medicare Locals' before the budget? Yeah, we all remember that one. Well, my Medicare Local in the Hunter happens to run this country's most progressive and innovative GP Access After Hours Service. We just celebrated the 10th year of the GP Access After Hours Service, which should be a model for this entire country. It is driven by the dedicated nurses who run the triage work, 24 hours a day, seven days a week—a service that is used by just about every one of the families in my electorate of Newcastle. And it is not just my electorate but the electorates of the member for Shortland, the member for Hunter and the member for Charlton—and the member for Paterson should be in here defending it, actually, because his constituents are also beneficiaries of the nurses who run the GP Access After Hours telephone service, which is gone because of cuts by this government.


Let's not talk about what this will mean in the future, but let's spend the remaining time by focusing on nurses, who are watching this government's attacks on their health industry, their workforce and their sector being cut to the core. It is nurses who are delivering the quality care into hospitals and services in the regions. I might remind the House that for the 20th year in a row nurses have been voted Australia's most ethical and trusted professionals. Do you know that 91 per cent of Australians aged 14 years and over placed nurses at No. 1 in terms of ethics and honesty?


This government is attacking our most trusted. They have no shame. We are facing a shortage of nurses in the near future, and you would think that might be an issue this government might be concerned about, but without a nationally-coordinated reform project that shortage is going to grow to more than 109,000 nurses by 2025. We have got nothing from the government. 


You would think they would want to assist women and men to go into nursing higher education, but no: universities like the University of Newcastle are going to be suffering drastically from the cuts in higher education. We know for women it costs more and more to do the degree and repay the costs later. (Time expired)

"Sudmalis, Ann, MP",LP,2014-07-15,"



Mrs SUDMALIS
 (Gilmore) (15:53):  Despite the fact that the federal government does not employ any nurses, I welcome this motion before the House and note that the shadow minister for health has already left the chamber. I also note the member for Throsby's inaccurate assertion that no coalition members are present to debate the issue.



Honourable members interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order!




Mrs SUDMALIS:
  There are eight on the other side and 21 over here. Excuse me while I choke! For seven months now I have been advocating for a practice nurse in a regional area, trying to find out why the previous government changed the rules, disallowing the possibility for a practice nurse to fulfil her obligations for 'recent hours in the practice' while working in order to renew her registration. Please do not snip at our fairy-tale budgetary interpretations measures when it was the previous government that made this change; and regional practice nurses are one of the unintended consequences. Where was Labor and the nurses' union when young nurses were desperate to retrain and get back to work after having a child? How do they assist them to get back to work? The answer is: they do not—no scholarships and no regional application of policies. Shame!


Those opposite speak of health and nurses, but when a previous Labor member announced extra beds in Tasmania, two wards were closed. To those opposite I say: 'don't make me laugh. Labor does not care about nurses or regional health care.' I welcome the chance to speak on this MPI because of the importance of health services in my regional electorate of Gilmore. Only yesterday I met with health minister, Peter Dutton, to talk about health care in my electorate; we spoke about issues like Headspace, bulk-billing, domestic violence services, counselling, MRI issues and more. Gilmore is one of the most healthcare-critical regions in the nation, and that truth is not something to be proud of, but something to advocate for. I am proud to say that on this side of the House we care about nursing and we care about health care.


In fact, the budget papers clearly show that there is no cut. Hospital funding from the government receives an increase of three years—in this budget annual hospital funding increases by over $5 billion. Our commitment to total hospital funding to the states is almost $70 billion over the four years to come. In my own state this goes to $5.9 billion in just three years' time. Those opposite go on about how one of their Kevin Rudd thought bubbles was to increase hospital funding by 10 per cent each year every year. Such an increase would take our current $15 billion health budget to a $40 billion debacle within a decade. Because we are not following this stupid, unaffordable Labor funding thought bubble, those opposite refer to it as cuts. Is it any wonder that we were left with a budget disaster when first-principle economics simply are not understood? It was another Labor thought bubble with no actual thought, no plan, no maturity and no accountability for this proposed expenditure. We are not cutting expenditure; we are just not spending imaginary Rudd dollars.


I find it farcical that those opposite bring this motion before the house today. And yet the Leader of the Opposition is short on how Labor would pay for its pie-in-the-sky health plan. The shadow minister the health never attempts to outline how Labor would find the nearly $15 billion a year extra they claim they can deliver for our hospitals. I guess they prefer the nurses to work in the dark because of the electricity costs. 


Gilmore has many district nurses and those opposite even tried to destroy part of their income package by getting rid of the FBT, which is essential for regional nurses. It is not enough that regional areas were starved of funding with no accountability required, but those opposite introduced additional levels of bureaucracy. How on earth does that equate to assistance for frontline nurses? We will be happily investing in healthcare professionals, showing them the respect they deserve, increasing the Practice Nurse Incentives Program, putting in an extra $40 million for medical internships and extra funding for the General Practice Rural Incentives Program, which actually gives nurses an increased chance to work.


We in Gilmore, especially through the Shoalhaven campus of the University of Wollongong, have an outstanding School of Medicine and also one of nursing. This university welcomes the changes to higher education and has confirmed in a competitive environment that it is in the students' interest and that it is unlikely to see fee increases. Unlike those opposite, we know how precious our nurses really are and we will continue to support them by growing the economy so they can actually get a job.

"Butler, Terri, MP",ALP,2014-07-15,"



Ms BUTLER
 (Griffith) (15:58):  It has been instructive in this debate to hear references to the phrase 'frontline services' on a number of occasions from the speakers from the Liberal and the National Parties. It is not new to me—




Mr Nikolic:
  What would you know?




Ms BUTLER:
  and I will take the interjection from the member from Bass who suggests that the language is new to me. You might like to know that the phrase 'frontline services' was used by the Liberal-National Party prior to the 2012 state election in my home state of Queensland. 'Frontline services,' they said. 'There will be no cuts to frontline services.' How did that go? What happened? Let us see this: 4,000 full-time equivalent hospital and health services jobs were lost across Queensland, including more than 1600 nurse and midwife positions. So when the Liberals and Nationals use the language of 'front-line services', you know they certainly do not mean front-line jobs. It is code for 'cuts'. It is always code for cuts.



Government members interjecting—




Ms BUTLER:
  I thank members opposite for so kindly providing me with an eye line and a group of people to address. As the member for Bass and others know, when you hear Liberals talk about front-line services, when you hear Nationals talk about front-line services, you need only think back to the example of Queensland, my home state—1,600 full-time equivalent nursing and midwifery jobs lost across that state, notwithstanding that reference to 'front-line services'.


Who else has spoken about front-line services? Perhaps COAG has spoken about front-line services. What did they say? On 18 May this year, shortly after the federal budget, they said: 


The meeting of premiers and chief ministers expresses grave concern that, contrary to the Prime Minister's remarks today, there are immediate impacts on front-line services and the cost of living for Australians. For example, from 1 July 2014, there will be a reduction in funding for 1,200 hospital beds across Australia … 


That is what COAG said about front-line services. So when members opposite use the words 'front-line services', we know that is code for cuts. 


It is gravely disappointing that, despite the protestations from those opposite that they care about nursing and that they care about health care, they have offered nothing but union bashing in this debate today. It is the old LNP playbook: 'We have nothing to say; let's bash some unions and let's talk about the Labor Party and union connections.' I have some news for you, members opposite. In Queensland, the nurses union is not affiliated with the Labor Party—not to mention that they are a fine representative organisation. Who do you think runs the Queensland Nurses' Union, members opposite? Nurses run the Queensland Nurses' Union. In fact it is enshrined in legislation—democratic control of organisations. 



Government members interjecting—




Ms BUTLER:
  They are not affiliated with the Labor Party. If you were listening instead of interrupting, you might have heard me saying that. Perhaps, members opposite, instead of continuously interrupting, you might want to listen. 


Let's talk about nursing. We know that the report Health Workforce 2025—



Mr Nikolic interjecting—




Ms BUTLER:
  Oh! The member for Bass is married to a nurse. In the Labor Party, we run nurses for parliament. 



A government member interjecting—




Ms BUTLER:
  The Queensland Nurses' Union is not affiliated. I have said it several times. But, yes, do you know what? Being a nurse qualifies you to stand for parliament. In fact we have a nurse running for parliament in one of my local state seats, Greenslopes. Our candidate, and hopefully our future member, is Joe Kelly, who is a nurse. He is standing for parliament—and guess what? You can stand for parliament in Queensland if you are a nurse. He will stand up for nurses as we on this side of the House do. I look forward to his getting elected and I certainly hope that he does.


But let's talk about nursing in Australia. Health Workforce 2025reported that there is already a shortage of more than 20,000 nurses in Australia. That is what Health Workforce Australia's report said. It projected that, without nationally coordinated reform, there will be a shortage of more than 109,000 nurses by 2025. Yet the Senate this week is moving to abolish that agency and to cut more than $142 million from workforce planning. It is a terrible shame. This side of the House cares about nursing. I invite that side of the House to join us in doing so.

"Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP",LP,2014-07-15,"



Dr SOUTHCOTT
 (Boothby) (16:03):  I am very pleased to speak about nurses and to respond to this MPI, which is a very flimsy MPI. I think the Minister for Health really got to the motivation behind this MPI. The nurses union is in town and they say, 'Jump' to the Labor Party—and the Labor Party asks, 'How high?' 


As a new candidate I remember being advised by the branch secretary of the Australian Nursing Federation to come and discuss the conditions at Flinders Medical Centre. It was a stunt. As well as me, she invited the local state Liberal members of parliament. What we heard was that this place was the most terrible place you could possibly imagine. I remember at the end saying, 'Look, I actually work there and this does not reflect in any way the conditions at that hospital.' You can imagine my surprise when that branch secretary of the nurses federation emerged some months later as the Labor candidate for Adelaide. Sadly, she did not win Adelaide. At the next federal election, she emerged as the Labor candidate for Makin. Sadly, the voters of Makin did not support her then either. It was realised that Gail Gago—the South Australian branch secretary of the nurses federation—and voters did not really get along, so they tucked her away in the Legislative Council. It is an example, I think, of how poorly health workers have been represented by some of these unions. We saw a really good example of this with the Health Services Union—the actions of those officials.


But, seeing as how we are talking about nurses, I would like to focus on the development of practice nurses. This very proud initiative was pushed forward by Michael Wooldridge, then the Minister for Health and Family Services. You now find that almost every general practice has a practice nurse, someone who is trained as a registered nurse. This provides more capacity in primary care. It means that, in areas like diabetes, chronic disease management, asthma and all sorts of things, the practice nurse can focus on certain things and allow the general practitioner to focus on diagnostics. It has been a great development. We have seen it happen around the world and it happened in Australia under a Liberal government. When Tony Abbott was Minister for Health, we saw this expanded through Medicare, using the practice incentive payment introduced by Minister Wooldridge, as well as using the team care arrangements and an expansion of Medicare in that area. 


The Labor Party have talked a lot about nurses, but what they have not mentioned is that they wanted to pull $437 million out of Medicare which was going towards practice nurses. That was something that we, as the then opposition, opposed. In our policy, we made it very clear that we would protect and maintain the $437 million of support for practice nurses that the Rudd-Gillard government planned to strip out of Medicare for these services.


We have heard a lot of rhetoric about nurses but, when it comes to substance, we have the runs on the board. Practice nurses are a great example, but it does not stop there. We have initiatives to provide scholarships for nurses, including $13.4 million for 500 additional scholarships for nursing and allied health. This will be for a maximum value of $30,000 per scholarship. The majority of nurses employed in Australia are employed in acute care settings in hospitals, and we are increasing hospital funding to state and territory governments every year. The increases are six per cent, nine per cent and nine per cent over the forward estimates, and we are providing more than $5 billion in additional hospital funding for the states over the next four years. 


When you look at the scholarships that are available for nurses, when you look at the practice nurse incentives and when you look at the funding that is going to hospitals, this MPI just does not stack up. The underlying motivation of the MPI comes down to the industrial arm of the Labor Party muscling the political arm of the labour movement—that is, the Labor Party opposition in this place. We have had a number of nurses represent us, such as Trish Worth and Trish Draper—great members. (Time expired)




The DEPUTY SPEAKER

Mr Nikolic:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. As a new member, Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek your counsel. If Labor brings on an MPI, are they required to have a minimum number of members in the chamber? I would think that four members for their own matter of public importance—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  No, they need a certain number at the start of the discussion, when members are called to stand in their place. I might say, too, that it is the responsibility of the government to maintain a quorum. I thank the member for Bass.

Ms RYAN
 (Lalor—Opposition Whip) (16:22):  I rise for the third time in an attempt to complete this speech on the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2014, which only goes to show my commitment. I begin where I finished by saying that the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act already provides for statutory civil penalties where a party knowingly or recklessly contravenes an order or direction made by the federal court or the Fair Work Commission under the registered organisations act or the Fair Work Act.


Under the Fair Work Act, officers of registered organisations already have fiduciary duties akin to those of directors under the Corporations Law. The registered organisations act already requires officers to disclose their personal interests. It already requires officers to disclose when payments are made to related parties. It already requires officers to exercise care and diligence, act with good faith and not improperly use their position for political advantage. It is, therefore, not surprising that we should question the motives of this government and the reasons for the introduction of these proposed reforms.


The government promised to regulate registered organisations in the same way as corporations. However, they have broken that promise. This bill places higher penalties and a more onerous regime on officers of registered organisations than those that are imposed on company directors. There are still recommendations to come from the various inquiries this government has established. Wouldn't it make more sense to wait for those outcomes and recommendations? This bill is pre-emptive and ill-conceived and it is also a broken promise.


Why is this government rushing to impose this onerous regime and penalties that exceed those in the Corporations Act? As always, we need to question the motivation of the government. Is this just a political attack on unions. I will remind members of the impact on workers when Work Choices was introduced in 2006, to help them think about and determine whether this legislation is just an attack on unions. Three workers at a cabinet installation company in the west of Melbourne were sacked on the day Work Choices came into effect and then offered casual positions at a lower rate of pay. Seventy Optus workers received letters from the company directing them to a seminar to teach them how to set themselves up as contractors. As contractors they would be up to $300 a week worse off and would have to pay $12,000 for their own van, as well as workers compensation, superannuation and other overheads. A woman employee of 15 years was sacked while she was on sick leave, just days after the Work Choices laws came into effect. A clerical employee was dismissed via email for requesting her pay, which was six weeks in arrears. A university student was working in a medium sized business which dismissed all permanent employees on the day the new legislation came into effect. They were offered AWAs with lower levels of pay and worse conditions. A young worker lost her job in a cafe after refusing to sign an AWA which included a hefty pay cut. A hairdressing apprentice was offered a contract which included an unpaid trial as a condition of employment and no overtime or penalty rates.


Workplace laws are about balance between the workers and the employers. They are about balance between unions and big business. They are about balance between law breaking and good governance. Is this legislation about balance or is it just an ideological attack? We have reason not to trust the coalition when it comes to workplace relations. They have form. In 2004, they did not tell the Australian people about their plans to introduce Work Choices and AWAs. In 2005, they told the Australian people their pay and conditions were protected by law, when they were not. In 2008, Tony Abbott said Work Choices was:


… good for wages, it was good for jobs and it was good for workers. And let’s never forget that.


In his book Battlelines, Tony Abbott said, 'Work Choices wasn't all bad.' Labor will not support a politically motivated witch-hunt designed to kill off unions just because the government seeks to reward its friends in big business.

"Tehan, Dan, MP",LP,2014-07-15,"



Mr TEHAN 

(
Wannon
) 
(
16:27
):  I rise to speak on the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2014, which amends the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009 to achieve greater accountability and transparency for registered organisations. It is a bill that I would have thought would have bipartisan support. What could be wrong with increased transparency in the way registered organisations operate? Sadly, the changes that we are proposing be made do not have bipartisan support.


I began to wonder why would it be that those opposite would not support a bill like this. It did not take long for me to begin to understand why there might be some sensitivities. We have seen that at first hand in Victoria through the evidence that has come up in the royal commission into the construction industry that is going on at the moment. We have seen some very concerning developments, especially when it comes to the CFMEU, which in Victoria has been accused of nepotism, blackmail, threats and cartel behaviour. I would have thought that, when there are accusations of that type, both sides of the political fence would seek to act. I would have thought that one would particularly seek to act if that behaviour was having a flow-on effect on how that industry operated in the state. Sadly, that has not been occurring.


It is problematic, to say the least, that we are not seeing action taken. In the previous parliament—this came up again, today—we saw issues regarding the Health Services Union. We had those opposite taking up the cause, or the supposed cause, of nurses today, yet in the previous parliament, when the Health Services Union was seen to have acted—or those in senior administrative positions were seen to have acted—in a way which was not befitting of how those in senior roles in organisations should operate, we heard nothing from the other side. These senior members of the HSU were operating in a way where it would seem that they were misusing union funds and that those union funds had been collected from some of the lowest paid workers in the union movement, yet nothing was done. It was as a result of that that, before the election, we on this side decided that some action needed to be taken, and the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill will achieve greater accountability and transparency for registered organisations.


You might ask in particular, when it comes to some of these unions, why we might not have bipartisan support for this bill here today. Most disturbing of all is the connection in Victoria between the CFMEU and the Victorian Leader of the Opposition, Daniel Andrews. There have been calls for the Labor Party in Victoria to distance themselves from the CFMEU, to not accept the donations that they receive from the CFMEU and to ensure that, instead of the CFMEU being party to the Labor Party in Victoria, Labor should do the right thing and say, 'No, sorry. If you're going to behave like that, we won't have you as part of our organisation.' But that, sadly, has not happened.


I thought we might see federally, here in Canberra, some action along those lines as well. It seemed to me that the federal Leader of the Opposition, with his detailed knowledge of how the union movement should work in this situation, might step in and say to Daniel Andrews, the Leader of the Opposition in the Victorian state parliament, 'Sorry, the Labor Party cannot condone this type of behaviour. We need to distance ourselves from it. We have to come out strongly against this type of behaviour.' I thought we might see some real leadership from the Leader of the Opposition on this issue. I thought we might have seen him decide, 'Yes, we do need to see more transparency when it comes to registered organisations. We do need to see greater accountability and, therefore, we will support what the government is trying to do here. After all, everyone stands to benefit.' Yet we have not seen that.


What we instead have seen is the Labor Party remaining silent. This is despite the evidence being detailed at the commission. To get it on the record, counsel assisting the commission detailed the claims in his opening statement. At a meeting between Boral representatives and the CFMEU, Mr Setka, the state secretary, said words to the effect: 'We are at war with Grocon, and in a war you cut the supply lines. All wars end and, once peace is established, the CFMEU will be at the table to divide up the spoils. The CFMEU will decide who gets what and what market share Boral will get.' That is the way that the CFMEU seeks to operate.


I find it passing strange that the Labor Party are prepared to sit silently by and let a union which is affiliated to the Labor Party behave in this manner. I think it is time that they understood that real leadership requires, at some stage, for you to stand up for what you truly believe in—you stand up for what you think is right; you stand up and say, 'Enough is enough.' This is the situation that we have reached and this is why the government is acting. This type of behaviour must be stopped so that we can have a construction industry, in Victoria for instance, which can operate without fear, without intimidation and without blackmail. The only way you can do that is to ensure that there is transparency and accountability in the way that these organisations operate.


We have seen some other things come up. The Fair Work Building and Construction agency is taking the CFMEU's president, Ralph Edwards, to the Federal Court over claims he intimidated Red & Blue Scaffolding. The statement of claim said that Mr Edwards allegedly told the firm:


The rules of the union are, we choose who is shop steward—if you want to have a business and a working relationship with me.


According to media reports:


When the contractor refused, the union official allegedly said: 'Well done, you've sacked your own workforce. You will be out of business.'


That is the type of intimidation that we are, sadly, seeing in workplaces as a result of this particular organisation operating without the government being able to take the right type of action to deal with it.


How does this bill interact with the previous government's amendments? The previous government's amendments, contained in the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Act, demonstrated that there is a need for increased financial accountability of registered organisations, strengthened investigation powers and increased penalties. However, these changes were not adequate. That is why this bill strengthens reporting and disclosure obligations to align more closely with the Corporations Act, moves obligations from the rules of registered organisations to the face of the legislation and gives the new commissioner greater scope to ensure that officers are complying with their obligations and greater powers to investigate when a member makes a complaint about a registered organisation. It is fairly straightforward, yet those opposite say that this is a bridge too far. Once again I ask why would they not want to take these extra necessary steps when we had evidence in the last parliament about the Health Services Union and the behaviour that went on there. Sadly, it was evidence which played out almost on a daily basis in this place. Now that the royal commission has moved to Victoria, we have further evidence of that occurring within the construction industry. The allegations detailed against the CFMEU involve behaviour taking place not just in the last 12 months—it dates back to the Westgate Bridge and the desal plant, and now it relates to Grocon and to Boral. This is why we need to introduce these amendments to the bill.


I would say to those opposite that you need to step back and think about what message your opposition is sending to the broader community. Daniel Andrews, the Leader of the Opposition in Victoria, looks extremely weak. I know that people would be looking at his actions and saying, 'Is this the type of leader we want—one who will not stand up to threats of blackmail and intimidation?' When it comes to the Leader of the Opposition federally, they will be looking and saying the same thing, 'Is it proper leadership when you have people or associations affiliated to your party who are acting in this way, and you stand by and say and do nothing?' That sends a very powerful message. All we have heard from the Leader of the Opposition here in Canberra is that he wants the royal commission to run its course. He said that he does not want to provide a running commentary on it. He does not need to provide a running commentary on it; instead, he can take some action to ensure that this type of behaviour cannot continue. The best type of action he could take is come in here when we vote on this bill and support the government. The history and the examples that we have seen over the last five to six years and beyond clearly show that, in these rotten little burrows, we need to stamp out these types of activities. We have seen these activities in the HSU, and we see them in the examples relating to the CFMEU that are coming before the royal commission.


This amending legislation before us today deserves to be supported. I know that the Minister for Education, who will address us next, is very keen on ensuring that this legislation and the amendments in it see the light of day. As he illustrated very clearly in question time today, we have had enough of those opposite saying, 'We don't like this type of behaviour. We need to see some action.' This legislation provides action, because it means that we can hold these registered organisations accountable. We can make sure that there is proper transparency and ensure that those unions which are doing their jobs can continue to do that, and that rogues that are using practices like nepotism, blackmail, threats and cartel behaviour cannot continue to operate in this manner.


In summation, this is a mature government acting in a mature way and putting forward some sensible amendments to a piece of legislation which will ensure that all Australians benefit when it comes to how unions and others operate within our community.

Mr PYNE
 (Sturt—Leader of the House and Minister for Education) (16:42):  It is a pleasure to rise to close the debate on the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2014. Given that the bill is being debated by this House for a second time, I will not seek to take the House's time in covering, again, the same issues I spoke on before. That said, I would like to thank all of the members for their contribution to this debate and take the opportunity to clarify the operation of this bill, following the contributions made by some of the members of the opposition.


The Registered Organisations Commission, when established, will have an important education function in assisting registered organisations and their officials to understand and work with these laws. To be clear, officials and registered organisations will be able to get advice and assistance to help them in their duties and to understand the framework. Should this bill pass the parliament, the Registered Organisations Commission will be there to help and assist but, if there is illegality or continued and deliberate noncompliance with the laws, they will have the powers available to prosecute and allow the court to decide on penalties. In almost all cases, these are set at maximum penalties and can be issued at the court's discretion. Consistent with longstanding practice, the courts will have the ability to determine the penalty within the framework provided within this legislation. The seriousness test is drawn from the Corporations Act and, again, will be at the discretion of the courts to use. The courts will be able to exercise discretion in the same way as under that act.


Some members have expressed concern about the new provisions, which are also modelled on the Corporations Act, that make it a criminal offence to breach the duties of a registered organisation's office holder. Let me be very clear: these provisions are in the Corporations Act today, and many voluntary officeholders and community groups are held to a similar standard. The only people who have anything to fear from these provisions are those who do the wrong thing and, importantly, are found by a court of law to have done so. The government would ask the Registered Organisations Commissioner to create fact sheets to assist officials within registered organisations to understand these provisions. It is also expected that the training required under this bill will adequately equip any office holder to understand their responsibilities under these provisions.


This House has now dealt with amendments that seek to fix the law as it currently stands. Unless these amendments pass this parliament as a whole, officials of registered organisations will run the very real risk of being in breach of the laws as they stand today in relation to the issues identified by the opposition that I mentioned earlier.


In closing, I would encourage all members of this place to seriously look at this bill and today support the honest and hardworking members of registered organisations who want peace of mind that their fees and dues are going to an open and transparent organisation. I commend the bill to the House.


Question agreed to.

(3) The Commissioner may grant the exemption subject to any conditions that the Commissioner considers appropriate in the circumstances.


I am pleased to move the government amendments that have been circulated. They will improve this bill and, importantly, fix a number of implementation issues that have arisen under the current framework. In 2012 the now Leader of the Opposition introduced amendments to this act which were rushed through the parliament with minimal consideration. Since that time, a number of issues have arisen that need rectification.


Interestingly, a number of the issues that have arisen as a result of the now Leader of the Opposition's own amendments have been bizarrely identified by those opposite as reasons not to support this bill. For example, Labor members have said in this debate that disclosure goes above and beyond the Corporations Act. For the benefit of members opposite, I can advise that the level of disclosure was introduced by the now Leader of the Opposition himself in his second reading speech, saying:


This bill will require the rules of registered organisations to provide for the disclosure of remuneration, including board fees, of the five highest paid officials of the organisation as well as the two highest paid in each branch, to the members of the organisation. Determining the five highest paid officials will be based upon monetary remuneration rather than non-cash benefits. However, where an official's remuneration is required to be disclosed, that disclosure will require non-cash benefits paid to the official to be identified.


These requirements came into effect on 1 January this year under the current act as implemented by the Leader of the Opposition.


Labor members have said in this debate that disclosure is too invasive and covers family members. The government agrees and again notes that this level of disclosure was introduced by the now Leader of the Opposition himself. I will quote him again. He said:


Under the amendments proposed by the government, registered organisations will be required to amend their rules to provide for the disclosure of transactions between the organisation and related parties, which may include the family members of officials.


These requirements came into effect on 1 January this year.


Labor members have said in the debate that even those with lots of experience require the training, but this was another requirement introduced by the now Leader of the Opposition. His new training requirement required that all existing officers received training before 1 July.


Today the opposition will have the opportunity to put its money where its mouth is and support fixing these problems that have come up as a result as the Leader of the Opposition's rushed amendments. These amendments are common sense. They amend the disclosure requirements for officers of registered organisations to more closely align them with the Corporations Act so that the requirement to disclose material personal interest applies only to those officers whose duties relate to the financial management of the organisation. They remove the more invasive disclosure requirements for officers of registered organisations to report family members' material personal interests and thereby more closely align with the Corporations Act.


The amendments align the material personal interest disclosure requirement for officers of registered organisations with the Corporations Act so that disclosures need to be made only to the governing body and not to the entire membership. They limit disclosures of related payments to payments made above a certain prescribed threshold with certain other exceptions based on the exceptions of the Corporations Act and member approval of related party transactions.


Finally, the amendments provide the Registered Organisations Commissioner with the discretion to waive the training requirements of officers of registered organisations if the commissioner is satisfied they fully understand their financial duties because of their level of qualification—for example, if a member is a certified and practising accountant.


Let me be very clear: unless these amendments pass the parliament, officials of registered organisations will continue to run the very real risk of being in breach of the laws as they stand today in relation to the issues identified by the opposition that I mentioned earlier. If this bill and these amendments are not passed, officials of registered organisations must declare all material personal interests of their family members under the current law or face financial penalties. So the opposition has a decision to make. It can either support the coalition's efforts to clean up this mess created by the Leader of the Opposition or it can allow its laws to prevail and see the consequences of that. I commend the amendments to the House.

Ms RYAN
 (Lalor—Opposition Whip) (16:22):  I rise for the third time in an attempt to complete this speech on the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2014, which only goes to show my commitment. I begin where I finished by saying that the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act already provides for statutory civil penalties where a party knowingly or recklessly contravenes an order or direction made by the federal court or the Fair Work Commission under the registered organisations act or the Fair Work Act.


Under the Fair Work Act, officers of registered organisations already have fiduciary duties akin to those of directors under the Corporations Law. The registered organisations act already requires officers to disclose their personal interests. It already requires officers to disclose when payments are made to related parties. It already requires officers to exercise care and diligence, act with good faith and not improperly use their position for political advantage. It is, therefore, not surprising that we should question the motives of this government and the reasons for the introduction of these proposed reforms.


The government promised to regulate registered organisations in the same way as corporations. However, they have broken that promise. This bill places higher penalties and a more onerous regime on officers of registered organisations than those that are imposed on company directors. There are still recommendations to come from the various inquiries this government has established. Wouldn't it make more sense to wait for those outcomes and recommendations? This bill is pre-emptive and ill-conceived and it is also a broken promise.


Why is this government rushing to impose this onerous regime and penalties that exceed those in the Corporations Act? As always, we need to question the motivation of the government. Is this just a political attack on unions. I will remind members of the impact on workers when Work Choices was introduced in 2006, to help them think about and determine whether this legislation is just an attack on unions. Three workers at a cabinet installation company in the west of Melbourne were sacked on the day Work Choices came into effect and then offered casual positions at a lower rate of pay. Seventy Optus workers received letters from the company directing them to a seminar to teach them how to set themselves up as contractors. As contractors they would be up to $300 a week worse off and would have to pay $12,000 for their own van, as well as workers compensation, superannuation and other overheads. A woman employee of 15 years was sacked while she was on sick leave, just days after the Work Choices laws came into effect. A clerical employee was dismissed via email for requesting her pay, which was six weeks in arrears. A university student was working in a medium sized business which dismissed all permanent employees on the day the new legislation came into effect. They were offered AWAs with lower levels of pay and worse conditions. A young worker lost her job in a cafe after refusing to sign an AWA which included a hefty pay cut. A hairdressing apprentice was offered a contract which included an unpaid trial as a condition of employment and no overtime or penalty rates.


Workplace laws are about balance between the workers and the employers. They are about balance between unions and big business. They are about balance between law breaking and good governance. Is this legislation about balance or is it just an ideological attack? We have reason not to trust the coalition when it comes to workplace relations. They have form. In 2004, they did not tell the Australian people about their plans to introduce Work Choices and AWAs. In 2005, they told the Australian people their pay and conditions were protected by law, when they were not. In 2008, Tony Abbott said Work Choices was:


… good for wages, it was good for jobs and it was good for workers. And let’s never forget that.


In his book Battlelines, Tony Abbott said, 'Work Choices wasn't all bad.' Labor will not support a politically motivated witch-hunt designed to kill off unions just because the government seeks to reward its friends in big business.

Mr TEHAN 

(
Wannon
) 
(
16:27
):  I rise to speak on the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2014, which amends the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009 to achieve greater accountability and transparency for registered organisations. It is a bill that I would have thought would have bipartisan support. What could be wrong with increased transparency in the way registered organisations operate? Sadly, the changes that we are proposing be made do not have bipartisan support.


I began to wonder why would it be that those opposite would not support a bill like this. It did not take long for me to begin to understand why there might be some sensitivities. We have seen that at first hand in Victoria through the evidence that has come up in the royal commission into the construction industry that is going on at the moment. We have seen some very concerning developments, especially when it comes to the CFMEU, which in Victoria has been accused of nepotism, blackmail, threats and cartel behaviour. I would have thought that, when there are accusations of that type, both sides of the political fence would seek to act. I would have thought that one would particularly seek to act if that behaviour was having a flow-on effect on how that industry operated in the state. Sadly, that has not been occurring.


It is problematic, to say the least, that we are not seeing action taken. In the previous parliament—this came up again, today—we saw issues regarding the Health Services Union. We had those opposite taking up the cause, or the supposed cause, of nurses today, yet in the previous parliament, when the Health Services Union was seen to have acted—or those in senior administrative positions were seen to have acted—in a way which was not befitting of how those in senior roles in organisations should operate, we heard nothing from the other side. These senior members of the HSU were operating in a way where it would seem that they were misusing union funds and that those union funds had been collected from some of the lowest paid workers in the union movement, yet nothing was done. It was as a result of that that, before the election, we on this side decided that some action needed to be taken, and the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill will achieve greater accountability and transparency for registered organisations.


You might ask in particular, when it comes to some of these unions, why we might not have bipartisan support for this bill here today. Most disturbing of all is the connection in Victoria between the CFMEU and the Victorian Leader of the Opposition, Daniel Andrews. There have been calls for the Labor Party in Victoria to distance themselves from the CFMEU, to not accept the donations that they receive from the CFMEU and to ensure that, instead of the CFMEU being party to the Labor Party in Victoria, Labor should do the right thing and say, 'No, sorry. If you're going to behave like that, we won't have you as part of our organisation.' But that, sadly, has not happened.


I thought we might see federally, here in Canberra, some action along those lines as well. It seemed to me that the federal Leader of the Opposition, with his detailed knowledge of how the union movement should work in this situation, might step in and say to Daniel Andrews, the Leader of the Opposition in the Victorian state parliament, 'Sorry, the Labor Party cannot condone this type of behaviour. We need to distance ourselves from it. We have to come out strongly against this type of behaviour.' I thought we might see some real leadership from the Leader of the Opposition on this issue. I thought we might have seen him decide, 'Yes, we do need to see more transparency when it comes to registered organisations. We do need to see greater accountability and, therefore, we will support what the government is trying to do here. After all, everyone stands to benefit.' Yet we have not seen that.


What we instead have seen is the Labor Party remaining silent. This is despite the evidence being detailed at the commission. To get it on the record, counsel assisting the commission detailed the claims in his opening statement. At a meeting between Boral representatives and the CFMEU, Mr Setka, the state secretary, said words to the effect: 'We are at war with Grocon, and in a war you cut the supply lines. All wars end and, once peace is established, the CFMEU will be at the table to divide up the spoils. The CFMEU will decide who gets what and what market share Boral will get.' That is the way that the CFMEU seeks to operate.


I find it passing strange that the Labor Party are prepared to sit silently by and let a union which is affiliated to the Labor Party behave in this manner. I think it is time that they understood that real leadership requires, at some stage, for you to stand up for what you truly believe in—you stand up for what you think is right; you stand up and say, 'Enough is enough.' This is the situation that we have reached and this is why the government is acting. This type of behaviour must be stopped so that we can have a construction industry, in Victoria for instance, which can operate without fear, without intimidation and without blackmail. The only way you can do that is to ensure that there is transparency and accountability in the way that these organisations operate.


We have seen some other things come up. The Fair Work Building and Construction agency is taking the CFMEU's president, Ralph Edwards, to the Federal Court over claims he intimidated Red & Blue Scaffolding. The statement of claim said that Mr Edwards allegedly told the firm:


The rules of the union are, we choose who is shop steward—if you want to have a business and a working relationship with me.


According to media reports:


When the contractor refused, the union official allegedly said: 'Well done, you've sacked your own workforce. You will be out of business.'


That is the type of intimidation that we are, sadly, seeing in workplaces as a result of this particular organisation operating without the government being able to take the right type of action to deal with it.


How does this bill interact with the previous government's amendments? The previous government's amendments, contained in the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Act, demonstrated that there is a need for increased financial accountability of registered organisations, strengthened investigation powers and increased penalties. However, these changes were not adequate. That is why this bill strengthens reporting and disclosure obligations to align more closely with the Corporations Act, moves obligations from the rules of registered organisations to the face of the legislation and gives the new commissioner greater scope to ensure that officers are complying with their obligations and greater powers to investigate when a member makes a complaint about a registered organisation. It is fairly straightforward, yet those opposite say that this is a bridge too far. Once again I ask why would they not want to take these extra necessary steps when we had evidence in the last parliament about the Health Services Union and the behaviour that went on there. Sadly, it was evidence which played out almost on a daily basis in this place. Now that the royal commission has moved to Victoria, we have further evidence of that occurring within the construction industry. The allegations detailed against the CFMEU involve behaviour taking place not just in the last 12 months—it dates back to the Westgate Bridge and the desal plant, and now it relates to Grocon and to Boral. This is why we need to introduce these amendments to the bill.


I would say to those opposite that you need to step back and think about what message your opposition is sending to the broader community. Daniel Andrews, the Leader of the Opposition in Victoria, looks extremely weak. I know that people would be looking at his actions and saying, 'Is this the type of leader we want—one who will not stand up to threats of blackmail and intimidation?' When it comes to the Leader of the Opposition federally, they will be looking and saying the same thing, 'Is it proper leadership when you have people or associations affiliated to your party who are acting in this way, and you stand by and say and do nothing?' That sends a very powerful message. All we have heard from the Leader of the Opposition here in Canberra is that he wants the royal commission to run its course. He said that he does not want to provide a running commentary on it. He does not need to provide a running commentary on it; instead, he can take some action to ensure that this type of behaviour cannot continue. The best type of action he could take is come in here when we vote on this bill and support the government. The history and the examples that we have seen over the last five to six years and beyond clearly show that, in these rotten little burrows, we need to stamp out these types of activities. We have seen these activities in the HSU, and we see them in the examples relating to the CFMEU that are coming before the royal commission.


This amending legislation before us today deserves to be supported. I know that the Minister for Education, who will address us next, is very keen on ensuring that this legislation and the amendments in it see the light of day. As he illustrated very clearly in question time today, we have had enough of those opposite saying, 'We don't like this type of behaviour. We need to see some action.' This legislation provides action, because it means that we can hold these registered organisations accountable. We can make sure that there is proper transparency and ensure that those unions which are doing their jobs can continue to do that, and that rogues that are using practices like nepotism, blackmail, threats and cartel behaviour cannot continue to operate in this manner.


In summation, this is a mature government acting in a mature way and putting forward some sensible amendments to a piece of legislation which will ensure that all Australians benefit when it comes to how unions and others operate within our community.

Mr PYNE
 (Sturt—Leader of the House and Minister for Education) (16:42):  It is a pleasure to rise to close the debate on the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2014. Given that the bill is being debated by this House for a second time, I will not seek to take the House's time in covering, again, the same issues I spoke on before. That said, I would like to thank all of the members for their contribution to this debate and take the opportunity to clarify the operation of this bill, following the contributions made by some of the members of the opposition.


The Registered Organisations Commission, when established, will have an important education function in assisting registered organisations and their officials to understand and work with these laws. To be clear, officials and registered organisations will be able to get advice and assistance to help them in their duties and to understand the framework. Should this bill pass the parliament, the Registered Organisations Commission will be there to help and assist but, if there is illegality or continued and deliberate noncompliance with the laws, they will have the powers available to prosecute and allow the court to decide on penalties. In almost all cases, these are set at maximum penalties and can be issued at the court's discretion. Consistent with longstanding practice, the courts will have the ability to determine the penalty within the framework provided within this legislation. The seriousness test is drawn from the Corporations Act and, again, will be at the discretion of the courts to use. The courts will be able to exercise discretion in the same way as under that act.


Some members have expressed concern about the new provisions, which are also modelled on the Corporations Act, that make it a criminal offence to breach the duties of a registered organisation's office holder. Let me be very clear: these provisions are in the Corporations Act today, and many voluntary officeholders and community groups are held to a similar standard. The only people who have anything to fear from these provisions are those who do the wrong thing and, importantly, are found by a court of law to have done so. The government would ask the Registered Organisations Commissioner to create fact sheets to assist officials within registered organisations to understand these provisions. It is also expected that the training required under this bill will adequately equip any office holder to understand their responsibilities under these provisions.


This House has now dealt with amendments that seek to fix the law as it currently stands. Unless these amendments pass this parliament as a whole, officials of registered organisations will run the very real risk of being in breach of the laws as they stand today in relation to the issues identified by the opposition that I mentioned earlier.


In closing, I would encourage all members of this place to seriously look at this bill and today support the honest and hardworking members of registered organisations who want peace of mind that their fees and dues are going to an open and transparent organisation. I commend the bill to the House.

"Plibersek, Tanya, MP",ALP,2014-07-15,"



Ms PLIBERSEK
 (Sydney—Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (21:00):  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has a proud history, going back to its creation in 1935 as the Department of External Affairs. Originally it was a tiny department with half a dozen officers. It grew in size and importance as Australia adopted a more independent foreign policy, a foreign policy that expressed Australian values and Australian interests rather than being just an offset of British foreign policy.


That role is just as important as ever, but the government's cuts to the Department of Foreign Affairs put its roles and its performance at risk—cuts, of course, that have come despite commitments before the election not to cut. The coalition said in its foreign affairs policy statement before the election that it would:


… implement a review of diplomatic resources and consider options ... to ensure Australia's global diplomatic network is consistent with our interests.


Well, it seems from this budget that what is 'consistent with our interests' is a $400 million cut over four years to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade budget. This year, that means reducing staff numbers by 500 people—one in eight of all DFAT staff. With an operating budget of $1.3 billion a year, that is a cut of eight per cent a year, every year, for four years.


Soon after the election the foreign minister said that she would fight for more funding for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. She told AAP in October:


Over time, I have a plan to expand our diplomatic footprint overseas and that will in some instances require new money ... Sometimes you have to spend more money to make more money.


Of course, there has been no sign of a truly expanded footprint, and instead of more money we are seeing dramatically less.


In Senate estimates we learned that the government is undertaking a 'footprint review'. The most likely outcome will of course be a smaller diplomatic footprint to reflect the smaller resources of the department. The department's Secretary, Peter Varghese, told estimates that in aid 'we will be doing less in Africa, which means the footprint we have in Africa on the development cooperation side is going to be different to what it was I2 months ago'. And I think 'different' means smaller in this case. We also learned in Senate estimates that the embassy in Baghdad will be merged with the British embassy and that the department is looking at further mergers of embassies in other places. In May, many DFAT workers were told that the department would reduce staff numbers at foreign posts by 65, out of 800 in total serving overseas. And of course there are cuts to the aid budget, which I have spoken about many times here.


Before the election, the coalition said there would be no cuts to the ABC. And in another broken promise we see that instead the government has abolished the Australia Network, a key instrument in Australia's soft-power diplomacy—the main tool for spreading the message about all aspects of Australia throughout our region.


The foreign minister probably thought that by combining AusAID with DFAT she could transfer some of the backroom costs and share them and protect DFAT from spending reductions. Instead, she has presided over massive cuts to AusAID and massive cuts to the Department of Foreign Affairs. In Canberra, responsibility for much aid policy and many aid projects has been transferred to Foreign Affairs staff who have little experience in the aid part of the work. Shifting foreign policy experts to aid tasks they are not trained for adds to the complexity of the aid work and also means that good foreign policy work that should be being done by those experienced foreign policy staff is not being done.


Staff morale has been very badly affected by the merger of AusAID with DFAT. Morale is especially low among former AusAID staff, who regard it as a hostile takeover. A staff survey conducted after the merger shows that just 33 per cent of former AusAID staff feel part of the team, compared with 70 per cent of longstanding DFAT staff. And the proportion who rate DFAT as a good place to work has slumped to 57 per cent, down from 70 per cent as recently as 2012.


So far, it seems that the merger will degrade the capability of both DFAT and AusAID, both parts of the new department, and it means that DFAT—the backbone of our foreign policy, trade and aid—is in a sorry state and getting worse.

Mr Hockey

:  the answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:


(a) Australia:


Australia has a robust set of domestic laws in place to counter base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) by multinational companies, including comprehensive controlled foreign company and thin capitalisation regimes, tough transfer pricing rules and an extensive general anti-avoidance rule.


The government is also progressing two key reforms to further respond to emerging integrity issues in the corporate tax system. These changes involve: 


Tightening and improving the thin capitalisation rules; in particular by reducing all safe harbour limits to bring them more closely into line with commercial debt levels or to regulatory requirements in the case of banks. This will broadly limit multinational enterprises from claiming excessive debt deductions in Australia. 


Changes to the exemption for foreign non-portfolio dividends. This will remove a significant tax planning opportunity that has arisen from a flaw in the current tax laws. This flaw has allowed multinational taxpayers to claim a tax exemption for interest income from loans to offshore subsidiaries, whereas this income should be assessable. The flaw has also undermined the efficacy of the thin capitalisation rules by allowing unconstrained amounts of debt to be allocated to Australia.


International cooperation complements our domestic processes and will help ensure that other countries are fulfilling their responsibilities.


The G20 is working with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to deliver the BEPS Action Plan, which identifies 15 action items to help prevent base erosion and profit shifting. 


Seven action items have outputs which will be delivered in September 2014, and the remaining items will be finalised by December 2015. 


As G20 President, Australia has a key role in facilitating these discussions about the international tax system, which is one of the key work streams in the G20 agenda. 


(b) Developing countries:


Australia recognises that many developing countries are also adversely affected by BEPS and is working both bilaterally and through international forums to help developing countries address BEPS. 


For example, in Papua New Guinea, Australia is helping to build institutional tax capacity to address transfer pricing, implement new automated systems, increase tax compliance and strengthen audit capacity. 


Australia has undertaken to increase tax-related official development assistance over the next two years. 


In the G20 context, Australia is working to ensure that developing countries can participate in and benefit from the G20's tax agenda. 


This year, the G20 is analysing the impacts of BEPS in developing countries and what the G20 can do to support developing countries address these.


The G20 will also release a roadmap on the steps developing countries can take to effectively implement the Common Reporting Standard on automatic exchange of tax information with other countries. Implementing the roadmap will help tax administrations in developing countries to identify offshore assets and investments held by their residents that may be subject to tax. This will be one important tool for developing countries to tackle tax evasion.
