Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (09:31):  I am in continuation from last night on this issue. When I was speaking on this issue last night, there was real concern about the use of the word 'significant' in the bill in terms of a threshold. What does 'significant' mean? Does it mean 20 per cent, 30 per cent or 40 per cent, particularly in the context of water use? In other words, if a carbon farming measure is approved and the minister only has to consider if it has a significant adverse impact on water in a particular area where the Carbon Farming Initiative is planned, what impact will it have on food security, local ecosystems and the viability of adjoining farms in that area if there is an issue of interception? My concern is that the word 'significant' gives too much leeway and is simply too dangerous because, at the very least, it could lead to a number of unintended consequences when it comes to the whole issue of an appropriate threshold to consider before a Carbon Farming Initiative is approved.


Ultimately any project that will have any adverse impact on water availability or Australia's food security should not be approved. We have seen the difficulties with managed investment schemes. We have seen the damage that managed investment schemes have caused to agriculture and family farmers. We have seen the damage that managed investment schemes have caused to water availability by distorting the water market, which has prejudiced many small farmers throughout Australia, par­ticularly in the Murray-Darling Basin. That has been an issue of great complaint from irrigators in the Riverland in South Australia, which I represent.


I also think it is important that we recognise early adopters of emissions reduction schemes. Indeed, that is something the Prime Minister has previously said. I agree with her that, if you have been an early adopter, you should be credited for it. I have previously spoken about the importance of early adopters and recognising irrigators who have invested significantly in water infrastructure. Well, the same theory applies here. Farmers who have taken the initiative and invested heavily in projects to independently reduce emissions should be included within this scheme. Until July 2010 they were able to access the Greenhouse Friendly scheme, but since the government's announcement in 2008 that it would introduce the Carbon Farming Initiative, their ability to trade their credits has been severely impacted. While the two-year notice was beneficial on the one hand, it also meant that credits effectively lost their value and participants in the Greenhouse Friendly scheme were unable to sell their credits. This is something that ought to be explored in the committee stages of this legislation. There also needs to be consideration for early adopters under this scheme and I will be supporting the opposition's amendment to this effect.


As I mentioned earlier, I have a number of other amendments that I will move in the committee stage. In addition to the amendments I have already mentioned, I indicate now that I will be moving an amendment to require the administrator to publish on its website, within 14 days of providing its decision to the person who made the request, its reasons for supporting or refusing the proposed methodology. It is also important that one of the functions of the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee is that it monitor all scientific research relevant to the issue of permanence and adjust permanence obligations under the act to reflect best evidence. If we are going to do this, let us rely on the evidence because, on the issue of permanence, there is a real concern amongst a number of farmers about the lack of certainty that causes. 'Permanence' is defined in the act as '100 years'. On the face of it, that gives a great deal of confidence. But it is not realistic in the context of farming practices and it is not realistic in getting a good outcome.


Let me quote from page 35 of the Senate committee report. The Chairman of the Carbon Farming and Trading Association, Michael Kiely, said:




No farmer would be silly enough to agree to 100 years for soil carbon or 100 years for anything. A 
finance lender would want to know seriously the impact on the value of the property of agreeing to such a thing. We did some research into the 100 years thing and discovered it was a policy decision, not a scientific measure ...



That is a real concern. We need to listen to key stakeholders such as the CFTA. It would be foolish not to listen to those who have that firsthand practical knowledge. This was a recommendation about the issue of permanence in the inquiry into these bills. It is important that the DOIC continue to update, amend and improve the scheme into the future. These are just some of the amend­ments I will be moving. I look forward to discussing them and debating them in more detail. I think we all agree, in this chamber, that a carbon-farming initiative is a good idea. I see agriculture as being part of the solution rather than being part of the problem when it comes to carbon but it is the detail and the implementation that will determine the effectiveness of such a scheme. If we get the detail or the implementation wrong this will be very bad news for Australian agriculture, and the monitoring and enforce­ment of the scheme will be vital. 


This scheme has the potential to be useful in the steps towards reducing CO2 and towards tackling climate change. I urge those who are sceptical about climate change to take the precautionary principle and, as Rupert Murdoch once famously said, give the planet the benefit of the doubt. But if we are going to use measures, let us use measures that are effective. Let us use measures that are cost effective, sensible, practicable and which can be well implemented.


Without knowing the full details of the government's carbon plan—it is only a few days away; this Sunday the government will make an announcement in relation to this—it would be very difficult and indeed very foolish to proceed with this legislation. That is why I will be supporting what the opposition is proposing—that we wait for the regulations. I will be putting up an alternative proposal, which I hope will be circulated shortly, in the form of a second reading amendment, that at the very least as a fall-back position we wait until next Sunday. In other words, this can wait until the next sitting period because it would be too risky, too problematic and too fraught with difficulties for this piece of legislation to be dealt with and finalised before, at the very least, we know details of the govern­ment's carbon pricing plan. I support Senator Birmingham's second reading amendment that this bill be further considered only after a draft of the final regulations is tabled, but as an alternative—the fall-back position—we should not deal with this legislation this week until we know what the government is proposing. 


Let us go back to what this bill is about. The explanatory memorandum of this bill says that this initiative has been designed to be complementary to a carbon pricing mechanism. We know that the Oxford English Dictionary defines 'complementary' as mutually complementing or completing each other's deficiencies. This bill will have a lot of deficiencies unless we get some more details about the carbon-pricing mechanism and the carbon-pricing details that the government will announce in just a few days time. 


I want this carbon-farming initiative to be effective. I want it to work. I want it to be effective in reducing CO2. Agriculture has a key role to play but I am very concerned that the framework of this bill, because it is complementary, is predicated on what a carbon-pricing mechanism will do, and until we have the details of that carbon-pricing mechanism I urge my colleagues on both sides of the house to be cautious and sensible and wait until we get those details this Sunday. That is something that I strongly urge my colleagues to do; otherwise we could well be back here in a few months time trying to unravel legislation that needs to be changed by virtue of the government's announcement this Sunday.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (09:40):  This bill is the government's attempt to introduce direct action policy. They do it badly but they are trying. The coalition agrees with the bipartisan commit­ment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and has committed to the bipartisan five per cent reduction on 2000 emissions by 2020. This bill, at its essence, is about voluntary financial incentives for farmers to improve land as a means of reducing Australia's emissions. It tries to do this by creating incentives for farmers and landholders to undertake voluntary land-sector abatement projects. The government will provide saleable Australian carbon credit units in return for eligible carbon offset projects to achieve carbon abatement and improved soil resilience. Carbon farming would have additional environmental benefits such as reducing salinity and erosion, protecting bio­diversity, regenerating landscapes, improv­ing water quality and improving agricultural soil productivity. Incentives for carbon farming are earned through abatement of greenhouse gases by capturing and destroy­ing methane emissions from landfill or livestock manure or by removing carbon from the atmosphere and storing it in soil or trees—for example, by growing forests.


So far, so good. In principle the coalition agrees with what the government is trying to achieve with this but there are some flaws in it. We would like to see the detail in the regulations before we finalise our consideration of this legislation. I also note the comments that Senator Xenophon has just made that the government shut down a very successful scheme that was previously in place—the Greenhouse Friendly scheme put in place by the Howard government. Shutting that scheme down took Australia backward rather than taking us forward in addressing our challenge of helping to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions.


But there are some things that we can do to make this legislation better. If the government supports the sensible amend­ments that we will be putting forward in the committee stages there is no doubt that this could be a very good way of making a sensible contribution to helping reduce global greenhouse gas emissions, moving forward.


But this comes in a broader policy context. This comes in the policy context of the government wanting to impose a carbon tax on Australia. This comes on top of the government wanting to impose a carbon tax when none of our major overseas trade competitors that are relevant in this context will impose either a carbon tax or an emissions trading scheme. 


The carbon tax that the government is proposing to impose as of 1 July 2012 will push up the cost of everything. It will make Australia less competitive internationally so it will cost jobs. And it will do all of that without helping to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. Why? Because it will make overseas emitters more competitive than equivalent Australian businesses, including those in Australia that are operating at world's best practice in terms of environ­mental standards. This will mean that overseas emitters will take market share from Australian businesses, which will mean that we will shift emissions overseas and we will shift jobs overseas. That will mean that a carbon tax, in the absence of an appro­priately comprehensive global agreement to price emissions, will reduce emissions in Australia in a way that increases emissions, arguably by more, in other parts of the world. This is a fundamental flaw in what the government is putting forward. Yesterday I asked the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, Senator Wong, a series of questions in question time about why carbon emissions from coal were worse than carbon emissions from petrol. If people have no choice but to use their car, why should electricity not be exempt from the carbon tax as well as petrol? Families who have to access electricity from coal fired power stations will equally not have any choice, no chance to avoid doing so.


Verve Energy in Western Australia gave evidence to the carbon tax inquiry that, irrespective of a carbon tax, they will have to continue to use coal as part of their energy mix to the same if not to a growing extent in order to ensure energy security in that state. This means that, given they are currently responsible for 8½ million tonnes of emissions, given that they are currently the 11th biggest emitter, they will have to pay between $160 million and $200 million worth of carbon tax, which will be passed on either to consumers by way of higher electricity prices or to taxpayers because, as a state owned enterprise, the electricity generator is, in that context, very likely to make a loss.


Because Minister Wong was unable to answer the questions, she went for a distraction. She made a statement in this chamber that somehow I had made a statement in September 2007. She said yesterday in question time:


I am interested that Senator Cormann has asked me about taxing petrol, because I was surprised to find his comments in the chamber, in September 2007, where he said of Mr Howard's emissions trading scheme: 'This will be the most comprehensive ETS, in the world, broader in coverage than any scheme currently operating anywhere; a world-leading scheme to cover 70 to 75 per cent of total emissions. By including large emitters alone, the scheme would cover 55 per cent of total emissions; however'—and this is the best bit, Mr President—'by including transport and other fuels the coverage of the scheme is significantly increased.' So Senator Cormann used to back an ETS which covered petrol.


I never made any such comments in this chamber or anywhere else. The minister misled the chamber. I suspect that she did not deliberately mislead the chamber. I suspect the minister's misleading of the chamber was due to some sloppy staff work. I suspect it was due to some incompetent hollowmen in her office giving her bad advice. If this is the quality of the advice she is getting in order to structure a political attack on the opposition, I really worry about the quality of the advice she is getting on the important matters of the nation. If this is the quality of the advice she is getting to run a cheap political attack in the context of not being able to answer a very important question, then no wonder we are looking at $107 billion of net government debt and no wonder we are looking at record levels of deficit year after year under this Labor administration. Clearly, this is a government that is not getting very good advice indeed. If the minister had any decency, she would come into this chamber and apologise.


Clearly, one of her advisers did have a look at my first speech in this chamber and she did, out of context, quote one particular sentence. The sentence she quoted did relate to the proposition of an emissions trading scheme:


The government's recent announcement of a national emissions trading scheme, including offsets for trade exposed industries, is a positive and sensible approach to addressing global warming.


I encourage all members opposite, and indeed people across Australia, to read my whole first speech because, if I may say so myself, it was a very good speech. In order to make sure that members opposite have a good understanding of what I actually said at the time, I am going to read them the whole quote. It is very important to have a very good understanding of what was said at the time. Let us remember that this was in August 2007 when the coalition did support an emissions trading scheme. In August 2007, all of us assumed that the United States would have an emissions trading scheme by 2010, that Japan would have an emissions trading scheme by 2010, that China would have an emissions trading scheme by 2015 and that India eventually would have an emissions trading scheme.


We know that Penny Wong, the then Minister for Climate Change and Water, and the then Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, went to Copenhagen in December 2009. Copenhagen was a massive failure and everything changed. When the facts change, good governments reassess the facts and are prepared to go for a policy rethink. This is actually what the government did at the time. The then Deputy Prime Minister, Julia Gillard and the—sadly, still—Treasurer, Wayne Swan, went to the then Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, and said: 'We should kill this ETS. This ETS is bad news, given what happened in Copenhagen.' That was very sensible advice. No doubt that is why the by-then Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, in the lead-up to the last election, said, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' She realised in 2010 that what all of us thought in 2007 may happen was not happening, that there was no foreseeable prospect or likelihood of any emissions trading scheme or any carbon tax in countries like the United States, Japan, China or Russia—many of the trade competitors of Australia. I will read the whole quote because I think it is important that senators opposite are aware of what I said back in August 2007. I know that Senator Ludwig is very interested to hear what I said:


Climate change is a challenge we are facing as a global community. If we take a sensible and considered approach to meeting that challenge, Australia can play a pivotal role in facilitating the production of clean energy for the world ... we are blessed with immense reserves of clean energy in the form of gas and uranium. No other place in the developed world has such reserves. Moreover, the growing bulk of this energy is being exported directly or indirectly in the form of processed resources to China, the epicentre of the world's growing energy challenge.


I am still reading—it is a very good speech. It goes on:


Our greatest possible contribution to addressing climate change is to export more energy. Each unit of clean energy exported from Australia reduces the consumption of less clean energy in China and elsewhere and, therefore, reduces greenhouse gas emissions.


That is exactly what a carbon tax in Australia—a price on carbon in Australia—in the absence of an appropriately comprehensive global agreement to price emissions will make harder to achieve. It will make it harder for Australia to maximise our exports of clean energy because it will make it harder for us to increase production of LNG and uranium. If we were serious about reducing global greenhouse gas emissions rather than just patting ourselves on the back for a reduction in domestic emissions here in Australia which will increase emissions in other parts of the world, we would be exporting more LNG to China—where, if LNG displaced coal, it could save five to nine tonnes of emissions for every tonne of emissions produced in Australia—and exporting uranium to India, which is something that this government is not prepared to do.


The speech is really good. It continues:


The Kyoto protocol failed to recognise the unique role that resource and technology intensive countries like Australia play in providing clean energy to the world. That is never more relevant than in a state like Western Australia.


That is an important point. I know that Labor senators get really irate when I say that if we are truly focused on one thing that is to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions—



Senator Ludwig interjecting—




Senator CORMANN:
  Here I am going to say something that is going to shock you, Senator Ludwig: if our focus was really on the reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions, it might be in the world's best interest for Australia to increase its emissions if, by our doing so, we could help to reduce emissions by a greater amount in other parts of the world. That is the point this government does not seem to understand. This government is focused on the concept that Australia is somehow an island, that somehow the sky around Australia has a boundary around it. This government thinks that, instead of the rabbit-proof fence, we have a carbon-emissions-proof fence around our sky, as if carbon emissions in other parts of the world will not make it to Australia and vice versa. There is no 'carbon-proof fence' around Australia, but who knows—one day this government may think that it would be a good policy. The way they are going, they might as well try to set up a carbon-proof fence. It would only be as ridiculous a proposition as their carbon tax proposal, which is before us at the moment.


Further on in my first speech I said:


The government’s recent announcement of a national emissions trading scheme, including offsets for trade exposed industries, is a positive and sensible approach to addressing global warming. Going forward we need to remain vigilant against pursuing one-policy-fits-all measures that fail to recognise our unique capacity, particularly in Western Australia, to use more energy and reduce global greenhouse gas emissions at the same time.


That is a fundamental point which, because it is inconvenient, this government completely fails to understand. If you look at the government's green paper back in the post Garnaut review days, there was a little sentence that recognised this point. However, it was removed in the white paper. Why did this happen? I asked officials from the climate change department. It was removed because in the absence of an appropriately comprehensive global agreement on pricing emissions this policy principle was too difficult to 'operationalise' as part of a price on carbon in Australia.


I was quite an active participant throughout 2009 in the policy debate on the proposed emissions trading scheme. We had a robust debate across Australia and across both sides of politics—and we had one also within our own party—about what the best way would be for Australia to help reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. The coalition, along with the Greens, Senator Xenophon and Senator Fielding, voted against the government's Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, first in August 2009 and then in November-December 2009. Because Senator Wong is so interested in what I have had to say about imposing a price on carbon, I will share my thoughts with her and help her advisers to find the right quote by pointing them in the right direction. In the great West Australiannewspaper on 6 October 2009 I said:


I do not think we should negotiate amendments with a view to pass the ETS legislation before Copenhagen … This flawed legislation—


the CPRS legislation—


will push up the cost of everything, put pressure on our economy and not reduce global emissions. We should wait until we know what the rest of the world is prepared to do before finalising Australia's position on the ETS.


A few days later, the same paper, the great West Australian, read:


WA Senator Mathias Cormann said waiting until after the Copenhagen conference before finalising an Australian ETS was common sense.


""Unless other relevant countries come on board with similar trading schemes, we would make overseas polluters more competitive, export emissions and jobs and any reduction in local emissions would be more than offset with increased emissions overseas,"" He said. ""That is not an effective way for Australia to help reduce global emissions.""


To finalise the trifecta of quotes, I go to the Weekend Australian, which is another very good paper. In it there was an article by Lenore Taylor, who is very supportive of emissions trading and putting a price on carbon. It read:


… West Australian senator Mathias Cormann said what he meant last week. ""After Copenhagen, the coalition parties should decide on the best policy on emissions, which may or may not include an ETS.""


That, of course, is the point. After Copenhagen—after we realised that there was no likely prospect of an emissions trading scheme, carbon taxes or explicit prices on carbon in a whole range of countries that Australia competes with—it was very clear that imposing an ETS or a carbon tax in Australia was not in our national interest because neither would help to reduce global emissions. That was the conclusion that the Labor government reached before the election, only to change its mind under pressure from the Greens after the election. The Greens voted against the emissions trading scheme because they thought it was not tough enough; it will be interesting to see what sort of carbon tax or emissions trading scheme they will be supporting as of Sunday. We will be looking very carefully at what the Greens are proposing to do.


One of the other unfortunate untruths that is being told in this argument is what the minister said again on Q&A on Monday—that is, that somehow the coalition is saying that nobody else is doing anything. The coalition is, of course, not saying that Australia is not doing anything either; Australia is doing a fair bit and could do more. But the point is this: if we are going to do more and if we are going to ask people to make sacrifices, that 'doing more' has to actually make a positive difference. A carbon tax and an emissions trading scheme in the absence of an appropriately comprehensive global agreement will not make a positive difference; arguably, it will make things worse. It will result in increased global emissions, not less, even though you might be able to pat yourself on the back about having reduced emissions domestically.


The point is: Australia is an emissions-intensive export-oriented economy. Access to cheap coal is one of the reasons why we have a very significant international competitive advantage. If we undermine our strengths in a way that will not help to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions, well, we are just being completely economically irresponsible. The way a US Republican congressman described it a few days ago, it would be 'unilateral economic disarmament', and that is not something that Australia should do. We should not be going for unilateral economic disarmament. Countries around the world understand this. Countries around the world are adopting direct action policies—whether it is the US, whether it is China—and of course what the minister does not say when she says 'other countries are doing their bit' is that other countries that we compete with are going for direct action and not for a toxic carbon tax which will make them less competitive.

"Boswell, Sen Ronald",Nats,2011-07-06,"



Senator BOSWELL
 (Queensland) (10:00):  I was not going to speak on this and I am not as prepared as I should be. My colleague Senator Nash handed me a bill of some 291 sections, and there are a couple more. We are being asked to vote on this bill when we have not got a clue what it actually means because all the detail, we hope, will be announced on Sunday. We are being asked to vote on a pig in a poke. No-one can possibly vote for this legislation unless we have the detail: how many acres of trees are we supposed to plant; are these trees going to affect food production; are these trees that we plant going to affect the townships; if we plant so many trees, are they going to have an impact on the sugar mills or the rice mills or the dairy farms? Because if you plant trees, you do not plant food and that food production cannot be processed and that has effects on the towns and employment in the towns.


This bill has had as much thought process go into it as the carbon taxing regime that the government is trying to put into place. It is about as silly as taxing Australia on carbon production. It is absolutely stupid and we are asked to vote for it. I will be supporting the amendments that we do not vote for this, that we do not carry the debate any further unless we know the detail. It is, really, an insult to this side of the chamber—or any side of the chamber. The Greens demand this, the government capitulates, a bill goes up and we have not got a clue what is in it. We are told: 'The details will be on Sunday. Please wait for this.' I say to the government: 'You have your new paradigm. It does not matter whether this bill comes in today or in two weeks time, the Greens are going to support you. You have got the numbers. Just execute the numbers more conservatively. Do not go in and try to hit the Senate over the head with a sledgehammer because that is what you are doing by asking us to vote for something that no-one knows what is in it.'


We have a direct action plan. I do not know whether this covers that. When I asked our spokesman John Cobb, he said: 'Look, there's no detail in this. Any responsible government could not possibly ask for a decision to be taken on this bill without any detail.' I suspect we will be under the lash of the new paradigm and Senator Milne will support the government on this. We will vote against it. Senator Milne will support the government and we will have a piece of legislation in that will make about as much sense as a carbon tax in Australia.


While Senator Ludwig is in the chamber I will report that I went to Indonesia last week to try to sort out some of the terrible mess that he has left over. There are people without food; people who work in cattle lots—80,000-odd of them—who have not got jobs; the insult that we have offered our neighbour of cutting off their food supply without even telling them. It is going to take a lot of diplomacy to unravel that mess. The total ill will in insults that have been offered to the Indonesians is hard to comprehend unless you go over there. They have an industry that has a lot of support over there, a lot of people working in it, and just to go and cut their supply off is unbelievable.


That is not what I want to talk about today; I will talk about that at a later stage. But the thought occurred to me when I was over there, as I saw some of the world's most extreme poverty and the government trying to do what it could to create employment, to give the people jobs: I wonder what the Indonesian contribution will be. Here are these people living in absolute poverty—they cannot even afford the kerosene for their stoves at night—going out working huge numbers of hours, and we are going to say to them: 'We want you to make a contribution to reducing carbon. We want you to live in extreme poverty. We want you to increase the price of electricity, increase the price of food, increase the price of building. We don't mind if you live in a hovel and we don't mind if you've got nothing to eat and we don't mind if you haven't got a job, but you've got to pull your weight on the environment.' What a stupid, idiotic idea. It is about as sensible as cutting off their food supply. This is what the people in Australia are saying. There is no thought in these processes. They come along with a rush of blood to the head: 'We'll have an ETS, we'll have a carbon tax and we'll expect the rest of the world to pull its weight.' I can tell you, Senator Ludwig: these people cannot go anywhere. They are trying to get out of poverty. They are trying to get somewhere decent to live. They are trying to have something to eat. They are trying to provide a job. The government is trying to provide jobs—even going to the extent of not being efficient, because efficiency costs jobs but being inefficient to provide jobs. They do not have machines, they do not have things that will cut jobs down. 


And then we come along and say: 'We have 1.4 per cent of the world's emissions and we will strangle our economy by trying to reduce it by 40 per cent. We will put steelworkers' jobs on the line, we will put cement industry jobs on the line and we will strangle our economy. We will put the jobs of all those people on the line. We will increase the costs of farms by 20 per cent—reduce the price of farmers' profits by 20 per cent.' It will ripple right through the economy. And what will it be for? For nothing. It will achieve nothing. These Third World countries that produce most of the emissions cannot move anywhere. Do you think India are going to say, 'We are going to cut our emissions down'? Senator Ludwig, maybe you can tell cabinet, if they leave you there without sacking you for your terrible mistakes—you should be sacked; if you had an decency, you would resign.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Pratt
):  Senator Boswell, please direct your comments through the chair.




Senator BOSWELL:
  Madam Acting Deputy President, I am sorry and I will direct them through you. It is just stupidity that this government can murder and emasculate our economy to try and reduce our emissions by 40 per cent. That is business as usual. They expect us to do it and, in return, the only way that can be effective is if the rest of the world joins us and reduces their emissions. Then you go to these impoverished countries—where the government is doing their best, doing their utmost, to give people jobs, to give people a living, even if it is $100 a month—and expect them to make a sacrifice for the environment, when they are living on the poverty line. You cannot do it. Any government that did it would be thrown out. There would be revolutions in the streets if you put the cost of food up. Yet we merrily go along and say, 'The world is doing something'. Let me tell you, Senator Ludwig, through the chair: in 2020, China's emissions will have risen by 496 per cent, and India's by 350 per cent. I do not know what Indonesia's will be but it will be significant.


One thing Indonesia said to me was: 'Well, you might have cut our meat supply off but you are going to be generous in sending a lot of industry over to us. You are going to send all your heavy industry over to us and maybe that will in some way pay us back for what you have done to our meat industry.' They know that the cement industry will go over there, the steel industry will go over there and the heavy industries will go over there. We will have achieved absolutely zero, because all we will have done is push our heavy industries off into Third World countries. Maybe that is a way to give them a bit of a kick-start but it will not do much for our people over here. 


We are told that we are not alone in this—everyone is pulling their weight; everyone is doing something. They are, to a lesser extent. But the best one I read was that Brazil is going to change its light bulbs. That is their contribution to reducing emissions. Good on Brazil. We are going to emasculate our industry while Brazil changes its light bulbs. How stupid is that. How absolutely stupid that we are saying we are going to introduce a carbon tax universally around Australia. We are the only single country that is going to do this. Yes, the EU has a carbon tax, and that carbon tax will extract $2 billion in five years. Let us say it is $2.5 billion. That is what a carbon tax is going to take out of the economy of the EU, which is probably 20 times bigger than our economy. But, at the behest of the Greens, we have to make a sacrifice. The Greens want a sacrifice. The Greens want blood. The Greens want workers' blood. Who goes along with it? Senator Ludwig and all the other Labor senators, because they have not got the guts to stand up to the Greens and say: 'This is just ridiculous. This is just stupid.'


In one year the Australian scheme will take out over $10 billion. That is what we are going to extract from our economy. We have heard about the US regional schemes. All the states are doing their bit. No-one is bludging on the system. Everyone is doing things. In two years they have extracted well under $2 billion. I cannot believe the stupidity of the absolutely ridiculous proposition that we are being asked to support. Let us forget whether the science is right or wrong. I have never questioned the science; I do not think there is an answer to the science. You do not have to go to the science to know this is the most ridiculous scheme that was ever put up because it will not work unless everyone participates in it. It cannot work unless you get India, China, the Philippines and Indo­nesia—these big countries with emissions—to join in. They cannot join in because they have got nowhere to go. They have got their people living in poverty, and the govern­ments of those countries are rightfully trying to lift their people out of poverty.


If you, Senator Ludwig, had gone over to Indonesia instead of sending a message that 'We've just cut your food supply off—don't worry about it,' you would have seen that there are significant emissions around Indo­nesia. Yes, there is a bit of smog around and there is smog around China. I have never been to India but I suspect there is over there too. But what is the alternative? To tell these people to starve? To tell them to live in a cardboard box? To tell them not to light their stoves? Where have they got to go? You are asking these people to live in poverty for the rest of their lives, to never crawl out of it. You say you are for the workers. I do not know: if we treated farmers the way you treat workers, the way you treat unionists, we would get tarred, feathered and run out of town. But you just treat them as absolute simpletons that do not understand anything and you expect them to vote for you.


I can tell you I have been in this game a long time—a lot longer than many of you—and I can see what is going to happen here. You are completely wedged between the Left and the Right. The conservative blue-collar family man who is concerned about his electricity costs is voting for us. The doctors' wives are voting for the Greens, and you are wedged in the middle and you are going nowhere except down. You can almost see your polls are like an elevator descending one floor after another: from 34, 33, 30, 29, 27. You will stop at about floor 25, and the Greens will just about come up and take the second position in parliament.


You have to realise it. The National Party realised it when they were fighting against One Nation. There is only one way to stop it: stand up for your constituents and prove that the Greens are completely hopeless, useless and not in this world. Until you face that, you are dead meat and you are going to get carved away, inch by inch. At the end of next election you will not have the Oakeshotts and the Windsors to rely on; you will be absolutely emasculated and run out of office. It will take you another four or five terms to recover.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (10:17):  I would like to thank senators for their contribution to the debate on the Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Bill 2011, Carbon Credits (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2011 and the Australian National Registry of Emiss­ions Units Bill 2011. 


I would also like to thank members of the land sector and Indigenous working group for their important contribution to these bills. The government has listened and acted in response to the issues raised. The recommen­dations by the National Farmers Federation is a case in point, and today I will move an amendment to the Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Bill to add to the list of matters that must be considered to include whether there is a significant risk that that kind of project would have a significant adverse impact on land access for agricult­ural production.


The government has committed to create opportunities in the agricultural, forestry or legacy waste sectors for the creation of new revenue streams through the reduction or storage of carbon pollution. The Carbon Farming Initiative fulfils this commitment. It would contribute to improving farm productivity, create jobs in regions, provide new opportunities for Indigenous commun­ities, enhance our biosecurity and build resilience to the impacts of climate change. Around the country, innovative farmers, landholders and scientists have been developing ways to improve the health of agricultural soils, improve herd efficiency, recycle waste and to farm and manage their land more sustainably.


The Carbon Farming Initiative will create incentives to protect our natural environment and adopt more sustainable farming practices as well as mitigate climate change. Increasing carbon storage in agricultural soils improves soil health and productivity. Revegetation will help restore degraded landscapes and protect biodiversity. Tree planting can help to address salinity and reduce erosion. This is important because the agricultural sector in Australia is likely to be one of the most strongly affected by climate change.


The Carbon Farming Initiative balances environmental integrity with administrative simplicity. An independent expert committee, the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee, has been established to ensure that estimation methodologies are rigorous and lead to real and verifiable abatement. This committee is now consulting on five draft methodologies with more in the pipeline, including matters such as re­afforestation; forest management and native forest protection; savanna fire management; landfill gas recovery and manure manage­ment; and management of methane from livestock, soil carbon and biochaff.


Carbon storage has to be permanent if it is going to be treated as equivalent to carbon emissions from the industrial sectors. The provisions to deal with permanence are rigorous, yet they are flexible and well suited to Australian conditions. We have also put in place arrangements to ensure that adverse impacts are avoided. Some have commented about the threat to prime agricultural land from tree planting. The government is confident that prime agricultural land is not at risk, and the legislative structure will prevent perverse outcomes: (1) while permanent tree planting will be rewarded, those responsible must take into account applicable natural resource management plans; (2) all state, territory and Common­wealth requirements must be complied with, including any water entitlements which may be required; (3) managed investment schemes will not be eligible because short rotation commercial forestry will fail the common practice test and management investment schemes will be explicitly excluded; (4) the economics of carbon credits are such that land use change is likely to occur on marginal agricultural land as evidenced by recent estimates of abatement by the department of CSIRO. It must also be remembered that the Carbon Farming Initiative is not just about tree planting but also covers a wide range of agricultural practices which reduce emissions, such as better fertiliser use, manure management and enhancing soil carbon. Many of these practices increase the productivity of prime agricultural land and this initiative will provide a new income stream for those who take up new and more sustainable farm practices.


The proposed legislation includes provisions to exclude activities that carry a high risk of adverse outcomes on the environment and local communities through a negative list which will be contained in regulation. The government will include activities on the negative list that pose a significant risk to the availability of water, to the conservation of biodiversity, to employ­ment or to local communities. These activities will not be eligible to receive carbon credits under the Carbon Farming Initiative. The Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency has under­taken a first-pass risk assessment of carbon forest activities and released this for public comment.


The government's position is that the following activities be on the negative list: establishing vegetation on land cleared of native vegetation since 1 July 2007, establishing a known weed species, establishing forest in conditions where it would risk impacts on the availability of water and establishing a forest as part of a managed investment scheme. The govern­ment recognises the need to monitor issues that may be raised with crediting metho­dologies and will engage with local government, natural resource management bodies and other stakeholders on whether additional activities should be added to the negative list. The government also recog­nises the need to act promptly with respect to these issues to ensure that perverse outcomes for biodiversity or agricultural land use are avoided. Negative list activities and the circumstances in which they apply will be tightly defined to avoid prohibiting low-risk projects.


With the content of the key regulations and the first methodologies now published, there is no reason to delay the passage of these bills. Investment in further metho­dologies and the underpinning science is dependent upon stakeholders having certainty that the initiative will actually go ahead. This is why it is essential for parliament to pass these bills and not continue to find excuses for delay. The environmental integrity of the Carbon Farming Initiative is essential to the value and credibility of the credits that are created.


The government recognises that some types of carbon projects indirectly cause emissions elsewhere in the economy through the effect of leakage. For example, a project based on preventing logging in part of our native forest estate could lead to an increase in logging elsewhere in the country if demand for timber remains. If unaddressed, leakage can reduce or even obviate abate­ment from such projects. The regulatory framework requirement for streamlined accounting treatments for leakage are to be incorporated in the methodologies. The Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency is currently developing mandatory guidelines to establish the accounting rules for dealing with leakage. This will be based on a discounting approach which identifies the likely risk and extent of leakage for projects based on forecasts about supply and demand in the relevant market. The government will work closely with key stakeholders to develop this guidance.


Another key to environmental integrity is the risk of reversal buffer. The government recognises the need to keep this under review as further evidence is gathered of potential risks. The CSIRO is well placed to do further work in this area.


The government is committed to ensuring Indigenous Australians can participate in and benefit from the Carbon Farming Initiative. The first methodology to be released for public comment under the Carbon Farming Initiative, 'savanna fire management', could inject over $2 million of revenue each year to projects such as those in western Arnhem Land. The government is consulting with Indigenous Australians to work through implementation issues with this initiative. In committing to ensure that they stand to benefit to this end, clarifying the consent rights of non-exclusive possession with native title holders will be important.


The government also recognises that other groups may need to be prescribed by regulation as having eligible interests, in particular those who hold mining leases over an area of land or have a legitimate interest in projects involving the same area of land, will be prescribed as eligible interests. The government also accepts the need to work with natural resource management bodies to improve the consistency of regional plan­ning. The government recognises the need to help build carbon literacy amongst land­holders and has already engaged Landcare facilitators to communicate the benefits and responsibilities involved with the initiative to interested stakeholders. We will continue to work with landholders, including Indigenous leaders, to ensure that they have the greatest ability to capitalise on the benefits of this very substantial opportunity for regional Australia.


In summing up, these bills before the Senate today will provide real opportunity to regional and rural Australians to be part of the climate change solution. We do appreciate that this sector needs to learn more about the potential abatement oppor­tunities by making a start with the Carbon Farming Initiative and getting projects on the ground. I commend the bills to the Senate.

These amendments are essentially designed to improve what is currently bad legislation because there are some important issues which have been identified by the WA state government and others around Australia. There is the potential for some real negative ramifications for states with significant areas of crown land if these amendments are not approved by the Senate. Of course, the Senate is the states house, so I am sure that senators on all sides of the chamber will reflect on their responsibilities to act as representatives of the states and will very carefully consider the amendments that the coalition is putting forward and, of course, then support them. They are sensible amendments that would improve what is currently somewhat flawed legislation.


I will go through the amendments in detail. As a senator for Western Australia, I will focus a little bit on some of the circumstances in WA to make a point, but it does have broader application. Of WA, 36 per cent is vacant crown land. The amendments that we are proposing would make the following changes. States need to have what would be described as an 'eligible interest' over crown land. Under the bill as drafted it is not clear at all that state governments would have an eligible interest over all crown lands and, given that the state could incur residual liabilities as a third party under the carbon maintenance obligations in the bill, for example, the coalition believes it is only reasonable that state governments should have a declared eligible interest in the land and be consulted before a carbon farming scheme is allowed. So amendments (3), (4) and (5) ensure that the relevant state minister in all states has an eligible interest over projects on crown lands.


There is also the issue of subsurface rights. It is important to make clear that subsurface rights are protected in the bill, particularly to avoid negative impacts on petroleum tenements. Amendment (1) addresses the subsurface rights issue by expanding the definition of eligible rights in land to include subsurface right interests in land.


Further, in relation to native title, exclusive possession native title holders under the bill have an eligible interest in carbon sequestration. This effectively gives them a right of veto and requires further consultation in addition to that required under the Native Title Act 1993 future act process. This kind of veto power would have negative ramifications on development and as such would not be in the national interest or in the interests of respective state economies. The amendment makes clear that the Native Title Act 1993 future act provisions apply to native title consents under this proposed legislation. The issue is addressed in amendments (2), (6) and (7).


In this context, I will read relevant correspondence that I received from the Minister for Mines and Petroleum, Minister for Fisheries, Minister for Electoral Affairs and the Leader of the Government in the Legislative Council in the great state of Western Australia. I will just read it in part:


I am writing to express the concerns of the Western Australian State Government with regards to the content which is intended to be drafted into the Commonwealth Government's Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Bill 2011 (CFI bill). I believe it is important that you … are aware of the potential implications of the proposed legislation to Western Australia's land and tenure system, and resource exploration and production. The concerns contained in this letter were expressed by the following State Departments: the Department of Regional Development and Lands, the Department of Mines and Petroleum, and the Office of Native Title.


According to the Proposed treatment of native title and land rights land under the CFI Bill discussion paper circulated by the Commonwealth Department of Climate Change January 2011,   there are three ways that land interests are relevant to projects under the CFI bill:


First, the proponent must have the legal right to carry out the project.


Second, each sequestration project proponent must have the carbon sequestration rights.


Third, for sequestration projects, each holder of a registered interest on Torrens system land or legal interest on Crown land (called 'eligible interests') must provide their consent.


So this bill will:


… deem that exclusive possession native title holders are eligible to participate in the carbon sequestration scheme; i.e. exclusive possession native title holders have 'eligible interests'. Further, no other person is taken to hold the applicable carbon sequestration right in relation to the project area or the legal right to carry out the project. As the holders of an eligible interest, the native title holders would need to provide their consent before any sequestration project may proceed on the land. 


In Western Australia ownership of minerals and petroleum resources are vested in the State. Mineral exploration and mining entities may access rights to minerals, subject to payment of rents and royalties, by obtaining mining titles to exclusively explore and develop the mineral resources. Mining in Western Australia is administered under the State's Mining Act 1978. Similarly, exploration and production of petroleum is permitted only under the provisions of the Western Australian Petroleum and Geothermal Energy Resources Act 1967.


In the same way as an owner of freehold land has an interest in that freehold land, the State of Western Australia has an underlying interest in Crown land, including Crown land that is determined to be exclusive possession native title. The CFI bill however makes no provision for the State to be consulted or, as the holder of an interest in Crown land, to give consent for sequestration projects. As with any other party with an interest in Crown land, the State should also be required to give consent to any CFI scheme including any CFI scheme proposed on exclusive possession native title land.


There is potential for the State of Western Australia to have liabilities to third parties if a carbon sequestration project is created over Crown land without the State's consent. For example, the land could have been allocated for a major resource or other development, or the area may be subject to a contract to give tenure over that land. Conflicts may arise if mining or petroleum tenements are granted over areas where native title parties intend to or already have implemented carbon farming projects. There is no mechanism under the proposed legislation to address the potential conflict between a carbon sequestration project and existing and future mining and petroleum tenements. Therefore, the State of Western Australia would require notification and consent provisions in any carbon sequestration project to effectively prevent conflict with any other existing interests in the land.


If the legal right to carry out a CFI project ceased to exist or the project participant ceased to be eligible to participate in the CFI scheme, the State could incur residual liabilities as the owner of the land under the carbon maintenance obligation (CMO). The CMO will require that carbon stocks be maintained by subsequent owners. As persons having an interest in land could be affected by a CMO, one of the underlying principles of the CFI scheme is to ensure these persons provide their consent to the land being a part of the scheme. Accordingly, the Commonwealth proposes that native title holders and claimants must provide consent to use of the land for a carbon sequestration project, but fails to acknowledge the State's ongoing interest in Crown land.


As exclusive possession native title holders are going to be regarded as having an eligible interest in carbon sequestration and must give consent before any sequestration project may proceed on the land, this requires consultation and negotiation on top of that already required by the Commonwealth Native Title Act 1993 (NTA) future act process. Under the NTA future act process, arbitration is available to resolve disputes. However, under the Commonwealth's CFI scheme the native party effectively has the power to veto any proposed carbon sequestration projects. This is so, even if they only have future act procedural rights as a native title claimant, rather than rights of a determined exclusive possession native title holder. This right of veto would have negative ramifications in Western Australia and therefore the State Government strongly urges the continued use of the NTA future act provisions to apply to native title consents.


An additional issue is that the draft CFI legislation—


which has been transported into this bill—


does not indicate whether the scheme will affect subsurface rights or how any implications are to be managed if they were to occur. Accordingly, to avoid the scheme impacting on petroleum tenements, the State requests that protection of subsurface rights and access to these interests be guaranteed in the legislation.


And here is the important bit in relation to this:


Currently, 26.5% of Western Australia constitutes determined exclusive native title land. Within the boundaries of this land, there are 1059 mining tenements impacted by determined exclusive native title claims. Of these, 432 are live tenements and 627 are pending tenements. The total area of mining tenements over the determined exclusive native title claims is 18,740,919 ha, of which 5,197,420 ha are live tenements and 13,543,499 ha are pending tenements. Also, there are 23 granted petroleum titles impacted by determined exclusive native title and 20 under application.


The relationship between native title holders and other stakeholders needs to be the subject of careful consideration in the context of the Commonwealth's CFI proposal. The State has grave concerns that the current formulation of the Commonwealth's proposed CFI legislation could create considerable difficulties for the administration of Crown land in Western Australia. This is due to, firstly, Western Australia's unique position with regard to the extensive amount of land subject to determined exclusive possession native title … and the potential for significantly more land to become exclusive possession native title. Also, the State's concern is a result of the nature of Western Australia's land tenure system and the importance of resource exploration and production to the State. Accordingly, these circumstances need to be considered and addressed before the draft bill is finalised.


The State through its ownership of minerals and petroleum has interests in Crown land and therefore any scheme that enables any interest in carbon sequestration should require the State's consent.


And he goes on.


The reason I have read all of this into Hansard is this. The government is proposing legislation which the coalition supports in principle but which seriously needs to be amended to address these issues. We do not want to have negative, unintended consequences when it comes to economic development in this context in the state of Western Australia, because keeping econo­mic development strong by keeping the mining industry strong, and through strong development of our petroleum and mineral resources is, of course, in the national interest. 


But this government is pushing ahead with a national mining tax which seeks to collect about 65 per cent of its revenue out of iron ore production in Western Australia over the next decade. If that were to go ahead, this government would of course have a very significant interest in what happens with minerals exploration and production in Western Australia. But that is separate legislation and I am not going to get too distracted. It is bad legislation which we will oppose because it is deeply flawed and comes out of a flawed process.


However, there are some issues here, in the context of the interaction between the carbon farming initiative legislation and native title legislation, and various other provisions that are relevant to state and territory governments, that have not been adequately addressed in this legislation. They should be addressed, in the interests of making sure that this legislation can operate effectively. But they also should be addressed to ensure the ongoing strong economic development in states like Western Australia, because that is in the national interest. Finishing off where I started, given that this is the states' house and the Senate was set up by our forefathers as the chamber of this parliament with a particular focus on the interests of states—every single senator in this chamber represents a state or territory in Australia—the issues raised by the Western Australian government are legitimate. They are issues that senators should consider very carefully. On behalf of the coalition and, in particular, Senators Birmingham and Colbeck, who join me in proposing these amendments for the coalition, I commend these amendments to the Senate. I hope that all senators will support them.

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (11:00):  I rise to say that the Greens will not be supporting the coalition's amendments. We will not support amendments which undermine native title rights and, in particular, undermine the capacity of Indigenous people to maximise their benefits under the carbon farming initiative. We see this as one of the pieces of legislation which will genuinely provide opportunities for Indigenous people. I think it is appalling that what is being proposed is the agenda of the Liberal Western Australian government to undermine the rights of Indigenous people and to undermine the native title provisions.


I indicate to the chamber that the Greens not only will be opposing the coalition's agenda to undermine the rights of Indigenous people but also in a little while will be moving an amendment which expands the capacity of Indigenous people to maximise the benefits under the Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Bill.

Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Digital Productivity) (11:02):  The government will not be supporting the amendments. The first amendment seeks to clarify that land includes the surface and subsurface, of particular interest to the West Australian government, which has raised concerns about potential negative impacts on petroleum and mineral tenements. The government accepts that there is policy merit underlying this amendment, but in this form it may not achieve the intended outcome. The government will consider providing clarification in regulations to clarify that a person who holds a mining lease in relation to an area of land holds an eligible interest in that area of land. For these purposes a mining lease is a lease or licence, however described, conferring on the holder the right to mine or recover minerals or petroleum on a specified area of land. A mining lease does not include a permit or licence to fossick, prospect, explore, assess or undertake other activities ancillary to the mining or recovery of minerals or petroleum.


The other amendments relate to Crown consents for projects being undertaken by exclusive native title or freehold land rights holders—that is, on Indigenous held land that is equivalent to freehold. The bill currently removes the need for any relevant minister, either the minister administering a land rights scheme or the state Crown minister, to consent to projects on Indigenous held land that is equivalent to freehold. These amendments which the government opposes would reverse this position so that the state Crown ministers would have a consent right—effectively a veto—on any projects on Indigenous held land that is equivalent to freehold.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (11:03):  I rise to support the amendments moved by Senator Cormann both on my behalf and on behalf of Senator Colbeck. This is an important matter which was considered by the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee inquiry into this legislation. It identified a submission to the inquiry by the Premier of Western Australia, the Hon. Colin Barnett, who considered the carbon sequestration right provisions in the bill. He said in his correspondence to the committee:


… by a clear negative implication, indicates that the relevant State Minister does not hold an ""eligible interest"" in State Crown land if that land is not Torrens system land and is subject to a determination of exclusive possession native title.


The committee said:


Premier Barnett was of the opinion the bill 'arbitrarily limits and curtails the rights of the State over State Crown land' and 'the Bill is discriminatory in relation to the State's interests as the State is treated differently from private land owners'.


These are serious concerns, along with so many concerns the opposition has about the approach the government has taken to this legislation. They are and remain unresolved in the approach the government has taken. I urge the government to reconsider and engage in some discussion with the states about this matter. I was chatting to my friend and colleague the shadow minister for COAG this morning who informed me that the next COAG meeting has been deferred yet again. It seems that the government is reluctant to talk to the states about terribly much at all at present for fear of finding disagreeable premiers when it gets to the table or something. But on this matter it is important that the government speak with the states and get it resolved.


I note that there was broad discussion around issues related to native title in the committee report. Even in the majority government comments there was a finding and a recommendation:


… the government address obstacles to indigenous participation in the CFI, including resolving outstanding uncertainties in relation to participation by holders of non-exclusive native title. 


Whilst Senator Cormann's amendment may address other matters, I challenge the minister to identify what steps the government has taken since its own senators identified that there were outstanding uncertainties surrounding this legislation and how it will operate in this regard. These are matters that it is important to resolve, and they are important for all stakeholders, be they the Indigenous groups that may see opportunities to participate or state governments that have a not unreasonable expectation that interests in crown land and the like are managed in a certain environment. What is the government doing to provide some certainty in the framework for all of these various stakeholders and to respond to the committee report and the recommendation, which was not a recommendation of coalition or opposition senators but a recommendation of the government's own senators? There were many recommendations about this legislation, and throughout this committee debate I hope that we will hear from the government what steps they have taken to address their own senators' concerns. If they have not taken steps then, of course, it again raises the question of why we are being asked to debate this legislation and finalise this legislation here and now without the full details of the regulations and complementary legislation on the table. Minister, I would again draw your attention to those remarks of Premier Barnett that were identified by the committee and, indeed, to your own government senators' findings in the committee report regarding outstanding uncertainties in this space.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (11:08):  In the majority report of the Senate committee that looked into this, recommendation 7 was:


The committee recommends the government address obstacles to indigenous participation in the CFI, including resolving outstanding uncertainties in relation to participation by holders of non-exclusive native title.


I understand what the minister, Senator Conroy, has said—that this would act as a right of veto. Could he expand on that? This was a recommendation of government senators in the majority report. It acknow­ledged the very serious concerns that were raised by the National Native Title Council and the Kimberley Land Council. The National Native Title Council said that the bill gave certainty to exclusive native title rights holders and treated them in a way that was 'fair and appropriate', and the govern­ment is to be commended for that in relation to the bill. But the NNTC, the National Native Title Council, said:


The failure to provide a clear pathway for non-exclusive native title holders into participation in offset projects is a major weakness …


When you consider the submission and evidence of the NNTC, it says, for instance:


Let us take Western Australia as an example. Approaching 20 per cent of the state is subject to an existing native title determination and, of that approaching 20 per cent, probably 90 per cent or 85 per cent is non-exclusive native title. This bill, other than by the mechanism of an Indigenous land use agreement with a state or territory government, provides no opportunity for non-exclusive native title holders to participate.


If you want to deal with Indigenous opportunity and this particular issue, there is enormous uncertainty. The National Native Title Council's significant concern is that:


… by sidelining the treatment of non-exclusive native title, by relegating the treatment of that issue to the Native Title Act, in fact the Carbon Farming Initiative bill is excluding non-exclusive native title holders from participation.


The Kimberley Land Council say:


The treatment of non-exclusive native title is discriminatory and fails to accord proper importance to the interests carried by native title.


…   …   …


The KLC observes that the effect of the proposed system would be to confer proprietary rights in carbon on holders of non-exclusive non-native title interests, while excluding non-exclusive native title holders simply by reason of the type of proprietary interest they hold. The KLC considers that there is a real risk that such an approach is inconsistent with the Racial Discrimination Act …


So my questions to the minister are: firstly, has the government got advice as to any potential breaches of the Racial Discrimination Act in relation to the concerns expressed by the Kimberley Land Council; secondly, how is the government addressing the, I think, very legitimate concerns of the majority of the committee, a committee that is chaired by a government senator and that has looked at this very, very carefully? Senator Cameron and his committee have done a very diligent job in exploring, I think very fairly, the concerns that have been raised. The committee recommended that the government address obstacles to Indigenous participation in the CFI. How does this bill address those concerns of the committee, and is there an issue with the Racial Discrimination Act? It is a real concern to me that the Kimberley Land Council has flagged that there could be a Racial Discrimination Act action taken because of this bill.

[technical correction]


The amendments to requirements to notify land registration officials remove an obligation on the scheme regulator to notify state land title officers of emission reduction projects because, of course, doing so would be unnecessary. As currently drafted, the administrator must notify the land registration official of all declarations, whether they be in relation to sequestration offsets projects or emission avoidance projects so the register can reflect that a carbon maintenance obligation may apply. Carbon maintenance obligations, however, only apply in relation to sequestration offsets projects. There is therefore as a consequence no need to notify land registration officials of declarations in relation to emission avoidance projects. Item 1 addresses this issue by ensuring that the administrator is only required to notify the land registration official of declarations in relation to sequest­ration offsets projects.


The item 12 amendment, in reference in a note in the CFI bill, corrects a minor drafting error. Clause 215 of the bill deals with audits, and the note in subclause (2) refers to the conduct of audits being dealt with in section 75AA of the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007. There is, surprisingly, no such section. Instead, the reference should be section 75 of that act. Amendments to the Australian National Registry of Emissions Units I will deal with subsequently.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (11:23):  I thank the minister and the government for moving these amendments. Obviously, as the minister has explained, the detail of these amendments is a sensible change. The detail will ensure that a copy of declarations is only required to be given to land registration officials if the declaration relates to a sequestration offsets project rather than an emissions avoidance offset project. That is the common sense way this should operate and, accordingly, the opposition will support the government's amendments in this regard. However, I note that these amendments relate to the declaration of sequestration offset projects. The need to declare such offset projects stems from matters of the permanence of such projects and the need for future landowners or interested purchasers of land to understand the obligations that flow from that ongoing permanence.


As a result, I bring to the minister's attention recommendation 3 of the Senate inquiry into this matter. It looked at matters of permanence and urged the government to continue monitoring scientific research relevant to the issue of permanence and to adjust permanence obligations to the CFI to reflect international consensus on this matter. That was a government senator's amendment and the coalition feels strongly that the matter of permanence needs as much clarity as possible. We note those who made strong submissions to the inquiry that the 100-year provisions were too long and would discourage some potential proponents from participating in the scheme. Equally, there were some who did not believe the 100 years was long enough.


The CFTA appeared before the inquiry and described the provision as the 'deal killer'. I will read an extract of the evidence that is highlighted in the inquiry. Mr Michael Kiely, Chairman of the CFTA, stated:


No farmer would be silly enough to agree to 100 years for soil carbon or 100 years for anything. A finance lender would want to know seriously the impact on the value of the property of agreeing to such a thing. We did some research into the 100 years thing and discovered it was a policy decision, not a scientific measure ...We believe that 100 years is a perverse outcome. The result is said to be necessary so buyers can be confident they are getting value—that is, genuine abatement—so they get nothing. There is nothing available for them. We have found examples where the IPCC and the Verified Carbon Standard have allowed other periods of time recently—20, 25, 30-odd years. We believe we could work within that sort of time frame.


AUSVEG, in appearing at the committee and in submissions, were also critical of the 100-year provision, stating:


... it would take a very brave farmer to agree to 100 year permanent arrangements in which they (and their children and grandchildren) will be held accountable for ""natural disturbances such as drought that may cause carbon to be released from the soil"".


Equally, placing all risk and costs as the growers' responsibility for ""bushfire ... drought, or actions by neighbours or third-parties"" belies the Government's own commitments to meeting its Kyoto obligations.


Given these serious challenges and immense uncertainty of carbon markets, it is quite unrealistic to expect vegetable and potato growers to sign 100 years commitments (with the threat of civil and criminal prosecution), undertake major investments, and change generational farming practices without any firm guarantees on the price they will be paid.


Another of those submitters which highlighted difficulty is CO2 Group Ltd. Its Chief Executive Officer, Andrew Grant, indicated:


It is a problematic issue in that, from an invest­ment perspective, after the growth period you have a long maintenance obligation with no income off it. Whether that is 100 or 50 years is rather semantic post the growth period. So, for argument's sake, say you have a 50-year growth period. You then have a 50- year permanence obligation.


I highlighted these examples of evidence given to the committee to bring the minister's attention to the government recommendation about the need to monitor the research relevant to the issue of permanence and adjust permanence obligations in the CFI. I also seek, for the benefit and record of this debate, his response to what processes the government will put in place to honour that recommendation and ask how they are going to respond to the concerns that were highlighted through the Senate committee process and what they will do in this regard. Again, I emphasise these were issues raised by the government dominated Senate committee not raised by the opposition. It is important for the stakeholders in this regard to actually get from the government some detailed response on the record as to how these issues will be dealt with going forward.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (11:29):  It is something I dealt with in addition if I recall during my summing up speech. To be clear, it is an area where the government has recognised the need to keep this under review because the environmental integrity is the risk of the reversal buffer. The government accepts that there needs to be continuing monitoring of that. Particularly, it has recognised the need to keep this under review as further evidence is gathered of the potential risk that could occur.


The CSIRO is well placed to do further work in this area. Similarly, which you talked about, the permanence requirements which are relevant only for sequestration projects will also be monitored in light of international consensus on these issues. It is one of those areas where the government recognises some of the issues that you raise but it is important to put them in perspective. First of all to go through the approval process, if I use that broad frame, from the methodology being approved, the recognised offset entity, the project approval, reporting, crediting, the termination of transfer of projects through to compliance, all of that means that there are methodologies which will have to be dealt with. Then they can use those which adds to the framework to ensure that the project does actually provide that permanence and proponents will not have to hand back credits for losses caused by such things as you raised, namely the impact of a drought or a natural disturbance.


These carbon stores will recover as forests regrow. Of course we have seen across the eastern seaboard as droughts lift we return to, in some instances, other natural disturb­ances such as floods. But they too, as we have seen across Queensland, are recovered from. Having gone into some of these regions I have seen roads, infrastructure and bridges being rebuilt but also the return to farming in those areas which suffered damage. NRMs are also assisting in returning areas to their natural state. All of that means that the proponents will not have to hand back credits for losses caused by those instances that you raised specifically.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (11:33):  The interesting issue here is the confluence of two matters. One is that we are happy to keep the permanence issue under review but it is essential to the environmental integrity of the scheme that we have to have that period which allows the scheme to operate and 100 years provides that permanency. The second matter you raised about the funding you could say that, with the way the commercial world works in relation to permanence, they are not coupled. You do not have to have, as I understand it, the commercial arrangement which matches that permanence. If you work through the schema, it is about the methodologies being approved. It is about the recognised offset integrity, the project approval, the reporting and the crediting. That is where the commercial entities will sit across that area and of course the termination of transfer of projects. You will have projects that will develop and have commercial outcomes and go for periods of time but that is distinct from the permanence. They are not interlinked in the way that you have described.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (09:31):  I am in continuation from last night on this issue. When I was speaking on this issue last night, there was real concern about the use of the word 'significant' in the bill in terms of a threshold. What does 'significant' mean? Does it mean 20 per cent, 30 per cent or 40 per cent, particularly in the context of water use? In other words, if a carbon farming measure is approved and the minister only has to consider if it has a significant adverse impact on water in a particular area where the Carbon Farming Initiative is planned, what impact will it have on food security, local ecosystems and the viability of adjoining farms in that area if there is an issue of interception? My concern is that the word 'significant' gives too much leeway and is simply too dangerous because, at the very least, it could lead to a number of unintended consequences when it comes to the whole issue of an appropriate threshold to consider before a Carbon Farming Initiative is approved.


Ultimately any project that will have any adverse impact on water availability or Australia's food security should not be approved. We have seen the difficulties with managed investment schemes. We have seen the damage that managed investment schemes have caused to agriculture and family farmers. We have seen the damage that managed investment schemes have caused to water availability by distorting the water market, which has prejudiced many small farmers throughout Australia, par­ticularly in the Murray-Darling Basin. That has been an issue of great complaint from irrigators in the Riverland in South Australia, which I represent.


I also think it is important that we recognise early adopters of emissions reduction schemes. Indeed, that is something the Prime Minister has previously said. I agree with her that, if you have been an early adopter, you should be credited for it. I have previously spoken about the importance of early adopters and recognising irrigators who have invested significantly in water infrastructure. Well, the same theory applies here. Farmers who have taken the initiative and invested heavily in projects to independently reduce emissions should be included within this scheme. Until July 2010 they were able to access the Greenhouse Friendly scheme, but since the government's announcement in 2008 that it would introduce the Carbon Farming Initiative, their ability to trade their credits has been severely impacted. While the two-year notice was beneficial on the one hand, it also meant that credits effectively lost their value and participants in the Greenhouse Friendly scheme were unable to sell their credits. This is something that ought to be explored in the committee stages of this legislation. There also needs to be consideration for early adopters under this scheme and I will be supporting the opposition's amendment to this effect.


As I mentioned earlier, I have a number of other amendments that I will move in the committee stage. In addition to the amendments I have already mentioned, I indicate now that I will be moving an amendment to require the administrator to publish on its website, within 14 days of providing its decision to the person who made the request, its reasons for supporting or refusing the proposed methodology. It is also important that one of the functions of the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee is that it monitor all scientific research relevant to the issue of permanence and adjust permanence obligations under the act to reflect best evidence. If we are going to do this, let us rely on the evidence because, on the issue of permanence, there is a real concern amongst a number of farmers about the lack of certainty that causes. 'Permanence' is defined in the act as '100 years'. On the face of it, that gives a great deal of confidence. But it is not realistic in the context of farming practices and it is not realistic in getting a good outcome.


Let me quote from page 35 of the Senate committee report. The Chairman of the Carbon Farming and Trading Association, Michael Kiely, said:




No farmer would be silly enough to agree to 100 years for soil carbon or 100 years for anything. A 
finance lender would want to know seriously the impact on the value of the property of agreeing to such a thing. We did some research into the 100 years thing and discovered it was a policy decision, not a scientific measure ...



That is a real concern. We need to listen to key stakeholders such as the CFTA. It would be foolish not to listen to those who have that firsthand practical knowledge. This was a recommendation about the issue of permanence in the inquiry into these bills. It is important that the DOIC continue to update, amend and improve the scheme into the future. These are just some of the amend­ments I will be moving. I look forward to discussing them and debating them in more detail. I think we all agree, in this chamber, that a carbon-farming initiative is a good idea. I see agriculture as being part of the solution rather than being part of the problem when it comes to carbon but it is the detail and the implementation that will determine the effectiveness of such a scheme. If we get the detail or the implementation wrong this will be very bad news for Australian agriculture, and the monitoring and enforce­ment of the scheme will be vital. 


This scheme has the potential to be useful in the steps towards reducing CO2 and towards tackling climate change. I urge those who are sceptical about climate change to take the precautionary principle and, as Rupert Murdoch once famously said, give the planet the benefit of the doubt. But if we are going to use measures, let us use measures that are effective. Let us use measures that are cost effective, sensible, practicable and which can be well implemented.


Without knowing the full details of the government's carbon plan—it is only a few days away; this Sunday the government will make an announcement in relation to this—it would be very difficult and indeed very foolish to proceed with this legislation. That is why I will be supporting what the opposition is proposing—that we wait for the regulations. I will be putting up an alternative proposal, which I hope will be circulated shortly, in the form of a second reading amendment, that at the very least as a fall-back position we wait until next Sunday. In other words, this can wait until the next sitting period because it would be too risky, too problematic and too fraught with difficulties for this piece of legislation to be dealt with and finalised before, at the very least, we know details of the govern­ment's carbon pricing plan. I support Senator Birmingham's second reading amendment that this bill be further considered only after a draft of the final regulations is tabled, but as an alternative—the fall-back position—we should not deal with this legislation this week until we know what the government is proposing. 


Let us go back to what this bill is about. The explanatory memorandum of this bill says that this initiative has been designed to be complementary to a carbon pricing mechanism. We know that the Oxford English Dictionary defines 'complementary' as mutually complementing or completing each other's deficiencies. This bill will have a lot of deficiencies unless we get some more details about the carbon-pricing mechanism and the carbon-pricing details that the government will announce in just a few days time. 


I want this carbon-farming initiative to be effective. I want it to work. I want it to be effective in reducing CO2. Agriculture has a key role to play but I am very concerned that the framework of this bill, because it is complementary, is predicated on what a carbon-pricing mechanism will do, and until we have the details of that carbon-pricing mechanism I urge my colleagues on both sides of the house to be cautious and sensible and wait until we get those details this Sunday. That is something that I strongly urge my colleagues to do; otherwise we could well be back here in a few months time trying to unravel legislation that needs to be changed by virtue of the government's announcement this Sunday. 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,1,2
"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2011-07-06,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (09:40):  This bill is the government's attempt to introduce direct action policy. They do it badly but they are trying. The coalition agrees with the bipartisan commit­ment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and has committed to the bipartisan five per cent reduction on 2000 emissions by 2020. This bill, at its essence, is about voluntary financial incentives for farmers to improve land as a means of reducing Australia's emissions. It tries to do this by creating incentives for farmers and landholders to undertake voluntary land-sector abatement projects. The government will provide saleable Australian carbon credit units in return for eligible carbon offset projects to achieve carbon abatement and improved soil resilience. Carbon farming would have additional environmental benefits such as reducing salinity and erosion, protecting bio­diversity, regenerating landscapes, improv­ing water quality and improving agricultural soil productivity. Incentives for carbon farming are earned through abatement of greenhouse gases by capturing and destroy­ing methane emissions from landfill or livestock manure or by removing carbon from the atmosphere and storing it in soil or trees—for example, by growing forests.


So far, so good. In principle the coalition agrees with what the government is trying to achieve with this but there are some flaws in it. We would like to see the detail in the regulations before we finalise our consideration of this legislation. I also note the comments that Senator Xenophon has just made that the government shut down a very successful scheme that was previously in place—the Greenhouse Friendly scheme put in place by the Howard government. Shutting that scheme down took Australia backward rather than taking us forward in addressing our challenge of helping to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions.


But there are some things that we can do to make this legislation better. If the government supports the sensible amend­ments that we will be putting forward in the committee stages there is no doubt that this could be a very good way of making a sensible contribution to helping reduce global greenhouse gas emissions, moving forward.


But this comes in a broader policy context. This comes in the policy context of the government wanting to impose a carbon tax on Australia. This comes on top of the government wanting to impose a carbon tax when none of our major overseas trade competitors that are relevant in this context will impose either a carbon tax or an emissions trading scheme. 


The carbon tax that the government is proposing to impose as of 1 July 2012 will push up the cost of everything. It will make Australia less competitive internationally so it will cost jobs. And it will do all of that without helping to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. Why? Because it will make overseas emitters more competitive than equivalent Australian businesses, including those in Australia that are operating at world's best practice in terms of environ­mental standards. This will mean that overseas emitters will take market share from Australian businesses, which will mean that we will shift emissions overseas and we will shift jobs overseas. That will mean that a carbon tax, in the absence of an appro­priately comprehensive global agreement to price emissions, will reduce emissions in Australia in a way that increases emissions, arguably by more, in other parts of the world. This is a fundamental flaw in what the government is putting forward. Yesterday I asked the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, Senator Wong, a series of questions in question time about why carbon emissions from coal were worse than carbon emissions from petrol. If people have no choice but to use their car, why should electricity not be exempt from the carbon tax as well as petrol? Families who have to access electricity from coal fired power stations will equally not have any choice, no chance to avoid doing so.


Verve Energy in Western Australia gave evidence to the carbon tax inquiry that, irrespective of a carbon tax, they will have to continue to use coal as part of their energy mix to the same if not to a growing extent in order to ensure energy security in that state. This means that, given they are currently responsible for 8½ million tonnes of emissions, given that they are currently the 11th biggest emitter, they will have to pay between $160 million and $200 million worth of carbon tax, which will be passed on either to consumers by way of higher electricity prices or to taxpayers because, as a state owned enterprise, the electricity generator is, in that context, very likely to make a loss.


Because Minister Wong was unable to answer the questions, she went for a distraction. She made a statement in this chamber that somehow I had made a statement in September 2007. She said yesterday in question time:


I am interested that Senator Cormann has asked me about taxing petrol, because I was surprised to find his comments in the chamber, in September 2007, where he said of Mr Howard's emissions trading scheme: 'This will be the most comprehensive ETS, in the world, broader in coverage than any scheme currently operating anywhere; a world-leading scheme to cover 70 to 75 per cent of total emissions. By including large emitters alone, the scheme would cover 55 per cent of total emissions; however'—and this is the best bit, Mr President—'by including transport and other fuels the coverage of the scheme is significantly increased.' So Senator Cormann used to back an ETS which covered petrol.


I never made any such comments in this chamber or anywhere else. The minister misled the chamber. I suspect that she did not deliberately mislead the chamber. I suspect the minister's misleading of the chamber was due to some sloppy staff work. I suspect it was due to some incompetent hollowmen in her office giving her bad advice. If this is the quality of the advice she is getting in order to structure a political attack on the opposition, I really worry about the quality of the advice she is getting on the important matters of the nation. If this is the quality of the advice she is getting to run a cheap political attack in the context of not being able to answer a very important question, then no wonder we are looking at $107 billion of net government debt and no wonder we are looking at record levels of deficit year after year under this Labor administration. Clearly, this is a government that is not getting very good advice indeed. If the minister had any decency, she would come into this chamber and apologise.


Clearly, one of her advisers did have a look at my first speech in this chamber and she did, out of context, quote one particular sentence. The sentence she quoted did relate to the proposition of an emissions trading scheme:


The government's recent announcement of a national emissions trading scheme, including offsets for trade exposed industries, is a positive and sensible approach to addressing global warming.


I encourage all members opposite, and indeed people across Australia, to read my whole first speech because, if I may say so myself, it was a very good speech. In order to make sure that members opposite have a good understanding of what I actually said at the time, I am going to read them the whole quote. It is very important to have a very good understanding of what was said at the time. Let us remember that this was in August 2007 when the coalition did support an emissions trading scheme. In August 2007, all of us assumed that the United States would have an emissions trading scheme by 2010, that Japan would have an emissions trading scheme by 2010, that China would have an emissions trading scheme by 2015 and that India eventually would have an emissions trading scheme.


We know that Penny Wong, the then Minister for Climate Change and Water, and the then Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, went to Copenhagen in December 2009. Copenhagen was a massive failure and everything changed. When the facts change, good governments reassess the facts and are prepared to go for a policy rethink. This is actually what the government did at the time. The then Deputy Prime Minister, Julia Gillard and the—sadly, still—Treasurer, Wayne Swan, went to the then Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, and said: 'We should kill this ETS. This ETS is bad news, given what happened in Copenhagen.' That was very sensible advice. No doubt that is why the by-then Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, in the lead-up to the last election, said, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' She realised in 2010 that what all of us thought in 2007 may happen was not happening, that there was no foreseeable prospect or likelihood of any emissions trading scheme or any carbon tax in countries like the United States, Japan, China or Russia—many of the trade competitors of Australia. I will read the whole quote because I think it is important that senators opposite are aware of what I said back in August 2007. I know that Senator Ludwig is very interested to hear what I said:


Climate change is a challenge we are facing as a global community. If we take a sensible and considered approach to meeting that challenge, Australia can play a pivotal role in facilitating the production of clean energy for the world ... we are blessed with immense reserves of clean energy in the form of gas and uranium. No other place in the developed world has such reserves. Moreover, the growing bulk of this energy is being exported directly or indirectly in the form of processed resources to China, the epicentre of the world's growing energy challenge.


I am still reading—it is a very good speech. It goes on:


Our greatest possible contribution to addressing climate change is to export more energy. Each unit of clean energy exported from Australia reduces the consumption of less clean energy in China and elsewhere and, therefore, reduces greenhouse gas emissions.


That is exactly what a carbon tax in Australia—a price on carbon in Australia—in the absence of an appropriately comprehensive global agreement to price emissions will make harder to achieve. It will make it harder for Australia to maximise our exports of clean energy because it will make it harder for us to increase production of LNG and uranium. If we were serious about reducing global greenhouse gas emissions rather than just patting ourselves on the back for a reduction in domestic emissions here in Australia which will increase emissions in other parts of the world, we would be exporting more LNG to China—where, if LNG displaced coal, it could save five to nine tonnes of emissions for every tonne of emissions produced in Australia—and exporting uranium to India, which is something that this government is not prepared to do.


The speech is really good. It continues:


The Kyoto protocol failed to recognise the unique role that resource and technology intensive countries like Australia play in providing clean energy to the world. That is never more relevant than in a state like Western Australia.


That is an important point. I know that Labor senators get really irate when I say that if we are truly focused on one thing that is to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions—



Senator Ludwig interjecting—




Senator CORMANN:
  Here I am going to say something that is going to shock you, Senator Ludwig: if our focus was really on the reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions, it might be in the world's best interest for Australia to increase its emissions if, by our doing so, we could help to reduce emissions by a greater amount in other parts of the world. That is the point this government does not seem to understand. This government is focused on the concept that Australia is somehow an island, that somehow the sky around Australia has a boundary around it. This government thinks that, instead of the rabbit-proof fence, we have a carbon-emissions-proof fence around our sky, as if carbon emissions in other parts of the world will not make it to Australia and vice versa. There is no 'carbon-proof fence' around Australia, but who knows—one day this government may think that it would be a good policy. The way they are going, they might as well try to set up a carbon-proof fence. It would only be as ridiculous a proposition as their carbon tax proposal, which is before us at the moment.


Further on in my first speech I said:


The government’s recent announcement of a national emissions trading scheme, including offsets for trade exposed industries, is a positive and sensible approach to addressing global warming. Going forward we need to remain vigilant against pursuing one-policy-fits-all measures that fail to recognise our unique capacity, particularly in Western Australia, to use more energy and reduce global greenhouse gas emissions at the same time.


That is a fundamental point which, because it is inconvenient, this government completely fails to understand. If you look at the government's green paper back in the post Garnaut review days, there was a little sentence that recognised this point. However, it was removed in the white paper. Why did this happen? I asked officials from the climate change department. It was removed because in the absence of an appropriately comprehensive global agreement on pricing emissions this policy principle was too difficult to 'operationalise' as part of a price on carbon in Australia.


I was quite an active participant throughout 2009 in the policy debate on the proposed emissions trading scheme. We had a robust debate across Australia and across both sides of politics—and we had one also within our own party—about what the best way would be for Australia to help reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. The coalition, along with the Greens, Senator Xenophon and Senator Fielding, voted against the government's Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, first in August 2009 and then in November-December 2009. Because Senator Wong is so interested in what I have had to say about imposing a price on carbon, I will share my thoughts with her and help her advisers to find the right quote by pointing them in the right direction. In the great West Australiannewspaper on 6 October 2009 I said:


I do not think we should negotiate amendments with a view to pass the ETS legislation before Copenhagen … This flawed legislation—


the CPRS legislation—


will push up the cost of everything, put pressure on our economy and not reduce global emissions. We should wait until we know what the rest of the world is prepared to do before finalising Australia's position on the ETS.


A few days later, the same paper, the great West Australian, read:


WA Senator Mathias Cormann said waiting until after the Copenhagen conference before finalising an Australian ETS was common sense.


""Unless other relevant countries come on board with similar trading schemes, we would make overseas polluters more competitive, export emissions and jobs and any reduction in local emissions would be more than offset with increased emissions overseas,"" He said. ""That is not an effective way for Australia to help reduce global emissions.""


To finalise the trifecta of quotes, I go to the Weekend Australian, which is another very good paper. In it there was an article by Lenore Taylor, who is very supportive of emissions trading and putting a price on carbon. It read:


… West Australian senator Mathias Cormann said what he meant last week. ""After Copenhagen, the coalition parties should decide on the best policy on emissions, which may or may not include an ETS.""


That, of course, is the point. After Copenhagen—after we realised that there was no likely prospect of an emissions trading scheme, carbon taxes or explicit prices on carbon in a whole range of countries that Australia competes with—it was very clear that imposing an ETS or a carbon tax in Australia was not in our national interest because neither would help to reduce global emissions. That was the conclusion that the Labor government reached before the election, only to change its mind under pressure from the Greens after the election. The Greens voted against the emissions trading scheme because they thought it was not tough enough; it will be interesting to see what sort of carbon tax or emissions trading scheme they will be supporting as of Sunday. We will be looking very carefully at what the Greens are proposing to do.


One of the other unfortunate untruths that is being told in this argument is what the minister said again on Q&A on Monday—that is, that somehow the coalition is saying that nobody else is doing anything. The coalition is, of course, not saying that Australia is not doing anything either; Australia is doing a fair bit and could do more. But the point is this: if we are going to do more and if we are going to ask people to make sacrifices, that 'doing more' has to actually make a positive difference. A carbon tax and an emissions trading scheme in the absence of an appropriately comprehensive global agreement will not make a positive difference; arguably, it will make things worse. It will result in increased global emissions, not less, even though you might be able to pat yourself on the back about having reduced emissions domestically.


The point is: Australia is an emissions-intensive export-oriented economy. Access to cheap coal is one of the reasons why we have a very significant international competitive advantage. If we undermine our strengths in a way that will not help to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions, well, we are just being completely economically irresponsible. The way a US Republican congressman described it a few days ago, it would be 'unilateral economic disarmament', and that is not something that Australia should do. We should not be going for unilateral economic disarmament. Countries around the world understand this. Countries around the world are adopting direct action policies—whether it is the US, whether it is China—and of course what the minister does not say when she says 'other countries are doing their bit' is that other countries that we compete with are going for direct action and not for a toxic carbon tax which will make them less competitive.

"Boswell, Sen Ronald",Nats,2011-07-06,"



Senator BOSWELL
 (Queensland) (10:00):  I was not going to speak on this and I am not as prepared as I should be. My colleague Senator Nash handed me a bill of some 291 sections, and there are a couple more. We are being asked to vote on this bill when we have not got a clue what it actually means because all the detail, we hope, will be announced on Sunday. We are being asked to vote on a pig in a poke. No-one can possibly vote for this legislation unless we have the detail: how many acres of trees are we supposed to plant; are these trees going to affect food production; are these trees that we plant going to affect the townships; if we plant so many trees, are they going to have an impact on the sugar mills or the rice mills or the dairy farms? Because if you plant trees, you do not plant food and that food production cannot be processed and that has effects on the towns and employment in the towns.


This bill has had as much thought process go into it as the carbon taxing regime that the government is trying to put into place. It is about as silly as taxing Australia on carbon production. It is absolutely stupid and we are asked to vote for it. I will be supporting the amendments that we do not vote for this, that we do not carry the debate any further unless we know the detail. It is, really, an insult to this side of the chamber—or any side of the chamber. The Greens demand this, the government capitulates, a bill goes up and we have not got a clue what is in it. We are told: 'The details will be on Sunday. Please wait for this.' I say to the government: 'You have your new paradigm. It does not matter whether this bill comes in today or in two weeks time, the Greens are going to support you. You have got the numbers. Just execute the numbers more conservatively. Do not go in and try to hit the Senate over the head with a sledgehammer because that is what you are doing by asking us to vote for something that no-one knows what is in it.'


We have a direct action plan. I do not know whether this covers that. When I asked our spokesman John Cobb, he said: 'Look, there's no detail in this. Any responsible government could not possibly ask for a decision to be taken on this bill without any detail.' I suspect we will be under the lash of the new paradigm and Senator Milne will support the government on this. We will vote against it. Senator Milne will support the government and we will have a piece of legislation in that will make about as much sense as a carbon tax in Australia.


While Senator Ludwig is in the chamber I will report that I went to Indonesia last week to try to sort out some of the terrible mess that he has left over. There are people without food; people who work in cattle lots—80,000-odd of them—who have not got jobs; the insult that we have offered our neighbour of cutting off their food supply without even telling them. It is going to take a lot of diplomacy to unravel that mess. The total ill will in insults that have been offered to the Indonesians is hard to comprehend unless you go over there. They have an industry that has a lot of support over there, a lot of people working in it, and just to go and cut their supply off is unbelievable.


That is not what I want to talk about today; I will talk about that at a later stage. But the thought occurred to me when I was over there, as I saw some of the world's most extreme poverty and the government trying to do what it could to create employment, to give the people jobs: I wonder what the Indonesian contribution will be. Here are these people living in absolute poverty—they cannot even afford the kerosene for their stoves at night—going out working huge numbers of hours, and we are going to say to them: 'We want you to make a contribution to reducing carbon. We want you to live in extreme poverty. We want you to increase the price of electricity, increase the price of food, increase the price of building. We don't mind if you live in a hovel and we don't mind if you've got nothing to eat and we don't mind if you haven't got a job, but you've got to pull your weight on the environment.' What a stupid, idiotic idea. It is about as sensible as cutting off their food supply. This is what the people in Australia are saying. There is no thought in these processes. They come along with a rush of blood to the head: 'We'll have an ETS, we'll have a carbon tax and we'll expect the rest of the world to pull its weight.' I can tell you, Senator Ludwig: these people cannot go anywhere. They are trying to get out of poverty. They are trying to get somewhere decent to live. They are trying to have something to eat. They are trying to provide a job. The government is trying to provide jobs—even going to the extent of not being efficient, because efficiency costs jobs but being inefficient to provide jobs. They do not have machines, they do not have things that will cut jobs down. 


And then we come along and say: 'We have 1.4 per cent of the world's emissions and we will strangle our economy by trying to reduce it by 40 per cent. We will put steelworkers' jobs on the line, we will put cement industry jobs on the line and we will strangle our economy. We will put the jobs of all those people on the line. We will increase the costs of farms by 20 per cent—reduce the price of farmers' profits by 20 per cent.' It will ripple right through the economy. And what will it be for? For nothing. It will achieve nothing. These Third World countries that produce most of the emissions cannot move anywhere. Do you think India are going to say, 'We are going to cut our emissions down'? Senator Ludwig, maybe you can tell cabinet, if they leave you there without sacking you for your terrible mistakes—you should be sacked; if you had an decency, you would resign.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Pratt
):  Senator Boswell, please direct your comments through the chair.




Senator BOSWELL:
  Madam Acting Deputy President, I am sorry and I will direct them through you. It is just stupidity that this government can murder and emasculate our economy to try and reduce our emissions by 40 per cent. That is business as usual. They expect us to do it and, in return, the only way that can be effective is if the rest of the world joins us and reduces their emissions. Then you go to these impoverished countries—where the government is doing their best, doing their utmost, to give people jobs, to give people a living, even if it is $100 a month—and expect them to make a sacrifice for the environment, when they are living on the poverty line. You cannot do it. Any government that did it would be thrown out. There would be revolutions in the streets if you put the cost of food up. Yet we merrily go along and say, 'The world is doing something'. Let me tell you, Senator Ludwig, through the chair: in 2020, China's emissions will have risen by 496 per cent, and India's by 350 per cent. I do not know what Indonesia's will be but it will be significant.


One thing Indonesia said to me was: 'Well, you might have cut our meat supply off but you are going to be generous in sending a lot of industry over to us. You are going to send all your heavy industry over to us and maybe that will in some way pay us back for what you have done to our meat industry.' They know that the cement industry will go over there, the steel industry will go over there and the heavy industries will go over there. We will have achieved absolutely zero, because all we will have done is push our heavy industries off into Third World countries. Maybe that is a way to give them a bit of a kick-start but it will not do much for our people over here. 


We are told that we are not alone in this—everyone is pulling their weight; everyone is doing something. They are, to a lesser extent. But the best one I read was that Brazil is going to change its light bulbs. That is their contribution to reducing emissions. Good on Brazil. We are going to emasculate our industry while Brazil changes its light bulbs. How stupid is that. How absolutely stupid that we are saying we are going to introduce a carbon tax universally around Australia. We are the only single country that is going to do this. Yes, the EU has a carbon tax, and that carbon tax will extract $2 billion in five years. Let us say it is $2.5 billion. That is what a carbon tax is going to take out of the economy of the EU, which is probably 20 times bigger than our economy. But, at the behest of the Greens, we have to make a sacrifice. The Greens want a sacrifice. The Greens want blood. The Greens want workers' blood. Who goes along with it? Senator Ludwig and all the other Labor senators, because they have not got the guts to stand up to the Greens and say: 'This is just ridiculous. This is just stupid.'


In one year the Australian scheme will take out over $10 billion. That is what we are going to extract from our economy. We have heard about the US regional schemes. All the states are doing their bit. No-one is bludging on the system. Everyone is doing things. In two years they have extracted well under $2 billion. I cannot believe the stupidity of the absolutely ridiculous proposition that we are being asked to support. Let us forget whether the science is right or wrong. I have never questioned the science; I do not think there is an answer to the science. You do not have to go to the science to know this is the most ridiculous scheme that was ever put up because it will not work unless everyone participates in it. It cannot work unless you get India, China, the Philippines and Indo­nesia—these big countries with emissions—to join in. They cannot join in because they have got nowhere to go. They have got their people living in poverty, and the govern­ments of those countries are rightfully trying to lift their people out of poverty.


If you, Senator Ludwig, had gone over to Indonesia instead of sending a message that 'We've just cut your food supply off—don't worry about it,' you would have seen that there are significant emissions around Indo­nesia. Yes, there is a bit of smog around and there is smog around China. I have never been to India but I suspect there is over there too. But what is the alternative? To tell these people to starve? To tell them to live in a cardboard box? To tell them not to light their stoves? Where have they got to go? You are asking these people to live in poverty for the rest of their lives, to never crawl out of it. You say you are for the workers. I do not know: if we treated farmers the way you treat workers, the way you treat unionists, we would get tarred, feathered and run out of town. But you just treat them as absolute simpletons that do not understand anything and you expect them to vote for you.


I can tell you I have been in this game a long time—a lot longer than many of you—and I can see what is going to happen here. You are completely wedged between the Left and the Right. The conservative blue-collar family man who is concerned about his electricity costs is voting for us. The doctors' wives are voting for the Greens, and you are wedged in the middle and you are going nowhere except down. You can almost see your polls are like an elevator descending one floor after another: from 34, 33, 30, 29, 27. You will stop at about floor 25, and the Greens will just about come up and take the second position in parliament.


You have to realise it. The National Party realised it when they were fighting against One Nation. There is only one way to stop it: stand up for your constituents and prove that the Greens are completely hopeless, useless and not in this world. Until you face that, you are dead meat and you are going to get carved away, inch by inch. At the end of next election you will not have the Oakeshotts and the Windsors to rely on; you will be absolutely emasculated and run out of office. It will take you another four or five terms to recover.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2011-07-06,"



Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (10:17):  I would like to thank senators for their contribution to the debate on the Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Bill 2011, Carbon Credits (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2011 and the Australian National Registry of Emiss­ions Units Bill 2011. 


I would also like to thank members of the land sector and Indigenous working group for their important contribution to these bills. The government has listened and acted in response to the issues raised. The recommen­dations by the National Farmers Federation is a case in point, and today I will move an amendment to the Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Bill to add to the list of matters that must be considered to include whether there is a significant risk that that kind of project would have a significant adverse impact on land access for agricult­ural production.


The government has committed to create opportunities in the agricultural, forestry or legacy waste sectors for the creation of new revenue streams through the reduction or storage of carbon pollution. The Carbon Farming Initiative fulfils this commitment. It would contribute to improving farm productivity, create jobs in regions, provide new opportunities for Indigenous commun­ities, enhance our biosecurity and build resilience to the impacts of climate change. Around the country, innovative farmers, landholders and scientists have been developing ways to improve the health of agricultural soils, improve herd efficiency, recycle waste and to farm and manage their land more sustainably.


The Carbon Farming Initiative will create incentives to protect our natural environment and adopt more sustainable farming practices as well as mitigate climate change. Increasing carbon storage in agricultural soils improves soil health and productivity. Revegetation will help restore degraded landscapes and protect biodiversity. Tree planting can help to address salinity and reduce erosion. This is important because the agricultural sector in Australia is likely to be one of the most strongly affected by climate change.


The Carbon Farming Initiative balances environmental integrity with administrative simplicity. An independent expert committee, the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee, has been established to ensure that estimation methodologies are rigorous and lead to real and verifiable abatement. This committee is now consulting on five draft methodologies with more in the pipeline, including matters such as re­afforestation; forest management and native forest protection; savanna fire management; landfill gas recovery and manure manage­ment; and management of methane from livestock, soil carbon and biochaff.


Carbon storage has to be permanent if it is going to be treated as equivalent to carbon emissions from the industrial sectors. The provisions to deal with permanence are rigorous, yet they are flexible and well suited to Australian conditions. We have also put in place arrangements to ensure that adverse impacts are avoided. Some have commented about the threat to prime agricultural land from tree planting. The government is confident that prime agricultural land is not at risk, and the legislative structure will prevent perverse outcomes: (1) while permanent tree planting will be rewarded, those responsible must take into account applicable natural resource management plans; (2) all state, territory and Common­wealth requirements must be complied with, including any water entitlements which may be required; (3) managed investment schemes will not be eligible because short rotation commercial forestry will fail the common practice test and management investment schemes will be explicitly excluded; (4) the economics of carbon credits are such that land use change is likely to occur on marginal agricultural land as evidenced by recent estimates of abatement by the department of CSIRO. It must also be remembered that the Carbon Farming Initiative is not just about tree planting but also covers a wide range of agricultural practices which reduce emissions, such as better fertiliser use, manure management and enhancing soil carbon. Many of these practices increase the productivity of prime agricultural land and this initiative will provide a new income stream for those who take up new and more sustainable farm practices.


The proposed legislation includes provisions to exclude activities that carry a high risk of adverse outcomes on the environment and local communities through a negative list which will be contained in regulation. The government will include activities on the negative list that pose a significant risk to the availability of water, to the conservation of biodiversity, to employ­ment or to local communities. These activities will not be eligible to receive carbon credits under the Carbon Farming Initiative. The Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency has under­taken a first-pass risk assessment of carbon forest activities and released this for public comment.


The government's position is that the following activities be on the negative list: establishing vegetation on land cleared of native vegetation since 1 July 2007, establishing a known weed species, establishing forest in conditions where it would risk impacts on the availability of water and establishing a forest as part of a managed investment scheme. The govern­ment recognises the need to monitor issues that may be raised with crediting metho­dologies and will engage with local government, natural resource management bodies and other stakeholders on whether additional activities should be added to the negative list. The government also recog­nises the need to act promptly with respect to these issues to ensure that perverse outcomes for biodiversity or agricultural land use are avoided. Negative list activities and the circumstances in which they apply will be tightly defined to avoid prohibiting low-risk projects.


With the content of the key regulations and the first methodologies now published, there is no reason to delay the passage of these bills. Investment in further metho­dologies and the underpinning science is dependent upon stakeholders having certainty that the initiative will actually go ahead. This is why it is essential for parliament to pass these bills and not continue to find excuses for delay. The environmental integrity of the Carbon Farming Initiative is essential to the value and credibility of the credits that are created.


The government recognises that some types of carbon projects indirectly cause emissions elsewhere in the economy through the effect of leakage. For example, a project based on preventing logging in part of our native forest estate could lead to an increase in logging elsewhere in the country if demand for timber remains. If unaddressed, leakage can reduce or even obviate abate­ment from such projects. The regulatory framework requirement for streamlined accounting treatments for leakage are to be incorporated in the methodologies. The Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency is currently developing mandatory guidelines to establish the accounting rules for dealing with leakage. This will be based on a discounting approach which identifies the likely risk and extent of leakage for projects based on forecasts about supply and demand in the relevant market. The government will work closely with key stakeholders to develop this guidance.


Another key to environmental integrity is the risk of reversal buffer. The government recognises the need to keep this under review as further evidence is gathered of potential risks. The CSIRO is well placed to do further work in this area.


The government is committed to ensuring Indigenous Australians can participate in and benefit from the Carbon Farming Initiative. The first methodology to be released for public comment under the Carbon Farming Initiative, 'savanna fire management', could inject over $2 million of revenue each year to projects such as those in western Arnhem Land. The government is consulting with Indigenous Australians to work through implementation issues with this initiative. In committing to ensure that they stand to benefit to this end, clarifying the consent rights of non-exclusive possession with native title holders will be important.


The government also recognises that other groups may need to be prescribed by regulation as having eligible interests, in particular those who hold mining leases over an area of land or have a legitimate interest in projects involving the same area of land, will be prescribed as eligible interests. The government also accepts the need to work with natural resource management bodies to improve the consistency of regional plan­ning. The government recognises the need to help build carbon literacy amongst land­holders and has already engaged Landcare facilitators to communicate the benefits and responsibilities involved with the initiative to interested stakeholders. We will continue to work with landholders, including Indigenous leaders, to ensure that they have the greatest ability to capitalise on the benefits of this very substantial opportunity for regional Australia.


In summing up, these bills before the Senate today will provide real opportunity to regional and rural Australians to be part of the climate change solution. We do appreciate that this sector needs to learn more about the potential abatement oppor­tunities by making a start with the Carbon Farming Initiative and getting projects on the ground. I commend the bills to the Senate.

At the request of Senator Fifield, I present a report of the Senate Standing Committee on the Scrutiny of Bills. I also lay on the table Scrutiny of Bills Alert DigestNo. 7 of 2011, dated 6 July 2011.


Ordered that the report be printed.

  I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


I seek leave to incorporate a tabling statement in Hansard.

The statement read as follows—



In tabling the Committee's Alert Digest No.7 of 2011 and its Seventh Report of 2011, I particularly draw the Senate’s attention to the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Matters) Bill 2011. 


The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 with the intention of ensuring that a large number of convictions for social security fraud are not set aside. The Bill seeks to insert, with retrospective effect to March 2000, an independent obligation for a person to inform the department of changes of circumstances that might affect the payment of a social security benefit.  


The need for the Bill has arisen as the result of a recent Supreme Court decision in which the court held that as the relevant legislation did not impose a duty to inform the department of changes in circumstances the omission to do so could not apply to the offence and a conviction for 'obtaining a financial advantage' was set aside.


The Scrutiny Committee's view is that the principle against retrospective legislation is not absolute and that there are situations in which retrospective legislation is justified. However, in the circumstances the Committee has strong reservations about (1) the use of retrospective legislation to impose or confirm criminal guilt, and (2) whether the justifications for its use in this instance are adequate. 


The full details of the Committee's view about this and other bills are available in the alert digest and report I am tabling today, and I commend the Committee’s Alert Digest No. 7 of 2011 and Seventh Report of 2011 to the Senate.

This bill inserts a new section 66A, which imposes an obligation on particular social security recipients to inform the department of a change of personal circumstances that might affect their payment or eligibility for a concession card. The relevant schedule applies retrospectively to 20 March 2000 to address some issues in the legislation at that time which have only recently become evident.


This bill also resolves some issues affecting the operation of Centrelink's computer programs. It ensures that the operation of a computer program complies with the relevant requirements in the Social Security Administration Act 1999. The application of this provision is limited to the period from 12 June 2001. I understand that Centrelink has reviewed its processes to ensure that, in future, necessary evidence of compliance with these requirements will be available. This bill also makes some technical amendments to family assistance legislation affecting child care and the childcare rebate.


This bill has a number of retrospective elements. The coalition does not take retrospective legislation lightly; however, with respect to this particular bill there are exceptional circumstances that warrant this action. This bill will address a previously unidentified legal technicality where the failure to do so could have a negative impact on Australia's welfare system. The coalition does not believe that these amendments contravene fundamental principles of fairness or due process; and, in light of this, the coalition will not oppose the bill.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations) (11:41):  I thank Senator Fifield for his contribution and other senators for the consideration of this matter. Australia provides its citizens with a strong social security safety net to support those whose circumstances mean they are unable, either temporarily or permanently, to support themselves. Successive Australian govern­ments have recognised the importance of ensuring that social security payments go to those in genuine need and not to people who seek to exploit the system through fraudulent means.


The Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2011 contains a number of amendments to protect the integrity of the social security system. The bill introduces into the Social Security Administration Act 1999 a stand-alone obligation for a person to inform the department of events or changes of circumstances that might affect the payment of a social security payment to the person or the person's qualification for a concession card. This change will operate prospectively and retrospectively to 20 March 2000, which relates to the length of this difficulty. Retrospective legislation is not pursued lightly; however, in this case there are exceptional circumstances, as it would not be appropriate for a significant number of prosecutions for social security fraud to be overturned on the basis of a previously unidentified legal technicality. This will allow the work of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions in prosecut­ing social security fraudsters to continue. Other provisions in the bill will ensure that past decisions made by Centrelink under the social security law by the operation of computer programs are not open to question.


The integrity of the social security system will be protected without adverse circum­stances for citizens. The bill is designed such that there will be no practical impact on Centrelink's business or on a person's obligations to report changes in circum­stances to Centrelink. It does not remove the requirement for Centrelink to notify citizens of their obligations to tell Centrelink about changes to their circumstances, and it does not affect citizens' rights to have decisions made by Centrelink reviewed independently on their merits.


The bill also corrects minor drafting oversights in the family assistance legisla­tion. I commend the bill to the Senate.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (11:44):  I seek leave to make a speech in this second reading debate. This bill was called on at very short notice. I was in a meeting and literally bolted across the parliament.


Leave granted.




Senator SIEWERT:
  I thank the chamber for that. The Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2011 makes what we believe is an important amendment to the Social Security Act. It is an important process but it is also important, I think, because it raises some important issues that I would like to articulate. This particular amendment, as you know, creates an obligation in the legislation for income support recipients to notify Centrelink in the event of a change of circumstances which might affect their payment. The point here is that it is obvious that that is something that is supposed to happen. It should be obvious to recipients but it is not actually in the legislation, so of course we support the principle of putting it into the legislation. Previously, the obli­gation to notify was contained in notices sent by Centrelink to recipients and it seems fairly obvious that you would need to because you have to meet certain require­ments to obtain social security support.


The bill seeks to repair a fault in the legislation and the way in which social security fraud cases have been prosecuted. The Greens do not have any difficulty with the issue of putting a requirement in the legislation that social security recipients are in fact required to notify Centrelink of changes in their circumstances. This is basically formulating a requirement that exists presently; however, the bill also seeks to retrospectively apply that requirement so as to ensure the convictions of around 15,000 people who are potentially at risk due to some recent court decision.


It is the retrospective element of the bill which causes me and the Greens some concern. The social security system, we believe, is an absolutely vital part of our society and defines us as a country. We take care of those who are most in need. This system will not work if people are intentionally taking advantage of the system for their own personal gain. As I said, we do not have any problem in principle


We want genuine fraud to have appropriate repercussions and we appreciate the potential administrative consequences of having to go back and look at 15,000 cases if this bill is not passed, but in principle we have a problem with the retrospectivity of this type of law-making. It is the principle of natural justice, not to mention international law, and I quote from Article 15.1 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights:


No one shall be held guilty of any criminal offence on account of any act or omission which did not constitute a criminal offence, under national or international law, at the time when it was committed.


An amendment which deals with these sorts of issues, which we believe this amendment does, potentially breaches our international obligations and we have got some serious concerns about this particular aspect of the bill. It is a very serious decision by this parliament that we believe could potentially infringe on somebody's civil liberties by retrospectively confirming criminal convictions which are now in doubt through decisions of our courts. 


I note with concern the Scrutiny of Bills Committee has strong reservations about the use of retrospectivity to impose or confirm criminal guilt and the justification used by the government. As the Scrutiny of Bills Committee report notes: the legal defect the bill seeks to fix squarely relates to the question of whether criminal liability was established. Furthermore, the report notes that the justification provided in the explanatory memorandum 'does not address the broader significance of the use of retrospective criminal law for the Australian legal system'. It goes on to say:


Although it is likely true that many persons were aware that as a matter of social or moral norms or principles they should have informed the Department of their changed circumstances…


It talks about the fact that—and I acknowledge it—it is in the High Court at the moment and there is no legal obligation to do so at the moment. It quite eloquently outlines the concerns about the retrospect­ivity of this particular piece of legislation.


Also the report talks in general about imposing retrospective laws, and people will be aware that the Scrutiny of Bills Committee often highlights those particular issues and expresses concerns. It says:


This principle may not necessarily be absolute, but there is arguably significant benefit in upholding this principle in terms of maintaining other policy objectives.


I too share the concerns of the committee and question whether the policy outcome justifies the breach of this important principle.


Another problem I have with this bill is that it shores up the government's prose­cution framework without the government acting on the greater injustices that exist in relation to the investigation and prosecution of social security fraud. We have got, as I said, some very strong concerns about the retrospectivity in itself as a principle, as does the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, but there are some other very significant issues that apply, we believe, to the Social Security Act and some of the ways that Centrelink and others have been handling the prosecutions through that particular act and how it reflects on the particular decision we are about to make in this place.


Let me be clear: we have no intention of being soft on people who intentionally defraud the system. It is imperative, if we are to have a strong social security system that truly acts as a safety net for our most vulnerable Australians, that it is strong, effective and is not undermined. I do not want anybody to be running around this place saying, 'The Greens are soft on fraud, on Centrelink.' We are not, but we are concerned that we are picking up people in that net that in fact are unintentionally committing offences and that we are not going for the really serious fraud cases.


When we speak to people in the sector, we believe there are obviously some very genuine fraud cases and, as I said, we need to go for those people. If you look at some of the ways these cases are being prosecuted and who is getting picked up through this process, we are concerned that there are some people getting picked up in the process that are not necessarily the big fish and that they have committed offences unintention­ally. It would appear that many people who are investigated, prosecuted and ultimately convicted are sometimes confused by the complexity of the system—an issue I have raised in this place before; in fact not two weeks ago we were talking about this issue and I was outlining the 34 pages of complex rules and tiers of payments that come out quarterly from the government. It is confusing for someone who knows the system, let alone someone who does not know the system. The main reason for Centrelink debt is undeclared or under­declared earnings. Many people, for example, underestimate their income to Centrelink because they do not know how to correctly report it or they do not have the understanding or, in some cases, the necessary English language skills to properly read a payslip. This confusion is com­pounded when people work irregularly or are paid irregularly or when their payslips lag behind reporting requirements. Centrelink letters which attempt to outline obligations and requirements can be difficult to under­stand, particularly for people with limited literacy, formal education or English skills. It is very concerning to note that Indigenous income support recipients are particularly susceptible to these problems and are more likely to incur debt than non-Indigenous recipients.


Casual employees, including teachers and nurses, also statistically find themselves more often in debt. That is because of the issue I outlined before about the irregularity of pay and when they are supposed to report it. Sometimes there is a lag in getting paid. If there is a lag in getting paid, you actually have no income. Those are issues that we have heard strong concerns about.


I have heard reports of income support recipients who know they are being overpaid but feel they are in too deep and are afraid to come forward for fear of being prosecuted. Of course they should report it, but they are concerned about the repercussions. We believe this is understandable considering reports that Centrelink staff frequently and inappropriately threaten people with jail—these people are worried they will go to jail. Given that those threats are being used inappropriately, that also has implications. These people are being charged as a matter of procedure, sometimes years after the so-called fraud has occurred and they have in fact already entered into repayment arrange­ments. I fail to see that justice can be served by prosecuting some of these cases. Surely our money is better spent focusing on those who are intentionally committing fraud on the system.


When you look at the statistics, minor offenders and those who end up in debt via error make up a huge proportion of those being investigated and prosecuted. For example, in 2007-08, 1,135 debts were prosecuted involving amounts between $5,000 and $10,000, and 379 people were prosecuted for amounts of less than $5,000. In the same year, only 10 out of a total of 2,624 successful prosecutions were for false claims or false identity matters—in other words, fraud. According to the National Welfare Rights Network, the level of deliberate and intentional fraud in the system is acknowledged to be extremely small: 0.044 per cent.


It is not just the welfare sector that reports this; a study of social security fraud cases completed in 2008 revealed similar patterns. Of the 80 cases examined, the average amount involved was $10,000, and over 85 per cent of people had already repaid some of the debt and there were no cases of identity fraud or elaborate scams. The authors state that these findings 'challenge the stereotype of the organised criminal willingly defrauding the Commonwealth government for large sums of money'. The research concluded that in many cases it was plausible that circumstances pointed to an error rather than criminal intent. What is going on here? We are focusing on prosecuting vulnerable people when there is no evidence of serious fraud and, in many cases, when they are already paying back their debt. The system seems to be set up to catch more vulnerable people rather than the serious exploiters of our welfare system.


The human toll on people who are prosecuted is painfully high. There are regular reports of human distress, careers ruined and even suicidal thoughts. When you look at the human impacts, not to mention the administrative costs, we believe we should re-examine this punitive approach. As I have said—and I will be really clear—we want to crack down on those who are intentionally committing fraud.


Centrelink's communications general manager, Hank Jongen, stated on ABC radio in 2009:


We do not prosecute people who make genuine mistakes. We only refer cases where there's been deliberate … deception or intent to defraud … Every one of those cases either involves deliberate false statements, forgery, identity fraud, or instances where the customer had previously been prosecuted for a similar offence.


Yet both reports from the sector and academic investigations reveal that this is definitely not the case. The difference between what is happening and what people say is happening is great. There seem to be two different stories here. We believe we need to look further into how we can improve this system. Why are we not targeting more intensely those who have committed serious fraud?


We believe that the statistics point not to a high rate of guilt but to serious problems with access to justice for people on low incomes. It is difficult for them to get legal representation and there are great incentives for them to plead guilty. This is particularly important: there is an incentive for people who cannot get legal representation, who are the most vulnerable, who are scared or who cannot navigate the system to plead guilty.


A recent audit by the Australian National Audit Office paints an even grimmer picture. In essence, the report concluded, for numerous reasons, that Centrelink's investi­gative procedures were seriously flawed. Among other things, it held that Centrelink misused its coercive powers, failed to keep records, lacked proper oversight and breached government and departmental policies. According to the audit, 87 per cent of Centrelink's 113 fraud investigations did not comply with the Australian government investigations standards or Centrelink's mandatory policies and procedures. To quote the report:


Overall, most fraud investigations reviewed by the ANAO did not comply with the Australian Government's regulated framework and Centrelink's internal policies and procedures.


The important issues to emerge from the results of the review were: noncompliance with the Australian government investi­gations standards and Centrelink's own policies and processes, increasing the risk of serious and complex fraud cases not being referred for consideration of prosecution and potentially affecting the quality of briefs of evidence referred to the CDPP; incomplete information recorded in Centrelink's fraud investigation case management system and investigation files, affecting Centrelink's ability to provide assurance that the investigative approach was appropriate and to protect the rights of customers through legislated safeguards such as freedom of information; and lack of documented critical decisions and evidence of managerial oversight at key control points in the investigative process, including information-gathering processes, making it difficult to determine whether Centrelink used its coercive powers inappropriately to collect evidence after fraud was suspected. These are quite serious findings. I think this quote sums it up:


Prosecution should not be instituted unless there is admissible, substantial and reliable evidence that a criminal offence has been committed. The ANAO's analysis suggests that material contained in Centrelink's briefs of evidence is not consistently meeting the requirements of the Prosecution Policy of the Commonwealth. This has the potential to severely limit the prospect of defendants, who may be successfully convicted for fraud, being treated in a fair, open and accountable manner. The ANAO notes that almost all of Centrelink fraud defendants plead guilty.


When you add all of these problems up it creates an extremely distressing situation. Vulnerable people are being investigated and prosecuted for fraud, often without basis and often for small amounts already being repaid, with an almost 100 per cent conviction rate—and there are serious questions about the fairness and transparency of the process. It is difficult to imagine how we can solve some of these entrenched, systemic problems, but perhaps we need to be taking a more serious look at this.


These are the reasons that we have concerns about this particular piece of legislation. We have 15,000 cases here that we are being asked to basically approve retrospectively, and I have just highlighted serious concerns with the way some of these cases may have been pursued. People would have pleaded guilty for the reasons that I outlined. The ANAO report clearly points out some serious problems with the way fraud is being investigated by Centrelink. We have been through Senate estimates and have talked about this, and I know that they are trying to improve the situation. But the point is that we are talking about retrospective application of this legislation. We have some very serious concerns about this piece of legislation because of its retrospective nature and because we are not convinced—I am sorry; we are just not convinced—that every single one of those cases would have been dealt with in the most appropriate manner.


This is a serious piece of legislation. I understand why the government has to do it and I understand the principle. Yes, we should be amending this legislation to put this particular amendment in to make it obvious that people have to notify Centrelink of their change in circumstances. We need to state what is obviously a requirement in the legislation. But we have very serious problems with this particular legislation and the ongoing way that Centrelink is pursuing some of these fraud cases.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations) (12:02):   by leave—I thank the Senate for the opportunity to address some of the issues that Senator Siewert has raised. With respect to the reasons for retrospectivity, I should highlight, as indeed other senators have, that this is obviously not an issue to be taken lightly. We have not yet had the benefit of looking at the Scrutiny of Bills report but certainly many of the issues that I am sure—from my past participation in that committee—would have been raised have indeed already been addressed in the govern­ment's considerations and, as I understand it, also in discussions with the opposition.


They are certainly not issues to be taken lightly, but there is no question that the Commonwealth has the power to enact retrospective legislation. This is not the only area where the Commonwealth has applied matters retrospectively and, indeed, in the past, serious consideration has also been given to the principles that Senator Siewert has highlighted—acknowledging also the point that she made that that principle may not be absolute. We believe that the concerns in this matter are significant enough to be regarded in that fashion.


The amendment is necessary to underpin the integrity of the social security system. The retrospective application of the amend­ment is necessary to prevent the risk of a significant number of convictions for social security fraud being overturned on appeal. In this country, social security fraud is not considered a legitimate activity for a person to engage in. The Australian community expects that there will be consequences for people who have been convicted of defraud­ing the Commonwealth.


People have already been convicted of social security fraud who were aware of their conduct as an offence. They were given notices by Centrelink which stated that they must inform the department of the specified events and changes of circumstances listed in the notices. They did not do so. The effect of the retrospective application of the amend­ment is to confirm convictions that have already been made. It does not create a new offence.


The Criminal Code offences under which people have been convicted of social security fraud are not strict liability offences. They include fault elements which the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt. This provides reasonable protection to defendants who were able to raise a doubt about whether they knew that they were defrauding the Commonwealth. Also, importantly, these provisions do not allow re-prosecution of past cases.


Let me conclude with some comments about the urgency of this matter and the reasons for the debate and the passage in this winter sitting session. This is a clarification of the original intent of the law going back at least to the year 2000, if not earlier. The legislation will provide certainty to the Commonwealth in the form of Centrelink and the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions regarding the operation of the social security law and interaction with the Criminal Code. The parliament will rise on 7 July until 16 August. Should a decision contrary to the Commonwealth be handed down in that period, there will be uncertainty as to the status of convicted individuals. If the decision is contrary to the Common­wealth, it would place a substantial number—that is, up to 15,000—of convict­ions at risk. Currently, a number of cases are on hold and others have not been pursued by the CDPP pending the High Court decision. Absence of the legislation will further affect prosecutions.


The legislation is consistent with community expectations that individuals should receive only the payments and/or concessions to which they are entitled, and delay in the legislation will lower confidence in the integrity of the overall social security system

That is because of the issue I outlined before about the irregularity of pay and when they are supposed to report it. Sometimes there is a lag in getting paid. If there is a lag in getting paid, you actually have no income. Those are issues that we have heard strong concerns about.


I have heard reports of income support recipients who know they are being overpaid but feel they are in too deep and are afraid to come forward for fear of being prosecuted. Of course they should report it, but they are concerned about the repercussions. We believe this is understandable considering reports that Centrelink staff frequently and inappropriately threaten people with jail—these people are worried they will go to jail. Given that those threats are being used inappropriately, that also has implications. These people are being charged as a matter of procedure, sometimes years after the so-called fraud has occurred and they have in fact already entered into repayment arrange­ments. I fail to see that justice can be served by prosecuting some of these cases. Surely our money is better spent focusing on those who are intentionally committing fraud on the system.


When you look at the statistics, minor offenders and those who end up in debt via error make up a huge proportion of those being investigated and prosecuted. For example, in 2007-08, 1,135 debts were prosecuted involving amounts between $5,000 and $10,000, and 379 people were prosecuted for amounts of less than $5,000. In the same year, only 10 out of a total of 2,624 successful prosecutions were for false claims or false identity matters—in other words, fraud. According to the National Welfare Rights Network, the level of deliberate and intentional fraud in the system is acknowledged to be extremely small: 0.044 per cent.


It is not just the welfare sector that reports this; a study of social security fraud cases completed in 2008 revealed similar patterns. Of the 80 cases examined, the average amount involved was $10,000, and over 85 per cent of people had already repaid some of the debt and there were no cases of identity fraud or elaborate scams. The authors state that these findings 'challenge the stereotype of the organised criminal willingly defrauding the Commonwealth government for large sums of money'. The research concluded that in many cases it was plausible that circumstances pointed to an error rather than criminal intent. What is going on here? We are focusing on prosecuting vulnerable people when there is no evidence of serious fraud and, in many cases, when they are already paying back their debt. The system seems to be set up to catch more vulnerable people rather than the serious exploiters of our welfare system.


The human toll on people who are prosecuted is painfully high. There are regular reports of human distress, careers ruined and even suicidal thoughts. When you look at the human impacts, not to mention the administrative costs, we believe we should re-examine this punitive approach. As I have said—and I will be really clear—we want to crack down on those who are intentionally committing fraud.


Centrelink's communications general manager, Hank Jongen, stated on ABC radio in 2009:


We do not prosecute people who make genuine mistakes. We only refer cases where there's been deliberate … deception or intent to defraud … Every one of those cases either involves deliberate false statements, forgery, identity fraud, or instances where the customer had previously been prosecuted for a similar offence.


Yet both reports from the sector and academic investigations reveal that this is definitely not the case. The difference between what is happening and what people say is happening is great. There seem to be two different stories here. We believe we need to look further into how we can improve this system. Why are we not targeting more intensely those who have committed serious fraud?


We believe that the statistics point not to a high rate of guilt but to serious problems with access to justice for people on low incomes. It is difficult for them to get legal representation and there are great incentives for them to plead guilty. This is particularly important: there is an incentive for people who cannot get legal representation, who are the most vulnerable, who are scared or who cannot navigate the system to plead guilty.


A recent audit by the Australian National Audit Office paints an even grimmer picture. In essence, the report concluded, for numerous reasons, that Centrelink's investi­gative procedures were seriously flawed. Among other things, it held that Centrelink misused its coercive powers, failed to keep records, lacked proper oversight and breached government and departmental policies. According to the audit, 87 per cent of Centrelink's 113 fraud investigations did not comply with the Australian government investigations standards or Centrelink's mandatory policies and procedures. To quote the report:


Overall, most fraud investigations reviewed by the ANAO did not comply with the Australian Government's regulated framework and Centrelink's internal policies and procedures.


The important issues to emerge from the results of the review were: noncompliance with the Australian government investi­gations standards and Centrelink's own policies and processes, increasing the risk of serious and complex fraud cases not being referred for consideration of prosecution and potentially affecting the quality of briefs of evidence referred to the CDPP; incomplete information recorded in Centrelink's fraud investigation case management system and investigation files, affecting Centrelink's ability to provide assurance that the investigative approach was appropriate and to protect the rights of customers through legislated safeguards such as freedom of information; and lack of documented critical decisions and evidence of managerial oversight at key control points in the investigative process, including information-gathering processes, making it difficult to determine whether Centrelink used its coercive powers inappropriately to collect evidence after fraud was suspected. These are quite serious findings. I think this quote sums it up:


Prosecution should not be instituted unless there is admissible, substantial and reliable evidence that a criminal offence has been committed. The ANAO's analysis suggests that material contained in Centrelink's briefs of evidence is not consistently meeting the requirements of the Prosecution Policy of the Commonwealth. This has the potential to severely limit the prospect of defendants, who may be successfully convicted for fraud, being treated in a fair, open and accountable manner. The ANAO notes that almost all of Centrelink fraud defendants plead guilty.


When you add all of these problems up it creates an extremely distressing situation. Vulnerable people are being investigated and prosecuted for fraud, often without basis and often for small amounts already being repaid, with an almost 100 per cent conviction rate—and there are serious questions about the fairness and transparency of the process. It is difficult to imagine how we can solve some of these entrenched, systemic problems, but perhaps we need to be taking a more serious look at this.


These are the reasons that we have concerns about this particular piece of legislation. We have 15,000 cases here that we are being asked to basically approve retrospectively, and I have just highlighted serious concerns with the way some of these cases may have been pursued. People would have pleaded guilty for the reasons that I outlined. The ANAO report clearly points out some serious problems with the way fraud is being investigated by Centrelink. We have been through Senate estimates and have talked about this, and I know that they are trying to improve the situation. But the point is that we are talking about retrospective application of this legislation. We have some very serious concerns about this piece of legislation because of its retrospective nature and because we are not convinced—I am sorry; we are just not convinced—that every single one of those cases would have been dealt with in the most appropriate manner.


This is a serious piece of legislation. I understand why the government has to do it and I understand the principle. Yes, we should be amending this legislation to put this particular amendment in to make it obvious that people have to notify Centrelink of their change in circumstances. We need to state what is obviously a requirement in the legislation. But we have very serious problems with this particular legislation and the ongoing way that Centrelink is pursuing some of these fraud cases.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations) (12:02):   by leave—I thank the Senate for the opportunity to address some of the issues that Senator Siewert has raised. With respect to the reasons for retrospectivity, I should highlight, as indeed other senators have, that this is obviously not an issue to be taken lightly. We have not yet had the benefit of looking at the Scrutiny of Bills report but certainly many of the issues that I am sure—from my past participation in that committee—would have been raised have indeed already been addressed in the govern­ment's considerations and, as I understand it, also in discussions with the opposition.


They are certainly not issues to be taken lightly, but there is no question that the Commonwealth has the power to enact retrospective legislation. This is not the only area where the Commonwealth has applied matters retrospectively and, indeed, in the past, serious consideration has also been given to the principles that Senator Siewert has highlighted—acknowledging also the point that she made that that principle may not be absolute. We believe that the concerns in this matter are significant enough to be regarded in that fashion.


The amendment is necessary to underpin the integrity of the social security system. The retrospective application of the amend­ment is necessary to prevent the risk of a significant number of convictions for social security fraud being overturned on appeal. In this country, social security fraud is not considered a legitimate activity for a person to engage in. The Australian community expects that there will be consequences for people who have been convicted of defraud­ing the Commonwealth.


People have already been convicted of social security fraud who were aware of their conduct as an offence. They were given notices by Centrelink which stated that they must inform the department of the specified events and changes of circumstances listed in the notices. They did not do so. The effect of the retrospective application of the amend­ment is to confirm convictions that have already been made. It does not create a new offence.


The Criminal Code offences under which people have been convicted of social security fraud are not strict liability offences. They include fault elements which the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt. This provides reasonable protection to defendants who were able to raise a doubt about whether they knew that they were defrauding the Commonwealth. Also, importantly, these provisions do not allow re-prosecution of past cases.


Let me conclude with some comments about the urgency of this matter and the reasons for the debate and the passage in this winter sitting session. This is a clarification of the original intent of the law going back at least to the year 2000, if not earlier. The legislation will provide certainty to the Commonwealth in the form of Centrelink and the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions regarding the operation of the social security law and interaction with the Criminal Code. The parliament will rise on 7 July until 16 August. Should a decision contrary to the Commonwealth be handed down in that period, there will be uncertainty as to the status of convicted individuals. If the decision is contrary to the Common­wealth, it would place a substantial number—that is, up to 15,000—of convict­ions at risk. Currently, a number of cases are on hold and others have not been pursued by the CDPP pending the High Court decision. Absence of the legislation will further affect prosecutions.


The legislation is consistent with community expectations that individuals should receive only the payments and/or concessions to which they are entitled, and delay in the legislation will lower confidence in the integrity of the overall social security system

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2011-07-06,"



Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (12:45):  I rise today to speak on a topic that causes me a great deal of concern. Child pageants and the early sexualisation of young girls appears to be an increasing problem gaining regular, even persistent, coverage in the media. I feel it is an issue that requires our immediate attention. We need to take a stand against this for the sake of all children and their right to a childhood. Child pageants are a long-held tradition in America, but now these pageants are on their way to Australia. 


The pageant in question is open to children as young as one month old. It has been brought to Melbourne by the Texas based Universal Royalty Beauty Pageant. The reality is that girls as young as one month old can potentially be subjected to fake tanning, eyebrow waxing, false teeth and more—all in an attempt to improve their looks and win. The message that this sends to young girls is that they are not good enough. I think that in itself is shameful. When is this astonishing event going to occur? On 29 and 30 July, at Bram Leigh Receptions in Croydon, Victoria. Let me quote from the Herald-Sun:


The July pageant, for babies to adults, costs a minimum of $295, which includes a compulsory beauty competition, modelling and make-up workshops.


Optional extras include tanning, dressing like a celebrity for $50 and a photo and autograph session with American beauty pageant star, five-year-old Eden Wood.


But when I say they 'are on their way', that is not quite accurate. There has already been a small pageant in Victoria—'Little Miss Bayside'. And there was commentary from Women's Day that included:


""The pageant was supposed to be a fun event, where little girls got to be princesses for a day. As my two-year-old Caja and I arrived I promised that as long as our objective was 'fun', all would be well. But when face-to-face with a baby in a pink tutu it was hard not to gently encourage Caja to brighten her smile a little.


""Three hours later I had seen kids parading across the stage smiling sweetly and waving at their parents—most encouraging, some scary. The grandmother who loudly criticised contestants on stage was awful. Little girls weren't allowed to play with their new friends in case their hair got messed up.""


""You had better do this right for mummy,"" snapped one mum to a tot.


What is really going on here? As a mother of girls I find it unbelievable that any parent would subject their children to a process of transformation so severe that, by the end of it, these little girls do not even look like children anymore. I also find it troubling that any parent would think it is helpful to put their daughters out on a stage to be judged only on their physical appearance. What kind of message does that send?


I personally find it very disturbing in this modern age where as women we have the opportunity to choose our own path in life and have the ability to become whatever we choose—a CEO, a politician, a business owner, a doctor, a mother, or any other career of our choice. At a time when we have gender equality, the right to vote and equal opportunity in the workplace, we still have practices going on such as child beauty pageants that reinforce areas of superficiality and overexaggerated emphasis on the importance of how we look, rather than the person we are and what we are capable of.


I believe all children, in this case particularly young girls, deserve the opportunity to be just children: to play, to have fun and to learn in a normal, non-competitive and not what I would suggest is a superficial way. Children should be free from the pressure of being critiqued and compared to others based on their looks alone. Cookson, an American academic, has said:


In the world of child beauty pageants, 5-year-old girls wear fake teeth, hair extensions, and makeup and are encouraged to 'flirt' onstage by batting their long, false eyelashes.


This sort of behaviour does not seem normal to me as a mother of girls and with two little granddaughters. The report from the American Psychological Association on the sexualisation of girls states:


Parents can also contribute to the sexualization of their daughters in very direct and concrete ways—for example, by entering their 5-year-old daughter in a beauty pageant in which she and other contestants engage in behaviours and practices that are socially associated with sexiness, wearing heavy makeup to emphasise false lips, long eyelashes, and flushed cheeks, high heels to emulate adult women and revealing ""evening gowns"".


Although relatively few girls actually participate in such pageants, they have become a topic of interest in the news, documentaries and advertising—


I understand that on some networks they actually have television shows dedicated to these pageants—


in particular regarding whether this precocious sexualization is problematic for these or other girls. In this way, the participation of a few may in fact contribute to the sexualization of many.


The notion of having girls as young as one or two years old entering beauty pageants begs the question: who is it really for? Many parents will argue that it gives young girls good life experience and the ability to understand competition and accept winning and losing. I would question that argument when we are talking about children aged under five, and as young as one or two. It would seem that in many instances the pageants are more for the mothers of the children, and this is simply not fair. In my opinion there is no good reason for taking away a little girl's childhood and replacing it with adult behaviour to fulfil what is ultimately the desire of the mother to compete and win. Some parents would defend their actions by saying it is nothing more than playing dress-ups and having some harmless fun. However, what it is doing—and perhaps unintentionally—is preparing young girls to seek approval for their physical appearance.


A recent editorial in the Age by Michelle Smith makes an excellent point. She says that beauty pageants normalise the notion that physical appearance is of the highest value. They teach young girls that being judged on their appearance is normal. To me this is just wrong. She said:


Girls' beauty pageants are a symptom of the way we socialise girls to value themselves on their exteriors, while boys do not learn that their worth depends in a significant part on their face and body.


When girls become women, they are already aware of the value placed upon fitting the feminine physical ideal. Whether they intend to read the news or to be the prime minister, a woman's appearance will be crucial to her success or failure.


It has been suggested that teaching girls to value themselves on their physical appeal can create numerous psychological problems, including dissatisfaction with themselves, eating disorders and depression. Dr Michael Carr-Gregg, an Australian psychologist, has also spoken out on the potential damage that can result from young girls being involved in these pageants. He said:




This is so clearly toxic—it's tantamount to having a tobacco-smoking competition for under-14s
—t
hat's the risk in terms of the psychological dangers, that's the comparison that I'd make.



It is not just the immediate effects that are concerning; clearly, there can be long-term problems associated with child pageants. I have been shocked and appalled by footage recently of little girls being bribed and pushed into competing in these pageants in America and it saddens me to think that we would allow anything even remotely similar to this in Australia.


It is paramount that we stand up and say something about the practice of little girls being paraded around in scant outfits and make-up while being judged on their physical appearance. The individuals behind these pageants must also take responsibility for their actions. As far as I can tell, these pageants are run like a business, with the primary aim of making money. This would clearly indicate to me that there is no real concern for the children and their wellbeing—rather, they are more concerned with the bottom line and making a profit.


The potential for damage is such that I do not believe we should condone child pageants in Australia. I would also argue in this chamber that we should seriously consider this issue and the real risks it poses. Today I have only scraped the surface of what is a much larger issue, and I have spoken about this previously. It is my concern that our children are being made to grow up and act like adults too quickly. This is not only inappropriate but also potentially very damaging.


Other issues with this problem are the early sexualisation of girls and inappropriate behaviour being encouraged by music videos and adult style clothing. In music videos, women more often than men are presented in provocative and revealing clothes and typically serve as decorative objects that do not have any other purpose or impact on the musical production. In most cases, they are not even playing an instrument. They are often displayed in ways which emphasise their bodies, body parts and facial features.


The impact that music videos, and celebrities featured in them, can have on young people is quite profound. Adult style clothing is just another part of the problem of early sexualisation of girls in particular. A recent study has found that, of all clothing items assessed, 31 per cent had sexualising features. In this instance, it may be easy to blame parents for dressing their children in an inappropriate way; however, the parents are not the cause of the problem. One researcher said:


Blaming the parents is exactly what the marketers want you to do. They spend $12 billion getting your kids to want the things you don't want them to have, and then they blame you for buying them.


When we have a situation where so many individuals in such different areas are becoming alarmed, I think we need to think seriously about a solution to this problem.


Journalists, child advocacy organisations, parents and psychologists have all expressed concerns that the early sexualisation of girls is a broad and increasing problem and is causing harm. It has been my intention today to draw attention to this broad and complex issue in the hope that we can work together to formulate a response, to ensure that the wellbeing of our daughters and granddaughters is of the highest priority. These young girls represent the future female leaders of our nation. They will one day be senators, members of the House of Representatives—that other place—teachers, mothers and professionals. It is our responsibility to ensure that their physical, mental and psychological wellbeing is preserved. I believe that by allowing children's pageants to run in Australia we are neglecting the best interests of our children.


I urge all those in this chamber and, as this is being broadcast, those in our community to think seriously about the negative ramifications that come from parading young girls around dressed as adult women. I encourage you to not support child beauty pageants continuing in this country.

Senator CHRIS EVANS
 (Western Australia—Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Jobs and Workplace Relations and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (15:01):  I seek leave to incorporate an answer to a question I took on notice during question time yesterday from Senator Bob Brown in my capacity representing the Minister for Defence.


Leave granted. 




The answer read as follows—



Australia takes very seriously the issue of the treatment of detainees and has made clear its commitment to ensuring that detainees are treated humanely, with dignity and respect and in accordance with all of Australia's obligations under domestic and international law.


The issue of detainee management in Iraq arose under the previous Government and was a matter handled by the previous Government.


These are matters for the previous Govern­ment. Ministers of this Government have no personal knowledge of those matters, including the specific role and function of then Major O'Kane.


The issue of detainee management in Iraq was the subject of the 2004-05 Senate Budget and Additional Estimates hearings for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of Defence (31 May, 1-3 and 17 June 2004 and 16-18 February 2005).


The issue of detainee management in Iraq and Australian personnel was also the subject of an Inquiry in 2005 by the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee into ""The Duties of Australian Personnel in Iraq"".


On 8 March 2005, the following matters were referred to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee:


a. whether any Australian personnel (including employees, contractors and consultants) were present, or had ditties which included being present, during any interrogations or interviews (however defined) of persons detained in relation to the war in Iraq, and in particular those persons suspected of having knowledge of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction;


b. whether any knowledge of or concerns regarding, the treatment of those Iraqi detainees was provided to Australian Government departments, agencies and ministers, and what actions resulted from the provision of this information;


c. whether the Iraq Survey Group (ISG) were able to report frankly and fearlessly on what they had found, or whether attempts were made to censor or otherwise distort their findings; and


d. whether any Australian personnel provided information or concerns to any part of the Australian Government relating to concerns about the functions or reports of the ISG, and what actions resulted from the provision of this information.""


The Committee reported in August 2005 and made one recommendation:




""The committee recommends that the ADP' review its procedures for instructing personnel about the various codes of conduct, ADF's instructions or Concepts of Operations governing the conduct of Australian personnel while engaged in overseas operations especially where Australian personnel are deployed with third country and respect as befits the professionalism of our forces and consistent with our domestic and international legal obligations 




""The detainee management framework draws on applicable international standards and advice front international organisations, including the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRO
)
. It is consistent with the Laws of Armed Conflict and the Geneva Conventions.""

Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:05):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (Senator Ludwig) to a question without notice asked by Senator Milne today relating to Forestry Tasmania.


Today we saw the Greens' latest shameful instalment of an unconscionable campaign for gaining a commercial advantage for its multimillionaire mate Mr Wood, a man who donated $1.6 million to the Greens. The Greens have manically pursued the bid by Mr Wood against another commercial player for a particular property in Tasmania and their manic pursuit of this can only be explained in terms of the huge donation that they received.


Let us go through the facts. Before the last election Mr Wood made a donation to the Greens of $1.6 million, the largest donation ever in Australian politics. Fact 2: the donation was personally negotiated with Senator Brown, who said afterwards he was 'forever grateful'. Mr Wood said in relation to this deal that helping the Greens win the balance of power in the Senate was 'probably a good return on investment'. There you have the facts: Senator Brown forever grateful; Mr Wood saying that it would be a good return on investment. Here we have the Australian Greens now, not only day after day but week after week, pursuing the commercial interests of one Mr Wood. Be it at question time in this place, the address at the National Press Club, getting access to the minister's office or even answering a question at a press conference about foreign investment, what was front of mind for Senator Brown? It was the Triabunna mill that he wanted his mate to be able to buy.


Let us go through the chronology. On 11 June, Senator Brown issued a press release promoting his mate's business venture. On 15 June, he asked a question to help his mate's bid. On 16 June, he asked another question to help his mate's bid. On 28 June, Senator Milne told ABC radio that it would be inappropriate for the state government to assist the person or company that was bidding against their green mate. On 29 June, Senator Brown could not help himself—he had to raise this issue at the National Press Club. On 30 June, at a news conference on foreign ownership, he had to raise his mate's case yet again. On 4 July, Senator Milne pressed the minister in this place trying to demand that the competitor not be supported. On 4 July, she then took note of the answer to promote the case even further. On 4 July, she even said about the competitor to Mr Wood—the $1.6 million donor to the Greens—that it had 24 shareholders and a valuation of $24 to buy a multimillion dollar woodchip mill. How outrageous! I have done the business search, I have done the company search and Mr Wood has got a shelf company as well with a value of $60 for a multimillion dollar site. Oh my good­ness, what tangled webs we weave.


The Greens have been caught out. They condemn Aprin with a $24 shelf company bidding for this venture. If that is to be condemned, why should not the Greens' multimillionaire mate also be condemned for his $60 shelf company? The list goes on. On 4 July, one of the state Greens said that if the state government supports this venture they will bring down the state government. This is the sort of bidding that the Greens do: they hector and they lecture us on this side and elsewhere in Australian politics about the evil of donations and how they corrupt the political system, and here we have it writ large that the Greens have—and I see Senator Rhiannon in the chamber—democracy for sale.




Senator Kroger:
  Hypocrisy for sale!




Senator ABETZ:
  It is hypocrisy for sale with the Greens, and I note the $1.6 million donation has not hit their website. The Greens stand condemned for their conflict of interest and they ought to fess up to the Australian people. (Time expired)

Senator STEPHENS
 (New South Wales) (15:10):  I am a bit overwhelmed by that amazing litany of complaints and accusations by Senator Abetz around this issue.




Senator Abetz:
  It's not only me; it's a lot of Labor supporters too, Senator Stephens.




Senator STEPHENS:
  Senator Abetz has a continuing vendetta. I know that he carries the flagship for his state, but this ongoing conundrum for him is a little bit unhealthy.




Senator Abetz:
  My task is to defend my state. It is no conundrum at all.




Senator STEPHENS:
  I can see that you do that, Senator Abetz, with great gusto. Today in question time we did hear some kind of explanation from the government around this issue. It goes to how we as a government and how we as a country can sustain forestry in Tasmania, given all of the challenges that there are within that industry, and how we can rationally consider how to support community and industry groups in working through the challenges of forestry in Tasmania. I know that much work is going on in considering the Tasmanian Forest Principles Agreement and in ensuring that people's concerns about specific private interests in the Tasmanian forestry sector can be part of the grand plan for that industry's sustainability.


When we think about the continuing argument on forest conservation and wood supply arrangements in Tasmania, we know that there are many positions and competing interests. For us as a government, the Australian government's and the Tasmanian government's responsibility is to ensure that the agreement preserves our high conservation areas and wood supply arrangements in a way that supports the communities as well. The kind of argy-bargy that is going on here in the chamber today around the question asked by Senator Milne does not do that case any good. It certainly does not help us to ensure that we look after the interests of the forest communities in Tasmania or that forest practices support sustainable forest use and conservation outcomes, which are at the core and the forefront of our considerations.


That we get consumed by this conflict between the Greens and Senator Abetz on this issue does not do the Senate any good and certainly does not reflect well on the interests we all share here for a prosperous Tasmanian future. When we think about the work that is going into the Tasmanian Forest Principles Agreement and the issues around Forestry Tasmania, ensuring they take responsibility for the wood supply contract, we know that we are really focusing on a sustainable industry for the long term and that we are trying to marry the social, economic and environmental considerations that are at play here and we acknowledge the challenges for Tasmania and not just the drought conditions that have been exper­ienced down there. There are the climate change issues that are part and parcel of our current debate. The main challenge we have with a state like Tasmania with a small population is making sure that we can do the things that need to be put in place to foster economic sustainability in a small state. So really, thinking through what has been part of Senator Abetz's contribution today, it does not help the argument for his state, for his economy, or for the communities that he is seeking to represent—




Senator Abetz:
  It is a shameful conflict of interest.




Senator STEPHENS:
  I know that you are very concerned about this perceived conflict of interest; you have taken this issue up in the chamber so many times, Senator Abetz. It really is pretty disingenuous. Senators here who are concerned about forestry in Tasmania should consider what the role of good government is. It is about how we actually deal with the issues and ensure that we have a very transparent and supported process of dealing with these major issues. (Time expired)

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2011-07-06,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:15):  Mr Deputy President, for as long as I have been in the Senate I, like you and others, have listened to endless hours of sanctimonious lectures by Senator Bob Brown and other Green senators but in particular by Senator Bob Brown about political donations. We have sat through endless hours of sanctimonious speeches by Senator Brown about the big end of town and its alleged relationship with major political parties. Yet now we discover that the party which Senator Brown leads, the Australian Greens, was last year the recipient of the largest political donation in Australian history—$1.6 million.


There is nothing of itself wrong with a large donation being received by a political party as long as disclosure obligations are met and the other requirements of the Commonwealth Electoral Act are met. But what makes this a particularly serious case, what makes this case approach the borders of corruption is that we now know that in public speeches both beyond parliament and within the Senate chamber Senator Brown and Senator Milne have sought to advance the commercial interests of that particular donor, Mr Graeme Wood. They did so yesterday in a question asked by Senator Milne and they did so again today in another question asked by Senator Milne of the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Ludwig.


The background of this is that Mr Wood is seeking to bid for the purchase of a major industrial complex in Tasmania, the Triabunna woodchip mill. His competitor in that bidding is another consortium known as the Aprin consortium trading under the name Fibre Plus Tasmania. Mr Wood is in direct commercial competition with Aprin to acquire the Triabunna woodchip mill. Mr Wood last year gave $1.6 million to the Australian Greens. In the sequence of questions, comments and other public utterances which were recited by Senator Abetz in his contribution, Greens senators—all of whom I might say have absented themselves from the chamber for this debate—have asked questions in order to damage the interests of the Aprin consortium and therefore of necessity to advance the interests of Mr Graeme Wood and his company.


When Senator Abetz and I in the opposition allege that there is a direct conflict of interest we do not do so lightly, but the facts do not admit of controversy. Of two competing commercial parties Mr Wood and Aprin, one of them, Mr Wood's company, paid $1.6 million to the Australian Greens last year, and in the months since and as recently as question time today a series of questions and statements have come from Greens senators—and in the Tasmanian parliament as well by Greens members of the Tasmanian parliament—seeking to damage the interests of Mr Wood's commercial competitor. There is a direct relationship between these events. Senator Brown, if he had any spine, would come into the Senate chamber and explain himself.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (15:21):  Thank you, Mr Deputy President. Could I congratulate you on your election as Deputy President. I look forward to working with you in that position. I just find this absolutely amazing. For the last few weeks we have had the coalition saying that the economy was on the brink of destruction because of a carbon price yet when they have an opportunity to actually raise these issues on the floor of parliament what do they do? They run and attack the Greens. They run and attack Senator Bob Brown. It just shows you how disingenuous this lot are. The important things for Australians now are to get a price on carbon, to make sure that households are assisted and to make sure that our industry is ready for the future. But what do we get from Senator Abetz? We get this vindictive hate campaign against Senator Brown. It is well known that you have this campaign going against Senator Brown. You come here to run these arguments. If there are any issues of misappropriation or wrong­doing then you should go to the appropriate authorities. This place should be dealing with the real issues, the important issues for Australians, and those are to ensure that we get a price on carbon and position this country for the future.


I find it absolutely hypocritical for the coalition and the Liberal Party, of any party, to talk about shelf companies and some problems in relation to funding. It does not take very long to find out some of the issues that the Liberal Party have been involved in over the years. Maybe they can explain to us what happened with Gerard Industries in South Australia with a shelf company in Hong Kong feeding money to the Liberal Party. Maybe, Senator Bernardi, you want to explain that if we want to talk about propriety in relation to elections. Maybe you want to talk about Gerard Industries and Hong Kong shelf companies. That might bring some light into the chamber.


Maybe Senator Abetz might want to talk about the payment by the Liberal Party for advertising for the Exclusive Brethren in Tasmania. We do not hear much about that, but it was reported in the press that the Liberal Party had bills sent to them for advertising to attack transgender Australians. That is what it was about: a minority group, the Liberal Party attacking them, the Liberal Party getting the bill and who paying the bill? The bill was paid by the Exclusive Brethren in Tasmania. So the hypocrisy just pours out of the Liberal Party when it comes to issues of getting funding outside of the appropriate process.


I tell you now: we did not hear much said about the Liberal Party taking money from big tobacco. You would put your electoral position before the health of Australians, so do not come here lecturing anybody about the implications of front companies for donations when you guys are prepared to take millions of dollars off of big tobacco—when it is clear that you are up to your neck in front companies. It is quite interesting. When they are doing the bidding of the Exclusive Brethren in Tasmania and Gerard Industries are the front company for the Liberal Party in Hong Kong, it is pretty rich for them to come here and talk about donations to any other party. It really is the pot calling the kettle black. I bet that in the future you will see how much money the mining industry has poured into the Liberal Party to oppose climate change in this country. You are hypocrites. You are a rabble. (Time expired)

"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2011-07-06,"



Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania) (15:26):  We see firsthand the sensitivity of the Labor Party over their coalition partners. They cannot even come in and address the specifics of the question that is put before the chamber; they have to have a rant and then run. For Senator Cameron to talk to the coalition about tobacco when it has been disclosed that the Minister for Health and Ageing has approached big tobacco for personal donations for her own campaign really demonstrates what we are talking about here today. It puts them in line with the point that we are making about the approach of the Greens, who, having taken a $1.6 million donation—the largest ever donation in Australian political history—now come into this chamber on a regular basis asking questions on behalf of the backers.


It is really quite extraordinary that they might do that, but as part of the process of doing that they misrepresent the issue that is being dealt with in Tasmania's forests at the moment. Senator Milne asserts that there is a clause within the process that excludes any new contracts. Senator Milne is talking about something that is history. It is something that has been superseded by the signatories agreement signed a couple of weeks ago. So Senator Milne is behind the times and does not know what she is talking about but continues to represent the interests of this major donor. In fact, the plant that is being spoken about is specifically referred to in the signatories agreement as continuing into the future. Part of the signatories agreement that Senator Milne referred to in her question to Senator Ludwig today is referred to as a vital piece of infrastructure for forestry in Tasmania and is written into the agreement as a continuing piece of infrastructure.


Regarding the other point that Senator Milne made about no further agreements, the next paragraph says it is recognised that there may be new players that take up existing allocations. So Senator Milne not only misrepresents the process but then comes in here to represent the interests of a $1.6 million donor to the Greens. It is not only Senator Milne and Senator Brown, as has been indicated by Senator Brandis; Mr Booth and Mr Morris in the Tasmanian parliament today also asked questions in relation to this matter on behalf of their major donors. The really disappointing thing is that there seems to be some form of acceptance, perhaps even from the govern­ment, that the only way to protect Tasmania's forests is to lock them up, but as part of the process the ENGOs are claiming 28-year-old regrowth from clear-fell and burn as high conservation value—a clear demonstration of how well forestry is done in Tasmania, a complete misrepresentation of the industry that is going on here by the Greens on behalf of their donors but also, in a broader sense, in the Australian com­munity, where they completely misrepresent the forest sector and the forest industry in their own interests. My suspicion is that this particular donor has been sucked in, unfortunately, by these misrepresentations of the Tasmanian and Australian forest industries by the Greens, and has been convinced to make this huge donation—$1.6 million, the largest-ever donation in Australian politics personally negotiated by Senator Bob Brown—yet continue to attempt to represent the interests of that donor in this particular case. In typical Greens style, they try to diminish the reputation of all of those involved. They tried to diminish the reputation of Aprin Logging. No, that is part of the Greens tactic: attack the person, diminish their reputation so anything that they possibly say in public will not be taken any notice of, and so the Greens can continue to go out and peddle their propaganda.


It is really disappointing that continued misrepresentation of the negotiation process in Tasmania is put into this place by the Greens. It is very disappointing that the government will not stand up to the Greens in respect of the value of our native forest industry in Australia and it is most disappointing that there is not one member of the Tasmanian ALP in this chamber.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2011-07-06,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (15:31):  I was going to suggest I might have been taking note of a different answer but, in view of the previous speaker, I am assuming we are taking note of an answer from Senator Ludwig.




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
  That is correct, Senator Milne.




Senator MILNE:
 I am very pleased to hear through you, Mr Deputy President Parry, that Senator Colbeck aligns himself to Forestry Tasmania and to the Aprin Logging deal in relation to the purchase of Triabunna. I think, when the truth comes out about this, everybody will be running a mile from having anything to do with it.


What have we got? We have got a scenario where Gunns wants to sell the woodchip mill and needed to do so by 30 June and could not get anyone in the forestry industry to buy it. The forestry industry wanted that woodchip mill to continue in complete defiance of the forest principles process, which is meant to be resolving the longstanding conflict in Tasmania's forests. 


Then what have we got? We have got Forestry Tasmania, a government business enterprise which is supposed to be support­ing the Tasmanian government in the forest principles process, doing some deal with Aprin Logging to provide them with a wood supply so that it would be viable for them to purchase the woodchip mill. Then we discover that the Tasmanian department of economic development has let it be known that should Aprin Logging ask for a loan it would be favourably looked upon. 


And what do we find? They then apply for a loan from the Tasmanian government to buy a woodchip mill for which Forestry Tasmania has given them supply, and now we discover in the Tasmanian parliament that Forestry Tasmania has entered into a profit-sharing arrangement with this very same company. The joke about that is that a profit-sharing arrangement will be a loss-sharing arrangement. Forestry Tasmania has posted yet another loss, another $6 million loss. It is lose, lose, lose. It is in debt and, if it were a private company, it would be insolvent. It has had to get letters of comfort from the Tasmanian Treasurer in order to even keep operating. That is the state of Forestry Tasmania. 


Aprin Logging, we now discover, does not have the resources in order to buy this mill; it has done it through a shelf company, which has set up Fibre Plus. It has got 24 shareholders and a capital of $24. A $24 shelf company buys a woodchip mill with a loan from the Tasmanian government promised with Forestry Tasmania putting up the wood supply agreement and, at the very same time, they are in negotiations with the Commonwealth saying, ‘Get out the Commonwealth chequebook; Tasmania needs the cash here to protect our forests.’ 


Who is being deceptive here? In the forest principles process, there is a statement that clearly says: no new contracts for logs—no new contracts. Yet Forestry Tasmania has just entered into a profit-sharing arrangement with Aprin Logging in relation to a woodchip mill. I would like to know, as I am sure the minister will need to know, exactly whether Forestry Tasmania has entered into any kind of agreement with Aprin Logging on that wood supply, because that would be in total contravention. 


What is more: where did Aprin Logging get the rest of the money from? It has not got that sort of money. We do not know who the principals are of Fibre Plus, but it is about time the Tasmanian community did. Senator Colbeck may know, given his support for this arrangement. I do not know and I think the Tasmanian community deserves to know. 


I asked the minister yesterday to guarantee that no Commonwealth money would go to Tasmania as a result of this forest principles process until we know what this deal is—and I believe it will be a corrupt deal—before the Commonwealth parts with a cent going to Tasmania, because this kind of dealing is what has given the Tasmanian logging industry such a bad reputation for such a long time. There is a cosy arrangement in Tasmania between politicians, the wood­chippers and this industry that has led to a disaster for the environment, a disaster for the Tasmanian community in terms of the state of the state and the finances there. Now we have got this deal going on and the Commonwealth is apparently oblivious to this particular deal. So let us hear what the Commonwealth is going to do about it. 




Senator Abetz:
  I seek leave to table an application for registration as an Australian company of the company known as Triabunna Investments Pty Ltd showing a paid-up share capital of $60: $30 from a Mr Graeme Thomas Wood and $30 from one Janet Heather Cameron. 




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
  Is leave granted?




Senator Bob Brown:
  No. The form here and the proper procedure—




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
  Senator Brown, is that a point of order?




Senator Bob Brown:
  Yes.




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
  What is the point of order, Senator Brown?




Senator Bob Brown:
  The point of order is that if Senator Abetz cares to circulate the matter to seek leave then I would imagine, as a matter of course, we will be giving it to him, but he must observe proper procedure in this place and make that available before it is tabled.


Leave not granted.

Senator LUDWIG:
  Australia takes very seriously the issue of the treatment of detainees and has made clear its commitment to ensuring that detainees are treated humanely and with dignity and respect and in accordance with all of the Australian obligations under domestic and international law. The issue of detainee management in Iraq arose under the previous government and was a matter handled by the previous government. Ministers of this government have no personal knowledge of those matters, including the specific role and function of Major O'Kane.


The issue of detainee management in Iraq was the subject of the 2004-05 Senate budget and additional estimates hearings of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of Defence throughout 2004 and 2005. Australian policy towards the treatment of detainees in relation to the war in Iraq was also examined by the inquiry in 2005 by the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee into the duties of Australian personnel in Iraq. Noting the extensive inquiries that have already been conducted into this matter, the government does not propose to initiate or conduct another inquiry into these issues. The government, therefore, on that basis, does not support this motion.

 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (15:47):  I seek leave to make a short statement.




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
  Leave is granted for two minutes.




Senator BOB BROWN:
  The submission by Senator Ludwig is quite extraordinary and it is a failure of responsibility by this government. The events at Abu Ghraib drew worldwide condemnation because they were in breach of international laws and because they happened under the presidency of George W Bush, who had invaded Iraq to uphold international law.


The minister is right: there were some very limited inquiries back in 2005—which he knows was six years ago—which did not involve, for example, a proper inquiry using the knowledge of Major O'Kane, let alone American participants in Abu Ghraib. We also know that the requests from the Leader of the Democrats in Congress, Nancy Pelosi, for Major O'Kane—as the Australian involved in these events—were turned down. So there has been a denial by Australian governments to have this matter properly canvassed. Now there is a whole bank of new information coming from the Sydney Public Advocacy Centre, and that information makes the situation all the more important to inquire into. I am amazed that this government does not support this proper move for an independent inquiry, with judicial function, into this matter to open it up and put it to rest. Question put:


That the motion (Senator B Brown's) be agreed to.

  Thank you, Mr Deputy President, and I thank the Senate. The Australian Greens at this point are seeking to refer the Criminal Code Amendment (Cluster Munitions Prohibition) Bill 2010, which is currently before this chamber, to the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. The committee examined the parent convention, the Convention on Cluster Munitions, which is very good. It has been worked on over a number of years. It is as a result of the extraordinarily hard work of civil society organisations and governments, including, we thought, the Australian government. We have taken a lead role on this and it is a position that we should be proud of.


We understand that there are very serious flaws in the government's bill—flaws that the opposition may be contemplating supporting. The Selection of Bills Committee noticed that the bill was inconsistent with recommendations made by JSCOT. That is why we are seeking to have it referred back to the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. The flaws are absolutely obvious to anybody with any regard to this issue. It is extremely important that the parliament takes time for second thoughts.


At this point I bring to the attention of the chamber an open letter to the Minister for Defence, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Attorney-General on this very issue. It is an open letter signed by dozens of eminent Australians, including: Tim Costello; Mark Purcell of the Australian Council for International Development; Emeritus Professor Ron McCallum AO, who is the Senior Australian of the Year; and Jody Williams, who is a Nobel Prize laureate. A number of prominent Australians have signed this letter calling on the parliament to take a second look.


I seek leave to table the letter, which I circulated well in advance to the whips, and have it incorporated into the Hansard.

letter
 read as follows—





Open letter to the Defence Minister, Foreign Affairs Minister and Attorney General



Dear Minister Smith, Minister Rudd and Attorney General McClelland


In 2008 you, Minister Smith, signed the Convention on Cluster Munitions for Australia. This important international treaty bans cluster bombs, an indiscriminate class of weapon known to cause significant and long-lasting civilian harm, particularly to children. We wholeheartedly endorse the treaty's aims and congratulate the government on having signed it.


In order to ratify the treaty, Australia must pass legislation to implement the treaty's obligations in our domestic law. However, the proposed legislation, shortly to be debated in the Senate, contains serious flaws which undermine the whole purpose of the treaty.


The treaty contains a clause which allows state parties to continue cooperating in military alliance with countries not party to the treaty. This clause protects troops of state parties if they are inadvertently involved in cluster bomb use during these joint operations. This is necessary and sensible, particularly for Australia, given that our major ally the USA has no intention of joining the ban on cluster bombs.


The problem with the government's proposed legislation is that it goes much further than is necessary to maintain our military alliances. The legislation allows Australian troops to directly and actively assist in the use of cluster bombs. It also explicitly allows non-state parties to stockpile cluster bombs on Australian soil and permits them to transit cluster bombs through Australian ports and airspace. No other ratifying country has provided such a blanket exemption.


These exemptions are unnecessary at best and add little or nothing to our national security. At worst, they run directly counter to the treaty's intent by setting a precedent which explicitly facilitates the ongoing use of cluster bombs.


In a submission to the government, the International Committee of the Red Cross said the abovementioned problems with the proposed legislation ""would have the unfortunate consequences of effectively permitting activities that could undermine the objectives of the Convention and contribute to the continued use of cluster munitions rather than further their elimination."" We agree.


The goal of the Convention on Cluster Munitions is clear. It aims to eradicate cluster bombs and put an end to the suffering they cause for all time. We therefore seek your support in ensuring that Parliament amends the draft legislation to reflect and fulfil that aim.


Yours sincerely

The Gillard Government's decimation of the live cattle trade to Indonesia and the catastrophic consequences for family farms and supporting businesses.

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2011-07-06,"



Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Deputy Leader of The Nationals) (16:09):  I rise, sadly, to speak about a situation that certainly two months ago no-one would have possibly thought was going happening. It was at the end of the wet—it has been a very long wet—and people were very keen to get out on the properties, starting to do those things that make a business, and that is move cattle off the place, provide an invoice and actually get some funds back in the system, because they have not had a pay cheque since October.


This has been a fantastic industry. Over the last 20 years they have gone through some major changes. They have actually changed even the breed of the cattle. Instead of having shorthorns that, although they were doing well, it was a bit of a struggle—it was very hard to get into markets and it was a long distance away. With the innovation of Australians, they changed the animal they grew. They went to Bos indicus—a brahman zebu breed—and they have bred to the country since then. Trucking companies sprang up to support the industry. Ships decided that Darwin was a major port. They developed the trade overseas, particularly into Indonesia and the Philippines. They developed feedlots. They have gone through processes of developing feedlots that met the very highest standards, trucks that carted cattle at the very highest standards and ships that did the same. 


That was not always the case. I can recall times when there was a lot of concern about the distances that cattle had to go and trying to keep that in sync with the responsibilities at the same time of ensuring that the driver had enough sleep. It was a very difficult process. We developed wet markets. We developed transport chains. I am talking about little trucks and little buses that go throughout the Indonesian archipelago taking Australian beef to very small markets. None of that was around 20 years ago. This is a massive amount of infrastructure. The feedlots require fodder and that fodder is grown by over a million people involved in the industry producing that fodder. The feedlots directly involve about 8,000 personnel. That is 8,000 families in Indonesia that depend very much on this trade.


We also have a growing appetite and a growing market for Australian beef. In fact, if every Indonesian simply ate one kilo more of beef every year, it would increase by almost double the current export levels. It is a market that has a huge future.


It is a truly international industry partner­ship. This is where we have industry in Indonesia, Indonesian businessman, who are in joint ventures in many cases in the development of this industry with Australia. It is truly an international industry.


Sadly, that changed pretty quickly. We had the Four Corners report, images which I think most of us now acknowledge were selected to provide what we all know now is an unbalanced story. Everybody said and I will say it again—any of the things that we saw are unconscionable and they should never happen again not only to Australian cattle but to all cattle. But then we had not cyclone, not a pestilence or some major disease that can ravage industries like this; we did not even have an act of God—we had an act of Gillard! She should have just continued to listen to Minister Ludwig when he said, 'We will close 11 of the abattoirs because we know those are the sorts of places that we don't want Australian cattle to go. It sent a clear signal. The industry straight away ensured that they were not going to go to those abattoirs and in fact started discussions across the divide to ensure that all the Australian cattle throughout the chain were going to go through and assurance process to ensure that these sorts of things did not happen again.


This closure seems to have gone forever. It has been a few weeks but in terms of the impact on industry, since I have lived in the Northern Territory—a very long time, since 1984—I have never seen the like of this. I have never seen the like of the impact on the communities. Up and down the track particularly we have almost all the businesses, whether you are Katherine, Tennant Creek, Alice Springs or parts of Darwin, dependent on the industry. I have been a bit surprised about how many businesses, whether they sell cars, parts, food to the stations, whatever it is, everybody has been impacted. It has had an absolutely enormous impact right across the divide. Some have told me that it has impacted on people in such a way that if they knew that this business was over and they were not able to cart cattle until next year they would be better off. They would be better off because they would actually have a clear vision of the environment in which they were operating. They would know they have to get another job, close down the station, sack people and make some decisions. But the environment at the moment has absolutely no clarity whatsoever.


The minister again today stood up and rolled out the normal garbage: 'Not a day longer; let me make this clear.' Industry need more than that. They need some security because there is only one thing that is consistent across this industry and across these businesses—whether you are a worker, an Aboriginal stockman or you own the station—and that is that the banks are relentlessly pursuing you to ensure that those relationships with the bank are held up. It is not only about those immediacies and them suddenly saying there is going to be a foreclosure. They are not the issues we are concerned about. It is having a default on a loan and then because of the default on a loan or an overdraft your interest rate goes up by two per cent. So what was today almost bloody impossible tomorrow becomes unfathomable, thus the stress levels of knowing you are mortgaged to a certain position, knowing you could probably hold out in a tough year but suddenly you know that there will likely be no income for at least another month. What the minister needs to clearly understand is this is not an industry where you can ring a bell or blow a whistle and suddenly it can all start again.


The one fundamental part of this that those on the other side may not have noticed is that we have to ship the cattle. If you check the ports out, there are no ships. Those workers have had to go and get another job; they cannot just sit around. It costs you $150,000 a day to hold these boats there. We are going to pay huge, obscene amounts of demurrage. That is why we want to try to avoid paying demurrage—no-one can afford to pay it. The ships have gone to ply their trade, a dedicated trade, in other parts of the world. What will they be doing? They will be carrying cattle to markets with the most demand. Unsurprisingly, that market has just been created in Indonesia by this govern­ment. There are no cattle flowing to Indonesia. The Indonesian market demand is around 300 tonnes a day. It is not getting filled and that is creating demand in a market we cannot get entry to due to our own decision, but other countries can get entry to it.


One of the things that really hurts me as a Territorian when I move around these properties is when you get some of the people who have only just got access to their own properties—our First Australians, the Aboriginal people who own the properties. There are six in Queensland, 55 in the Northern Territory and 22 in the Kimberley. It was not on the back of Kidman that the industry was built. The industry was built on the back of Aboriginal stockmen. They knew the country. They knew where the water was. They did not need a five-star hotel. They needed a horse and a swag and not much else. They are the ones that built the industry and now they are actually getting something back. They have their own land and governments have encouraged the return of land. They have their land. They have herds. They are getting going. They are employed—and suddenly this. You can insure against an act of God, but clearly you cannot insure against an act of Gillard. Again, they have been completely and utterly crushed. There is no future. 


No-one has made a decision that it is going to be five days out, 12 days out, 20 days out or a month out. There have to be business decisions about whether you keep people on, whether you lease another truck, whether you build yards or, in some cases, whether you can buy diesel to ensure that you can water the cattle. Imagine the fear of not being able to afford to keep your animals alive. This is going to be an absolute catastrophe in economic, social and animal welfare terms and this catastrophe was brought on this government by our own Prime Minister.

"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2011-07-06,"



Senator STERLE
 (Western Australia) (16:19):  I listened intently to Senator Scullion's contribution acknowledging that Senator Scullion is a Territorian. He certainly knows his stuff, he knows his territory, he knows his constituents and he knows the problems they face. As an ex-long distance truck driver who plied my trade through the Kimberley and through the Northern Territory for quite a few years—some that I remember fondly; some I would like to forget—I am very mindful of the importance of the live cattle trade to our state, to Senator Scullion's territory and, to a lesser extent, to Queensland. This is a travesty; it is shocking. There is no doubt about that. I think we would have far greater resolutions in this place if we could hear the sensible arguments put forward by people like Senator Scullion and not some of the hysterics from other members of the opposition.


But let us talk a little about the impact. I want to talk too about the impact on our Aboriginal stockmen. I am very actively involved, as is Senator Scullion, with Kimberley Aboriginal Pastoralists Associa­tion, known as KAPA. They are led by a wonderful Australian, Doodie Lawford, out there at Bohemia Downs. Doodie and I speak regularly. We contact each other a lot and I know that there are conversations in your territory, Senator Scullion, with Doodie and his mob on the impact this is having on them. But we have to be very mindful: we have to get this right. I am not going to stand here and say that this can go on for ever and ever. It cannot. It needs to be fixed and it needs to be fixed quickly, but it needs to be fixed in such a way that the industry does not get stumped again by footage that none of us want to see. 


On that footage, I have not met one Australian who condones that behaviour. I know for a fact that it would upset not only us in the city based populations but certainly our pastoralists. It was very distressing, but what also distresses me is what I found out today from a media report that I was not quite sure of. I received the report from Colin Bettles. If my memory serves me right, it was not from Colin. Colin who wrote it, but I think he is tied up with one of the farming papers.




Senator Nash:
  Rural Press.




Senator STERLE:
  Okay. This is no dis­respect to Senator Coonan, but it actually says that Senator Coonan was forewarned of export footage. That is fine. That is not the problem. Here is the problem I have. If I can just quote from the report, it said that Senator Coonan:


… was given the shocking Indonesian abattoir footage by Animals Australia and the RSPCA in confidence, at least one month prior to the ABC Four Corners program airing on May 30.


It goes on to say that Senator Coonan did not see it but her staff did. But the bit that alarmed me—I am quoting Mr Bettles—is:


She—


I assume that is Senator Coonan—


said the animal rights campaigners allowed them to have the vision in an attempt to build Coalition support.


I am not trying to digress, but what I am very alarmed about is that I put a phone call in to Animals Australia at 3.22 pm this afternoon. I spoke to a very friendly young lady there. I was chasing Ms Lyn White, who is the lady who is the face of the animal cruelty campaign. Unfortunately I have not been able to confirm if that is true or not, but I think that says it all. Before I go any further, if that is the way that the RSPCA and Animals Australia conduct their business, that is just disgusting and disgraceful. I think I would have bipartisan support in this chamber. They think they are so smart and so clever that they will use the coalition to build support to bring an industry to its knees. I am not condemning the opposition; I make this very, very clear. How can we, as responsible Australians who have an affinity for anything that is not cruel to animals—as a nation who loves animals—support this? I do not even want these people in my room. If this is the way they do business, they are not welcome in my room. So I hope this message gets out loud and clear to the RSPCA and very loud and clear to Animals Australia: you are not welcome in my room.


Let us get back to the problem that we have in hand. A major problem that we are confronted with—certainly in the Top End of Australia—is, as Senator Scullion put it so brilliantly or so pointedly—




Senator Nash:
  Eloquently.




Senator STERLE:
  Eloquently? Why do you have to use these big words? Okay, that is enough of the big ones. He done well! He did very good! He was quite right that we have Brahman cattle. Brahman cattle are the main cattle that are used for export. Brahman is not a breed of cattle that we have in our market. But my pastoralists in the Top End, particularly the Kimberley Aboriginal pastoralists that I deal with extensively, are faced with a massive problem. They have a product that is not wanted in the Australian domestic meat market. We have this misbelief that is being put out there—and certainly this is not political—that all of a sudden we can open up abattoirs all along the northern coast which we used to have, such as in Port Hedland, Broome, Derby, Wyndham and Kununurra. I for one would love nothing better than to see our abattoirs reopened and our meat slaughtered here in Australia. I would love nothing better than to think that there is actually a requirement for a boxed meat market to Indonesia. The truth—the harsh reality; the fact—is that there is not. So, while we are fighting all these side arguments and silly statements coming from all sorts of self-interest groups or whatever they are, it is not fair for those who do not know our meat market and our live trade export market. That is not an option for us. The only option we have is to get this $330 million industry back on track. We need to do it quickly. We need to do it the right way. Doing it the wrong way is not an option for us, because if this is the behaviour that we have from Animals Australia—if this is their modus operandi and that of the RSPCA—then goodness knows how long it will be before it all appears back on our TV screens again with images of animal cruelty. That would be a travesty for our northern producers, for those directly employed by the producers and for all those very important service industries that rely on this very important trade.


As Senator Scullion said, our truckies are a very, very important part. In fact, if it were not for the truckies, it would not matter how good our cattle are or how great our market is; the cattle would not get there. It does upset me, alarm me and hurt me to hear that 30 truck drivers two weeks ago were put off the job. They were employed, I believe, with Road Trains Australia. I know the trucks, because they used to be bigger than mine and would try and take their part of the road and mine—that was when we had single-lane bitumen. There is nothing worse. Where are these truck drivers going to go? What the heck are they going to do? It is not as though they are going to be sitting under a tree waiting for the whistle to be blown to signal that we are back on and everything is going to happen. It is not only the truck drivers, those people that have invested their life savings in purchasing those trucks and those crates. What about the tyre fitters? What about the auto-electricians? What about the mechanics? It goes on and on and on. If anyone wants to have an argument with me—I know no-one in this chamber does—about the costs of running a vehicle, bring it on. But they will not; I know that. There are a number of other industries that hang off our northern export live trade. It is a nonsense to think that tourism will carry us through and we can survive in that part of the world when we have a window of about five or six months of good weather. There are no other jobs for these people; there are no other opportunities.


It is very important to notice that we have implemented—I know we have copped a bit of flak—some assistance for those that are affected. I know that we will always have people saying we are not doing enough. I have heard the commentary saying: 'Stick it in your back pocket. We don't want handouts; we want our industry back.' Fine, but I remember when Ansett Airlines collapsed. I am an ex-Ansett employee, and I remember when 30,000 Australians were thrown out on the street overnight with absolutely no assistance. So if we can at least afford some assistance while we work our way through this and while the minister is doing his best—I believe the Prime Minister has the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Trade and everyone working on this to try and get this unfortunate situation corrected—then I think it is a bit disin­genuous to throw that back in our face and say that we do not care. We all care. I do not know, but I would be pretty close to the mark to say that I do not think the minister has been sleeping very well in the last few months with the pressure that is on him. With the greatest respect, I fully endorse and support his position, because the last thing we want, as I said, is more footage of animal cruelty.


We will have to have a very, very structured system. We need to have international standards up to OIE; that is not an argument. We need that. We need the supply chain. We need to know—for our own sake and for the sake of the producers and the cattle—where they have come from. We need to be able to track them through our National Livestock Identification System from the farm to where they end up in Indonesia. Do not forget that when the Indonesians take our Brahmans they put an impost on our growers and our producers that there be nothing over 350 kilograms. So they have them and fatten them up in Indonesia for a period that the good Dr Back would be able to tell me; I think it is about 80 to 100 days to get them up there. But we have heard stories of our cattle appearing in the slaughter yard some two years after they left Australian shores. That is not good enough. We also need an independent auditor on the ground. This is what we need. This is where I am going to do my darnedest to work with my minister to assist this fantastic industry and get it up and running. For goodness sake, let us get it done as quickly as we possibly can.

",Senate,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Live Animal Exports</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,16,1
"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2011-07-06,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (16:29):  I would like to give some historical perspective to the whole issue of the live cattle trade. It in fact goes back, Acting Deputy President Mark Bishop, to our own then colony of Western Australia. It was in 1838 that the vessel Black Swan, which happened to be under the command of my great-great-grandfather, Captain Edward Back, shipped the first live cattle out of the colony and, ironically, it was to Batavia. From the records of the voyage they travelled well and they arrived safely. So our family has been involved in this trade for some 175 years. What is interesting and important to know is that the demand for beef in Indonesia came about as a result of a chronic shortage of protein, especially for the lower socioeconomic sectors of Indonesian society. Up until 8 June this year, Australia had become a very proud and consistent supplier of that protein, through beef. We need to get that back on deck as quickly as we can, as has been agreed.


It might be of interest to the chamber to know some of the background. I acknowledge CSIRO for its establishment in Bogor, Java, of a microbiology laboratory in which they not only provided a pathology service but trained the first Indonesian technicians and scientists in this area. So it has its origins there. In fact, so impressed was the then Indonesian government with the contribution of Australia through CSIRO that they became interested in our trade. It was in 1990-91 that the first cattle left Darwin to go up to Indonesia to start to service the trade. You would be interested to know that in 2010—which is not many years from 1990—we shipped 874,900 cattle to Indonesia, with a value of about $684 million, and we have a herd size in the north of Australia of some 3.2 million cattle. That is the size and scale of what we are dealing with. It is important for people to understand that, in parallel with that trade developing, we had a scenario in which we brought Indonesian veterinarians and stockman down and educated them at the Katherine Pastoral College. This was critical to the transfer of Australian technology and knowledge and the building of relations.


Let me now lay to rest this allegation by others that the live cattle shipment in some way is cruel or abhorrent. The official figures from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, which are circulated twice annually, indicate that 0.1 per cent—one beast in a thousand—die on the ships. More important for people to understand is that, far from it being a cruel trade, cattle actually maintain weight and put on weight on the journey to Indonesia and also to our other markets in the Middle East, Turkey and now even as far afield as Russia. That is how good we are—we are leaders internationally in the design of ships, the management of those vessels, the nutrition, the stockmanship et cetera. Australia leads the world in that. It is so disappointing to hear this nonsense spoken about apparently cruel conditions on ships. It just is not the case.


Meat and Livestock Australia have been much maligned, and it is not my role to defend them, but people must understand that they have contributed, along with the shippers, to the excellence of the shipboard transfer of cattle from this country. They can also take a leaf in the sense that the quality of feedlots now in Indonesia and other places is almost up to and in many cases is at international level. That, again, has been an Australian input. It should be acknowledged that Australia stands alone as the only country that invests heavily in personnel, transfer of technology and knowledge, and assistance to our end markets. Often all we hear about in this place is Europe. Let me tell you that once vessels leave the European shores there is no interest by European vendors, as there is by Australian vendors, and has been for many years, in all our markets.


I come to genetic improvement, and Senator Sterle quite correctly referred to Bos indicus cattle. It was two brothers, Mick and Ray Beebee, of Eukaronig Station in the Northern Territory, who brought the first Brahman bull across to the Territory in 1967 from Apis Creek Stud in Queensland and he was the foundation sire of the Brahman herd across the north of Australia. That is not many years ago, when you think of the genetic improvements which have occurred.


People need to understand just how essential this trade is to the Indonesians. You will hear it said that it is a load of nonsense that they need live cattle because they have got refrigeration and they do not need live cattle, they need the boxed product. Let me put it into perspective for you. The top 10 per cent of Indonesians certainly have refrigeration. They certainly use similar cuts to those we do and they buy out of restaurants and supermarkets. I refer to the other 90 per cent, those who must buy out of what are known as the wet or daily markets. We cannot replace those with animals slaughtered here in Australia. The circum­stances are that the need for protein there is dire. As I mentioned in this place yesterday, Ramadan, the highest consump­tion period of the year for the Islamic world, starts in only 24 days time and they are facing dire shortages.


We hear it said that we can process animals here. Let me tell you about the sort of consumption by many lower socio­economic Indonesians. They are around the abattoirs to collect bones, to collect intestines, to collect hooves and even to collect and split raw hide, the skin, so that they can boil that down and collect the gelatine. What we provide to that market is a very important source of protein and energy. So it is not possible for Australia to simply replace the live cattle market. If we do not get it going again, others certainly will.


The point has also been made, and unfortunately this has been run by meat industry union and other representatives, that it is the live cattle trade in Queensland that has actually decimated local processing. You can look at the statistics going back 10 or so years and you will see that it is always seasonal conditions; it is not the live cattle export trade that determines the numbers of animals slaughtered in Queensland abattoirs. In fact, the opposite is the case. Given the fact that no animals are now actually leaving Australian shores, there would be a far higher proportion of cattle going through Queensland abattoirs. Regrettably, only this week a large abattoir in Toowoomba closed, so it is further evidence that that is not the case. We hear it said, 'Why can't we rebuild abattoirs across the north of Australia to service this trade?' Mr Acting Deputy President, I can tell you that the north of Australia is littered with the carcasses of abattoirs that failed: Port Hedland, Broome, Derby, Windham, Darwin, Katherine—the list goes on. It simply is not economic to build and run an abattoir for a limited time of year.


We have a real animal welfare issue. We have an issue associated with the transport of cattle to the south. We have an issue associated with the animal welfare of animals remaining on leased properties. We have a circumstance where, because these animals are now not going to be shipped to Indonesia, the stocking rates on leased pastoral lands will be exceeded and therefore they will find themselves in default of their pastoral lease agreements. We are finding already a scenario in which the banks are having more difficulty in lending and advancing funds to pastoralists who now do not have very many livestock to offer as collateral. They have no equity in their pastoral lands because they are leased and, regrettably, if and when pastoralists have to leave those pastoral properties, again they have nothing to sell by way of livestock or property; they will merely have their own personal possessions.


Which way do we go in this? Yes, there has been an attempt at some level of compensation. I had a pastoralist only today from the Gascoigne call me to say that in their circumstance they do not meet the criteria, the reason being they cannot demonstrate under the conditions of the funding that they export their cattle directly to Indonesia. They in fact sell to agents who put shipments together, or would have put shipments together, and so they are now excluded from this level of support. We heard yesterday the owners of Moola Bulla station telling us it costs $120,000 a day to run the station, let alone to feed stock. They are indeed overstocked.


We have a circumstance in which the Northern Territory Cattlemen's Association is attempting to put together a cattle marketing pool. I believe it should be supported. All Australians must understand the severity of what is going on in the north. As I said the other day, livestock cattle are not a commodity like iron ore that can be left under the ground if it does not get a price. It is not like a production line which you can turn off. These animals are eating and feeding and their owners need support.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2011-07-06,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania) (16:39):  I stand today to speak on the matter of public importance and, in particular, to defend the comments that the Gillard government has decimated the live cattle trade to Indonesia. The Gillard government is trying to bring the live cattle trade to Indonesia up to standard. We are interested in the long-term sustainability of the industry. I draw attention to a speech that was made on Monday night in the House of Represent­atives by the member for Farrer, Ms Ley. As part of her speech, Ms Ley said: 




We urge the government to do everything in its power to restart the live cattle export trade to facilities that can demonstrate humane killing methods. 



I could not agree more. Once we have established supply chain assurance to be sure that cattle are processed in appropriate abattoirs with tracking and transparency and independent auditing, we will restart the trade. Ms Ley's further comments were particularly interesting. She went on to say:


Having been a farmer it broke my heart to see footage of the mistreatment of cattle in some Indonesian abattoirs. There is no excuse for this shameful behaviour. If any person, organisation, industry or government body knew of it and yet did nothing, they would stand condemned, no less by the opposition than by the supporters of this bill.


I find these comments interesting, especially when considering Colin Bettles's report in Stock & Landonlinelast Friday, which has already been referred to by my colleague Senator Sterle. The article is entitled Coonan forewarned of export footage. If that is accurate, I have a few problems. The article began:


NSW Liberal Senator, Helen Coonan, was given the shocking Indonesian abattoir footage by Animals Australia and the RSPCA in confidence, at least one month prior to the ABC Four Corners program airing on May 30.


It went on to say:


Senator Coonan said having the footage gave her time, before the issue “blew up”, to begin asking Agriculture Minister, Joe Ludwig, questions in Senate budget estimates …


If those reports are accurate, I wonder what Ms Ley thinks of her coalition colleague. Is doing nothing more than coming up with some estimates questions enough to escape her condemnation? Nobody wants to see this kind of cruelty that we saw on Four Corners repeated and I am sure that most cattle farmers would not want to see their cattle mistreated in such a cruel manner.


When some members of the opposition started expressing fabricated outrage they missed the point that allowing this treatment not only is devastating for the cattle but also in the long term will be devastating for the live export industry. The long-term sustainable future of the cattle industry depends on animal welfare assurances all the way down the supply chain. Unless we can guarantee that cattle will not be mistreated, we cannot ensure that sustainable future. That is why the government has taken the action it has. This is not just about ensuring the welfare of the animals we are supplying to the international beef market but about making sure we have an industry that continues to operate into the future.


I think the opposition live in glass houses. I say that because they had more than a decade in government to ensure a sustainable future for the industry yet failed to do anything about it. This is just another example of how the opposition are good at sound bites, they are good at three-word slogans and they know how to deliver bluster, hyperbole and silly political stunts, but what they cannot do is deliver a long-term reform. To illustrate the opposition's approach to this matter, just look at the fact that the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott, was reported yesterday as saying there is no reason why the trade could not be resumed straight away. Mr Abbott not only is astonishingly ignorant of the steps the government is taking to ensure improved animal welfare but shows absolutely no interest in finding out about it. He could not even make the time to attend a government briefing that was offered to him on this issue. It just goes to show that Mr Abbott is not the least bit interested in the long-term viability of this industry. What Mr Abbott is interested in is the short term politics.


We understand the difficulties that are being experienced by the industry in the face of this suspension, and that is why we are working hard with the industry, with state governments and with our Indonesian counterparts, to resume the trade on a sustainable basis. We want to see this trade get back up and running. We do not want the suspension to last a day longer than it needs to.


But when we commence that trade we must have appropriate supply chain assurances in place that can guarantee the welfare of livestock, as I said, not only now but into the future. Senator Sterle also mentioned that there are three government ministers working hard to this end. We have got the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Rudd, the Minister for Trade, Dr Emerson, and of course, leading the government's response to animal welfare issues in Indonesian abattoirs is the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Ludwig.


The Gillard government appreciates the importance of the live export industry—in Indonesia and beyond—to Australia's economy. There is no question about the importance of this industry to the livelihoods of graziers, producers and other stakeholders. During the suspension, we are providing assistance measures to provide short-term support to help the industry through this period. We welcome the establishment of a $5 million industry contingency fund to address animal welfare needs in the short term. 


In addition to this, the Prime Minister has announced a $30 million Live Exports Assistance Package to provide short-term help to individual primary producers and related businesses affected by the temporary suspension. This package will build on previous assistance measures, and will provide immediate grants of up to $5,000 for eligible businesses with further grants of $20,000 also to be made available.


Senator Ludwig has also announced income recovery subsidy payments to employees and small business owners who earn the majority of their income from the live cattle trade to Indonesia. Individuals can register straight away with Centrelink for this assistance and receive payments up to the level of Newstart allowance from 7 June for up to 13 weeks. Anyone who has lost their employment can register for priority assistance through Job Services Australia. They will receive immediate and personalised employment services. 


Of course the minister is not just working hard with industry and with the Indonesian government to establish supply chain assurances. He has appointed an independent reviewer, Mr Bill Farmer AO, to undertake a complete supply chain review of the live export trade for all markets. He has also met with key animal welfare advocates including the RSPCA and Animals Australia. The minister and the government are committed to reaching the best possible outcome for the industry and the welfare of livestock.


If the opposition doubts our claims that the actions this government have taken, including the temporary suspension, are necessary, then they should listen to the voices of the industry itself. On 8 June, the day after the suspension was announced, Luke Bowen of the Northern Territory Cattleman's Association was reported as saying:


This is something that needs to be fixed and producers more so than anyone are committed to see that happen.


Paul Holmes a Court, of Heytesbury Cattle Company, one of the biggest exporters of live cattle to Indonesia, on 10 June was reported as saying:


Currently our industry can't guarantee that our standards will be met all the way down the line …


The ban should only be lifted once we have an independent, auditable system which will allow that to happen.


And, on 22 June, Luke Bowen said on Sky:


Clearly we don't want to see any cattle going into this market unless those supply chains are secure, and there's no leakage out of those supply chains.


Producers are demanding that.


They don't want to see their animals going into a situation where they're going to be exposed to any of the things that we saw, certainly, or any sloppy practice.


So producers, most of all, are demanding that we have to have secure supply chains, and assured, independently accredited supply chains and that's where we are right now we're actually making sure that that happens.


So while members of the opposition wax lyrical about the consequences of this suspension for family farms and supporting businesses, they should consider the consequences for business of not getting this right. They should consider the conse­quences that industry have identified because industry know that they do not have a long-term sustainable future if supply chain assurances for animal welfare are not secured.


The Australian government will continue to work with the Indonesian government, the cattle industry and animal welfare organ­isations to develop a robust framework to ensure Australian cattle exports are handled appropriately and in line with community expectations throughout the supply chain. Once those assurances are in place, trade can resume. Until trade resumes, and this industry is back on a sustainable footing, I fully expect we will hear more slogans, more howls of derision, more attempts— (Time expired)

"Adams, Sen Judith",LP,2011-07-06,"



Senator ADAMS
 (Western Australia—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (16:50):  What an invitation! Thank you, Senator Bilyk. As a farmer for 38 years in the Great Southern area breeding both cattle and sheep for export I think that I do know what I am talking about and I feel very sorry for my colleagues who are in the Kimberley, the Northern Territory and Far North Queensland. We do have one senator from Western Australia on your side that does understand the industry but I do not think that anyone else does.


I want to get on to the World of Animal Welfare and the RSPCA. This afternoon I received an email from a colleague of mine who runs Three Rivers Station in the Murchison in Western Australia. He has pointed to the Teacher's guide to live export on the net being put forward by the RSPCA. He says:


I've had enough. I've recently been made aware of the Teacher's guide to live export for Australian schools prepared by the RSPCA developed by the World of Animal Welfare. It is delivered in a completely biased and grossly inaccurate manner in a deliberate ploy to sway the minds of impressionable young children with two guides prepared for target audiences of nine to 13 and 14 and over. Not only do I find it morally bankrupt to be involving children in this manner, it especially infuriates me that Australian taxes are being spent on such an initiative through the government funding of the RSPCA.


I could not agree more. It is headed up, 'Teacher's guide to live exports'. It says:


The following information is designed to assist you in delivering age appropriate information and providing students of all ages with ways in which they can help.


Guess what? We have a picture of sheep going up a race to go onto the ship. We do not have cattle. So obviously sheep are next to be banned from live export. It describes live exports:


Every year millions of Australian animals are exported live for slaughter. Cattle, sheep and goats are sent all over the globe, ending up in countries where animal welfare laws do not protect them. Many thousands of animals don’t even survive the sea voyage and those that do are subjected to handling, transport and slaughter in importing countries that is cruel and well below Australian standards.


The ships that carry these cattle, goats and sheep have a fatality rate on them that is less than if these animals were out in the paddock, so these sorts of statements being given to students gives completely the wrong message. And then guess what. There is a letter here about how to write to the Prime Minister:


Let the government know how you feel about live exports. Write your own letter to the Prime Minister to help end this cruel and unnecessary trade.


   …   …   …


Dear Ms Gillard,


After learning about the cruel and barbaric treatment of animals that are exported to Indonesia, I am asking you to call an immediate ban on all live exports. This trade simply will not be tolerated by the Australian public and we must act fast to stop any more animals from suffering.


It goes on to describe how the animals travel overseas, which is absolutely not right. This is the propaganda that is being given to our schoolchildren.


I go on to Mrs Christine Glenn from Ashburton Downs in the Pilbara. They are cattle producers. They have cattle waiting to go. They are really having problems. She said they were in drought last year and she is very worried that rural children and, more importantly, isolated children will be exposed to an even greater divide if basic schooling is not provided due to their geographic location. The problem here is the concern that it is fine to say Centrelink is supporting these families; unfortunately, any child going to boarding school is receiving no assistance whatsoever. As she says here, they were in drought last year and have no income this year. The income for this year was to come from their live cattle shipment, which now will not go ahead. Husband has to go off farm to earn an income, leaving her to run the station and teach the children through School of the Air. The boarding school children will not be able to stay there. So these are the runoffs from this particular issue that was decided overnight. I can assure you that, if any other trade were stopped overnight, it would be a circus. But it is fine to do this to the cattle people and later to sheep because there are not that many of them.


To quote: 'As an industry we've been disgusted with the complete lack of knowledge, awareness and understanding that has been displayed by the Prime Minister and Senator Ludwig and their complete indifference as a tsunami of economic destruction travels through Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland. The Prime Minister does not seem to be aware that their handling of this matter may be subject to a wide-scale legal action, as people will be forced to seek damages. Neither the Prime Minister or Senator Ludwig met with anyone in Indonesia or Australia to determine the consequences of their decision three or four weeks ago. Hundreds of jobs have been lost that may not be recovered, as many pastoralists will go to the wall on the basis of this suspension.' She continues: 'Our Prime Minister's decision has been at the cost of a whole generation's education. Our children's education has been denied, as we will not be able to cover the $15,000 to $30,000 required to send each child away to boarding school after the rebate. This is not a choice.'


That is what is happening on that issue. She also goes on to say: 'WA currently has a severe shortage of hay. There is not the feed on the ground due to two years drought and a 4,000 kilometre average to our closest slaughter point.' As Senator Back has said, these cattle are not the cattle that will go south, because they have been bred specifically to cover the Indonesian market. It has taken a long time to get that breed in.


Last Friday Senator Back and I attended a forum run by the Pastoralists and Graziers Association of Western Australia in Katanning. As President Rob Gillam says:


Livestock producers throughout Western Australia are now demanding that their livelihoods be returned to them.


   …   …   …


WA is the largest livestock export state in Australia, with over 350,000 cattle and 2.5 million sheep exported annually, yet the Minister cannot even be bothered to come over and meet with the pastoralists whose livelihoods have been affected by his actions.


Such losses are unacceptable in any industry and the Prime Minister has no choice but to remove her Minister from his portfolio and replace him with someone who will regain the confidence of Western Australian livestock producers.


I would also like to inform the Senate that a website has been set up by four women in Western Australia called Save Australian Farming. It is headed up by Jane Marwick, and the website is www.saveaustralianfarming.org. That will be up and running on Friday, and you can register on the domain now. I think it is very important that we get support for this to continue the export trade. As far as the animal husbandry goes, that is being well and truly looked at, and for the government to say that they could not have continued the trade, with three abattoirs with the closed loop circuit that they could have kept going they could at least have kept Indonesia on side. But, unfortunately, the diplomatic issues that are going to arise from this are very sad and very serious. A number of contracts ended on 30 June, and we may not have any contracts now until October—if we can get this mess fixed up.


One last thing: Kirsty from Nita Downs Station thought that the cattle that were being held in the yards on the station would be eligible for the cattle disease contingency fund. No. It is just cattle held in registered pre-embarkation premises designed for live export but unable to be exported due to the suspension of cattle exports to Indonesia. Those are the criteria. Therefore, those cattle that are being held on stations in yards and being fed will probably all end up over the limit of 350 kilos, because once they are being hand fed they put on weight. As you can see from TV footage, these cattle are not agitated; they are quite content to be eating their high-protein feed.


So these people are in a terrible situation. The mental health issues are very serious. (Time expired)

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2011-07-06,"



Senator CROSSIN
 (Northern Territory) (17:00):  I rise this afternoon to provide a contribution on this matter of public importance on live animal exports. I have to say from the outset that, like Senator Scullion, I have a strong commitment to representing our live cattle trade in the Northern Territory. No-one should be under any doubt whatsoever that we are working as diligently, as quickly and as hard as we possibly can to get this issue resolved.


I just want to go back to the beginning, from where this emanated. I am glad Senator Adams raised some of the issues the RSPCA has been highlighting. In the Northern Territory now I find that my constituents are caught up in this national debate about whether we should have live cattle exports at all. I believe we absolutely should. In the Northern Territory we have a massive industry for breeding cattle that has evolved over time and is designed specifically for exportation. We cannot simply come to a position where we say there will be no live cattle exports ever again in this country unless we turn away from the concerns of people I represent in the Northern Territory.


I am a strong defender of this industry, and I am certainly very strong in wanting to see this resolved very, very quickly. I get the same sorts of emails that other senators in this place are getting, particularly Senator Adams. I am not prepared to name those cattle stations or those people in this chamber—I want to respect their privacy—but I am getting those emails. These people are saying two things to me. The first thing they are saying is, 'We care for the cattle we have bred and we were shocked and horrified when we saw the footage on Four Corners.' The second thing they are saying is: 'We do not want that to occur. We do not want to put our cattle on a boat that will end up in a country where they are not slaughtered humanely, and we want that fixed.'


Everyone is with the program on wanting to ensure that when these cattle turn up at a slaughterhouse it is done as humanely and as appropriately as possible. But when people email me and talk to me about this issue they have very real concerns about what Meat and Livestock Australia have been doing. On the very last sitting day for the 12 senators who recently left from this place there was an adjournment debate—very late on that Thursday night. I listened attentively to the last speech Kerry O'Brien gave in this place. I urge senators to listen to what Senator O'Brien said. He had concerns about what Meat and Livestock Australia has been doing with the levy it has been collecting from these cattlemen and women and from these stations.


At this point in time, no-one is really turning their attention to what the industry bodies were doing during the lead-up to this problem and what they are doing now. As I understand it, the Northern Territory Cattle­mens Association is not represented by Meat and Livestock Australia. There is a real disconnect between what is happening in that industry body and what is going on with the cattle association in the Northern Territory.


I know we have met with these people to try to resolve this as quickly as possible. The Prime Minister has been in the Northern Territory twice in a month to meet with them. She came last Wednesday, and I was present at that meeting. Also, in a cooperative effort, Senator Scullion, Minister Warren Snowdon and I, at my initiative, had the whole of the Northern Territory Cattlemens Association here in this building for two days two weeks ago. They had access to a range of ministers, spokespeople from the opposition and members of the broader parliamentary community here, trying to get people to understand why they are so reliant on a live cattle trade. That is where a lot of their focus has been—trying to dispel this humbug about live cattle exports. They have had to fight this rearguard reaction from people who do not want live exports to occur, and their attention has been diverted away from maintaining the trade they have. If we set all that to one side, if the cattle people did not have to have their energies diverted to defending what they do so well, then perhaps we might have all been able to get with this program much faster. People are working extremely diligently to get this resolved as quickly as possible.


There is no question about the value of the live animal export industry to Indonesia or beyond. It is vital to our economy, worth over $300 million. It is so vital, in fact, that I notice that the Northern Territory Chief Minister, Paul Henderson, and Minister Kon Vatskalis have been in Indonesia meeting ministers and officials from that government and having a look at what is happening. Be under no illusion here. Everyone is pulling out stops as quickly as possible to get this resolved. We want to ensure not only that the welfare of the animals is taken care of but that we also have a closed loop. We want to be absolutely satisfied that from the minute the cattle get onto that boat until they arrive in Indonesia, and from the paddock to the point of slaughter, there is a supply chain that is regulated and supervised. Can that happen overnight? No, it cannot. Can we ensure that it happens?


We are seeking to work closely and cooperatively with Indonesian officials to get this moving as quickly as possible but this involves working inside, and with, another country. That country, as I understand it, also wants to get this resolved. There have been reports, for example in today's media in the Northern Territory, from Minister Kon Vatskalis that this is now having effects on families in Indonesia. 


In this situation we have to be convinced and reassured that once we get these cattle moving the assurances—the checks and balances—are in place so that the trade can resume. I have no doubt, after the meetings that I have been involved in for the past month, that cattlemen, the Prime Minister and Minister Ludwig, departmental officials and the cattlemens association are diligently working around the clock with the Indonesian government. The cattle industry and welfare organisations are developing a robust framework to ensure that Australian cattle exports are handled appropriately.


I want to draw people's attention not only to the independent review that we have set up and the fact that payments and assistance have been provided to people but to what I want to see at the end of the day: this problem fixed forever. Once these cattle start moving I do not want us to be back in here in three, five or 10 years time. This is an opportunity to try to support the cattle industry and the people I represent in the Northern Territory as best, as efficiently and as compassionately as we possibly can.


If we really get this right—so that in the supply chain loop we do not have just five or six abattoirs regulated but 20, 30 or 50 abattoirs regulated—this will provide an opportunity for the cattle industry to grow. It will be an opportunity for the cattle industry to be able to say: 'That was a pretty rough patch back then but we now have this industry sorted forever. We now have an agreement with the Indonesian government, who are as committed to resolving this as we are, and this will be fixed up for all time.'


As the Prime Minister said last week in Darwin:


... I wouldn't let an extra day go by before we resume this trade, as soon as we had the animal welfare measures addressed.


As soon as this problem is sorted and as soon as we have an agreement with the Indonesian government—I know they will be diligently working as hard as we are to resolve this—we will get this trade moving again. Not one day will be wasted. Not one extra day will go by. The minute we can get these cattle moving off these shores in a live export trade we will do this.


At this point in time I want this nation to stop diverting attention to a discussion about whether there should be live exports. There are live exports and they are going to continue under our watch. (Time expired)

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2011-07-06,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (17:10):  I present the final report of the Community Affairs References Committee, Disability and ageing: lifelong planning for a better future, together with the Hansard record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.


Ordered that the report be printed.




Senator SIEWERT:
  I table the report and I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


It is with great pleasure that I table this report. This report contains some very important recommendations. It contains 15 recommendations and makes some points about some very important issues. The committee report has taken quite some time to develop and we had hearings in a number of locations around Australia, including Canberra, Melbourne, Sydney and Toowoomba. 


It is important to note that this report coincides with work being undertaken by the Productivity Commission into disability care and support. However, there is a significant difference between the work that we have done in this report and the draft report of the Productivity Commission. The focus of our committee report is on the lifelong and sustainable planning that assists carers of a person with a disability, helps them to plan for the future and particularly helps them answer the questions: 'What happens when I'm no longer here? What happens when I can no longer care for the person that I am caring for?'


As I said, the committee took evidence in a number of locations around Australia. We took evidence from people with disabilities, carers, carer organisations, peak bodies, service providers, and state and federal government departments. The evidence that the committee received suggested that the challenges facing the disability sector are substantial and that the existing system is not operating effectively. People with dis­abilities, carers, service providers and governments all agreed that there are many inadequacies in the choice, funding and support options available for people with a disability.


Given that Australia is anticipating significant population ageing, which will be accompanied by a reduction in the availability of informal care and support, the committee is deeply concerned by evidence suggesting that little sustainable planning is taking place. Many carers are so consumed by their day-to-day caring role that they have not even begun to start thinking about planning. Others find the planning a considerable challenge and need support to manage what is a complex and multifaceted task.


In the report, the committee focuses on why it is critical that whole-of-life planning takes place. We are particularly keen to point out the importance of whole-of-life planning and I will also point out here that this was picked up in a previous report that this committee did into the CSTDA as it was then known—the Commonwealth State Territory Disability Agreement. When this committee did that inquiry we picked up and highlighted the need for whole-of-life planning and we have looked at it in more detail in this report. The report considers some of the major practical barriers to planning including access to information, accommodation support, availability of respite, appropriateness of assessment tools, and the difficulty of navigating the disability and aged care interface. In spite of the fact that the government provides limited planning support to people with disabilities and their carers, the committee heard many inspiring stories, frequently told by parent carers, documenting the work taking place in the community. Across Australia there are pockets of people doing the most extraordinary work, in the most part voluntarily, because they see the need.


The committee heard of disability advocacy groups who have established what they call 'supported living funds', 'circles of support' or 'circles of friends' to assist with the future care of their adult children with disability; of parents in Sydney who are setting up an 'intentional community'; of a group in Gunnedah who established a rehabilitation day program for mental health consumers; of a group of very active parents in Toowoomba who organised a letter campaign, successfully advocating for funding to establish a house for shared accommodation, the Anden—hearing that story was simply inspiring; of an individual in Hervey Bay who organised the council to provide accommodation where she can support mental health consumers in living independently; and of the important work in my home state of Western Australia by Perth Home Care Services and by Planned Individual Networks, commonly known as PIN, who have established microboards and networks of support to ensure that people receive lifelong planning support.


While it should be acknowledged that some of these initiatives have received some government funding, many are established, supported and funded by parent carers and are taking place independently of govern­ment. Many of the grassroots level, non-government initiatives identified in our report emerged in response to the lack of government support or the cumulative frustration of dealing, over many years, with complex and confusing government bureau­cracies. Others emerged in response to service support which is often piecemeal, or where there was an absence of ongoing case management. Above all, these initiatives, frequently parent run, emerged in response to the frustration of dealing with bureaucracies that are simply not responsive enough, innovative enough or flexible enough to meet people's complex needs. Over and over again the committee heard that services are just not meeting the needs of people with disabilities or their carers.


In acknowledgment of these innovative planning schemes, the committee makes two significant recommendations. Firstly, it recommends that the government look to increase its support of these community based organisations that provide planning services. We believe this is essential. Secondly, it recommends that the govern­ment establish a national framework to give clear direction on how these organisations can ensure transparency and develop adequate governance arrangements. The committee envisages these guidelines also represent the beginning of an integrated and coordinated national approach to planning. It is really important that these innovative community organisations are given flexible support to provide their planning initiatives, but it is also essential, because of the very nature of the work that they do, that they meet the transparency and accountability requirements that we would expect, because these initiatives will be looking after the long-term needs of those living with a disability.


In addition to these recommendations, I would like to point out a couple of others. Of course, we believe all 15 are important, and I am sure my colleagues in the committee will highlight some more. We believe we have to solve the issue of portability of funding and services for people transitioning from the disability to the aged-care sector. We have to improve issues around portability of aides and support across state and territory boundaries. It just has to be resolved. It is not beyond the wit of this country to do this. We also need to look at issues around retirement from Australian disability enterprises. That is a key issue. There are many other important recommendations. Very importantly, the government needs to acknowledge the need for lifelong planning and to support this lifelong planning by investing in community based initiatives that make this happen.


Before finishing I would like to say thank you to, obviously, my colleagues on the committee. It is always a pleasure to work on the community affairs committees, whether it is the legislative or the references committee. I believe we work well together and do some very important work. I would like to acknowledge and say thank you for all the support and camaraderie we share. I would also very strongly like to say thank you to the secretariat, who have really moved mountains to get these reports done. They have had a tremendous workload over the last couple of months and continue to produce first-class work. Thank you very much to the secretariat. Very importantly, I want to say thank you for the hours of work that the community organisations, parents and carers put into our committee inquiry. These are people who are working day to day caring for people they love, and they took time out of their busy schedules to give us evidence, to write the submissions, and to come to our hearings and present evidence. These people sometimes struggle to get respite care on an ongoing basis or when they need it. They are the people that are doing it tough. We know that they need help and that there needs to be improvement in the services they receive. I thank them very much for the time and effort they put into ensuring that we got the evidence we needed to make the recommendations we have made.

Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (17:20):  In 2004, pretty soon after I came to this place, I was very honoured to be engaged in a Senate select committee that was looking at the issues of poverty in our community. Throughout that process there were some extraordinarily confronting experiences, and people gave of their hearts, minds and lives—which is a common experience in our committee.


I will always remember evidence that was taken in the city of Ballarat, a beautiful city. A lady came to the front and talked to us. She expressed the fact that she was very nervous. She did not tell me her exact age, but she told me she was in her 80s. I remember my friend Steve Hutchins was sitting beside me. She looked at me and said, 'I am so tired, but I'm too afraid to die,' which was a fairly confronting statement. I always say people should go back and have a look at our committee reports and evidence because they are a snapshot of our Australian community. She went on to describe the fact that she and her husband of many years—her husband had recently died—had a son in his 50s who had Down syndrome. She was too afraid to die because she did not know what was going to happen to her boy.


That was in 2004, yet the Senate Community Affairs References Committee heard those same stories as we listened to evidence. We can do better. We are at quite an exciting time, because at the same time as this committee was looking at the lifelong planning needs of people with disabilities and their families and handed down its report—we took a long time to work out a title for it, and we came up with something catchy: Disability and ageing: lifelong planning for a better future—we had the opportunity to look at the draft reports arising from the referrals that the government has made to the Productivity Commission on two key areas—there was a referral on the general area of ageing and a referral on the general area of disabilities in our community. The draft reports on these areas have been given to the government and government responses are due to come back into wider parliamentary and community discussion in the next few months. We hope that the work of the community affairs committee can add to the work of the Productivity Commission so that we can ensure that no longer will there be families in our community that are so tired, so lost and so afraid of the system that they are fearful of what will happen to their children.


I acknowledge the work of Senator Sue Boyce. Sue had brought a recommendation for an inquiry to our committee, and she was absolutely determined that we were going to act on it. That determination has been rewarded, because where we could we looked to build on work that had previously been done. As Senator Siewert said, a few years ago this committee looked at Commonwealth-state disability agreements and came up with a range of recommend­ations, some of which were part of the National Disability Agreement that the government brought in on 1 January 2009. We can celebrate the fact that there is now a national disability agreement; but when we read through the core elements of that agreement, we say that the states, the territories and the Commonwealth must work together to ensure that there is a better system for people with disabilities in our community.


The agreement goes through several topics. It talks about 'improved access to disability care, including consideration of systems that provide a single point of access.' How many times did we hear during the committee process about the need for a single point of access so that people would be able with confidence and without fear to contact one area from which they will be able to obtain information, support and guidance? Unsurprisingly, considering that it is in the national disability agreement, we have a recommendation from our committee saying that we should have a single point of access, and that is good.


The National Disability Agreement talks about there being 'a nationally-consistent assessment process and a quality assurance system', and the committee recommended that too. The National Disability Agreement also mentions the need for 'a renewed focus on early intervention and planning to ensure that clients receive the most appropriate and timely support.' The committee has recommended that also. In fact, we get a fair hint by looking at the cover of the committee's report that the committee think that that is a good idea as well.


The committee has recommended improv­ing the capacity of service providers to better develop and train care workers. That is a necessary ongoing measure, Madam Acting Deputy President Pratt, as you know. In any system that aims to provide care, we need to have trained, effective, caring, responsible workers so that that element of trust which is so intrinsically necessary to any government service delivery is put forward.


As Senator Siewert said with a degree of frustration, there is also the issue around consistent access to disability aids and equipment. It is ongoing, consistent and frustrating problem, and it is blindingly obvious that people who have disabilities in 2011 should have access to appropriate aids and equipment. It should not matter at what stage of the identification of their disability is at or whether they are covered by a state or a federal arrangement, they should have the best possible equipment and support so that they can have the most rewarding life possible.


Of all things in the National Disability Agreement, these are my personal favourites: the National Disability Agreement signed in 2009 is 'a commitment by all levels of government to work together to better measure the level of unmet demand for disability services' which promises 'continued reform of roles and responsibility in relation to community mental health disability services and aged care.' For me, one of the most revealing things about the committee process was that it showed that we have good policy. But we could have better policy, and through the introduction of the measures in the reports from the Productivity Commission on ageing and disabilities we can work to have the best possible policy for our community. We found consistently in the evidence we took, the submissions we received and in the general discussions that happened—at least after the hearings that I attended: people wanted to share with us; they wanted to talk with us—that people wanted to be involved. So the frustrating thing is that we have good policy but it is not being implemented. The core message for me is that we need to move to ensure that implementation is effectively monitored.


I am not saying that there are not good results—Senator Siewert referred to that, and our committee report mentions where there have been amazing successes and rewards. To be quite parochial, I mention here the Toowoomba Intellectual Disability Support Association—TIDSA—and Tony Lanigan, who is the chair of that organisation. He has been working with me and many people in this place for many years, talking from a parent's perspective about how a group of parents can get together and develop plans around the needs of their children and then consistently harry state and federal governments to ensure that they get effective funding. TIDSA has received some funding from the state government, and that organisation is a genuine success story. We need to have that success story replicated across all the communities in our country. The house that TIDSA has formed was described by some of the elderly people who came to the committee's hearing in Toowoomba as a life saver for them and their families, because they have a sense of confidence that their children will have a secure housing future and people to care for them. That is the kind of model that this report is hoping will be identified, imple­mented and rewarded through government policy.


The committee talked about access to the system, and consistently through the committee process we heard about the complexity of the system. That is true—the system is complex—but if we act on the National Disability Agreement, which talks about 'a commitment by all levels of government to work together to better measure the level of unmet demand' and if we look at how the reforms can operate, the system can become less complex. The focus should be on the individual and their family, which is the core aspect of the committee's report. I am going a little bit over our time, Senator Boyce, but we have it because there is no-one else here. The last chapter of our report looks at issues of lifelong planning and support schemes that are now in place. There are extraordinarily valuable processes in some parts of our country, which we put up as examples from which we can learn and hopefully build on in future modelling. When he came to see us, Mr Edward Birt from Life Without Barriers explained:


If you think about a system like person-centred planning, which is something that is talked about a lot at the moment in disability services, where the person's goals and aspirations are at the centre of what you are doing, their vision for what their life might look like is the driving force behind what we do, and every disability service standard around the country would say that is absolutely right: individual needs, decision making and choice, service access, valued status—the list goes on. They are all wonderful things. The legislation has it absolutely right, but I think that lack of funding and service options is a big problem.


What we learnt from the people who came to us is that there should be people-centred planning. We congratulate that; we want it into the future.

Senator BOYCE
 (Queensland) (17:31):  I am not quite sure how far we are going to take this multi-partisanship. I had the same quote as Senator Moore marked to use! I would also very much like to thank the members of the Senate community affairs committee and the secretariat, who, as the previous speakers have mentioned, worked under extremely difficult circumstances with some changes of personnel going on at crucial times. I would like to thank them all for bringing this report to fruition.


The report has 15 recommendations. It was deliberately designed to complement the current work being done by the Productivity Commission on the National Disability Insurance Scheme. We very deliberately chose to have the word 'lifelong' in our title—that is, Disability and ageing: lifelong planning for a better future. The National Disability Insurance Scheme report looks at the current situation and the need for funding—it talks about a system that is not even a system; so underfunded and inequitable and broken is the current disability support 'system' that it does not even function as a system. The Productivity Commission's report was not looking at the exact question that so many parents and other carers lie awake at night wondering about—that is, what happens when I can no longer care?


This is a relatively new question in developed countries because up until not all that many years ago people with intellectual disabilities and people with physical disabilities were not likely to outlive their parents. The average life expectancy for a person with Down syndrome in Australia in the 1950s was 27. People no longer live in institutions; they live in the community. They have better nutrition as a result and a better sense of their own worth. They also benefit from the huge advances in medical technologies that have been made, which assist people in every area of their lives, including the pain management that some people with physical disabilities need to undertake regularly. So the life expectancy for people with disabilities has expanded past the span of their parents' lives.


Not only do we need to think about the fact that their parents are going to die—it is always a difficult term to use, but their parents are going to die—but also in many cases parents are going to get to the stage where they can no longer provide the level of care needed. They are just not physically strong enough any longer to assist their adult child with their needs. We are supposed to have a system that would offer respite and offer specialist support to assist families in those situations. It does not happen. Or, if it does happen, it happens in an ad hoc way that cannot be relied on and never quite meets the needs of the people who are doing the huge amount of caring that needs to happen.


Lifelong planning is the focus of this report—not service planning. I would like to quote from a Queensland organisation called Pave the Way. It goes on to make the distinction that parents of people with disabilities are used to planning from the time their children are babies, but that is primarily service planning. It is about trying to get your child to the right speech therapist or to the right podiatrist or into the right education program or into the right work system. It is about planning for the near term, the short term; it is not planning for what happens when you are no longer there. As both Senators Moore and Siewert have mentioned, there are many barriers to planning. Some of the barriers to planning are simply that people do not have the time. It takes quite a long time to sit down and plan what a good life will look like and who will support it when the carer cannot do so any longer. It is not only the issue of individual families finding time to do it, it is also getting the space to do it. You need respite care, probably, to undertake the planning.


In many cases families with children with disabilities—and this came out again in this inquiry—are quite socially isolated. Because of their need to care, their friendship groups have diminished more and more. So knowing people that you can even ask to become involved in helping to support your son or daughter becomes problematic. And then of course there is the question: what is the point of planning if there is nothing at the end to underpin that plan?


One of our recommendations here—which supplements the one about one-stop shops—is to have a look at improving the accessibility of information on government websites and updating the FaHCSIA website so that its information is up to date, comprehensive and navigable. I know that many parents regard up-to-date lists of services as cruel jokes in themselves, because you can get this great list of services but, when you go to use those services, they are booked out for years to come, or you do not meet the criteria, or they are a pilot program and they do not know if their funding will be going into the next month, and so it goes on. There are so many areas where that is not available. 


I hope we have pointed out here that lifelong planning involves not just where you live or what you do or how much service support you have; it is also about who cares about the quality of that support and who cares about whether you are being abused or exploited in those situations. One of the examples that I found quite profound was from a group called Scope, a disability services provider in Victoria. They were talking about why people might have lost faith in the ability of the government system to provide accommodation. They said:


In the emergency housing area, if a crisis happens the person with the disability ends up going into respite care facility. Last year in the north-western metropolitan region 50 per cent of our respite places were blocked up—it sounds awful saying 'blocked up'—and were unable to be used because of crises that had happened in ageing carers' homes and the person with the disability had to take the place for a year or two years. That meant all the other people that wanted to use respite were not able to use it because 50 per cent of our places were taken up with crises. 


I think that might give you a sense of why parents would be less than confident that the system is going to support them or that the services that they might find on a website are actually going to be available when they need them. We referred again to the culture of crisis which the Productivity Commission report brought out so firmly.


We have, as I said, made 15 recommend­ations. Some of the more important ones were around the difficulty that people have navigating between disability employment, disability retirement and premature ageing in the area of disability. This needs to be considered, perhaps in the same way that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander ageing is looked at. Another recommendation is that the government establish with the states and territories a succession planning framework that organisations can use to develop—and assist families to develop—lifelong plans. Our 15th recommendation is that recurrent funding be made available in the next budget to assist community run organisations and individual families to pursue disability planning. I very much hope that this will be pursued and I very much recommend the report to the Senate.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2011-07-06,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (17:10):  I present the final report of the Community Affairs References Committee, Disability and ageing: lifelong planning for a better future, together with the Hansard record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.


Ordered that the report be printed.




Senator SIEWERT:
  I table the report and I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


It is with great pleasure that I table this report. This report contains some very important recommendations. It contains 15 recommendations and makes some points about some very important issues. The committee report has taken quite some time to develop and we had hearings in a number of locations around Australia, including Canberra, Melbourne, Sydney and Toowoomba. 


It is important to note that this report coincides with work being undertaken by the Productivity Commission into disability care and support. However, there is a significant difference between the work that we have done in this report and the draft report of the Productivity Commission. The focus of our committee report is on the lifelong and sustainable planning that assists carers of a person with a disability, helps them to plan for the future and particularly helps them answer the questions: 'What happens when I'm no longer here? What happens when I can no longer care for the person that I am caring for?'


As I said, the committee took evidence in a number of locations around Australia. We took evidence from people with disabilities, carers, carer organisations, peak bodies, service providers, and state and federal government departments. The evidence that the committee received suggested that the challenges facing the disability sector are substantial and that the existing system is not operating effectively. People with dis­abilities, carers, service providers and governments all agreed that there are many inadequacies in the choice, funding and support options available for people with a disability.


Given that Australia is anticipating significant population ageing, which will be accompanied by a reduction in the availability of informal care and support, the committee is deeply concerned by evidence suggesting that little sustainable planning is taking place. Many carers are so consumed by their day-to-day caring role that they have not even begun to start thinking about planning. Others find the planning a considerable challenge and need support to manage what is a complex and multifaceted task.


In the report, the committee focuses on why it is critical that whole-of-life planning takes place. We are particularly keen to point out the importance of whole-of-life planning and I will also point out here that this was picked up in a previous report that this committee did into the CSTDA as it was then known—the Commonwealth State Territory Disability Agreement. When this committee did that inquiry we picked up and highlighted the need for whole-of-life planning and we have looked at it in more detail in this report. The report considers some of the major practical barriers to planning including access to information, accommodation support, availability of respite, appropriateness of assessment tools, and the difficulty of navigating the disability and aged care interface. In spite of the fact that the government provides limited planning support to people with disabilities and their carers, the committee heard many inspiring stories, frequently told by parent carers, documenting the work taking place in the community. Across Australia there are pockets of people doing the most extraordinary work, in the most part voluntarily, because they see the need.


The committee heard of disability advocacy groups who have established what they call 'supported living funds', 'circles of support' or 'circles of friends' to assist with the future care of their adult children with disability; of parents in Sydney who are setting up an 'intentional community'; of a group in Gunnedah who established a rehabilitation day program for mental health consumers; of a group of very active parents in Toowoomba who organised a letter campaign, successfully advocating for funding to establish a house for shared accommodation, the Anden—hearing that story was simply inspiring; of an individual in Hervey Bay who organised the council to provide accommodation where she can support mental health consumers in living independently; and of the important work in my home state of Western Australia by Perth Home Care Services and by Planned Individual Networks, commonly known as PIN, who have established microboards and networks of support to ensure that people receive lifelong planning support.


While it should be acknowledged that some of these initiatives have received some government funding, many are established, supported and funded by parent carers and are taking place independently of govern­ment. Many of the grassroots level, non-government initiatives identified in our report emerged in response to the lack of government support or the cumulative frustration of dealing, over many years, with complex and confusing government bureau­cracies. Others emerged in response to service support which is often piecemeal, or where there was an absence of ongoing case management. Above all, these initiatives, frequently parent run, emerged in response to the frustration of dealing with bureaucracies that are simply not responsive enough, innovative enough or flexible enough to meet people's complex needs. Over and over again the committee heard that services are just not meeting the needs of people with disabilities or their carers.


In acknowledgment of these innovative planning schemes, the committee makes two significant recommendations. Firstly, it recommends that the government look to increase its support of these community based organisations that provide planning services. We believe this is essential. Secondly, it recommends that the govern­ment establish a national framework to give clear direction on how these organisations can ensure transparency and develop adequate governance arrangements. The committee envisages these guidelines also represent the beginning of an integrated and coordinated national approach to planning. It is really important that these innovative community organisations are given flexible support to provide their planning initiatives, but it is also essential, because of the very nature of the work that they do, that they meet the transparency and accountability requirements that we would expect, because these initiatives will be looking after the long-term needs of those living with a disability.


In addition to these recommendations, I would like to point out a couple of others. Of course, we believe all 15 are important, and I am sure my colleagues in the committee will highlight some more. We believe we have to solve the issue of portability of funding and services for people transitioning from the disability to the aged-care sector. We have to improve issues around portability of aides and support across state and territory boundaries. It just has to be resolved. It is not beyond the wit of this country to do this. We also need to look at issues around retirement from Australian disability enterprises. That is a key issue. There are many other important recommendations. Very importantly, the government needs to acknowledge the need for lifelong planning and to support this lifelong planning by investing in community based initiatives that make this happen.


Before finishing I would like to say thank you to, obviously, my colleagues on the committee. It is always a pleasure to work on the community affairs committees, whether it is the legislative or the references committee. I believe we work well together and do some very important work. I would like to acknowledge and say thank you for all the support and camaraderie we share. I would also very strongly like to say thank you to the secretariat, who have really moved mountains to get these reports done. They have had a tremendous workload over the last couple of months and continue to produce first-class work. Thank you very much to the secretariat. Very importantly, I want to say thank you for the hours of work that the community organisations, parents and carers put into our committee inquiry. These are people who are working day to day caring for people they love, and they took time out of their busy schedules to give us evidence, to write the submissions, and to come to our hearings and present evidence. These people sometimes struggle to get respite care on an ongoing basis or when they need it. They are the people that are doing it tough. We know that they need help and that there needs to be improvement in the services they receive. I thank them very much for the time and effort they put into ensuring that we got the evidence we needed to make the recommendations we have made.

"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2011-07-06,"



Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (17:20):  In 2004, pretty soon after I came to this place, I was very honoured to be engaged in a Senate select committee that was looking at the issues of poverty in our community. Throughout that process there were some extraordinarily confronting experiences, and people gave of their hearts, minds and lives—which is a common experience in our committee.


I will always remember evidence that was taken in the city of Ballarat, a beautiful city. A lady came to the front and talked to us. She expressed the fact that she was very nervous. She did not tell me her exact age, but she told me she was in her 80s. I remember my friend Steve Hutchins was sitting beside me. She looked at me and said, 'I am so tired, but I'm too afraid to die,' which was a fairly confronting statement. I always say people should go back and have a look at our committee reports and evidence because they are a snapshot of our Australian community. She went on to describe the fact that she and her husband of many years—her husband had recently died—had a son in his 50s who had Down syndrome. She was too afraid to die because she did not know what was going to happen to her boy.


That was in 2004, yet the Senate Community Affairs References Committee heard those same stories as we listened to evidence. We can do better. We are at quite an exciting time, because at the same time as this committee was looking at the lifelong planning needs of people with disabilities and their families and handed down its report—we took a long time to work out a title for it, and we came up with something catchy: Disability and ageing: lifelong planning for a better future—we had the opportunity to look at the draft reports arising from the referrals that the government has made to the Productivity Commission on two key areas—there was a referral on the general area of ageing and a referral on the general area of disabilities in our community. The draft reports on these areas have been given to the government and government responses are due to come back into wider parliamentary and community discussion in the next few months. We hope that the work of the community affairs committee can add to the work of the Productivity Commission so that we can ensure that no longer will there be families in our community that are so tired, so lost and so afraid of the system that they are fearful of what will happen to their children.


I acknowledge the work of Senator Sue Boyce. Sue had brought a recommendation for an inquiry to our committee, and she was absolutely determined that we were going to act on it. That determination has been rewarded, because where we could we looked to build on work that had previously been done. As Senator Siewert said, a few years ago this committee looked at Commonwealth-state disability agreements and came up with a range of recommend­ations, some of which were part of the National Disability Agreement that the government brought in on 1 January 2009. We can celebrate the fact that there is now a national disability agreement; but when we read through the core elements of that agreement, we say that the states, the territories and the Commonwealth must work together to ensure that there is a better system for people with disabilities in our community.


The agreement goes through several topics. It talks about 'improved access to disability care, including consideration of systems that provide a single point of access.' How many times did we hear during the committee process about the need for a single point of access so that people would be able with confidence and without fear to contact one area from which they will be able to obtain information, support and guidance? Unsurprisingly, considering that it is in the national disability agreement, we have a recommendation from our committee saying that we should have a single point of access, and that is good.


The National Disability Agreement talks about there being 'a nationally-consistent assessment process and a quality assurance system', and the committee recommended that too. The National Disability Agreement also mentions the need for 'a renewed focus on early intervention and planning to ensure that clients receive the most appropriate and timely support.' The committee has recommended that also. In fact, we get a fair hint by looking at the cover of the committee's report that the committee think that that is a good idea as well.


The committee has recommended improv­ing the capacity of service providers to better develop and train care workers. That is a necessary ongoing measure, Madam Acting Deputy President Pratt, as you know. In any system that aims to provide care, we need to have trained, effective, caring, responsible workers so that that element of trust which is so intrinsically necessary to any government service delivery is put forward.


As Senator Siewert said with a degree of frustration, there is also the issue around consistent access to disability aids and equipment. It is ongoing, consistent and frustrating problem, and it is blindingly obvious that people who have disabilities in 2011 should have access to appropriate aids and equipment. It should not matter at what stage of the identification of their disability is at or whether they are covered by a state or a federal arrangement, they should have the best possible equipment and support so that they can have the most rewarding life possible.


Of all things in the National Disability Agreement, these are my personal favourites: the National Disability Agreement signed in 2009 is 'a commitment by all levels of government to work together to better measure the level of unmet demand for disability services' which promises 'continued reform of roles and responsibility in relation to community mental health disability services and aged care.' For me, one of the most revealing things about the committee process was that it showed that we have good policy. But we could have better policy, and through the introduction of the measures in the reports from the Productivity Commission on ageing and disabilities we can work to have the best possible policy for our community. We found consistently in the evidence we took, the submissions we received and in the general discussions that happened—at least after the hearings that I attended: people wanted to share with us; they wanted to talk with us—that people wanted to be involved. So the frustrating thing is that we have good policy but it is not being implemented. The core message for me is that we need to move to ensure that implementation is effectively monitored.


I am not saying that there are not good results—Senator Siewert referred to that, and our committee report mentions where there have been amazing successes and rewards. To be quite parochial, I mention here the Toowoomba Intellectual Disability Support Association—TIDSA—and Tony Lanigan, who is the chair of that organisation. He has been working with me and many people in this place for many years, talking from a parent's perspective about how a group of parents can get together and develop plans around the needs of their children and then consistently harry state and federal governments to ensure that they get effective funding. TIDSA has received some funding from the state government, and that organisation is a genuine success story. We need to have that success story replicated across all the communities in our country. The house that TIDSA has formed was described by some of the elderly people who came to the committee's hearing in Toowoomba as a life saver for them and their families, because they have a sense of confidence that their children will have a secure housing future and people to care for them. That is the kind of model that this report is hoping will be identified, imple­mented and rewarded through government policy.


The committee talked about access to the system, and consistently through the committee process we heard about the complexity of the system. That is true—the system is complex—but if we act on the National Disability Agreement, which talks about 'a commitment by all levels of government to work together to better measure the level of unmet demand' and if we look at how the reforms can operate, the system can become less complex.

The Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011 amends the Telecommunications Act 1997 to support the government’s policy that fibre-to-the-premises infrastructure should be installed in new developments.


When the government announced the NBN, it indicated it would also progress legislative changes to have fibre-to-the premises infra­structure installed in new developments. The government considers it does not make sense to roll out a fibre network to up to 93 per cent of premises without preparing for the rollout of fibre in new developments.


The government has undertaken an extensive consultation process in developing this legis­lation, including releasing discussion papers and draft legislation and forming a broadly based stakeholder reference group. 


In drafting this Bill, the government has also considered the recommendations of the Senate Environment and Communications Committee report into the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2010.


The government welcomed the release of the report of the Joint Committee on the NBN on the Bill on 4 July 2011, in particular its recommend­ation that the Bill be passed by the Parliament. 


The government’s policy approach was announced on 20 June 2010 and implementation details were released on 9 December 2010. These details were recently refined and a revised policy statement was issued on 22 June 2011.


Under the government’s policy, from 1 January 2011, NBN Co is the fibre provider of last resort in new developments within its fibre footprint. As a result, developers are free to use any telecommunications providers to service their development, but NBN Co will provide fibre where developers do not wish to use another provider. Developers are required to meet the cost of trenching and passive infrastructure. The provision of passive infrastructure by developers recognises the considerable investment NBN Co will make in providing fibre cabling and associated equipment.


Initially NBN Co is responsible for developments of 100 or more premises. Telstra has a transitional role as provider of last resort in developments of up to 100 premises, pending the provision of fibre by NBN Co or another party.


The Bill will add a new Part 20A to the Telecommunications Act to support the rollout of fibre generally and to support NBN Co in its role as fibre provider of last resort. Proposed Part 20A is intended to apply to all types of new developments, including broadacre estates, urban infill and urban renewal projects. The rules will generally apply to new developments in NBN Co’s long-term fibre footprint. 


There are four key measures in proposed Part 20A.


First, the Bill enables the minister to specify new developments or classes of new developments in which fixed lines that are installed must be optical fibre lines. While NBN Co’s role as the fibre infrastructure provider of last resort means fibre will be provided in new developments, this provides a reserve mechanism to ensure, if necessary, that new lines in future are fibre.


Second, the Bill provides that when fixed-line facilities are being installed in a development, these facilities must be fibre-ready. This rule will apply to the person installing the facilities, and if that person is a developer, whether or not the developer is a constitutional corporation.


A fixed-line facility is an item of passive infrastructure such as underground ducting or ‘pit and pipe’ used in the deployment of fixed telecommunications lines to a premises. A ‘fibre-ready facility’ is a fixed-line facility that is designed, manufactured and installed so that it allows the ready deployment of optical fibre cabling, noting such cabling has special deployment requirements.


Third, and most importantly, the Bill will have the effect of requiring constitutional corporations, particularly developers that are constitutional corporations, to install fibre-ready facilities on or in close proximity to their developments. Penalties will apply if a constitutional corporation sells or leases land or a building situated in a new development unless fibre-ready facilities have been installed. However, the sale or lease transaction will still be valid. The focus of this requirement on constitutional corporations reflects the application of the Australian government’s constitutional powers over corporations.


These fibre-ready requirements will not apply in new developments where other urban utilities such as electricity, water and sewerage, are not being installed. The Bill also provides for NBN Co to provide a written statement advising that it will not be deploying fibre in an area, that is, the area is outside the long-term fibre footprint of the NBN. The effect of such a statement is that it will relieve a person such as a developer of the obligation to install fibre-ready facilities in that area.


To provide flexibility, the Bill also provides for the minister to exempt specified projects, individual lots or units, or conduct from requirements under the Bill.


The Bill also exempts from these requirements developments where, before the Bill comes into effect, contracts have been signed or work has commenced on the installation of fixed-line facilities or lines, or where civil works generally have been contracted or commenced.


Fourth, proposed Part 20A provides for a regime for carriers to secure access to fixed-line facilities such as pit and pipe that are owned by non-carriers, to ensure fibre can be rolled out using these facilities. The regime is based on that applying to carrier facilities in Part 5, Schedule 1 of the Telecommunications Act. Access would be on terms that are commercially negotiated or, failing agreement, determined by an agreed arbitrator, or failing agreement on an arbitrator, by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.


The Bill provides for a number of new definitions to support the operation of Part 20A of the Telecommunications Act.


Part 20A does not intend to exclude or limit the operation of state and territory laws that are capable of operating concurrently with the proposed new Part 20A. As such, the legislation can be complemented by changes to state, territory and local planning arrangements, which would further support the deployment of fibre-ready facilities or fibre.


The Bill applies the civil penalties in the Telecommunications Act to breaches of obligations under the new Part 20A.


In addition to inserting the new Part 20A, the Bill also amends Part 21 of the Tele­communications Act, which relates to technical regulation. The amendments enable the Australian Communications and Media Authority to make technical standards for customer premises equipment and cabling for use with the NBN and other superfast telecommunications networks. The ACMA will be able to exercise these powers on its own initiative or if directed by the minister. The amendments also enable the minister to give the ACMA directions in relation to cabling provider rules.


In effect, the proposed amendments will commence at the start of the day after the day the Bill receives Royal Assent. While the government first flagged its intention to facilitate the deployment of optical fibre infrastructure in new developments in April 2009, this approach has given stakeholders further advance notice and removes concerns about potential retrospective requirements.


It has been the government’s expectation since the 20 June 2010 announcement, however, that developers will have recognised the benefits of installing fibre-ready passive infrastructure to facilitate the rollout of fibre in their developments and will have proceeded on this basis.


The Bill will help residents and businesses in new developments access the most up-to-date telecommunications services. It is a key complement to the government’s historic National Broadband Network initiative. It will play an important role in helping us prepare Australian homes, workplaces, schools and other premises for the high-speed online digital world of today and the future.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  In accordance with standing order 111, further consideration of this bill is now adjourned to the first day of the next period of sittings, commencing on 16 August 2011.

Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (18:51):  I would like to take this opportunity as the only member of the defence frontbench team in the Senate to say a few words about the changes to the leadership of the Australian Defence Force which the Minister for Defence announced on 1 June and also about some matters particular to my portfolio responsibilities.


I want to begin by adding my tribute to Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, Lieutenant General Ken Gillespie and Vice Admiral Russ Crane, who have retired after long and distinguished careers in the Australian defence forces. Australia has been extraordinarily lucky, at a time when our defence forces have been facing enormous challenges, to have had men of such calibre at the helm. In the 10 months since I assumed my current responsibilities, I have found them all to be unfailingly helpful, professional and dedicated officers and I take this opportunity to thank them for their service to Australia and to wish them well in their future careers.


I also want to add my congratulations to the new leadership team: General David Hurley as CDF, Air Marshal Mark Binskin as Vice Chief of the Defence Forces, Lieutenant General David Morrison as Chief of the Army, Vice Admiral Ray Griggs as Chief of Navy and Air Marshal Geoff Brown as Chief of Air Force. They take office at a time of continuing challenges for our defences forces, most particularly a severe test of our national resolve in maintaining our commitment to the task at hand in Afghanistan.


From what I know of the new ADF leadership team I am confident that they have the skills, courage and character to face these challenges. I particularly want to thank Geoff Brown for his assistance in helping me to come to grips with the complex issues of aircraft noise around RAAF bases and I look forward to continuing to work with him on these issues.


This is also a time of transition in one of my own portfolio areas, Defence honours and awards. The founding Chair of the Defence Honours and Awards Appeals Tribunal, Emeritus Professor Dennis Pearce AO, finishes his three-year term this month. Professor Pearce and his staff, particularly executive officer Mary Birmingham, have been extremely helpful to me and my office as we have mastered this extremely complex and often emotionally charged area of policy. This is an area in which veterans, ex-service organisations, next of kin and historians, quite rightly, have strong views and strong feelings. Professor Pearce has presided over a number of inquiries into unresolved issues relating to honours and awards, always with fairness, firmness and patience. I thank him for his service. We are currently well advanced in the process of choosing a successor, and I look forward to making this announcement soon.


One of the most contentious inquiries which the tribunal has carried out under Professor Pearce's chairmanship has been into the level of recognition given to the victims of the Battle of Long Tan, fought in South Vietnam in August 1966, a battle in which 18 Australians died. Whatever we may think of the wisdom of Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War there is no disputing the courage and skill of the men of Delta Company 6RAR, who were heavily outnumbered but achieved a decisive victory on the battlefield. They did so under the leadership of Major Harry Smith, a very brave officer, who was awarded the Military Cross for his actions.


Since the Vietnam War Harry Smith has carried out a long campaign for greater recognition for the veterans of Long Tan, and he was absolutely right to do so. Largely as a result of his efforts, there have been two inquiries into this issue, the most recent conducted by Professor Pearce. As a result of these inquiries, Harry Smith's award was up­graded to the Star of Gallantry and two other Delta Company veterans, Geoff Kendall and David Sabben, were awarded the Medal of Gallantry. A RAAF helicopter pilot, Cliff Dohle, was awarded a post­humous Disting­uished Service Medal, the contemporary equivalent award to the Distinguished Flying Cross. A ceremony for the presentation of these decorations by Her Excellency the Governor-General was held at Government House on Long Tan Day in 2010.


The tribunal also recommended that a unit citation for gallantry, a UCG, be awarded to Delta Company 6RAR. That award was not presented last year because at that time 6RAR, as it is presently constituted, was on deployment in Afghanistan. It will be presented by Her Excellency the Governor-General at Gallipoli Barracks in Brisbane on Long Tan Day—that is, 18 August—this year. I intend being at that ceremony and I look forward to meeting Harry Smith and the other veterans of Delta Company as well as the current members of 6RAR, who have served with the same gallantry as their forebears.


There has been some controversy about the presentation of these awards and, while I do not wish to add to it, it is necessary to set the record straight. I want to make it clear that the decision about the time and place at which the UCG is to be presented to Delta Company 6RAR was not taken by either politicians or public servants, as some have alleged. It was a decision taken by the Chief of Army, and rightly so. Let me make it clear, the government fully supports his decision. That decision was not motivated by financial considerations. It was made for operational reasons, quite simply, because 6RAR was serving in Afghanistan last year and because the correct place to present a UCG is at the unit's home base which, in this case, is Gallipoli Barracks.


I fully understand that some veterans are unhappy that the tribunal did not accept submissions that more Long Tan veterans should be honoured. I know that some feel the UCG should have been presented at Government House last year or should be presented there this year. I know some feel that the Army should have paid for all Delta Company veterans to attend last year's ceremony. On the first point, we have had two independent inquiries and we should accept the decisions they have made. On the second point, I do not accept that presenting the unit citation at Gallipoli Barracks is any less prestigious than presenting it in Canberra. I might indeed reflect that the fact it will be presented with 6RAR as it presently exists will significantly add to the honour of the occasion. The UCG takes the form of a streamer, which will be attached to the colours of 6RAR and the correct place to do that is at Gallipoli Barracks.


On the third point, the Department of Veterans Affairs will be meeting the costs for veterans to attend this year's ceremonies because this is an honour for Delta Company as a unit.


Whatever strong feelings individuals may have about these issues, I hope they will accept that, these decisions having been made, it is now time to join in honouring all of those who took part in the Battle of Long Tan and particularly those 18 young Australians who gave their lives in the service of their country. I look forward to the opportunity of joining both current and former members of 6RAR in honouring all Long Tan veterans on 18 August.
