Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (09:01):  Let me end on a personal note. I was born in 1972. When my mother's pregnancy reached the nine-month mark she pinned an 'It's time' badge onto the part of her shirt that covered her belly. Gough's vision and optimism helped shape my political life.


Canberrans, too, have always treasured Gough. He ensured that ACT residents got Senate representation. Given that he spent 10 years living in Canberra full time as a child at Telopea High and Canberra Grammar, and then as a resident of the Lodge, plus two more decades travelling here as a member of parliament, Canberrans are rightly proud to claim Gough as one of our own. 


On the crypt of the great English architect, Christopher Wren, is engraved 'si monumentum requiris, circumspice'—if you seek his monument, look around you. It would be a fitting epitaph for Edward Gough Whitlam.

Ms LEY
 (Farrer—Assistant Minister for Education) (09:02):  Edward Gough Whitlam left on extraordinary legacy which has been captured by numerous speakers. This is my personal reflection. I was a year 8 student at Campbell High School in the ACT at the time of the dismissal. My family was delighted. My mathematics teacher was anything but. My memory is of him at the front of the class glaring around, face brick red, sleeves rolled up, declaring: 'There will be no maths today. Hands up anyone who, if they could vote, would vote Liberal at this election?' Needless to say, I did not put up my hand. 


Gough's social reforms have quite rightly been celebrated. Helping to end the White Australia policy and making Indigenous and new Australians feel welcome and included are to me standouts. 


The social mobility that he initiated was the beginning of the end of the class system we had inherited from Britain. Above all, Gough demonstrated with wife Margaret what a partnership based on love, equality and respect look like in a modern world. 


Gough left a one-of-a-kind legacy in my electorate of Farrer. Albury-Wodonga was selected as the primary focus of the federal Whitlam government's scheme to arrest the uncontrolled growth of Australia's large coastal city, Sydney and Melbourne in particular, by encouraging decentralisation. Grand plans were made to turn Albury-Wodonga into a major inland city. 


As Professor Bruce Pennay from our local Charles Sturt University notes that Whitlam from opposition and then in government was 'personally responsible for imagining the rapid and joint development of Albury-Wodonga' as a collective—one city straddling the New South Wales-Victorian border. 


Drop into our border towns today and many people you meet will say the growth centre concept was both bold and imaginative. Some will say it was too rushed and less than well executed. It is somewhat ironic that the federal body known for most of its existence as the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation, which was set up to carry Gough's eventually unrealised visions from 1972, will come to a close at the end of this financial year. Regardless, Whitlam remained an enthusiast, and would visit from time to time to hail any new endeavour to promote the two cities as one and of course to rebuke those who would dare set them apart. The tax office in Albury, with over 600 staff, has provided employment and a career for many local people. In my case it was my first job after part-time study and the birth of my children, and it set me on a professional pathway that was largely instrumental in my coming to this place.


As many would be aware, the parliament owns Clifton Pugh's famous portrait of our 21st Prime Minister. The story of the picture reflects the intersection of art and this democracy of ours in several ways. When he won the Archibald Prize with his portrait of Sir John McEwen in 1971 Clif did not know Gough Whitlam, but he casually announced to the press that he would win the next year with whoever the Prime Minister was going to be. Whitlam, just as informally, sent a telegram agreeing to sit. They were relaxed times back then. My cousin-in-law, Judith Pugh, was Clif's wife and she explains that, as part of her role to keep the attention of Clif's sitters, she outlined to Gough the plan for the arts that had been developed by a number of creative and performing artists and persuaded him to be minister for the arts. What the artists at the time acknowledged but has become rather overshadowed is that, from the second Menzies government, Sir Robert and the subsequent coalition prime ministers developed a program of travelling exhibitions that engaged us with Asia, developed a remarkable collection of art and planned a national gallery in which the collection could be displayed. Gough Whitlam signed off on that gallery and of course it is now a place to see Australian and international art—a place of scholarship, a place of education and a tourist destination. Clifton Pugh's Archibald Prize-winning painting was bought by the Historic Memorials Committee, and it is fitting that it should be the most visited picture in this building, no doubt much as Whitlam would be happy to be remembered—thoroughly larger than life and just as important now that he has gone.

Ms BUTLER
 (Griffith) (09:07):  Gough Whitlam changed Labor and he changed this country. He and his cabinet brought modern Australia into being. They created our modern social democracy. Last week, after we had heard the news, the Labor family walked to Old Parliament House to pay tribute to Gough together. As we walked up the steps, the member for Moreton asked me, 'How do you feel—a girl like you, a working-class girl from Cairns—to be here at such an occasion?' I said to him, 'Well, that's the point. That's what Gough did for us' and he agreed, because we both know that Gough wanted to create opportunities for everyone and he wanted to work for a more equal society. Like countless others, I am a direct beneficiary of that.


Earlier this year I gave a speech for Gough's 98th birthday. In that speech I thanked Gough for the opportunities I had had to get a higher education, and I thanked him for a lot of other things as well. I am pleased to say that he heard about the speech and that he knew of my gratitude. I received a message: 'You have made an old man very happy.' I must have been one of so many people who thanked him for everything he had done over the course of his life.


Remembering Gough reminds us all that politics matters and that public life matters. It reminds us that we must be here in this place with a sense of purpose, determined to improve the wellbeing of our countrymen and women. We all share in this great responsibility to build on his legacy. I do not claim to know Gough; I have only met him a couple of times. I was there at our national Labor conference when he and his beloved wife, Margaret, received their national life memberships of the Australian Labor Party. They were the first two people to receive those memberships from the party's national conference. But even though I did not know him it is impossible not to be grateful to him for what he did to change our nation. As I said, he also changed the Labor Party. That is important, because this nation and its people depend on Labor to be the party of great reform. The Liberals and Nationals can claim to have instigated very few of the nation's great reforms since the 1970s but, under Gough's leadership and since, our movement has won, and defended, for all Australians so many reforms. 


I do not need to repeat the list of them and there are too many anyway, but I want to mention, as the member for Lingiari did much more extensively last week, Gough's work to improve the rights of Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders.


As he said in 1972: 


We will legislate to give Aborigines land rights—not just because their case is beyond argument, but because all of us as Australians are diminished while the Aborigines are denied their rightful place in this nation. 


It is because of Labor's reformist tradition that Australia needs Labor. There is no other party able to govern that will do what is needed to build our nation at the same time and make it a fairer place for everyone. 


Gough understood the imperative to make Labor a better party so that we could fulfil that obligation. As Senator Faulkner said in his speech on Gough's 92nd birthday: 


… he was determined to make much needed changes to get Labor out of opposition and into government. 


He pursued party reforms to make the party a viable alternative government, and policy reforms to make Labor's platform one that truly met the needs of modern Australia. 


In 1977, the year I was born, Gough came to Queensland and told our Labor-In-Politics Convention bluntly that we had to get our house in order. He said: 


Whenever things go badly, there is a natural tendency to look for far-fetched answers and blame the people instead of ourselves. I don't think we need to go beyond the obvious for an explanation of our troubles: the party has been run down and defeatist, our policies have been too-little explained and too-little understood. 


He went on to say: 


Let us not delude ourselves that dissatisfaction with Mr Bjelke-Petersen is enough to put Labor back, any more than dissatisfaction with the Fraser government will put us back in the national parliament. We must put our own house in order first. A reformed and invigorated party in Queensland must be the first step to a Labor government in Brisbane and a new Labor government in Canberra. 


In 2014, we can take a great deal of inspiration from Gough's policy achievements and we can also take a great deal of instruction from the way he worked to make Labor electable again. We owe it to him to be Labor, at Labor's, best every day. 


I finish by expressing my sincere condolences to Katherine, Nicholas, Tony, Stephen, their partners and their families.

"O'Dwyer, Kelly, MP",LP,2014-10-28,"



Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins) (09:11):  There are but a few faces that represent an era. Yet we can certainly say that Gough Whitlam's name, voice and face bring to mind a political epoch. His features themselves can conjure memories of turbulent times—times of great aspiration and times of great controversy. He was and remains synonymous with dramatic national transformation. 


Gough Whitlam was nothing if not a passionate, driven and energetic man. He implemented reforms in almost every field of government endeavour ranging from foreign policy to education. The frenetic pace at which he led this change left many gasping for breath. But his convictions led him to leave no stone unturned. Indeed, some stones he hurled metaphorically into the next paddock. Whether or not one agrees with his policies, his vision and sheer grit are characteristics worthy of our deepest respect. 


I believe all sides of politics will concur, regardless of our own political inclinations, that last Tuesday we lost a great Australian. Whitlam did leave many valuable legacies, driven by passion, ideals and character. He had a strong relationship with his wife of almost 70 years who herself was an inspiration to the women of her time and an advocate for women's rights. It was from the publicly witnessed strength of such a strong relationship that he could make on marital laws so much more humane through the passing of the first no-fault divorce procedure in 1975. 


The Whitlam government fought for equal pay for women and the establishment of an inquiry to lay the basis for lands right for Indigenous Australians. He also brought in the first cuts to tariffs led by the inspirational modest member Bert Kelly. So there are certainly policies to celebrate. 


Whitlam also made a significant contribution to Australia's identity. He had a confidence in Australia and brought with it the idea that Australia has the power to determine its own ideals and that, even as a small country, we can still have big ideas and aspirations. Indeed, with his exciting political dash, he had the capacity to make Australians feel part of something much bigger. 


However, as Greg Sheridan pointed out in The Australian, there are misperceptions surrounding Gough Whitlam's prime ministership. Greg cautions that we do not turn Whitlam into some form of political god, because many of his actions were a continuation of sensible trends. For instance, he is often credited with being responsible for the removal of Australian troops from Vietnam; yet most of the troops had already been repatriated by the previous coalition government. 


Many have spoken of Gough's brilliant foreign policy legacy, in particular his engagement with China. He did recognise the new government of China after the revolution, and the Chinese government itself has, on his passing, recognised him as the father of Chinese-Australian relations. Yet he was not without flaws in consideration of other peoples and nations. For example, he recognised the sovereignty of the Soviet Union over the Baltic states without taking into account their right to self-determination. Furthermore, he was decidedly unwelcoming to Vietnamese immigrants, even when they had been very helpful to Australians in Vietnam. Nevertheless, Whitlam was a great Australian. 


His legacy is enormous but he has also left us with lessons which we must not forget. All can agree that Whitlam was responsible for one of the most rapid periods of legislative change in Australian history. However, his approach, that government is the solution to every problem, is not one that fits well with many Australians. Big government often diminishes its citizens—their choices and their opportunities. Whilst Prime Minister Whitlam was enacting rapid social change, it is my view that the economy was neglected and indeed mismanaged. Government spending increased by 40 per cent, tax rates soared and in one year unemployment doubled. In one short year, between 1974 and 1975, the Whitlam government managed to completely lose control of the budget. According to the economics editor of The AFR, Alan Mitchell, it took '20 years and four prime ministers to get it back under control'.


This was his ultimate legacy to the Labor Party and the legacy that, sadly, has been repeated by Labor prime ministers since his prime ministership—for then, as now, we cannot spend beyond our means, even when implementing a dramatic reform agenda. There seemed to be a concept at the heart of his government that inflation, which reached double digits, and prudent budget administration could be handled after other reforms had been achieved. We have since learnt the important lesson that vision must come hand in hand with economic management. If we do not plan to pay for our changes, the ultimate payment is extracted from our children and their children in an uncontrolled and unplanned manner. Real leadership involves responsible choices. A great leader has a vision and an economic plan for the nation. Without these two essential ingredients a national leader can do more harm than good.


It is also true that Whitlam's management of his government was chaotic. Unable to control his own ministers, the government's inability to finance its big spending program revealed itself to the public in the Khemlani loans affair, which involved a $4 billion loan from the Middle East from undisclosed sources, meaning a bypassing of the Loan Council. The Minister for Minerals and Energy, Connor, was sacked along with the Treasurer over this loans scandal. Perhaps these economic problems and scandals contributed to the souring of his relationship with the Australian public, as evidenced by Whitlam's landslide loss at the election in 1975.


In remembering Whitlam, we remember a period of legislative change the like of which Australia has never seen before, economic problems of the Whitlam government's own making but also an increase in tolerance. Whitlam will be remembered as significantly shaping the Australian that we love today. He used the power that he had as an agent of change and reminded us all of our national identity and how proud we should be to call ourselves Australian. He was a man of great courage and vigour, so regardless of whether or not we agree with his policies it is no sin to feel saddened by his passing and blessed to have lived in the same epoch as such a man.

Ms COLLINS
 (Franklin) (09:18):  It is with some sadness that I rise to speak on the condolence motion to farewell the Hon. Edward Gough Whitlam AC, QC, the 21st Prime Minister of Australia. It is time for him to be with his beloved Margaret and it is time for us to say goodbye to a great Labor leader. But where to start when one talks about the most influential leader that this country has ever had? As so many have said, he was truly a giant of a man. He had a great intellect and he had a great vision, but he was also kind, funny and warm, and he had a loving family. 


Gough dared to dream. He dared us to dream, to dream of what a future Australia should look like, and then he told us that we could make it so. Gough entered this parliament in 1952. He chose to do this because he believed politics is an honourable profession. He could have stayed with the law. He had served his country in the Air Force. He had so many options, but he wanted to serve his country as a member of parliament. I am sure, knowing Gough, that he would have been confident early on that one day he was going to be Prime Minister. He was Prime Minister for such a short time but it was a very busy time, with Gough and Labor in a hurry to implement their ideas and their policies after so many years in opposition. The government that he led, that implemented his vision, made so many changes to policy in this country that forever changed the people of Australia, how we thought about ourselves and how others viewed us from outside.


After winning the 1972 election, it was of course a Tasmanian in Lance Barnard, the member for Bass, who formed the two-part cabinet with Gough that made so many sweeping changes. It is hard to decide which of the many reforms had the biggest, most enduring impact. His changes to education meant so many Australians had an opportunity to get a tertiary education that would not have happened without his reforms. So many of us in this place have a story about the first ever family member who did go or is going to university because of Gough. His changes to the social security system gave poor people the dignity of being accepted and treated as equals in this country. So many children of those affected by these changes have had opportunities that they would not otherwise have had because of Gough. There were his changes to our health system, with Medibank, now Medicare, providing universal health care to so many and the start of the great Medicare. So many lives were enhanced, extended and saved because of what Gough did.


From health to education, from social security to antidiscrimination, to his wonderful land hand-back to Aboriginal Australians, to his passion for the arts, to his visit to China, to his commitment to equal pay and what he did for women's rights, to his starting to reduce tariffs, Gough really did modernise and change the face of this country. He reformed the Labor Party itself. He told us we had to believe we could win government, that we needed to win government. Indeed, he told the ALP's conference in Victoria in 1968 that 'only the impotent are pure' and that we need to change our platform and we needed to change our party.


He also changed the country's voting systems. To quote from Gough's speech from 2001 at the Federation anniversary dinner in Melbourne, celebrating the centenary of the federal ALP's caucus, Gough said:


Tonight we celebrate more than a century's commitment to change and reform through Parliament. My most constant objective has been to make Australian Parliaments more representative of all voters. The nadir of the Party's electoral fortunes was reached in March 1968, when the Dunstan Government was defeated despite winning 52% of the votes.


Only one of Australia's 13 Houses of Parliament was left with a Labor majority, the Tasmanian House of Assembly. Tasmania alone had equal enrolments in all electoral divisions in the State and Federal lower houses. In the winter of our discontent, Lance Barnard and I, the Leader and Deputy Leader in the Senate, Lionel Murphy and Sam Cohen, Premier Eric Reece and the Leaders of the five State Oppositions met in Hobart. We resolved to achieve equal franchise—one vote-one value—in the House of Representatives and in all the State Houses of Parliament.


At the joint sitting of both Federal Houses in August 1974, the House of Representatives was made the first legislative body in Australia to be elected on the principles of one vote, one value and regular redistribution.


Gough was truly a democrat. He believed in the parliament. He believed in people and their ideas.


I had the great privilege of meeting Gough on several occasions, particularly when he came to Tasmania, my home state, and, importantly, when he and Margaret were presented with their life membership at the ALP national conference in Sydney—the first people to receive a national ALP life membership.


In closing, my sympathies go to Gough's children, his family and his friends. On behalf of my electorate of Franklin and on behalf of the people of Tasmania I say, simply: 'Thank you, Gough.'

"Coleman, David, MP",LP,2014-10-28,"



Mr COLEMAN
 (Banks) (09:24):  I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to this condolence motion for the Honourable Gough Whitlam AC, QC. Like most Australians, I did not know Mr Whitlam. I was not born when he became Prime Minister and I was just one year old when he left office. Like most Australians, there was much about Mr Whitlam I respected. I am fortunate to have the opportunity to express my views in this place.


It seems to me that much of the battle in public life is about having the courage to ask the big questions. You cannot move things forward unless you are willing to at least contemplate some radical ideas. Wisely, we generally shy away from radical ideas once we have contemplated them, but every once in a while it takes a leader to grasp tomorrow's conventional wisdom today. Mr Whitlam demonstrated that leadership ability in a few important ways. 


He established diplomatic relations with China. He was ahead of his time. He did it during the Cold War. If, politically, Richard Nixon could go to China, it was much more difficult for Mr Whitlam—but he did do that and it has been, clearly, to the benefit of our nation in the ensuing decades. He decolonised Papua New Guinea, recognising that the era of colonies was over and belonged to another time. He drafted the first Land Rights Act for Indigenous Australians, which put us on the path we have been on for some time since and that path towards acknowledging the legal fiction of terra nullius. Importantly, he cut tariffs by 25 per cent in 1973, a very aggressive idea at the time with little public support. It was certainly not supported by his union constituency or many others but was something that helped set us on that path of tariff reduction, which has been so important to our future prosperity.


None of us are any more than human and Mr Whitlam was just a man. He made at least his share of mistakes and pursued economic policies that the Australian people understandably rejected. But he was a man blessed with the intellectual depth to conceive of big ideas and he had the powers of persuasion to make them happen. He could never be accused of entering politics simply to occupy the crease. He had ideas. He pursued them with all vigour. We can ask nothing more of a public servant. I pass on my deepest condolences to Mr Whitlam's family at this difficult time.

"Ferguson, Laurie, MP",ALP,2014-10-28,"



Mr LAURIE FERGUSON
 (Werriwa) (09:27):  Due to my age and the longevity of my political involvement, I am indisputably the only person in this parliament who was at the 1969 and 1972 victory functions at Gough Whitlam's home. I want to correct an earlier contribution regarding that, because the second 1972 event certainly was at his home. He had previously received the results at the Sunnybank motel, room 7, and then walked to the function that night.


In 2010, after the strange, brief disappearance and then revival of the seat of Reid, and in a checkmate of political faction leaders and union honchos, I found myself the member for Werriwa. I soon found two very distinct aspects of that electorate. The first is a sense of difference, a belief that the Macarthur region was distinct. If you go to any fundraiser in that electorate they always promise people that all the money will stay in the region. That is a hangover from the rural nature of Campbelltown and its environs. 


I also found that not only Labor loyalists but also the general electorate had a belief that it was a great thing they lived in the electorate of Gough Whitlam. Again, in 2013, when the Liberal Party plastered the electorate with money, and pundits in both the Liberal Party and the Labor Party thought that I would lose the seat, I had newspaper commentary which constantly stressed that the iconic seat of Reid, the old seat of Gough Whitlam, would be lost to the Labor Party. So he is very much centrally involved in the history of that electorate.


I had the opportunity of observing another aspect of his political life. My father shared with him state and federal responsibilities for significant periods. They went through the obvious requirements of the electorate—attending school fetes, balls and dances and other events of the burgeoning Maltese, Italian and German communities. There were also functions at the nascent RSLs and bowling clubs. On many occasions he dropped by our house. He would take off his shoes and have a few drinks with my parents. My mother being raised in the Riverina was no mean cook, and on many occasions she commented on Gough's fondness for the tooth—a proclivity for cakes et cetera.


I want to stress that from the moment of the 1949 by-election—I have an advertisement of it here provided by Richard James Ford for a meeting at Liverpool Town Hall on 25 November—Gough Whitlam was a person who very much involved himself in the electorate, with the local education of the children and sporting and training events. He was a person who actually treated very seriously his civic responsibilities and his engagement with the local electorate. It is not only a matter of what he accomplished for this country but also the fact that he was very much a participant in local democracy within the electorate. It was, as I say, the reason that we now see such a fondness for him within that electorate. 


He is respected for many breathtaking innovations during that period, and it is an important point to bear in mind that those changes still affect us today. Both sides of politics have talked about the NDIS and, hopefully, we will now see action in regard to Australia's disabled. A person called Gough Whitlam was, 40 years ago, calling in the wilderness for a national compensation scheme. In the last few months, Australia has been very proud to make its opinions known on matters as diverse as ISIS and the shooting down of the plane in Ukraine and also to make its presence felt on the Security Council. This accomplishment is very much related to a person who, in contrast to many other prime ministers, knew that there were capital cities in this world beyond Washington, Wellington, Tokyo and London. He had an incredible knowledge of the world, its diversity, and a belief that rather than being the arse end of the earth this country through is pioneering accomplishments, through its remoteness and through its independent need to survive the Second World War et cetera did have something to present. The fact that we can now see ourselves on the Security Council, that we can have a role independent to some degree of the United States—at least a degree greater than it was previously—owes much to him. 


In regard to university education, a matter of controversy these days, I want to quote some figures to show how bad things are in the United States, which some people in this country would like us to emulate. Christopher Benfey in the New York Review of Books last week revealed that 100 United States schools, representing 0.3 per cent of the United States education system, were able to provide 22 per cent of the entrants to Princeton, Yale and Harvard. This is the kind of outcome that Gough Whitlam vigorously opposed. We know that he abolished university fees, introduced student income support, moved the federal sphere very strongly into tertiary education and changed many other aspects of the policy. 


Another issue on the agenda today that has some connection with him is Gonski. One of the issues back in his political career was the question of state aid for schools. I have a letter here from Brother Kelvin Canavan, who was a long-term activist on this issue. He talks about Whitlam at state and other rallies in 1969. He notes: 


His message was always the same. Australia must increase spending on education and both government and Catholic schools should be funded according to need. Gough had a very clear view that the Commonwealth must make ""a comprehensive and continuous financial commitment to schools, as it has to universities.""


A few years ago, I located a sound recording—of the Town Hall speeches. I sent a copy to Gough who phoned me the next day with his reminiscences of the campaign by Catholics for financial assistance their schools.


…   …   …




He took considerable pride in the role 
he 
played in ensuring that all students had access to well-funded schools. 



On a number of occasions, he came back to the 1969 rallies. He lamented the passing of public meetings that provided a stage for a gifted orator. ""Television is a poor substitute for the Town Hall,"" he said. 


He recognised another area where Whitlam's views are still relevant today. His belief that there needs to an emphasis on areas of need for those regions that are deprived so that people have access to university and an equal education in primary and secondary schools.


In my association with people, the most common reference to Whitlam is in connection with education. The number of people who say that they personally would not have gone to university, had the livelihood that they have, brought up their family in the way that they have or had the opportunity to broaden their knowledge without Whitlam's reforms in education is the most evident of those changes.


We also have—and many people have raised this—the recognition of China. It is interesting that in the last fortnight that Jimmy Carter—who only accomplished US recognition of China in 1978 and in the process was vigorously attacked by Barry Goldwater—was treated very badly in China. It was, as I say, six years after Australia that the United States normalised responsibilities. It was a breathtaking initiative by an independent country—a country asserting its place in the world.


Finally, there was the war in Indochina and the decision by Labor to stop this lottery and to give people the opportunity to avoid involvement in this conflict which had long been opposed far more vigorously even than by Gough by other elements in the Labor Party over the previous decade.


I salute Gough and Margaret's contribution to Australian politicly life; and to his family, I express my own, my electorate's and my family's condolences.

Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (09:37):  Gough Whitlam our 21st Prime Minister was born on 11 July 1916 and passed away of 21st October 2014 aged 98 years. The 98 years of his life, although our country has gone through many ups and downs, saw an unprecedented improvement in the prosperity and the welfare of the average Australian. We saw vast improvements across our living standards during that period. 


Here are a couple of examples: when Gough Whitlam was born, life expectancy for the average Australian was under 60 years. When Gough Whitlam died, it was approaching 85 years. Australians born today have been given the gift of a quarter of a century of life. 


We also saw during the time of Gough Whitlam's life substantial decreases in infant mortality. In fact, at the time of Whitlam's birth, there were around 100 deaths for every thousand live births. Today it is down to less than three for every thousand live births. It has come about through improvements in prenatal and post natal care; new medicines; mass vaccinations; and improved sanitation. 


We have also seen during Whitlam's life a massive decrease in deaths from infectious diseases. When Whitlam was born, there were around 143 deaths per every thousand people per year from infectious and parasitic diseases. Today it is down to just nine. 


We also saw substantial increases in real wages and increases in household wealth when we look at what we take for granted today like motor vehicles. In the 1920s, when a young Gough Whitlam would have been considering getting a car, there were only 21 motor vehicles in the country for every thousand people. Today it is over 560 for every thousand people. 


When we look at household appliances, communication and education, Australians today enjoy so much prosperity because we inherited the legacy of our previous generation.


The other thing we should be very thankful to our 21st Prime Minister for is his war service. We know that Gough Whitlam registered for the Royal Australian Air Force the very day the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. He was called up in June 1942 and he served as a navigator, spending much of his time stationed at Gove. He moved further north and undertook bombing raids on enemy supply camps in the islands of the Philippines. We Australians today who enjoy the peace and prosperity that we do should always be thankful to that generation of Australians who fought and served during the Second World War.


Gough Whitlam also had ties to the electorate that I represent, Hughes. In fact, Gough Whitlam tried to run for the Sutherland Shire Council but was defeated twice. He also ran for the state seat of Sutherland in 1950 but was again defeated. Many might say that the Sutherland Shire's loss was the nation's gain, although some of the Sutherland Shire might put it the opposite way. In 1952, he was finally elected in a by-election for the seat of Werriwa, which at that time encompassed much of the Sutherland Shire and much of the seat of Hughes that I represent today. In 1955, the electorate of Werriwa, then the most populous in the nation, was split in two, with the older part of Hughes being created—the electorate that I proudly represent here in parliament today.


It took Gough Whitlam 14 years in this parliament, which is a substantial amount of time by today's standards, before he was elected leader of the Labor Party. He went on to lose the 1969 election, but in 1972 he finally led Labor into office after 23 years in opposition.


I believe that all our past prime ministers have been great patriots of this nation and they all wanted to see our nation succeed and our prosperity continue to increase. Therefore, I believe that they would all want us not to engage in mythmaking but to look upon their terms in office critically, to look at the things that they did wrong—not for the sake of criticising but for the sake of hoping to learn from those mistakes. The Whitlam government, although they certainly did many interesting things, they did a few things that we should look at and we should learn from those mistakes. 


One, I believe, was the recognition of the Soviet annexation of the Baltic states: Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. That was undertaken by the Whitlam government on 3 August 1974. That was in the midst of the Cold War, the real struggle in the second half of the last century, the struggle between communism and the West. By recognising the communist takeover, we said it was okay for those people to remain locked behind the Iron Curtain, that the Iron Curtain was a permanent feature that we had accepted and that we had surrendered in the fight of the Cold War. History shows that that was the wrong thing to do. We have shown that that was standing on the wrong side of history. Thankfully, many other nations stood by the Baltic states, especially the Americans. When those states were finally liberated in the nineties, that recognition, unfortunately, was a very sad part of our nation's history. Thankfully, it was reversed after a short period of time.


The other thing that the Whitlam government was given much credit for was recognition of China, but that came at the expense of Taiwan. We withdrew from Taiwan and closed down our embassy, and we recognised China. We have to remember that the China that we deal with today is a different kettle of fish to the China of the 1970s. One reason, I would suggest, that China has gone down the track that it has and has seen its prosperity increase so much is that, during the eighties and nineties, the Chinese leadership had the opportunity to look at how their nation was progressing and compare it to the island of Taiwan. Whereas China's economy, GDP and standard of living were flatlining almost for decades, the economy of Taiwan continued to increase substantially. The prosperity the Taiwanese people enjoyed multiplied several-fold while the Chinese economy was flatlining. One of the reasons was that the Taiwanese people went down the track of free markets. They went down the track of democracy. They went down the track of creating an entrepreneurial culture, of allowing their own people to own and create wealth and to start up their own businesses. 


I would suggest it was that prosperity—seeing the difference of the standard of living those two systems delivered, in terms of material welfare—that was one of the major reasons the Chinese government, in the 90s, decided to open its economy.


By pulling out of Taiwan, by closing our embassy there, we threatened the Taiwanese economy. In fact, the Taiwanese economy went through a very dark and harsh period, during the early 1970s, when countries such as Australia no longer recognised them—and recognised China. It is also worthwhile remembering that even in the 1980s our exports to China only represented 2½ per cent of our nation's exports. Today they represent over 30 per cent. That increase has come about because the Chinese have realised they should have followed the economic policies of the Taiwanese. What Australia and many nations did, by pulling out of Taiwan, threatened the very thing that has created the modern China of today.


There are also the mistakes we made about the Vietnamese refugees, and this was covered by a debate yesterday in this parliament. There is the decision of creating independence for Papua New Guinea. We see Papua New Guinea today experiencing as a nation great difficulties. Perhaps we rushed into giving Papua New Guinea independence. Perhaps it was because of an anti-colonialist attitude that we thought having another country as a colony—although we never treated it that way—was a bad thing. 


Before we became a federation we were able to enjoy 100 years of British traditions and the establishment of those institutions to create the democracy that we have, the rule of law that we have. Perhaps we rushed into giving Papua New Guinea that independence. Perhaps we should have stayed there and helped that nation establish those British institutions, help establish the rule of law, help establish the Westminster system and help establish its infrastructure. Perhaps if we had done that Papua New Guinea would have been a stronger nation today.


The other thing we can learn from the Whitlam era is the way that we treat our troops when they come home. Much is said about the Whitlam government bringing the troops home from Vietnam, but history shows that this all happened under previous Liberal governments. When Labor came to power there were only 120 Australian troops left in Vietnam, most of those guarding our embassy. And none of them were conscripts. There were the attacks from the left when those troops came home—the demonisation of those troops—that caused many of those men many more problems than they had experienced fighting in the war. 


We realise now those mistakes. We realise now the importance, whether people agree or disagree with the war, of treating our troops and armed service men and women, who serve and fight in those wars, with the utmost respect and dignity when they return home.


We also learned about the issue of so-called free education. Much is said about Whitlam making education free. We know there were many scholarships and grants, and the majority of people in university when Whitlam was in power were actually there on some type of scholarship system. We remember the word 'free', but nothing is for free. Someone always has to pay. So unless we are going to turn our lecturers in universities into slaves, someone must pay. If we are giving someone a free university education or even a subsidised university education, it means someone else out there in society—often someone who never would have the opportunity to go to university—has to pay.


We also learned about our Trade Practices Act. It is often said the Whitlam government introduced the Trade Practices Act, but we had a Trade Practices Act preceding that in 1965 and we had a Restrictive Trade Practices Act in 1971. Perhaps, with hindsight, one of the great mistakes of that Trade Practices Act was section 49, the provisions on price discrimination where, rather than following the entirety of US antitrust law at the time and implementing what was the US Robinson-Patman Act for price discrimination, we went with other wording. We tacked on the other end of our price discrimination act a substantial lessening of competition test, and that has led to much concentration in our markets today across all sectors.


The Whitlam government was certainly one of great historical importance and interest to our nation. As I said, we cannot sugar coat the period. We need to look at the mistakes that were made so we can learn from those mistakes. Of course during that period we also saw unemployment triple, we saw the tax take almost double, we saw the deficit blow out and we saw inflation soar to almost 20 per cent. When the Australian public was finally given the opportunity to give a verdict on those Whitlam years at the 1975 election, Labor were tossed out in a landslide. There was a 7.4 per cent swing against them and, of the 66 seats that the Labor Party held, 30 seats were lost. Almost half of the government lost office, with a two-party preferred vote of 55.7 per cent to 44.3 per cent. Whitlam stayed on in parliament and contested the 1977 election. Despite that, there was just a 1.1 per cent swing back and they only won back two of the 30 seats they had lost. It was still a landslide victory to the coalition.


Gough Whitlam was part of an era, a generation of Australians that has enabled my generation and my children's generation, and hopefully my children's generation in the future, to enjoy enormous prosperity. For all the errors, for all the mistakes, we must be greatly thankful for our 21st Prime Minister.

"Danby, Michael, MP",ALP,2014-10-28,"



Mr DANBY
 (Melbourne Ports) (09:51):  On a balmy night on 30 November 1972 I walked down Balaclava Rd from my grandmother's house in Carnegie to the 'It's Time' rally at the St Kilda, now Port Phillip, Town Hall, and there I met for the first time, and heard, Gough Whitlam, with whom I have been intermittently in contact throughout my time in politics and indeed before my entry to parliament. He was an inspiring but flawed leader. I suppose we are all flawed.


The Menzies government was the first one to tentatively introduce state aid to independent schools in the form of funding for science laboratories, but it was Gough Whitlam who ensured that the funding of non-government schools was for ever non-partisan. Prior to 1970, the hard left anti-Catholic sectarians who dominated the Victorian Labor Party hated the idea of the federal government funding of non-government schools. Whitlam understood that unless there was a needs based, non-sectarian funding of all schools Labor would remain unelectable. Indeed the issue of state aid to independent schools destroyed the career of my predecessor, then leader of the state opposition, Clive Holding. Just days before the 1970 election the local newspaper, the Herald Sun, reported Bill Hartley, the infamous anti-Israel head of the Victorian central executive, overruling Holding's pledge to give government money, state aid, to church schools. This caused Mr Whitlam, who was then the Leader of the Opposition, with the support of then ACTU President Bob Hawke, to intervene in the Victorian Labor Party and insist on the replacement of its extreme left executive. Excising the hard left Victorian central executive, dominated by the little remembered but prominent at the time figures Bill Hartley and George Crawford, is widely judged to have been crucial not just at a state level but also nationally to Labor's election for the first time in 23 years in 1972.


Despite the ghastly ghouls in the Greens party trying to steal Gough Whitlam's mantle after his death, Whitlam was a centrist and long an enemy of the hard left. Only in conversations since his passing have I been told it was he who alerted the Red Fox, Alan Reid, and his photographer to the scene of him and Arthur Calwell, then the Leader of the Labor Party, lurking under a dim street lamp. I do not know whether it is true, but it was said to be designed to embarrass the 36 faceless men who comprised the national conference of the Labor Party, determining Australia's foreign policy without our national deputy leader present and our attitude to the then important issue of the communications base at North West Cape. It was typical of Gough if he in fact did it. His doctrine was, as in many other issues, crash through or crash.


I have to record, unfortunately, that Mr Whitlam in my view sullied his reformist record in 1975 by proposing to take a donation from the Iraqi Ba'ath party. There is and there was grainy contemporaneous footage of Saddam Hussein dragging out dissident members of the Ba'ath party from their national congress to be murdered. These kinds of events about Iraq and the Ba'ath party were known at the time.


Nonetheless, Mr Whitlam was removed by, in my view, an unethical blocking of supply, and the Governor-General's, Sir John Kerr's, dubious exercising of his undefined reserve powers in unfortunate collaboration with a former Liberal Attorney-General, the Chief Justice of the High Court at the time, Sir Garfield Barwick. As a university student leader, I organised many manifestations of ongoing public outrage at Mr Whitlam's removal. Most memorable was an American-style picket of the Royal Commonwealth Society in Queens Road in early 1976, when Sir John Kerr appeared for the first time since the dismissal. As president of the University of Melbourne student representative council, I organised over 300 students, all garbed in top hats made out of black cardboard to mock the pomposity of the then Governor-General Kerr and to highlight his constitutional improprieties.


Occasionally through the years I saw Gough Whitlam, and our relationship slowly revived. He occasionally sought to refine my speeches and questions in this place and approved of many of the historical, linguistic and geographical allusions in my parliamentary contributions. Our last conversation was several years ago at the ALP National Conference in Darling Harbour, where Mr Whitlam, typically, exhibited a keen interest in my role, as he had done with many Labor members of this parliament, as the ranking member then of the federal parliament's Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. Former Prime Minister Whitlam was very anxious that the Liberals not roll back one vote, one value. He was passionate about electoral reform and believed that federal Labor had unfairly lost three federal elections in 1954, 1961 and 1969 because of the perversions of the electoral process, including gerrymandering and archaic voting laws. Although he tried to reform them in his time, a blockage in the Senate meant that those fair electoral laws which we now have presiding over Australia were only adopted when his colleague Bob Hawke was elected as Prime Minister in 1983, and great reforms of electoral matters took place in those days.


As Mr Whitlam stepped into his car at the ALP conference in Darling Harbour, his parting remarks to me were in his famous deep, self-mocking tone: 'I pass to you, Danby, the torch of electoral reform'—a treasured compliment, as is his memory.

Ms GAMBARO
 (Brisbane) (09:58):  I rise in support of this condolence motion for the Hon. Edward Gough Whitlam AC QC. I want to make special mention of Gough and Margaret's surviving children, Tony, Nicholas, Stephen and Catherine, as well as his sister, Freda. All too often in circumstances such as this, it is the family of those who have passed who are treated as the epitaph, an afterthought at the end of speeches and news reports. I want to mention them first because as a nation we lost our 21st Prime Minister; their loss is the greatest loss of all. I recently suffered the loss of my father, and to Gough and Margaret's family I want to say this: for all the intrusions that the politics of this nation have made into your lives over the years, thank you for sharing your father and your mother with all of us. Your sacrifice has helped to make us the country that we are today.


The passing of a Prime Minister is a national event. It is something we all rightly mourn and for which we show our deepest respect. Regardless of whether any of us agreed or disagreed with Gough's politics, there are times when our humility triumphs over our differing political views, and this is one of those times. As polarising a political figure as Gough was in life, I for one have been humbled by the fact that we as a nation have all come together to celebrate his life, his triumphs, his failures and how he contributed to our view of ourselves as Australians. I do not believe that anyone in this place could be unmoved by the way that Gough's passing has brought us together, political opponents united in respect for one man.


Even in death Gough is challenging us to think beyond our petty squabbles and hatreds. As my parliamentary colleague the member for Wentworth has said:


… hatred, as we know, destroys and corrodes the hater much more than it hurts the hated, and so many people in our business, in politics, find themselves consumed by hatred and retire into a bitter anecdotage, gnawing away at all of the injustices and betrayals they have suffered through their life.


This was not the case with Gough, as both he and another former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser demonstrated over many years.


There have been many superlatives spoken about Gough this past week, just as there have been many less forgiving and quite blunt appraisals of his competence in government—or, rather, the lack of it. This must be really confusing for a generation of Australians who did not live in Gough's time. Where does the truth lie? For me, it is a little of both. It is properly acknowledged that Gough thought big. He had big ideas, big dreams and, by all repute, a big ego which eclipsed both. I believe he genuinely wanted to change the lives of all Australians for the better. I do not believe he knew how to best go about achieving that goal, but his belief in the ideal was admirable. His government ended conscription and recalled our troops from Vietnam. He recognised China, introduced Medibank, abolished university fees and gave Papua New Guinea its independence. He transformed our approach to Indigenous Australians and he championed the cause of women. His government's incompetence in the management of the economy, however, would ultimately prove that Labor was not fit for office at that time.


In the passing of Gough, we must guard against a temptation to canonise a man who was, as Prime Minister Abbott has rightly described, a 'giant' in our country's history. There are lessons we can learn from Gough, from his successes and his failures. As a young country still creating the depth of its political mythology, it is only right and healthy that we have such debates and contest these ideas, that we seek to learn. But we cannot learn if we view our own history through rose-coloured glasses. One lesson I believe we can take from Gough is that style over substance is no way to lead a country.


But, in saying that, and as Henry Ergas said in The Australian yesterday, unlike some Labor leaders who have come after him, Gough was:


A self, not a selfie, he had character …


Edward Gough Whitlam was an Australian statesman and a patriot. He was an optimist and unashamedly ambitious for this country. If there is any legacy from Gough that we should seek to emulate it is this: we must never stop trying to make this lucky country of ours even better.

Ms KING
 (Ballarat) (10:03):  The death of Gough Whitlam is mourned across the nation as the passing of a great Australian, a leader who changed this nation for the better and left us a magnificent legacy that continues to enrich our lives today. Like many in this place—on all sides, it seems—I treasure memories of my meetings with Gough and Margaret. In my case, it was during their visits to my electorate of Ballarat.


Gough first came to Ballarat as Prime Minister in 1973 to unveil the restored Eureka flag at the Ballarat Fine Art Gallery. I know that he was pleased to hear that it had eventually gone back to where the Eureka Stockade had occurred. It now sits within the Museum of Australian Democracy at Eureka. In a landmark speech in 1973, at the time of the unveiling, he noted that:


It is a truism, perhaps, that the importance of an historical event lies not in what happened but in what later generations believe to have happened.


Gough was a great champion of the spirit of Eureka, attending numerous functions in Ballarat to mark what he believed to be both an event of great significance in the evolution of Australian democracy and a true symbol of a proud, independent nation. So, as the member for Ballarat, I particularly wanted to contribute to this condolence motion to thank Gough on behalf of the people of Ballarat for your faith in us and your continued belief in the spirit of Eureka.


Whenever I had the pleasure of meeting and talking to Gough, I was always struck by his incredibly cheeky sense of humour. In fact my very first meeting with Gough came shortly after I was elected as the federal member for Ballarat. We had our annual Eureka walk. I had worn a pair of Blundstones because the walk was quite lengthy. Gough had been brought to the event in a car. I had met him the day before. I was sitting on the podium with him and he looked down and peered most curiously at my footwear. He beckoned to his staff member, Stephen, in a very loud voice and pointed so that everybody in the audience could see him pointing at my boots, and said, 'Look, Stephen, she's got Stott Despoja boots on.' I always thought it was a difficult situation—how do you deal with someone as great as Gough suddenly taking the micky out of you? It was quite a funny experience.


In 2004, my husband and I, together with about 25 guests, hosted Gough and Margaret at our house in Ballarat. It was an enormous privilege to experience for a few hours their shared passion and extraordinary knowledge of history, culture and travel. I will never forget a young girl who since has subsequently gone on to work in politics, Susan, who I remember spent a lot of time talking to Gough. Gough was incredibly kind, generous and engaging with her. There he was in his 80s, frail, but still wanting to know about her and her aspirations for life. He encouraged her to continue her engagement with politics.


Gough not only loved Ballarat's history but also our architecture. He considered the streetscape and buildings of Ballarat to be some of Australia's finest, and Lydiard Street, where my electoral office is located, to be one of Australia's truly great preserved streetscapes.


Gough's passing has been the trigger for many of us to reflect on his legacy and his achievements. All of us who were fortunate enough to be elected to this place come here because we want to make a difference. But few politicians in this nation's history, if any, can point to a legacy as great as the one bequeathed to this nation by Gough Whitlam: ending conscription, recognising China and tearing down the last vestiges of the White Australia policy to make us a truly multicultural nation. Whitlam's government recognised land rights, introduced no-fault divorce, pursued equal pay for women and made the dream of many parents for their children to become the first in their family to go to university a reality. He introduced Australia's first consumer protection and trade practices laws and promoted the arts in all its myriad forms that today so proudly reflect our national identity. And, of course, what will come as no surprise for anyone to hear me declare is that his finest achievement was universal health care.


These are the achievements of a true political giant, a leader with a sweeping vision who saw this nation as a place that could, and must, be better than it had been; a nation that should be a fairer, decent and more inclusive society, where its rich natural resources and great wealth were shared with all of its people; a nation which pursued a vision of itself every bit as great as the continent it inhabited; a nation where we stood tall on the world stage, proud of who we were, and no longer able to be dismissed as a British outpost at the far end of the earth.


Critics often dismiss Gough's achievements as reforms that were going to happen anyway, suggesting he just happened to be the one around at the time. One only has to look at the struggles to this day to give Australia access to decent universal health care to know that this argument is false. Without Gough showing the way, demonstrating that universal health care was an idea which could be delivered, it would have been so much harder for Bob Hawke to have fought and won that battle once more. Forty years after those tumultuous times of 1975, it is now clear the Dismissal only ended Gough's time as Prime Minister, not what he sought to achieve during that brief time he was in office. His far-reaching reforms to make Australia a more modern, open, inclusive and fairer nation endure.


'If you seek his monument, look around you,' reads the epitaph of Christopher Wren in the magnificent St Paul's Cathedral. So too does Australia stand today as that monument to Gough. His monument is all of us. This nation was fortunate to have had such a great statesman in Edward Gough Whitlam. We mourn his passing, but we celebrate a life that has left us all the richer for his time among us, and we thank his children for sharing him with us during what has been a very important time in our history.

Mr CHESTER
 (Gippsland—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence) (10:10):  I join with the member for Ballarat and others who have already spoken in relation to this condolence motion. I am humbled to speak in relation to our 21st Prime Minister, the Hon. Edward Gough Whitlam, known universally as Gough. On behalf of all Gippslanders, I would like to extend my condolences to the Whitlam family, particularly his children—Tony, Nick, Stephen and Catherine—and also the Australian Labor Party. Our political parties are a bit like our extended families and Gough was the patriarch of the modern Labor family.


I would also like to acknowledge the members and senators from all sides who reflected so fondly on the memory of Gough Whitlam. I think we saw last Tuesday parliament at its absolute best. The condolence motion spoken on by the opposition leader, the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and others reflected very favourably on the way this House can pull together at appropriate times and rise to a higher standard, and I think the Australian people deeply appreciate it when we manage to reach those levels.


It was a celebration of a momentous life, and there is no question or any suggestion that Gough Whitlam ever adopted the small-target strategy which seems so popular in modern politics. Gough lived life large and to the full, and it is a great credit to him and his family that he was able to excite political debate at a time when the Australian community was desperate for someone of his ilk. So it is important that we use these events—and I cannot for a second suggest it is a sad event, because I think it is actually a celebration of a magnificent life—to recognise former leaders of our nation, particularly one who lived to the ripe age of 98 and continued to make a contribution well into what other people may regard as retirement years, often at great personal sacrifice and sacrifice from his family as well.


I do not think this is a time or a place to be running a report card on the former Prime Minister, on how we think he performed, either at the time or afterwards. I even saw on the weekend a media outlet encouraging people to give him a score out of 10, which I think is a great disservice to a Prime Minister. Whether he was 'Australia's greatest Prime Minister' or 'not our best Prime Minister' I do not think particularly matters. It is not for us mere mortals to make those assessments of a man of Mr Whitlam's great ego, if you like, as reflected on by other members last week.


Everyone will have their own opinions, but I think we can focus on the things that we do agree on—and that is, that he was a giant of political life in Australia. He was a powerful motivating force who sought to make a difference, and I think that is a great contribution. What really matters, I think, is that Gough Whitlam showed great pride, determination and passion for Australia and he pursued his policy agenda. He knew what he wanted and he set out to achieve that agenda with great passion and vigour.


I think these are the qualities that the Australian people are looking for today, perhaps even more so than in the past. They want to see members on both sides of this chamber coming here with a clear vision, a determination to participate in the great contest of ideas this parliament provides for, and pursuing their agenda with passion but with respect for each other. I think we can have a robust contest in this place—at all times we have a robust contest—but we can maintain a level of wit and good humour which I think Gough Whitlam demonstrated on many occasions.


I think there can be few more appropriate examples of members who have come to this place with a clear vision of how they wanted to shape the nation, in their mind for the betterment of the nation. I do not think we need to agree, as I said, on his success or failure, but surely we can agree that he was determined to make a difference. He had a relentless optimism and a belief in our nation.


I think the media, perhaps unfairly, over the last week or so have used the passing of Gough Whitlam to reflect on the inadequacy of current politicians and the current parliament. I would encourage the media to be a little bit less churlish in that regard. I am not going to stand here and lecture the media, but I think they could be a little bit less churlish. Rather than make comparisons with Gough Whitlam and his era and use the occasion to reflect adversely on members of the current parliament, take the time to meet many of the members in this chamber, on both sides of the House, and you will find many extraordinary community leaders who are doing some great work in their individual electorates. No-one gets elected to the House of Representatives without some ability. We may dispute the choice of the individual electorates. We may fiercely contest the next election and then try to defeat those individual candidates. But no-one makes it to the House of Representatives without some level of ability, something that appeals to their electorates. I think we have a shared passion and commitment to our individual regions. I encourage the media in that regard. Rather than reflect on the adequacy of current members of parliament, get out there, meet some of these people in their electorates and understand the work they do on a daily basis. 


It is an opportunity for us to reflect on the great contribution that Gough Whitlam made to the Australian Labor Party in particular. It is an opportunity to recommit ourselves as members in this place to working together whenever we can. I accept there are many occasions when we do not agree. But, whenever we can, it is an opportunity to work together on some of these significant national projects of importance and to demonstrate the respect and personal integrity that we need to stand in this place and to have that great contest of ideas. 


If there is one great legacy for Gough Whitlam—and take aside all the individual policy areas which we may dispute—it is that he excited a generation of young people to get interested in politics. His ideas excited debate in the community. He motivated young people in particular to show an interest in the great public debates of our time. He encouraged a generation to become engaged in the political process. As I learned last week, to my great surprise, that included our own Deputy Prime Minister. Warren Truss, the member for Wide Bay, remarked that many on this side were inspired to get involved in politics for the opposite reason. They thought it was necessary to stand up against some of the things that he stood for. I did indulge in a bit of tweeting at the time. I could not quite imagine my great leader and great friend the Deputy Prime Minister out there chanting slogans and manning the barricades with billboards. But you learn something every day. It is true that the member for Wide Bay was excited to enter politics through the activities of Gough Whitlam, though of course on the opposite side of the political agenda. 


There were many great speeches last week and I will not go through them all now in terms of the contributions that people made. But I think the point made by the Leader of the Opposition that he articulated again last week was a very valid one. Gough's ambition went beyond his desire to service our nation. He wanted to transform it completely and permanently—and he did. And, as members here gather throughout the year, I say we all accept there are things we need to improve in our nation, that it is an ongoing process to continue to work wherever it is possible on the reforms that are required. I do not accept for a second that any government is perfect, nor do I accept that any government is a complete failure. I look at the previous government, the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd years, and I see some reforms which occurred in that time frame which I think will be reviewed quite positively by the electorate in the longer term. Perhaps the failure of that government relates more to the capacity to pay for some of the reforms when they were made. But there is ongoing reform required in issues related to education; child care; aged care; health services; making sure that people who are socially or economically disadvantaged have the support they require; making sure that we support older Australians in an ageing population; and, in an area where Gough Whitlam himself was an enormous reformer, Indigenous affairs. Particularly on the issue of land rights, that work continues today. I do not suggest for a second that we are anywhere near finished that journey, but I believe the Whitlam legacy in that regard has been a positive one and I am confident the members on both sides, members of good faith, are heading in the right direction in relation to Indigenous reforms and making sure that our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people get the support they need to be full and complete participants in our great nation.


So the work of government is never done and there is still need for enormous reforms, but I congratulate the Australian Labor Party and its patriarch of the modern era, Gough Whitlam, for the work they undertook in that tumultuous time. No-one is suggesting for a second they were not divisive days. No-one is suggesting for a second it was a perfect time. But it certainly did excite political interest in our nation. 


Just briefly and in conclusion, I want to remark on a story that was retold to me by some of my local electorate residents. As far as I can tell, during his relatively short term in government Mr Whitlam only had limited opportunities to the visit the electorate of Gippsland. I did manage to find a speech where he was at the Gippsland Field Days. This was in 1974 at Lardner, near Warragul. This is not quite in my electorate but in the electorate of McMillan nearby. I would suggest it would have been a pretty tough crowd for a Labor Prime Minister. There were reports of heckling and jeering farmers armed with tomatoes. There were no reports that Warren Truss was in the crowd, but it was a tough crowd for a—




Mr Tehan:
  What about truss tomatoes?




Mr CHESTER:
  I acknowledge the member for Wannon. He would have hardly been a twinkle in his mother's eye at that stage! 


It was 1974. But, with his usual charm, humour and robust debating style, he held his own and apparently placated the masses. He even thanked the crowd for receiving him so warmly. So I think that as Tony Abbott, the Prime Minister, said last week:


In person, it was hard to disagree with and impossible to dislike such a man …


I am sure his presence left an impression on the masses that gathered that day in 1974.


Finally, it would be remiss of me not to mention, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence, the contribution that our former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam made to the Royal Australian Air Force. Mr Whitlam signed up with the RAAF in 1941 and started training as a navigator/bomb aimer in May 1942. He was later posted to the RAAF No. 13 Squadron, operating out of the Northern Territory, Dutch New Guinea and northern Western Australia, often flying very long sorties. He served with distinction, as he went on to serve with distinction in this place, and the war experience no doubt emboldened his sense of public duty and the service which he maintained throughout his career both as a barrister and later as a parliamentarian.


It takes courage to be a RAAF officer. It takes courage to enter this parliament and to stand at the dispatch box and contest the great ideas that our nation needs to contest for its future. It was a brave decision by Mr Whitlam as opposition leader to visit China in 1971, and history will judge him very kindly for making that decision. Just look at our relationship now with our northern neighbours. It is a type of courage in decision making that we should all aspire to. As the Prime Minister said, there is a lot to be learnt from the giants of those times. As the Deputy Prime Minister said, some of the big changes Gough Whitlam influenced during his tenure are widely accepted now. He had the courage of his convictions and he acted upon them.


I will leave the final comments to the member for Sydney, who reflected that Gough Whitlam, in his own words, might be considered 'eternal but not immortal'. Certainly, when it comes to the story of our great nation, Gough Whitlam will always hold a special place. I commend the condolence motion to the House and I again extend my condolences, on behalf of the people of Gippsland, to the Whitlam family, its friends and the Australian Labor Party.

Ms BURKE
 (Chisholm) (10:22):  It is indeed an honour to speak on the condolence motion for Edward Gough Whitlam, the 21st Prime Minister of Australia. Throughout the course of this debate—and yet again from the member for Gippsland—it has been wonderful to hear many personal reflections about the impact that Gough Whitlam had on people's lives and how he shaped their views, beliefs and actions, on either side of the divide.


In my office sits a photograph of my baby brother—Paul will always be the baby brother!—Paul's graduation day. He graduated from Monash University, the same university that I, my sisters, Nina and Sophie, and my other brother, Tony, all graduated from—all five Burkes. The day Paul graduated, my brother Tony—who is not one for getting publicity—contacted the local paper and the Herald Sun and wanted to make comment on this momentous achievement: five children from the one family all graduating from the one university. But what he really wanted to tell was the story of how we got there and why we got there and to praise the fact that, if it had not been for Gough Whitlam, these five siblings would never have made it to university. I suspect my elder brother and sister would have, as they had gone through school on full scholarship, but my parents would have been left with the choice of which child then would not get to go. It was a choice my grandparents made in respect of my father, who never got to go to university.


So this was a momentous day for us, and both papers came down and took the photo, and the Herald Sun actually ran the story. It was not just about us completing university; it was the trail that had been blazed for us to get there. This was an absolutely magnificent day for my family—most particularly for my mother, who struggled through all those years to get us to university. As I have said in this place before, one of the proudest days our family had was seeing my mother graduate many years later as a mature-age student, something again not possible without the intervention of Gough Whitlam.


I know I am not alone in this place in my appreciation of Gough for the advantages I received in life because of his vision. Many of us here are of the generation which benefited most from Gough's reforms to our education—an education my parents dreamed of for their five children but could never have afforded otherwise, an education my father-in-law's parents dreamed of for him but that they could not have afforded. He sat his matriculation twice, not because he had not passed brilliantly the first time but because he had not passed brilliantly enough to get a full scholarship. His school allowed him to resit his matriculation so he would get a full scholarship to go on and complete his medical degree at Melbourne university. I think, if he had not had parents who were that savvy, the outer eastern suburbs of Melbourne would have missed out on a phenomenal practitioner. There was no way that the tram conductor's kid was going to get to university and do medicine! But he got there the hard way. It is something Gough took away in ensuring that all the next generations did not have to blaze that trail. The essence and principle of Gough's visions have endured. When cost is not a barrier to education, all Australians are able to access the educational opportunities that are their right—a right this government is trying to rip away as I speak. But it is not a time for partisan politics in these remarks.


Gough Whitlam viewed Australia not just through the narrow prism of an economy; he also saw Australia as a society and, in every way, he worked to improve our society as a whole to make sure that people are not excluded and that, as much as possible, everyone is given an equal chance—an equal chance, not an equal choice; a chance to strive based on your ability, not your parents' income. To quote the man himself:


Poverty is a national waste as well as an individual waste. We are all diminished when any of us are denied proper education. The nation is the poorer—a poorer economy, a poorer civilisation, because of this human and national waste.


Hear, hear, I say. It is funny how some things change but many do not. And it is a waste if we cannot ensure that everyone has access to a proper education. Gough was enormously successful in reducing this divide and in reducing the poverty in our nation as a whole. 


In fact, it is hard to name a Prime Minister who has managed to achieve such a long list of lasting social changes as Gough Whitlam. As many people have remarked since his passing last week, the Whitlam legacy very much defined what we understand to be modern Australia. Even those people whose political ideology drives them to seek to destroy everything Gough Whitlam established are the first to say that no Prime Minister has changed Australia more, and it is true. Gough Whitlam made this country fairer. He broadened our horizons, made us braver and reshaped our view of ourselves and all we can achieve. 


The appreciation the Australian community has not only of the Whitlam legacy but of Gough Whitlam the man has been amazing to witness. The sheer outpouring of emotion by the country when Gough died says far more about the depths of gratitude and awareness of his great contribution than any speech ever can. Indeed, my older Labor Party branch members in Chisholm, many of them who are still fighting on today will tell you they joined the party because of Gough. It is what you hear reverberate time and time again: 'I joined in 1970 because of Gough. I joined because of the Vietnam War and what Gough did.' And they are loyal to the party to this day. The fact that even today, in the modern political environment, we are still wrangling over so much that was central to the Whitlam reforms says even more about just how much Gough Whitlam had to fight to achieve change.


Gough Whitlam fought to achieve universal health care. He fought hard. It took six blocked bills, a double dissolution election and a joint sitting of the parliament to establish Medibank. Now, four decades later, all Australians enjoy access to Medicare, even though it remains under attack by the same ideology that fought so hard to prevent its establishment in the first place. It is the rock bed of what we consider to be almost an inalienable right in Australia, Medicare. 


I think one of the reasons Gough Whitlam's passing has so captured the imaginations and hearts of so many Australians is how contemporary so many of Gough's reforms remain. Gough Whitlam ended conscription and completed Australia's withdrawal from the Vietnam War. He scrapped knights and dames, and introduced the Australian honours system. He established no-fault divorce. Gough removed sales tax from contraception and added the pill to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, abolished the death penalty for federal crime, supported the case for equal pay for women, reduced the voting age to 18 from 21 and changed our national anthem from God Save the Queen to Advance Australia Fair—all things we are still debating in this modern era, although hopefully not the national anthem. But, while it is hard to find people who can recall and sing the second verse of the national anthem, it is now a far better reflection of the values of modern Australia which were awakened by Gough.


We also owe a debt of gratitude to Gough for the strength of our multicultural society. It was Gough Whitlam who took the first step in recognising Aboriginal land rights and addressing the profound inequality and discrimination experienced by Indigenous Australians—a lasting legacy to this day. Gough Whitlam saw past the fear of the other and reached out to the communist government of China, beginning our relationship with our most important contemporary trading partner. Again, he did this in spite of fierce opposition. The Sydney Morning Herald editorial at the time of Gough's first visit to China lambasted him:


If … Whitlam thinks that this wholesale selling out of friends to gain a despot's smile is diplomacy, then Heaven protect this country if he ever directs its foreign policy.


As the representative of an electorate that is home to more than 20,000 people of Chinese heritage, a multicultural community where half of everybody's parents were born overseas, I would like to pay particular thanks to Gough for his commitment to our multiculturalism. We are a better community and a better country because of it. Opening ties with China was visionary, and I do not think you will find anybody lambasting it as the editorial of the paper did back then.


In life, Gough Whitlam was a guiding light to his party and country for both his success and his failure. He showed the Labor Party and Australia what we can achieve if we are true to our values and our principles and maintain the courage and the rage to pursue policies of fairness and equality no matter how strong the opposition. He also showed us strength in the face of the greatest act of political bastardry that this country has ever seen. In 1997 Gough Whitlam remarked, 'I have more influence now than when I had the power.' And, in death, I imagine that Gough Whitlam's legacy and his influence will continue to grow. And so it should.


Gough Whitlam will always be a giant of Australian history, a giant of the Labor Party and a giant in our hearts. Vale, Gough Whitlam. May he rest in peace.

"Tehan, Dan, MP",LP,2014-10-28,"



Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon) (10:32):  Gough Whitlam's death marks the passing of a truly remarkable era. It is funny that, as a young boy when the Whitlam government came into power, I cannot remember a lot about the debate that took place—the fierce policy debates, the fierce questioning of the economic management, the fierce questioning of some of the social programs that were put through this parliament. But the impact of what was occurring was obviously significant because, as a young boy at primary school and in junior primary school, I can still remember having discussions—fairly juvenile discussions, I must say, but discussions—about what was happening in Australia. It does show how remarkable those times must have been because it was reaching down into grade 1 and grade 2 of primary schools across the nation. I am sure that our discussions in the playground or in the classroom were similar to what was occurring around the nation. Obviously there was fierce discussion taking place across the dinner tables at teatime across the nation as to what was happening to the country. And there were remarkable things that were happening.


I think that it is worth recognising the spirit in which this discussion has occurred in this place because it has been incredibly fitting, I think, that both sides have been able to recognise both the successes and some of the shortcomings of someone who was a truly remarkable Australian.


The thing that has struck me most in listening to the eulogies and reading the tributes to Gough is his public service. He was committed to public service like few others have been in this parliament. He volunteered for the RAAF, or the RAF as it was then. He was someone who demonstrated that his public service knew no bounds, because he was prepared ultimately to put his life on the line for our nation. I think anyone who is prepared to do that, for that fact alone, deserves our recognition.


But it was not only that commitment. He then committed to a very long stint in this parliament, ultimately becoming the 21st Prime Minister of this nation. And given everything that he went through, the trials and tribulations, not only in his remarkable transformation of the Labor Party with its internal brawling, he was able to achieve that much-needed reform and then take over the prime ministership. It would only be fair to say that he was Prime Minister during a time of considerable change, but also a time of considerable debate and conflict, ultimately ending with the dismissal. There would be many people who would take their bat and ball and go home after enduring all that, but Gough Whitlam did not. He decided that he would continue to serve the public and became ambassador to UNESCO.


He also never gave up on his commitment and contribution to the Labor Party. As we heard during the eulogies on the day when we first marked his death, his commitment to turn up after he had retired from politics, to attend branch meetings and party functions, became legendary. He did so even in the electorate of Wannon. In 1990 he turned up to Portland and addressed the south-west Labor club down there, of course with much fanfare. He had visited the electorate of Wannon previously in the late 1960s. He visited Warrnambool and Portland then when the then member for Wannon, who would also go on to become Prime Minister, was the education minister. I note there was a hiatus between the late 1960s and the 1990s when he did not come to Wannon—and I imagine there is probably a very good reason for that—but even the conflict and the turmoil that took place between the former member for Wannon and Gough Whitlam, even those scores, were settled after a period of time. Very interestingly, they became what I think you would call political friends after a considerable amount of time, which also goes to show the calibre of the individual that Gough Whitlam was. I think there would be many people who, having endured what he endured and been through what he went through—and this is not saying whether what occurred with the dismissal was right or wrong, but it would have been incredibly easy for him to dismiss Malcolm Fraser and say that he would never have anything to do with him again. Yet he was prepared, after a period of time, to embrace him and to work together with him on areas where they thought there was a mutual interest. That is truly remarkable.


One thing that I would like to go into in a little bit of detail here is a lasting reform commitment, an economic reform commitment, that Gough Whitlam left. There are not many lasting economic legacies that he did leave. Unfortunately we saw government expenditure increase at rapid rates, probably at rates we have not seen until Kevin Rudd was Prime Minister after the GFC. We saw budget deficits increasing; we saw the size of government increase remarkably. We are still grappling with those issues now. But one of the things he did do upon coming to power was to cut the level of protection in Australia by 25 per cent. He cut tariffs by 25 per cent. This was remarkable, because until he did that the consensus, almost on both sides of politics, was very much that protectionism was good and healthy for our country. Gough later recognised that Bert Kelly—the modest member—had had a big impact in the decision that he ultimately made. He came in and decided that he was going to cut tariffs by 25 per cent and basically did it overnight. He also raised the dollar at that time. 


That legacy, which both sides of government have taken onboard, has made us a wealthier and more prosperous nation. He knew that ultimately we had to open ourselves up to the world and open ourselves up to our region. In a way, he foresaw the impact that globalisation was going to have on our nation, and if we were not prepared and ready for it then we would be all the poorer for it. This was a brave and gutsy decision because he knew that not only would he get some criticism from our side but also, ultimately, he was going to get a lot of criticism from his own party and from the union movement, but he knew that it was the right step to take. 


As we have seen, that legacy has been embraced. We saw it with the floating of the dollar, we saw it with further tariff reductions during the eighties and the nineties, and we are seeing it even now with the government's free trade agendas with South Korea, Japan and, potentially, China. It would be incredibly fitting if, in the year that Gough died and we remembered what he did to begin our modern relationship with China, we could mark the year of his death with a free trade agreement with China. 


It would bookend the period remarkably. I, for one, hope that the government can achieve that because in a foreign policy sense, once again, his bravery—and we heard from the previous speaker about what TheSydney Morning Herald had to say about him travelling to China—in taking criticism from both sides and forging that path to begin the modern relationship with China is something which was truly remarkable. It showed that when he knew he thought he was doing the right thing, he had the bravery to do it. I think there are a lot of us here who could reflect on—what some have called a crash or a crash-through approach—a real firmness of conviction and a real bravery in being able to follow your convictions. Ultimately, those who have been through this place and are judged and judged well are those who have had convictions and have been prepared, through the way that they have acted in this place, to ensure that those convictions have guided what they have done. His legacy in that area stands as a tribute to him.


I will conclude there. If I could pass on my empathy and my sympathies to his family. His has been a life well lived. I hope that the passing of time will enable his family to get over the suffering and the hurt that they are feeling, and that they will be able to reflect on a remarkable life.

"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2014-10-28,"



Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley) (10:44):  Here is my Gough Whitlam story: I am in my 20s and I am a newish industrial officer at my old union, the Communications, Electrical and Plumbing Union in the postal and telecommunications branch. A big part of the job was taking phone calls and lots of them. On one particular day, we had been deluged by calls and from recollection there was a stuff-up in the processing of an allowance, so we had a lot of uptight members ringing through wanting to see what the union could do. I had finished this string of calls and decided I would just sneak out for a cup of coffee. But the loudspeaker on the phone piped up and it was reception telling me I had another call. I was at the door of my office and I leaned in and said, 'Can I just go and grab a cup of coffee?' Reception said, 'You'll want to take this call.' I said, 'I will be five minutes'—I was pleading—'take a message and I will grab a coffee.' Reception said: 'It's Mr Whitlam's office. Mr Whitlam wants to talk to you.' 


At that moment, you would think that the importance would sink in and that I would respond accordingly, but I said to reception, 'Sure, put the great man through and get me next week's Lotto win as well!' So I pick up the phone and say, 'Hello' and there was silence. Then I heard, 'Comrade' and it was that unmistakable voice. There on the line was the former Prime Minister of Australia. He was ringing because I was the secretary of the Greenway federal electorate council at that time within the Labor Party and we had sent him a letter commending him on his strong response to a very disappointing inaugural speech by a former member for Oxley in this place. He had rung to express his gratitude, but then he went on to do what others have remarked upon and quizzed me about my background—where was I from, where were my parents from, where did my parents raise us, where did we live.


What would you take out of that encounter? Not that Husic is flash at writing correspondence, though I would be grateful for the compliment; rather it was his curiosity, his interest and his care. It is these personal attributes of the man that so many people cherish and remember. Inasmuch as he had an eye for detail, and we have all heard stories of him indexing and footnoting Hansard; there is something else that people valued and I want to get to that point in a way you would not expect. I ask the House: can you remember the name of the Bart Cummings's horse that won the Melbourne Cup in 1974 and 1975? 




Mr Chester:
  Think Big.




Mr HUSIC:
  Correct. Very good work, member for Gippsland. I will remember to invite you to my next trivia night. If there was ever a horse that was so aptly named for the Whitlam era, it was Think Big—the name of the horse that won in 1974 and 1975.


Many people have celebrated his big range of achievements and they were secured in a compressed time frame. But Gough Whitlam thought big because he had big dreams for the nation. He had a big task of transforming and shaking up Australia and that demanded a big call-up of people. It was here that he did something special and why he is warmly remembered. He not only had self-belief; importantly, he believed in those who in a harder and tougher time did not benefit from the belief of wider society. If you think about it, he made a place for them all—for our nation's first people, for women, for migrants, for the families starting their lives way out in the suburbs and for the communities of our regions. He brought them within the view of public consciousness. That was the power of the Whitlam legacy. It was his faith in the capabilities of his fellow Australians.


Mr Whitlam was brought to life via the stories of my father, the man who tried so hard to peer through the windows of the Blacktown civic centre to see the man destined to become Prime Minister, when he made the call to the men and women of Australia. My dad had only just made it to Australia a few years earlier and mum followed soon after. I might have known Gough through those stories, but I actually knew him better because his belief touched our lives. He believed that working class families deserved access to quality health care or that kids of working class parents should be pushed to pursue higher education, prepared for it via good secondary schooling, or in Western Sydney that our homes should be properly sewered. Thanks to Gough, we never had to dance that dance of fear with redbacks in the outhouse!


I am here in part because of that belief that Gough Whitlam had in multicultural Australia. I am so grateful and honoured to be standing on this floor because Gough Whitlam had faith in multicultural Australia and he called up into national endeavour people of all backgrounds, and I am eternally grateful for that. On his passing, I thought of my dad's generation or the generation of Labor Party members out my way who had their belief ignited in the legitimacy of our party sitting on that other side of the House. It is from there that we can achieve so much for the people who deserve richer and better lives.


Much will be read into Mr Whitlam's style, approach and philosophy but, for me, he will always be remembered as a progressive for progress, not as a progressive championing the status quo. He recognised that the static imprisons the people we care for. It restrains Australians from capturing the opportunity emerging around them. He reformed and prepared his party—our party—as a vehicle for change in our country. As much as Mr Whitlam ushered in big change, huge change, he ensured the support was there for the people affected by it. 


He had a grander plan for Australia. He called up people from the breadth of Australian society to help him bring that vision to life. He made sure his government looked after them on the way through, shielding them from the tougher short-term consequences of that change while awaiting the longer-term improvements that these changes would bring. That is a lesson for the ages. Thank you for your service and your belief. Vale Edward Gough Whitlam.

"Bird, Sharon, MP",ALP,2014-10-28,"



Ms BIRD
 (Cunningham) (10:50):  I rise to convey my condolences to the House on the passing of the Honourable EG Whitlam AC, QC. In the coming days and weeks a great deal more will be written and said about the prime ministership of Gough Whitlam. It follows decades of discussion, writing and talking about the contribution of his government. One thing that can never be questioned is the modernising and transformative impact Gough had on Australia. The Australia that existed at the start of Gough's prime ministership was vastly different from the one that existed at the end of it.


Gough told us we could aspire to higher personal and national achievements, and we did. He told us we could be confident in the world, and we were. He encouraged us to open generous hearts to the less well-off, at home and abroad, and we did. His love of our country and our people translated through his leadership. He called to all of us to be our best, and we rose to that call. This is what continued to echo throughout the decades that followed his government. Unlike his government, the legacy could not be dismissed.


Gough's vision was as vast as international policy on the recognition of China and as specific as the position—as my colleague has just outlined—of sewer services and transport to the burgeoning public-housing suburbs on the fringes of our cities. Like my colleague, I did do the dance with the red-back spider before my own suburbs were sewered as a child. I have vivid memories of that legacy as well!


He knew we needed education and employment but also that we deserved arts and sports. He knew how to think deeply and to laugh fully. Some people represent their generation, and Gough certainly did that, but a rare few inspire us to imagine and act for future generations. Gough was one of those giants in our national story.


Many contributors to this debate have talked of the depth and spread of his enduring policy achievements and those of his government. It should not be ignored in this significant policy record that in my own shadow portfolio we saw the seeds of a truly national vocational education-and-training system begin to take shape through the Kangan report, the establishment of our modern TAFE system and the ensuing debate on how to grow productivity and participation for all Australians through the VET sector.


Gough did not only see university as a path to opportunity but also recognised the critical importance of skills, training, community and further education. Gough had very strong links to my own electorate of Cunningham. His early seat boundaries included suburbs that are now in my seat—in particular, the suburb of Helensburgh, and he is still very warmly regarded in the community. Like so many here, I was motivated by the experience of the Whitlam years. I joined the ALP, in 1977, as soon as I was old enough to join the party. I had been to many rallies and campaigns in Wollongong with my mum, dad and family. 


In 1989 the University of Wollongong awarded him an honorary doctorate and he regularly visited the area to assist in ALP campaigns, including my own in 2004 when I was able to spend a leisurely afternoon with him at the Mt Kembla pub—which was owned by his son Nick at the time—where Gough very generously gave me a lot of his time and wisdom on political life and purpose.


Like many of us in this place, Gough was well-served by his long-term and extremely loyal staff members: Aaron Rule, Penny Sachnikas and Michael Vlassopoulos. Aaron, Penny and Michael devoted many years to working for Gough, and I know they will be feeling the loss particularly keenly.


To Gough's son Nick and his wife Judy, who reside in the Illawarra and are good friends to many of us, I would like to extend my personal condolences to you both. Nick has told me that in the end their dad went quickly and peacefully.


I would also like to extend my condolences to Nick's brothers and sister: Antony and Stephen Whitlam, Catherine Dovey, and their families. Through their hard work and vision, Gough and Margaret opened up opportunities that have shaped my generation and many generations to follow. We thank you for sharing your parents, the powerful partnership that was Gough and Margaret, with the men and women of Australia.


In the few minutes that I have left, I wish to put on the record the words of many locals who have gone onto my website to put tributes into my condolence book. It is a great privilege that we can stand in this place and reflect on our own experiences, and they have been wonderful personal experiences. But many in our communities are also very keen to express publicly their views. These are some excerpts:


Thank you for changing our lives for the better. My parents could have never afforded to send me to university if it weren't for your reforms. Justine Griffith.


Rest in peace, Gough. An inspiration to people across the ditch as well. Mark Byford.


I heard Gough speak many times when I lived in Sydney and always enjoyed the occasions. He was one of the world's best orators along with Nelson Mandela and Martin Luther King. Carol Maloney.

A great man with a grand vision for what Australia could and should be. Although he will be missed each day we benefit daily from the legacy of his reforming and modernising agenda. Paul Scully and Alison Scully.


Gough Whitlam belonged to the 'great generation'—the one prepared to give of their lives for service to country. He went from RAAF navigator to head of government for all too brief a period. Gough Whitlam understood the important of political drama and seizing the moment. My generation sadly now takes many of his Government's hard-fought policies, in a wide range of areas, for granted Gough Whitlam's leadership and tremendous vision now belongs to the ages. I bid my own farewell to a great Australian leader and a great man. Gino Mandarino.


Australia has lost a truly great thinker, his ideas and courage to implement those ideas has never been equalled. His commitment to equality for all Australians is defined in the free education system we have at the present. Bev and Kevin Reed

I am one of thousands of working class women and men who were able to go to University after Gough introduced free Higher Education. This changed my life, and the life of my sister, in numerous ways giving us opportunities to reach our fullest intellectual potential. My condolences to his family and may it perhaps assuage their grief just a little to know how many lives were changed for the better by his courage and commitment. Mary Day.


And let's not forget Margaret and her many achievements too. A great man and a great woman ... a great partnership! Eileen Day.




I wish to express my profound gratitude for the life and service of our comrade, Gough Whitlam. I owe a good deal of the standard of living of my life to his courage and determination to bring about the changes he made, particularly for women and for our First People

 Let us hope he casts a long shadow, even from the grave, and inspires a new generation in these dark times.

Mr RIPOLL

 (
Oxley

):


It is an honour and a privilege to speak on the death of the Hon. Edward Gough Whitlam, AC, QC. There is no doubt that Gough was and is an icon of Australian history; he was larger than life both physically and mentally. He cast a shadow far and wide, influencing people and politics not just across our nation but right across the world. In his nearly 100 years of enormous life, Gough, as he is referred to by almost everyone, was never going to be a man who merely participated in life but someone who would lead and create. Every country has at least one person, someone who has done more than most to affect our way of life and leave behind more than just their memory. For Australia, Gough was one of these people.





Be it through creating Medibank, now Medicare, or through free university degrees, which so many people have spoken about, he also gave a new level of access to Australians by reducing import tariffs and in the way that we educated ourselves. He truly reformed the way Australia saw itself as well as the way that we behaved. It has often been said that you should not measure the success or contribution of anyone, let alone of Gough Whitlam, by the number of years that he was Prime Minister, but more importantly by what his achievements were in that short period of time. Gough worked very hard and he had a great vision for Australia. He saw a bigger Australia, a more confident Australia, an Australia finding its voice on an international stage. He saw Australia as having something to say on our own future, and it was a vision that he would share with many Australians new and old. To say that Gough had courage is an understatement. In a time when the world and even the Labor Party were heading in the other direction, Gough forged a path to China and led the way for many other countries—including the United States, which would follow one month after Gough
'
s historic visit to that country.




While Gough Whitlam could see the bigger picture on an international stage, he was also completely committed to domestic politics. He kept his promise to elevate the Office of Aboriginal Affairs to ministerial level once in government. Under Gough Whitlam the Senate was extended to include representatives from the territories. Cyclone Tracy struck in 1974—I am sure he was not responsible, but he was certainly there at the time. He also reformed and changed the Australian honours system. It was established to replace the British honours 
system. The first enactment of the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act took place. The evacuation of Australian and US troops from Saigon took place. The Racial Discrimination Act was enacted and outlawed discrimination on the basis of race. There was the first Family Law Act. And there was the handover, very significantly, of Wattie Creek at 
Daguragu 
in the Northern Territory to Vincent Lingiari of the 
Gurindji 
people—just to name a few of the more historic changes made by Gough Whitlam and his government. But for Gough, all of these reforms were just part of a relentless drive to contribute and to drag Australia and the Labor Party out of the past and into the future—and that he did very, very successfully.


Everyone has a story about Gough Whitlam; inevitably they all involve some humour, some funny story, some great anecdote—elements of the great wit that the man possessed and usually a whole range of elements brought together that just showed the complexity of the person that he was. For me it was the first phone call that I received in my office. Not long after being elected to parliament, having made a speech in parliament, I got back up to my office and my staff told me that there was a gentleman on the phone who claimed to be Gough Whitlam. I answered the phone to hear that very familiar voice and he quickly told me that he had been listening in on proceedings of parliament, heard my speech, appreciated all of the things I said, but gave me some frank and fearless advice on how I could have said them better. I do not recall all of the detail of what my speech was about, but I do very warmly recall the fact that he took the time—obviously not just to listen to my speeches and contributions here but to also listen to so many members of parliament. It is legendary that up until maybe just very recently he was still reading the Hansard. He still took an interest in the daily politics of Australian life; he still took an interest in what this place did, what it said, what it meant for the Australian people.


I also very fondly recall his visit to Ipswich not so long ago to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the town hall. He was welcomed back to Ipswich almost as a son of Ipswich. He was welcomed in a way that only celebrities and pop stars normally are—all the pomp and the ceremony for a person of his standing in the community. But for all the noise and the fanfare on that day, and the long and detailed speech that is customary at any place that Gough attended, what really stood out for me was his generosity—he was generous with his time with every single person that approached him; he always gave his autograph and there was always a seemingly endless line-up of well-wishers who wanted their photo taken with the great man. Even more fascinating was his ability to recall mayors or councillors or details of things that happened 30 years before—recall in detail little elements about individual people, their families, their histories and their stories. For this and probably many other reasons, people always felt this really deep, warm connection to Gough. 


There is no doubt he has had a great impact on so many people in this place—regardless of their politics, regardless of their own ideology or their own view of the world, Gough had an impact. It often brings a smile to people's faces—when you mention his name it triggers a little memory, and always a good memory. Gough, you have left us a much better place, a better people and a better country for your service—service in the military, in the RAAF, which has been talked about so much; service to the country in terms of public service; and service to the Labor Party in reforming the party and giving it an opportunity to lead this country and participate at a greater level. You have certainly served us all very well. My condolences to the Whitlam family for their loss. May he rest in peace.

Ms VAMVAKINOU
 (Calwell) (11:09):  I begin by associating myself with the contributions made by many of my colleagues on the passing of Gough Whitlam. I offer my condolences firstly to the Whitlam family—they have lost a father and grandfather—and of course the Australian Labor Party and indeed the broader community have lost a significant and indeed iconic figure. One cannot reflect on the life and times of Gough Whitlam without making reference to the other half of the Whitlam whole—his life's partner, Margaret Whitlam, who passed away a couple of years ago. This was Australia's power couple akin to the Roosevelts, Eleanor and Franklin Delano, and I thought that when I met the Whitlams for the first time as a 16-year-old schoolgirl during that dramatic period after 11 November 1975. The passage of time has only reaffirmed my belief that Gough and Margaret Whitlam were truly a marriage of true minds.


It is often said that everyone remembers where they were on the day that the Whitlam government was dismissed by the Governor-General, Sir John Kerr. I remember where I was. I was in class, year 11 at Princes Hill High School, and I remember the uproar in our entire school community; students and teachers alike were absolutely outraged and took to the school quadrangle, as opposed to the streets. This marked the beginning, I believe, of my own political activism. Like everyone else around me at the time I felt—such was the feeling at the time—that I had to do something. I very much wanted to be a part of the dramatic events that were unfolding. The public wrath was palpable as Australians faced what many consider to be the closest we are yet to come to a coup d'etat. So I joined the Migrant Workers Committee at the Victorian Trades Hall Council and I ended up working as a volunteer on the election campaign to re-elect the Whitlam government in the 1975 federal election. Of course, I could say that the rest is history. 


When I became the candidate for the federal seat of Calwell in 2001, I wrote to Gough inviting him to launch my campaign. Quite to my surprise, and as a colleague said previously, he rang me and he actually greeted me in the Greek language. This voice on the other end of the phone said 'Tia sou ti kaneis', and I immediately recognised it as Gough Whitlam's voice. I was very surprised that he would greet me in the Greek language at the time—but not really surprised, as I will mention later.


I invited Gough because I had discovered that the last function he had officiated at as Prime Minister of Australia was the opening of the Broadmeadows Sporting Club, in my electorate. We thought at the time it was a great idea to invite him to make a return visit to Broadmeadows—unfortunately he was unable to do so because he could not travel at that time. But he was very gracious with his time and, as always, with advice. He had a propensity to give a lot of advice and to correct a lot of records. I know the people of Broadmeadows remain very chuffed that they are a small footnote in a very important historical event. He informed me that after Broadmeadows Sporting Club he went to the Melbourne Town Hall, and of course the next day he came to Canberra, where he was dismissed. 


If Arthur Calwell laid the foundations for modern Australia, Gough Whitlam, as Australia's 21st Prime Minister, was the architect of the contemporary Australian identity. To this end I want to reflect on his very special relationship with migrant Australia, or the New Australians as he often referred to them. Gough Whitlam envisaged an Australia that was reconciled with its first people, our Indigenous Australians—and of course there is that memorable photograph of Gough with Vincent Lingiari. He gave hope for reconciliation and paved the way for native title. Gough Whitlam embraced the new Australians that came here, my family and I included, in a way that gave us a sense of ownership and belonging, a gesture that would become the driving principles of access and equity which underlined multiculturalism—a policy that the Whitlam government not only championed but also implemented during that period of great reform. 


It is indeed a privilege for me to be given the opportunity to speak in this condolence motion as the member for Calwell. The sense of fate and history does not escape me at this moment, because the 16-year-old schoolgirl of 1975 would never have imagined that she would be here today in the House of Representatives. It is a very important moment, when you look back in time.


Universal health, free education, land rights, the Racial Discrimination Act, ending conscription, legal aid, no-fault divorce, pension reform, multiculturalism and a new national anthem are some of the most iconic policies that characterised the Whitlam government, but it is Gough's relationship with new Australians that I want to reflect on here today and in particular his relationship with the Australian Greek community. It was a very special relationship. Gough Whitlam was a philhellene in every sense of the word. Gough once said:


… there can be no doubt that the Greek language is important in Australia, and that Greek civilization is important to Australia.


Gough became very involved in the Greek Australian community. From advocating for the return of democracy to its original birthplace during the seven-year dictatorship of the 1960s and early 1970s to supporting Australian peacekeeping forces in Cyprus and advocating for the return of the Parthenon marbles he was indeed a true friend of Greece and the Australian Greek community.


He was patron of the Antipodes Festival in Melbourne for many years. He was an honorary member of the Greek Orthodox Community of Sydney and NSW. He was a recipient of the Hellenic republic's highest honour—the Order of the Phoenix—for services to Hellenism. As my constituent Kostandinos Tsourdalakis, the cantor of our local Greek orthodox church, said in the 18-stanza Homeric prose he wrote on the occasion of Gough's passing last week, Gough was 'the Greek community's second father'. I am absolutely certain that Gough would love Mr Tsourdalakis's 18-stanza Homeric epic tribute to him. I wish I could read it out in the chamber today, but I think I would be trying the patience of Hansard considerably.


The affection new Australians held for Gough is captured by what my late father always used to say to me. During the 1975 campaign at a rally in Melbourne, Gough walked by my father, stopped and shook his hand. My father always described this as the moment an Australian Prime Minister had embraced him as a fellow Australian. There is no denying that Australia is a better place today because of Gough Whitlam.

Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (11:17):  I am saddened but proud to speak in honour of a man who has made such a significant contribution to the wellbeing of our nation: the Hon. Edward Gough Whitlam AC, QC—11 July 1916 to 21 October 2014. There is much to admire about Edward Gough Whitlam's life: his service with the RAAF as a flight lieutenant, his transformation of the political landscape in Australia, his wit and his great love affair with Margaret. Despite these many contributions, it is his reforms to the law that have left the greatest impression on me as a lawyer. Gough's legacy remains in many of the important laws that underpin civil society today.


None of us arrive in this House from a vacuum, not even Gough. We are all shaped by our early lives and the families that mould us. Gough's father, Harry Frederick Ernest Whitlam, was a very bright young man who topped his school; however, his family did not have the financial means to send him to university so he joined the Commonwealth Public Service and studied at night to obtain a law degree. Gough's dad went on to have a brilliant career as the Crown Solicitor and as a human rights lawyer at the United Nations. That struggle for a university education would shape Gough. Also Gough's father-in-law, Wilfred Dovey KC, was a successful barrister and a judge who presided over many divorce and matrimonial cases back in the bad old days of divorce.


Gough's most enduring partnership, and perhaps his greatest influence, was Margaret. I use the term 'partnership' deliberately because that is obviously what it was. Margaret was very much an equal part of that relationship. She was a modern woman for the times and had very progressive views. During her time in the Lodge she was a very strong vocal supporter of women's rights.


These three family stories would shape the Whitlam government's agenda. Gough was, of course, a barrister, admitted to the New South Wales bar in 1947. Coincidentally, one of his chamber mates was Sir John Kerr, but that is enough about him. Gough took silk in 1962. Gough's progressive legal reforms shaped the way we live in Australia today. Gough said when he spoke at Old Parliament House in 2002 that he tried to apply an overarching principle and unifying theme to all of his work which he said could be stated in two words: 'contemporary relevance'. While that theme can be identified in his legal reforms, it seems to me that there is a far simpler theme that also persists in his legal reforms: to improve the lives of every Australian—and Gough most certainly achieved that.


When the Racial Discrimination Act was introduced it had monumental benefits for Indigenous people. No longer could they be discriminated against in employment, working conditions, remuneration or housing—issues that had long been problematic for Indigenous communities. This groundbreaking legislation overrode Queensland legislation at the time which restricted the property rights of Aboriginal people and provided inequitable legal representation for them. As ridiculous as it sounds today in 2014, before the Migration Act was amended by the Whitlam government in 1973—so in my lifetime—Indigenous people had to apply for special permission before they could leave Australia.


Other significant pieces of Whitlam legislation include the first Commonwealth legislation to grant land rights to Indigenous people; legislation to abolish the death penalty for federal crimes; legislation for equal pay for women; the Health Insurance Commission Act and the Health Insurance Act that created Medicare; the Family Law Act, which changed the way people divorced and made leaving a bad relationship far less painful than previously and enshrined the principle of the 'best interests of the child' so that children's rights are prioritised in any decision concerning them; and the Seas and Submerged Lands Act in 1973, which gave the Commonwealth authority over the states in any issues relating to the seas surrounding Australia—a piece of legislation that basically created the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park down the track and thwarted Joh Bjelke-Petersen's plan to have mining on the Great Barrier Reef.


Gough Whitlam's government ratified some of the most significant international human rights agreements including the 1953 Convention on the Political Rights of Women, the 1966 International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the 1966 International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees. Not only did Gough enact some of the most groundbreaking legal reforms in Australia; he also established the Australian Law Reform Commission. There is no point in having legislation that provides justice if ordinary Australians have no access to it, so what did Gough Whitlam do? He created the Australian Legal Aid Office. 


In 1985, on the 10th anniversary of the dismissal, Gough Whitlam delivered the John Curtin Memorial Lecture. He said during the speech: 


A conservative government survives essentially by dampening expectations and subduing hopes. We, by contrast, exist to raise hopes and expectations—to lift the horizons of the people.


Hopes were raised and so were expectations during Gough Whitlam's term in office. We would never see Australia and our futures in the same way again that we did before he was elected. We as a nation were forever changed for the better, and I will devote myself to lifting those horizons for all, not just a few. 


Gough enjoyed a long life. He also enjoyed many friendships, as we have heard in the contributions from both sides of the chamber. As the member for Moreton, I am well acquainted with his friendship with one of my esteemed predecessors Sir James Killen. I have actually heard quite a few stories from Lady Killen because I see her every year when she gives out the James Killen community service award in my electorate. Although James Killen and Gough Whitlam were on opposite sides of politics, their friendship continued until Sir James died in 2007. In fact, they telephoned each other most Sundays, and there are many stories about the notes they frequently passed back and forward during parliamentary sittings, often to the dismay of their colleagues. 


In fact, Gough Whitlam gave the eulogy on behalf of the Killen family at Sir James Killen's funeral. Sir James describes in his book Inside Australian Politics an encounter in his parliamentary office when Gough was the leader and was particularly upset with a colleague. The colleague wanted to attend the funeral of a former Labor minister, but his name had not been called in the ballot to determine who would attend. Gough was frustrated at being put in this position and Sir James, who was Minister for Defence at the time and charged with organising the flights for the mourners to attend the funeral, was attempting to calm him down. Sir James Killen said to Gough, 'What do you want to happen when you die?' Gough took a deep breath and said, 'I just want you to get up and say, ""Let the Senate be his pyre.""' Gough understood history and timelessness. The previous member for Moreton is not here to farewell his great friend, but we who are who are left behind shall do our best to keep the Whitlam legacy alive. Edward Gough Whitlam: may he rage in peace.

Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (11:25):  Today we pay tribute to Edward Gough Whitlam, QC, AC: patriot, veteran, barrister, Prime Minister, ambassador, Australian legend, husband to Margaret and father to Antony, Nick, Stephen and Catherine. We pass on our condolences to his family and all who knew and loved him.


Throughout the course of this discussion we have seen the best of the Australian parliament. We have seen the outflowing of genuine affection and admiration for a great Australian, and I believe in this discussion we have genuinely held up a mirror to the Australian nation. Gough himself was more than a reflection of Australia as he found it. He was a leader who gave political voice to Australia not as he found it, but as he thought it could be. As Gough himself explained in 1973, his government was elected on the basis of policies which were developed carefully, steadily and intelligently to meet the important demands of our community.


His was the politics of courage and conviction. Indeed it is hard to imagine Australia without the reforms that were driven through by the Whitlam government. In the area of equality, we turn our minds to the reforms to the education system: free access to tertiary education and needs-based funding for our school system. In the area of electoral reform: one vote, one value; lowering the age of voting so that the age of voting was the same as the age at which you could be conscripted to go and fight for the country—the age of 18. In the area of gender equality, we have heard many speakers talk about the importance of his family law reforms: no-fault divorce, introducing onto the PBS the contraceptive pill and reopening the equal pay case to ensure that that important principle could flow through to our industrial tribunals. In the area of land rights: ensuring that the First Australians could once again have full custodial ownership of their traditional lands. On race discrimination, one of his first acts was to ban race-based sporting contests, which was an incredibly controversial issue in the early 1970s, and we all remember the controversy around the Springbok tour. It went beyond that, he was indeed the father of modern multiculturalism.


As previous speakers have talked about, the concession of Australia to a raft of international treaties laid the platform for a broad sweep of reforms, legislative and otherwise, in areas as diverse as industrial relations, heritage and conservation; and sex and disability discrimination. Not all of this was achieved in his term, but for him it would not have been achieved. 


We are currently gripped in a debate around paid maternity leave, but Australians first enjoyed the right to paid maternity leave through the reforms of Gough Whitlam and his industrial relations minister Clyde Cameron. It was Whitlam and Cameron who also introduced a great reform which ensured that when Australians today go on holidays they enjoy four weeks annual leave and not three weeks annual leave. It was the Whitlam government which extended annual leave entitlements and provided an annual leave loading to ensure that when working class families took leave they could afford to go on a holiday. Extending the long service leave provisions was another one of his important industrial reforms. 


Often overlooked when we recount the contribution of the Whitlam government to modern Australia were his economic reforms. It was Whitlam who introduced the Trade Practices Act and started the process of reforming our tariff system and opened up our diplomatic and trade relations with China, which are so much a part of our modern trading relationship and our economic success.


An important lesson of the Whitlam government, a lesson that must be heeded by all of us who occupy a place in the 43rd Parliament is this: you cannot do in government that which you have specifically disavowed in opposition. Indeed, you must use those years in opposition well and this is something that the Whitlam government did. Gough Whitlam spent plenty of time in opposition. He was first elected at the age of 36 in the Werriwa by-election in 1952, and he often remarked that his brilliant career in local government was cut short by the Werriwa by-election. He did not see government for another 20 years—20 years in opposition, 20 years of doing the hard slog of reforming the party, reforming the policy so it was fit to govern in modern Australia and ensuring that he had a vision which was right the government when he eventually achieved government in 1972. It was time; that was true—but it was Gough that made that possible.


In August this year, we celebrated the 40th anniversary of the first and only joint sitting of this parliament under the deadlock provisions of the Australian Constitution—the deadlock provisions designed to ensure that when the House of Representatives passes a bill which is blocked successively by the Senate, there is a means of resolving that. In the case of the August 1974 joint sitting of parliament, central to that sitting was the Medibank legislation. When that legislation was first introduced into parliament, Gough spoke on the bill in December 1973 and he had this to say:


We propose a universal health scheme, based on the needs and means of families. This proposal—the most rigorously investigated proposal ever put by any party on any subject at any election—has to be seen against the contrast of the existing scheme, unwieldy, unjust, enormously costly, inherently costly.


He said to those who opposed it and who forced the government to a double dissolution:


Let the warning be quite clear: if Liberals propose next week to prop up, patch over, the existing scheme, it will mean more in contributions and more in taxation for everybody. Let's have a clean sweep.


All those words remain true today.


When you ask what motivated Gough Whitlam to introduce the Medibank legislation, something which is now an article of faith on this side of the House, you need look no further than his own words. He had this to say:


I personally find quite unacceptable a system whereby the man who drives my Commonwealth car in Sydney pays twice as much for the same family cover as I have, not despite the fact that my income is 4 or 5 times higher than his, but precisely because of my higher income.


These values find an echo in the 43rd Parliament.


In America they call it the 'Kennedy moment'; in Australia it is the 'Whitlam moment'. Every Australian knows where they were on 11 November 1975. He inspired a generation of political activism, he is a reference point for all who follow, and today we pay tribute to a great Australian.

"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,2014-10-28,"



Mr FITZGIBBON
 (Hunter) (11:33):  How does one sufficiently and comprehensively pay tribute to the great EG Whitlam in five minutes? The reality is one does not. One could not possibly hope to. You would need at least 20 and then, of course, that would not be enough. But I say 20 because I think we need to talk about Gough through four lenses: first, Gough the Prime Minister; second, Gough the parliamentarian; third, Gough the party member—that is the Labor Party member and party leader; and, fourth, Gough the human being—and an honest, compassionate man he was, dedicated to it equity and social justice not only in this country but right around the world.


Gough was by any measure one of Australia's greatest Prime Ministers. The history of the federation, I have  no doubt, will treat him well. Just as well-known were the myths, particularly around Gough's economic management. It is very true to say that Gough came to office just as the long boom was coming to a close. There has been much talk about the December 72 OECD report, which pays testament to that proposition. He also faced two very significant oil shocks and came to office at a time when the EU was enlarging and all the consequences that had for the nation's economy. I should say he was a stickler for Treasury advice and followed Treasury advice almost always. In amongst all of that he also saw a need for economic reform and began to dismantle the then out dated and economically destructive tariff system, which was make making Australia so inefficient, and, in doing so, paved the way for further economic reform and further economic restructuring.


To save time, I am going to take the second and third together—Gough the parliamentarian and Gough the party member and party leader. This is Gough's biggest legacy. Gough used the forms of the parliament from opposition to drag that then coalition government to new reforms—matters that would have been resisted otherwise if it was not for the advocacy skills of Gough Whitlam. Gough always also brought the Labor Party into the modern era, making it electable again after more than two decades in the wilderness—and it was not easy at all. He took on entrenched factional interests, faced expulsion from the party at one stage for his efforts, but, with true Gough Whitlam determination and courage, he stood up to the factional masters and those who had created their fiefdoms within their party at the expense of the party and took the party forward.


Fourth of course is Gough the man. I am one of many in this place who can say that I was honoured and privilege to know Gough and to know Gough well. I did not know Gough well when he was Prime Minister; I was only 10 or 12 years of age. I do recall meeting him at a nursing home opening in my town of Bellingen when I was around 12 years of age, which excited me somewhat, but it was in his later years that I got to know Gough well.


What always stands out for me is that—despite his public persona, his exaggerated public persona—Gough was not interested at any time in talking about Gough or his legacies. The great man was far more interested in talking about the Labor Party and how it was going—the future of the country. And more particularly he was interested in talking about me; he was far more interested to know how I was going than he was interested in talking about where he had been. 


He encouraged me to study more, for example—some advice I followed. Although I must admit that, having been persuaded by him to begin a law degree, I did not finish that law degree. I think I was at about the halfway point at the time. But his advice was appreciated and his ongoing interest in my progress through that university degree was also appreciated. 


I would like to share one small anecdote. I very fondly recall being contacted when I was Defence Minister by my good friend and Gough's son, Nick, to inquire as to whether there were any Ventura bombers that were still airworthy in the country; the family was starting to think about Gough's farewell and they thought if a Ventura was still airworthy it might have made a nice touch as a fly-past at his farewell. 


There was something unique about Gough and his art for both self-deprecation and self-praise. He could talk himself up in a way which most people could not get away with. Gough got away with it, because amongst all of his other fantastic attributes, he had a very sharp wit and a very good sense of humour. He will be missed by many. He had a very good innings; at 98, he had a full life, almost unchallenged by anyone else in Australia's political history. He will be missed by many. I will certainly miss him. What he did for his country he can be very proud of. Certainly, his family can be very proud of him, and I again extend my sympathies to his family.

"Watts, Tim, MP",ALP,2014-10-28,"



Mr WATTS
 (Gellibrand) (11:39):  Where to start in paying tribute to Gough Whitlam? Given the stature of the man, particularly as an orator and a wit, it is impossible not to feel inadequate to the task. Many members on this side of the House will pay tribute to the pantheon of Gough's achievements, initiatives that changed lives and changed our nation. I want to narrow my focus and pay tribute in this House to the way that Gough changed the Labor Party. Over the preceding week we have seen the history wars play out, both in this chamber and in the broader community about the meaning of Gough's legacy to Australia. Given the nature of his times and his leadership, it  would be disappointing if this was not the case. 


But we should always remember that Gough was nothing if not a moderniser. The sine qua non of Gough's achievements, the achievement that made all of the rest possible, was the way he changed the Labor Party. Gough Whitlam changed the Labor Party from an inwards looking, sectarian, ideologically obsessed movement into an outwards looking party, focused on the practical measures needed to both secure government and to increase the standards of living of Australians in our cities, suburbs and regions. In this respect, many of Gough's greatest achievements were chalked up during his time as opposition leader. 


On this side of the House, we should acknowledge that the rigid, resistant orthodoxies that Gough confronted, the ideological intransigence that he crashed through, was just as often located on this side of the House. Indeed, his description of his leadership style as 'crash or crash through' was made not in reference to Fraser's obstructionism, but to the 1960s Labor Party's resistance to the change that he sought to bring, an intransigence that saw one of my predecessors, Hec McIvor, spend his entire 17 year career in this place in opposition. 


Gough was an extraordinary individual, the likes of which we will probably never again see in this place, but the reason that he was so transformative for Australia, was because the Labor Party had been so bad for so long.   We had failed Australia for decades before Gough ushered in three years of glorious change. Gough gave the 1967 Victorian Labor Party conference the defining articulation of the Labor Party's reason for being. He reminded us of our mission: to change the country for the working man. He told us that we were not founded to be a protest group. He said: 'The men who formed the Labor Party in the 1890s knew all about power. They were not ashamed to seek it and they were not embarrassed when they won it.' 


At this time—the late 1960s, early 1970s—the idea that Gough would be remembered today as a paragon of ideological purity would have been laughable. Gough was bigger than the received ideological orthodoxy of his time. He understood that, unlike the Tories, no Labor opposition has ever been elected off the back of the same ideological agendas as the preceding Labor government. Gough understood better than anyone that Labor must always be a party that is relevant to contemporary times, relevant to the lives and aspirations of contemporary Australians, not engaged in byzantine ideological navel gazing and internal sectarianism. That is the reason Labor won government in 1972, and that is the reason we are remembering his achievements today. For that reason, the thing that I will always remember above all about Gough Whitlam was that he was nothing if not a moderniser. You can say whatever else about him, but that much will remain true. 


Because Gough meant so much to members of the Labor Party, I wanted to finish my contribution with some reflections from my branch members on the great man. In deference to the other members in this chamber I will limit myself to one story. Terry Cuddy, one of my branch members told me about a meeting he had with Gough in 1975:


Back in September 1975, I went to Canberra with a high school excursion from Melbourne. We were at ANU on the day, and Gough was set to arrive to deliver a speech. There had been protests about his government and there was a rowdy protest at the Uni by the Young Liberals. Scuffles were going on and there was a robust verbal tirade from the Tories. It was pissing down with rain, thunder and lightning. The word went around that Gough was unlikely to turn up. And then the car arrived, the clouds parted, the sun shone and the birds starting singing. Gough arrived. There were smiles all around, and cheers from everyone—including the Young Liberals.


And really this sums up Whitlam's broader impact on our nation. It was rainy in Australia, there was thunder and lightning, and then the clouds parted, the sun shone and the birds started singing. Gough arrived and there were smiles all around. Thanks Gough.

Dr CHALMERS
 (Rankin) (11:43):  I am proud to stand here in the House of Representatives to celebrate a great Australian life. I was also proud to mark Gough's passing with my colleagues last Tuesday as we walked down to pay tribute at Old Parliament House on the steps where Gough made such a famous declaration and where he did his work in the old House of Representatives just down the hill. I am also particularly honoured to be joined in the chamber today by two great branch members from the Rankin electorate, Jeanette and Kevin Condran, who are in the gallery today. They are branch members of longstanding. They are part of the mighty Logan North branch, one of the greatest branches of the Labor Party anywhere in the country if I may say so! But they also lived in Gough's electorate of Werriwa. They lived in Green Valley. When Gough was the member for Werriwa but before he was the Prime Minister they used to drink beer with him at the Mount Pritchard Workers Club in Gough's electorate. Jeanette was a steward for the ETU and Kevin for the AWU. They used to spend time with Gough when he was their MP and before he was our Prime Minister.


Gough Whitlam was a leader, of course, but he was more than that. We have had many leaders in Australia, and some of them have been great, but we have only ever had one Gough and we only ever will. I like to think of him as a sculptor: his leadership, an act of vision and creation—a sculptor who imagined a perfect outcome and who pushed and prodded and polished and scraped and sanded to make it a reality.


Like other sculptors, the big man's masterpieces were subject to the criticism of those with smaller minds and smaller motivations. Sculpting required him to get his hands dirty as well; he was not too good nor too pure for that. At times, his was an untidy creation. He built, not a statue, but a nation; Australia as we know it—more modern and more confident than the one it replaced; more assertive and yet at the same time more generous. It was not a statue that he sculpted, of course: not a monument but a movement—a mission—one that inches forward still today. It is a movement and a mission that finds new purpose: in constitutional recognition of our Indigenous brothers and sisters; in marriage equality; in an Australian republic; in equal pay for equal work; in universal health care; in affordable higher education; in needs based school funding; and whenever we need to maintain our rage and enthusiasm, and wherever one Australian is treated less fairly than another


There is hardly an aspect of the modern Australian nation that Whitlam did not play a role in imagining and creating. For everyone whose life he changed, for all of us called to politics and public service and for the change makers in so many other fields of endeavour, his mighty and distinctive voice will echo through the ages, just like the melodic and distinctive voice of Paul Kelly will. In his famous tribute, Kelly sings of Whitlam:


Eight years went by, eight long years of waiting


Till one day a tall stranger appeared in the land


And he came with lawyers and he came with great ceremony


And through Vincent's fingers poured a handful of sand


That is one of the truly great Australian songs—real goose bump material, and it is about Gough.


I was thinking of it on Saturday as I took part in the Walk Together event, which finished on Carmody Street in Woodridge in my electorate. You see, Kev Carmody was Paul Kelly's collaborator in the writing of that song, From little things big things grow. They wrote it together—two great Australian poets, one white, one black—and later they performed it together as well.


I stood there in the middle of that proud parade of multicultural Australia on Carmody Street, thinking of the nation Gough found and the one that he left: the nation I was born into the same year he retired from the House of Representatives. I did not properly meet him beyond a handshake or two at campaign launches and national Labor conferences. But he taught my generation and the generations that followed something very important: that you can love your country and still desperately want to change it. In fact, he taught us that changing your country is the ultimate act of patriotism when that change is well considered and well motivated.


He also taught us that politics can be entertaining but it should never be trivial. We have heard some really funny stories about Gough in this condolence motion. But most of all we have heard of his achievements: free of trivia, free of pettiness, free of day-to-day polls and political commentary. And in recognising Gough Whitlam's extraordinary and selfless life we recognise that he could have instead lived a life of anonymous and comfortable privilege. Nobody forced him to join the Air Force to serve, but he did. Nobody forced him to dedicate his life to others, but he did. Because when he surveyed the Australia of mid-century, when he grasped the 'Menzian torpor', as Keating described it, he knew what needed to be done. He sculpted a new nation. Every Australian is strengthened by that creation, that contribution, and by his life.


I can only imagine how proud his family are of him—we all are—as they lay the great man to rest in eternal peace.

"Gray, Gary, MP",ALP,2014-10-28,"



Mr GRAY
 (Brand) (11:50):  The death of Edward Gough Whitlam is a time to celebrate the aspirations that Gough brought to public life. Gough showed us that a political life can make a difference.


My first memory of Gough Whitlam is from television and radio in the late 1960s and early 1970s. I was in primary school in Whyalla, South Australia, living in state housing. My dad worked at the local steel works and my mum was a cleaner. We used to watch TV or listen to the radio just to hear Gough.


While the Gorton and McMahon governments were descending into chaos, Gough was calm, dominant and determined. He used humour to win arguments. He used scholarship to gain perspective. He learned from history and he taught great lessons. Gough's style, energy and agenda spoke to us and we listened.


Gough Whitlam's impact on Australian politics began with the renewal of his party. He gave confidence to the faithful that Labor could be more than a party of opposition and complaint. Gough listened, learned and built a framework for modern Australian politics. He broadened the appeal of Labor beyond the traditional union-working class base. And he prepared Labor for government, developing shadow ministers, policy agendas and a modern world view.


He had a legendary memory, I introduced my wife, Deborah Walsh, to him, he kissed Deb and asked how Rosalie was—Deb's mum—who Gough would have met some 20 years before. Gough was, indeed, a terrific politician.


Through 20 difficult years of division and opposition Whitlam built his program, piece by piece. A modern Australia was his program, his project and his passion. He used the parliament to effect great change and as Prime Minister he used government to implement that change. He introduced a system of universal health care, abolished university fees, recognised Aboriginal land rights, supported equal pay for women, embraced multiculturalism, cut tariffs and agricultural subsidies and he celebrated Australia's identity.


He was the first Australian prime minister to recognise the People's Republic of China. He met Chairman Mao and created the diplomatic trade ties that have underpinned our relationship with China today. Gough poured a handful of desert dirt into Vincent Lingiari's hand as a symbol of dignity, prior ownership and Aboriginal land rights. Gough understood the importance of images and the media. He rose to dominate the political landscape at a time when his presence was most needed. He reimagined the role of government in Australian society, and he did it all with incredible confidence.


His government was disrupted by the 1973 oil shock and instability in global commodity and currency markets around the world, and at home unemployment began to rise. His government was not his equal. My father-in-law, Peter Walsh, was a Labor senator elected in the 1974 double dissolution election. Peter said Gough's ministers let Gough down. They were not up to Gough's standards. This taught us all great lessons about governance, lessons that were learned by Hawke and Keating. Without Gough, there could not have been a Hawke or a Keating government. Australia is now more tolerant, fair and equal because of Gough Whitlam. Following the tumultuous sacking of the Whitlam government, Gough urged his supporters to maintain public order and protest at the ballot box. He was forever a democrat.


Gough's wife, Margaret, was his equal, his ballast and his partner. She would moderate, manage and support him. We loved Margaret. Peter Walsh told me once that Gough inspired great loyalty. He remembered walking with Gough through the corridors of Old Parliament House to the opposition party room that November day in 1975. 


In the middle 1980s, Gough was not fashionable in Labor circles. His book The Whitlam Government explained and defended his government. Eventually, Gough won that battle too, not just to be history but to tell it. Gough built his government and was the strength of that government. When it fell, he fought for it and he defended it against his opponents; he wrote its history and made it great. It is an epic story. 


In many ways, Gough was the kind of politician that we need to see more of: humorous, educated, enlightened, courageous, engaged, resilient and persistent. Gough was a leader for the ages, a leader who cared for the rights and dignity of Aboriginal Australians, a leader who understood Northern Australia, a leader who cared for the arts, a leader for ideas, a leader who made us proud to be Australian and a leader who, although he loved Australia, still wanted to see it changed. He was a leader who made us proud to be Labor.

"Dreyfus, Mark, MP",ALP,2014-10-28,"



Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Deputy Manager of Opposition Business) (11:54):  Gough Whitlam changed Australia for the better. There is no doubt that on any side of politics Gough Whitlam was one of the great leaders of our nation. He was a bold and courageous reformer in areas as diverse as health care, social policy, foreign policy, education and reconciliation with Indigenous Australia. Many of the excellent contributions on this condolence motion have covered these reforms. I want to speak about Whitlam's contributions to the law and to the arts.


Whitlam brought about great and sweeping reforms to the laws of our nation, establishing changes that have transformed public life in Australia and that are part of our lives today. These include the abolition of the death penalty, establishing the Law Reform Commission and the Institute of Criminology, and proposing the establishing of a general Federal Court. Working with his Attorney-General, Lionel Murphy, Whitlam also created the first national scheme of legal aid, which forms one of the pillars of access to justice in our country.


In 1975, Whitlam brought in the Racial Discrimination Act, a pioneering piece of legislation that embodies modern Australia's opposition to racism and bigotry. Whitlam also recognised the ongoing injustice being suffered by Indigenous Australians, and part of his government's response was to establish the Woodward royal commission into Aboriginal land rights in the Northern Territory. The reports of that royal commission paved the way for the Aboriginal land rights act. Whitlam also brought Australia's first legal action before the International Court of Justice, demanding that France cease its nuclear testing in the Pacific. He was successful in this, with the French government stopping atmospheric nuclear testing in the Pacific in 1974.


Somehow Whitlam also found the time to introduce national trade practices legislation and the Trade Practices Commission, while also helping to modernise family law, establishing no-fault divorce, authorising civil celebrants and, in 1975, enacting the Family Law Act. This list of major legal reforms is remarkable. It is remarkable for its breadth, it is remarkable for its boldness and it is remarkable for having been achieved in less than three years.


I also want to draw attention to Whitlam's contribution to the arts, because the arts and cultural policy were central to Whitlam's vision of Australia as a modern and confident nation, sure of its identity and its place in the world. He also saw, as with other areas of public policy, that the Australian government should have a central role in encouraging and promoting our arts and our culture. His 1972 policy speech, 'It's Time', proposed the establishment of a council to promote excellence in the arts, to expand access to the arts in the community, to help establish a distinctive Australian identity, and to promote Australian culture internationally. He also proposed a public lending right for authors and measures to increase Australian content in film, television and books.


Whitlam brought to the prime ministership a passionate belief in the importance of the arts. In The Whitlam Government, he wrote:


In any civilised community the arts and associated amenities must occupy a central place. Their enjoyment should not be seen as something remote from everyday life. Of all the objectives of my Government none had a higher priority than the encouragement of the arts, the preservation and enrichment of our cultural and intellectual heritage. Indeed I would argue that all the other objectives of a Labor Government - social reform, justice and equity in the provision of welfare services and educational opportunities - have as their goal the creation of a society in which the arts and the appreciation of spiritual and intellectual values can flourish. Our other objectives are all means to an end; the enjoyment of the arts is an end in itself.


In government, Whitlam established the Australian Film Commission and the Australia Council. He saw the Council as offering:


… the prospect of a broad policy for the national development of the arts within a streamlined administration providing independence from political pressures and safeguards against centralised and authoritarian tendencies.


This is a principle of arts administration that still holds good today. He began construction of the National Gallery and, in an audacious and hugely symbolic gesture, bought Jackson Pollock's Blue Poles as a statement of Australia's confidence of its place in world culture. 


Whitlam wanted the arts and our cultural heritage to be open and accessible to all. He established inquiries into the role and funding of museums and national collections, public libraries, the performing arts, and expanded the role of the National Library and introduced compensation for authors for the free loan of their books in public libraries, the Public Lending Right. As with so many other areas of public policy, Whitlam changed the way we think about the role of government for the arts and established the framework of arts policy that still exists today. Above all, he gave us the confidence and the support to speak as Australians and to tell our stories to ourselves and to the world.


Debate adjourned.

"Bishop, Julie, MP",LP,2014-10-28,"



Ms JULIE BISHOP
 (Curtin—Minister for Foreign Affairs) (12:00):  by leave—On 5 September of this year Prime Minister Abbott and India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi witnessed the signing of an agreement to pave the way for the supply of Australian uranium to India for its civilian nuclear power needs. I have pleasure in tabling this agreement, the Australia-India Nuclear Cooperation Agreement.


India is the world's largest democracy, an emerging Asian superpower, an influential regional power and a strategic partner for Australia. This agreement signals a maturing of the Indian and Australian bilateral relationship, which was upgraded to a strategic partnership in 2009 and which has continued to deepen and strengthen in so many respects since then. It is also a sign of our mutual confidence and trust in the relationship. Changes to international guidelines on nuclear supply to India in 2008, agreed by the 48 members of the Nuclear Suppliers Group, have opened the door to cooperation with India in the field of civil nuclear energy.


The 2008 Nuclear Suppliers Group decision was based on a number of significant commitments from India; commitments such as separating its civil and military activities; accepting International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards at its civil facilities; putting in place an IAEA additional protocol on safeguards with respect to civil nuclear facilities; continuing its moratorium on nuclear testing; and working with others towards conclusion of an international treaty to end the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and to prevent the spread of sensitive materials and technology.


In the years since 2008 India has met these commitments. India's additional protocol with the IAEA entered into force in July of this year. It has not undertaken any nuclear tests, and it is working with Australia and others to try to start negotiations on a Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty in the Conference on Disarmament.


Since 2009 India has progressively placed its civil nuclear facilities under IAEA safeguards, and plans that by the end of 2014 it will have completed that process—marking a clear separation of civil nuclear facilities from military programs. Were it not for the promise of increased international cooperation, India may have had little reason to move closer to the nonproliferation mainstream in this way.


As with each of Australia's 23 other nuclear cooperation agreements, the terms of this agreement tabled today commit India to ensure that all Australian uranium, and nuclear material derived from it, is used only for peaceful purposes and will remain within India's civil nuclear facilities. The IAEA applies safeguards at those facilities, which will ensure that nuclear material supplied to India by Australia will remain in peaceful civilian use only. In addition, India will ensure the security of Australian nuclear material in accordance with relevant broader international conventions and standards—the same conventions and standards that apply in Australia's dealings with other bilateral nuclear partners including the United States, Japan, Canada, and the EU.


Australia has a strong record on nuclear security. In the new agreement, both India and Australia have reaffirmed their respective commitments to ensuring that the use of nuclear energy is safe, well regulated and environmentally sound. India is party to the international Convention on Nuclear Safety and other nuclear safety treaties, and has supported international efforts to enhance nuclear safety following the Fukushima incident, including by inviting the IAEA to review aspects of India's national nuclear safety arrangements. Australia expects India will follow international best practice to ensure safety in its nuclear industry.


The Australia-India Nuclear Cooperation Agreement will provide a framework for greater cooperation between our countries on a broad range of nuclear-related areas, such as nuclear safety, production of radioisotopes and regulatory and technological advances in the nuclear fuel cycle. A senior officials' level dialogue between Australia and India on nuclear nonproliferation and disarmament, covering a wide range of issues including nuclear doctrine, disarmament and nonproliferation and export controls, offers a valuable opportunity to better understand and influence India's policies in these areas.


Australia steadfastly supports nonproliferation and disarmament and our policy towards India is aligned with other major uranium suppliers in the Nuclear Suppliers Group. The terms of the nuclear cooperation agreement also align with Australia's uranium export requirements and will ensure our supply of uranium to India is consistent with Australia's international nonproliferation objectives and obligations.


Exports of uranium to India will not commence until the agreement is brought into force and the administrative arrangement that will allow us to implement the agreement has been settled. The administrative arrangement will cover technical aspects, including the processes required to account for all Australian nuclear material in India. For Australia, nuclear cooperation with India provides an opportunity to increase exports and employment over the longer term. India is already an important trade partner with two-way trade worth around $16 billion.


Australia has a hard won reputation as a reliable, cost-effective supplier of energy and India is a large and growing market. It is estimated that by 2015 India will be the world's third largest emitter of carbon dioxide and its primary energy needs will double by 2030.  Nuclear power is an important part of India's energy mix to help it reduce its carbon emissions and to provide it with the secure supply of power it needs to underpin its ongoing economic development. Australia is well placed to provide India with a significant proportion of its growing uranium needs.


Given that nuclear energy is a zero-emissions source of baseload power, I expect support for this treaty from across the political divide. The embrace of nuclear power will enable India to contribute to the reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions.


The completion of this agreement is one of many areas in which the government continues to strengthen our ties with India. Cooperation under the agreement, together with the development of a strong dialogue with India on nuclear nonproliferation and disarmament, will reinforce the nonproliferation commitments that India has made in recent years, help bring it further into the international nonproliferation mainstream and enable Australia and India to build an enduring bilateral relationship.


I present a copy of the Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of India on Cooperation in the Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy, the national interest analysis on the agreement and a copy of my ministerial statement.


I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the member for Brand to speak for 7½ minutes.


Leave granted.

"Gray, Gary, MP",ALP,2014-10-28,"



Mr GRAY
 (Brand) (12:08):  I thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs for tabling this document. Today is a good day. This is a good agreement and it is the culmination of a decade of hard work that spans both sides of this parliament, a decade of hard work that spans many foreign ministers and prime ministers, a decade of hard work that has resulted in an agreement between Australia and India to not only allow the sale of Australian uranium to India but to do it through a better and stronger bilateral agreement than that which would otherwise have been available under the NNPT. Successive foreign ministers and prime ministers of both countries are to be greatly congratulated.


In just a few weeks, our parliament will be graced by a historic visit from India's Prime Minister, Mr Modi. He will speak to our parliament, and it is a good thing that he speaks to our parliament after we have, with good grace, completed this important piece of work. This important piece of work is not only helpful for Australia's trade relationship but extremely important for India's development. The great agenda which Prime Minister Modi has for the Indian people is an agenda for growth and wealth creation and an agenda to lift people from poverty and to give them better lives. Prime Minister Modi will achieve that by increasing electricity production in India. He will achieve that through a nuclear reactor build that will provide power for hundreds of millions of Indian families. He will do that to help Indian families to warm their homes in winter and to cook and chill their food. This nuclear reactor build will drive industry, drive jobs, create wealth and create better lives. 


This is not simply a good agreement because it allows Australian uranium to be sold to India; it is actually an important part of an agenda which the government of India has to create better lives for all of its people. As such, this piece of work is not simply about a trade relationship; it is what we are all about. Australia is by any measure an energy superpower. We do not provide energy just to our neighbours in North Asia; we are one of the world's significant suppliers of uranium. But we are also more than that. We are partners in nuclear cooperation, in developing better industry and better standards in the countries with which we trade and with which we have partnerships. This cooperation agreement does just that. 


In 2011 and 2012, when the former federal government began a long process of aligning its internal Labor Party processes to allow for the proper facilitation of this agreement, it took the great courage of former Prime Minister Gillard to bring the Labor Party platform to a point where it could happily, and in an inclusive way, embrace this agreement. Great diplomatic agreements, as significant as they are and as enduring as they should be, are built on pragmatic and practical local management politics. 


Before agreeing to export uranium to India as a strategic partner for Australia, we needed to have commitments and responsible actions to support nuclear nonproliferation—and Australia obtained those assurances. We required that the agreement be consistent with international guidelines on nuclear supply and that it provided an acceptable basis for peaceful nuclear cooperation. In response to that the government of Australia was always prepared to negotiate the provision of Australian uranium.


Australia's existing stringent bilateral safeguards agreements with other countries specify that our uranium and the nuclear material derived from it must be used exclusively for peaceful purposes in civilian nuclear fuel cycles—and that is what this agreement does. Australian uranium and the nuclear material derived from it is also protected in accordance with strict internationally agreed standards for its physical security. These agreements ensure that countries to which Australia agrees to sell its uranium are committed to International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards and international nuclear security standards. Under those agreements countries receiving uranium must also report on their use of Australian nuclear material and seek Australian consent for any enrichment, reprocessing or third-party transfer.


This agreement allows for these critical elements to be in place. A bilateral nuclear safeguards agreement with India imposes high standards. It ensures that Australian uranium remains solely used for peaceful purposes. It ensures that Australian uranium will help burn the lights, support industry, cook meals, generate a better standard of living for generations yet to come in India. It ensures that our mines in South Australia, in the Northern Territory—hopefully soon in Western Australia—will be suppliers of safe uranium for safe and peaceful purposes, with a lower carbon footprint than fossil fuel burning, with a better industrial profile than other environmental fuels available in India, and with the capacity to provide baseload power to the world's most populous democracy.


We stand here today at the culmination of nearly a decade of effort that spans the combined wisdom and concentration of former Prime Minister Howard, Prime Minister Rudd, Prime Minister Gillard and, of course, today, Prime Minister Abbott. To have this agreement book-ended, if you will, in just a few days' time with the appearance in this chamber of India's Prime Minister, Mr Modi, is a good thing—a good thing for this agreement and a good thing for the way in which our nations have worked together to produce this agreement, which will not just endure but will strengthen our relationships and make industrial development in India safer, better and cleaner. I commend this agreement to the House.

That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Project AIR7000 Phase 2B—Maritime Patrol Aircraft Replacement Project.


The Department of Defence is proposing to provide new facilities, upgraded infrastructure and airfield works to support the introduction of the new Boeing P-8A Poseidon aircraft. The AP-3C Orion has served the Australian Defence Force well but due to its age is difficult to continue to support and its systems are facing obsolescence. It will be replaced by the new P-8A Poseidon aircraft with the first aircraft scheduled to be delivered in late 2016. New facilities are required in order to support the new aircraft.


The facilities will be at the Main Operating Base, Royal Australian Air Force Base Edinburgh; and forward operating bases RAAF bases Darwin, Pearce and Townsville. The project will also refurbish the existing torpedo maintenance facility and new explosive ordnance storage facilities at HMAS Stirling. Facilities located at the other bases will provide logistic support for aircraft deployments and explosive ordnance storage.


The proposed works will support Australia's advanced maritime intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and response capability. The estimated cost of the project is $707.9 million, excluding GST. This includes provision for management and design, construction, furniture, fittings and equipment, contingencies and escalation. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is scheduled to commence in late 2015 and is planned to be completed on all sites by late 2020. I commend the motion to the House.

"Coleman, David, MP",LP,2014-10-28,"



Mr COLEMAN
 (Banks) (12:41):  I am pleased to continue my remarks on this important piece of legislation and this important area of public policy. What I want to do in my remarks today is to bust a few myths in relation to health policy and talk about the important changes encompassed in the Private Health Insurance Amendment Bill. I will also talk about the financial situation that the government confronts, not only in health policy but in policy more generally because of the extreme waste of the previous government. Broadly, the government inherited, a fiscal mess—high levels of debt growing very rapidly. It is incumbent upon the government to address that debt and deficit situation, which we are doing, in a sensible and purposeful fashion right across the board in government spending. Indeed, we are returning the budget to near balance within four years and, importantly, investing in areas that require public investment, such as health, in a substantial way. So we want to get the budget back on track, back to a near surplus situation, while at the same time investing in health and other areas.


Let us go to some of the numbers to demonstrate the gravity of the fiscal situation we confront. When Labor came into office there was $50 billion in the bank, no debt at all and no interest payments—because you do not pay interest when you do not have any debt. Over the six sorry years of Labor administration we saw a consistent overspend—deficits of $27 billion, $55 billion, $48 billion, $43 billion and $19 billion, culminating in $50 billion in 2013-14, based on the previous budget. They are very consistent high levels of debt. We will recall that one of the excuses given for this financial mismanagement was that revenue had collapsed—there was this thing called the GFC, which of course was a very convenient excuse for the previous government. It was pretty much trotted out in virtually all situations but it was certainly trotted out as a reason why running these huge deficits on a continuing basis was unavoidable.


The problem with that excuse is that government revenue under Labor actually rose very strongly. In 2008-09, the first full year of the previous government, government receipts were $289 billion; in 2013-14, the last year they were in government, they were $361 billion; and in FY13 they were $348 billion. So over that six-year period government revenue rose by 25 per cent and in fact averaged an increase of 4.5 per cent every year—the compound annual growth rate, as it is called. So government revenue did not go down at all, with the exception of 2009-10 where it did pause momentarily; it went up very substantially. It went up in 2010-11 by six per cent, in 2011-12 by 10 per cent and in 2012-13 by another six per cent. These were very substantial increases.


So there really is no excuse for not being able to make the expenditure match the revenue, but that is of course what happened. As a consequence we have a very big debt that we must address. This government, therefore, has to take a different approach. We cannot sleepwalk into the future, pretend everything is okay and go on running up deficits of tens of billions of dollars every year. We will not do that. So what we have laid out in a methodical and detailed fashion is a plan that gets the budget back on track. The plan means that by 2017-18 there will be a deficit of just $3 billion, so next to nothing in the context of a $460 billion organisation. We have done that by making sensible changes to government expenditure right across the board. Obviously there have been changes in areas such as foreign aid, where we have quarantined some of the larger increases that were planned.


Obviously the principal focus of the discussion today is health. As I said, the government has provided for a situation which gets the budget back under control and gets it back broadly to a surplus while at the same time the government has provided for significant increased investment in health. It is absolutely not the case that government expenditure in health is declining; in fact, it is increasing quite substantially. So the health budget was $64 billion in 2013-14 and will go up to $79 billion in 2017-18. That works out to be an average increase in health expenditure over the next four years of about five per cent. That is a very important point. Health investment is not going down; it is going up and going up at a very solid rate.


There are a number of different areas in which the government invests in health care but the three biggest are Medicare and dental services—they are sometimes treated separately but for the purposes of this it is probably easier to treat them together—assistance to the states for hospitals and the PBS, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, which provides subsidised drugs to Australians. Let us have a look at what this government is doing in terms of investing in these areas. We should bear in mind that this is in the context of getting the budget back under control. We know that government spending is moderating because we know we are not going to be running massive deficits. We will actually be getting the budget under control but, whilst we are doing that, we will continue to invest very solidly in important health services.


Let us take a look at Medicare services and dental. In 2013-14 total expenditure was just over $19 billion and in 2017-18 the forecast total expenditure is just over $23 billion, so that is growth of about 21 per cent, or annualised close to five per cent. Let me be very clear. Expenditure by this government on Medicare and related dental services is forecast over the next four years to increase by more than 20 per cent. That is not going down by 20 per cent; it is going up by 20 per cent. That is a very important point to note.


Let us look at assistance to the states for hospitals. Mr Deputy Speaker, you may have heard stories of supposed cuts to spending by the Commonwealth on hospitals. That is absolutely false. There is $13.8 billion in FY14 and that is forecast to rise to $18.9 billion in FY18. That is an increase of 37 per cent, or about eight per cent on an annualised basis. So again it is absolutely flat out false to suggest that Commonwealth spending on hospitals is declining. It is not declining; it is increasing substantially. This government is spending significantly more on public hospitals than the previous government ever did. That is an important point: this government is spending considerably more on assistance to public hospitals than the previous government ever did. It is going up very substantially. In fact, by 37 per cent over four years.




Mr Tudge:
  What? Thirty-seven?




Mr COLEMAN:
  The member for Aston is commenting on that very substantial increase. This government is spending 37 per cent more than the Labor Party ever spent on assistance to public hospitals. That does not seem to be consistent with the narrative of those opposite, but it has the tremendous virtue of being true. There is a 37 per cent increase in investment in public hospitals.


Let us look at the investment in the PBS. There are sensible changes to the PBS but nonetheless government expenditure on the PBS will be increasing by 10 per cent over the next four years, an average growth rate of about 2.5 per cent. We see incremental money coming in for the medical research fund—going up to $4 billion by 2017-18—and a total annual increase in health expenditure of just over five per cent per year. That is not five per cent going down; that is five per cent going up. But importantly, whilst there is an increase it is an increase which is being managed in the context of a sensible budget, under which we say goodbye to the years of rampant uncontrolled spending and we say, 'How do we as a government sensibly plan to get back on track for a surplus whilst at the same time invest as required in important areas such as health?' It is very important that that narrative is understood. We see investment in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health increasing over the next four years. We see investment in the subsidies to private health insurance going up in the next four years.




Ms Hall:
  No joke!




Mr COLEMAN:
  These figures—and I am quoting directly from the budget, so I don't know if the member for Shortland has a different interpretation on numbers which are factual—are a very significant increase in health expenditure. The changes in this bill are a part of that sensible approach to health expenditure. The freezing of the indexation in relation to the private health insurance rebate and related matters will assist in addressing some of those broader budget challenges whilst at the same time being part of an overall approach to the health area of government policy, where health expenditure continues to increase—going up, not down—on an annual basis every year. That is a very important point to note.


What we cannot and will never do as a government is go into that intellectually dishonest and lazy place of putting out press releases, saying there are going to be surpluses and not doing the hard work to actually make them happen. That is not what this government are about. We are about sensible and methodical planning and a part of that is sensible planning which enables continuing investment in health services.

"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2014-10-28,"



Ms HALL
 (Shortland—Opposition Whip) (12:54):  I strongly encourage members of the government to agree to the amendment. The contribution from the member for Banks was a disgrace: an absolute disgrace. It shows just how statistics can be manipulated. No wonder people distrust the Abbott government as much as they do. The member for Banks is a stark contrast to the previous member for Banks, who was such an honest and straight-shooting member of parliament. I would encourage him to go and talk to the health minister in New South Wales and to talk to the Premier in New South Wales, and see whether or not they believe that this government—the Abbott government—is actually ripping money out of the health budget. In actual fact it is over $1 billion a year that it is ripping out of the budget. 


Listening to the member for Banks talk about returning the budget to surplus and investing in health, then in between the lines I got the feel of a member who is arguing in favour of a GST and a GST being placed on health along the lines of all the other things that this government has done. They promised before the election that there would be no new taxes—and I will talk a little bit about the GP tax in a moment—and now there is the possibility of a GST. You get the GP tax plus on top of that you get your GST. Really that is an absolute disgrace. No cuts to health? Well, I will be dealing with that in great detail as I go through this speech because this is a government that is cutting essential services. This is a government that is making cuts to health and making cuts to education. It is a government that has absolutely no commitment whatsoever to universal health care, which underpins our health system here in Australia. 


It is a government of broken promises and a government that does not really understand health. The Prime Minister did not understand health when he was actually the health minister. When he was the health minister bulk-billing rates in the Shortland electorate were 60 per cent. Following the time since we had the Gillard and the Rudd governments in power, bulk-billing rates were not 70 per cent, not 80 per cent, but 82 per cent. So on one hand we had in the Howard government, when the current Prime Minister was health minister, a man that undermined the universality of our health system.


I think it is really important to make comparisons to health systems in other countries. In Australia, we spend about nine per cent of GDP on health, which is much less than the UK and much less than the US, which is the model that I am sure the Prime Minister would like to see introduced in Australia. I am thinking about the legislation that has been introduced by the health minister. Last week we debated dental legislation. The dental legislation was not legislation to ensure that all Australians had access to dental health; rather it was legislation to waive the debt that dentists incurred when they did not abide by the guidelines of the chronic dental health program. This government and the previous Howard government have an appalling record on health.


To get to the bill that we are talking about today, the Private Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2014: it pauses the income threshold which determines the tiers for Medicare levy surcharges and the Australian government rebate on private health insurance. Talking of private health insurance, that reminds me that this government, when in opposition, said they were going to remove the means testing from private health insurance. We have not seen that legislation in the parliament yet and I suspect we will not, which will be another broken promise. But I think it was a promise that was very sensible for the government to walk away from.


When we looked at the independent analysis before the last election and when the means testing was placed on the health insurance rebate, the detailed analysis predicted that in the first year 175,000 people would withdraw from private health hospital cover and a further 583 people would downgrade their private health cover. Over five years they predicted 1.6 million Australians would drop cover and 4.3 million would downgrade their cover. Now let us look at the facts: in fact, private health insurance is at its highest level ever and continues to increase despite the means testing. Just for the record, before the election the Health Minister asserted that this level of private health insurance would decrease. It was 46 2.2 per cent; now it is 47.2 per cent of Australians who have hospital cover—hardly a decrease.


Everyone knows that those on the other side of this House, those in government will manipulate every figure and will cut services to those people that need them. They have no compunction whatsoever about cuts and putting new taxes on those people that cannot afford them. The effects of this budget that still has not really passed through the parliament is that the budget savings of over $1 billion a year will be made off the backs of the most vulnerable Australians. And people who miss out on safety nets will now miss out on care. So if a person cannot afford to pay for their health care, what they will do will be go without.


This is a government that has wielded unfair cuts on so many Australians in this budget. It just shows its lack of understanding of the struggle that people have each and every day to pay their bills, to be able to afford their health care, to be able to buy their medicines and to be able to access the quality universal health care that has become the rule not the exception in Australia. I really believe that many of those on the other side cannot remember what it was like before there was Medicare, which morphed into Medibank, which morphed into Medicare. They cannot remember how people were constantly hauled before the courts simply because they could not pay their hospital bills or how people did not get the treatment that they needed.


The broken promises and the unfair agenda, the attack on people through this budget is phenomenal. We on this side of the House really strongly support health and medical research. We demonstrated this support when we were in government through commitments of more than $3.5 billion in health and medical research funding, including $700 million to upgrade the health and medical research facilities across the country. In actual fact, the Hunter Medical Research Institute was a beneficiary of that investment in health. It is a fine institution and the research that is being undertaken there is second to none. I would like to put on the record my congratulations to the Hunter Medical Research Institute. I know that they will continue to undertake cutting-edge research.


But what this government has done is give us an excuse the reason it is hitting Australians with a GP tax that will go into medical research. Those in the department did not even know anything about it until three weeks before and is sending medical researchers that should be undertaking research and working in their institutions to Canberra to talk to members of parliament to try and convince them that there is a valid reason to support the change. When questioned, they say, 'We are still working on the higher level aspects of it and we cannot give you any details whatsoever.' So there are absolutely no details about it. There has been no consultation. They did not consult with the Chief Scientist until afterwards then tried to blackmail the health and medical research sector into coming down to Canberra to support a very flawed proposal.


The savings are being made in an environment where the government is really making significant cuts to the health system despite what previous member for Banks said on the other side of the parliament. He is really holding the people of Australia in contempt by making those very flawed statements and he is also showing just the difference between him and the previous member for Banks, who was in there always fighting for the constituents that he represented in this parliament. Rather than fighting for his constituents, fighting for Australians the current member for Banks is making excuses.


The taxes on GP visits are also taxes on pathology and diagnostic imaging. We heard in this parliament over the last week just what sort of an impost those increases, those taxes will have on people. Those opposite have increased the cost of medicine and they have made changes to the pharmaceutical benefits safety net. All these cuts, all these changes are hurting people when they are sick, when they are vulnerable and when they need to look to the government to ensure that they are going to have access to universal health care. But unfortunately the Abbott government does not have that commitment to universal health care.


It is cutting $368 million from the National Partnership Agreement on Preventative Health. One of the first actions of this government was to get rid of the Preventative Health Authority, a body that was undertaking some cutting-edge work in the area of preventative health. The minister and the Abbott government as a whole do not understand that the biggest savings in health can be made in prevention. If people can change their behaviours, if they can undertake activities that will lead to better health outcomes, then our health spending will decrease. But, unfortunately, this government does not see it like that. That was funding that the states relied on for preventative health. That $368 million helped tackle obesity, smoking and alcohol abuse, and now it is gone. 


Cutting $229 million from the dental Flexible Grants Program. Once again, that is an attack on dental health; once again, it will to lead to poorer dental health outcomes. Dental health cannot be looked at in isolation because dental health impacts on a person's overall health. Those on the other side of this House do not get that. Every area you look at in relation to dental health care this government is walking away from it. They have made changes based on lies about the sustainability of the health system—a system that is much more sustainable than the UK system, or the US system. This government would like us to replicate the US system, but no-one agrees with the government on these issues. 


Professor Owler, the President of the AMA, said that these figures in relation to healthcare spending are not out of control and that there is absolutely no reason to introduce a GP tax. This government stands condemned for its attack on the health system. (Time expired)

"Jones, Stephen, MP",ALP,2014-10-28,"



Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (13:09):  It is a great pleasure to follow the member for Shortland in this important debate. You could not find a more passionate advocate for the interests of health consumers in this country. It is an area of long-standing interest for the member for Shortland—indeed, before she came to parliament she was an allied health professional herself. 


The bill before the House is an important one. It deals with private health insurance, the government's subsidies to the private health insurance industry, and how they can be managed in a sustainable way over the long term. It gives parliament the opportunity to focus on how we fund our health system and the role that private health insurance has in that funding arrangement. 


Private health insurance is important. It costs the Commonwealth budget in terms of the rebate approximately $5.8 billion a year. That's right: $5.8 billion in 2014-15, which is a little bit less than 10 per cent of the Commonwealth's total health expenditure. It is right and proper that Commonwealth government and this parliament regularly focus on the performance of private health insurance and how much we are paying for this subsidy. 


In terms of how private health insurance funds the contribution to total health expenditure in this country, it plays a very important role. The Commonwealth does the heavy lifting directly; nearly 41½ per cent of total health expenditure in this country is paid for by the Commonwealth; followed by states and territories at close to 27 per cent. It may surprise many on the other side of the House who are stern advocates for a price signal when it comes to access to primary healthcare services to learn that individuals already foot close to 18 per cent of total health expenditure in this country. Private health insurance is about eight per cent of the total expenditure on health insurance. So it is an important part—by no means the most important part—of health expenditure. At nearly $6 billion a year, it is something the parliament ought to focus on. 


When this bill came before the House, it was met by a collective arching of the eyebrows from those on this side of the House, from each and every Labor member of parliament. That is because the subject matter of the bill is interesting. It was perhaps once seen as controversial by those on the other side of the House. It freezes the threshold for private health insurance rebate and the Medicare levy surcharge. The bill has the effect of reducing the amount of health insurance rebate that will be paid compared to if indexing were to occur as usual—that is, it freezes the rate at which the private health insurance rebate cuts out. It also—and this is not known by everyone—means that some individuals who would not pay the Medicare levy surcharge will pay that surcharge compared to if the surcharge was left alone. 


Labor does support the legislation and we will support responsible measures, well-targeted measures, which are aimed at keeping health spending at sustainable levels, and I will go through some of the measures that Labor took in government. When Labor was in government, we introduced measures that ensured that private health insurance incentives were means-tested and made fairer. That was just one of the measures that we put in place.


At the time, those who introduced this bill before the House today opposed it most vehemently. When in opposition they opposed similar measures that we brought before the House. I have to say that, of the many vanities that we accuse the current government of, a dogged adherence to principles is not one of them; when you turn your thoughts to many of the things that were said in this place in 2012 in relation to Labor's fairer private health insurance legislation, you are left rolling around the floor laughing because there is such a gap between what was said then and what is being said by members opposite now in support of similar legislation. 


The member for Flinders had this to say:


Significant numbers of consumers will withdraw from their private hospital cover—


1.6 million consumers over five years, he estimated—


or downgrade to lower levels of private health cover (4.3 million consumers over five years) following the proposed policy change.


So there you have it: the member for Flinders predicting a massive exodus as a result of the introduction of means testing for the private health insurance rebate. We know what happened, and that is the exact opposite. Private health insurance coverage rates continue to increase. In fact, they were at record levels when we left office.


But the member for Flinders, never one to be slowed down by facts or principle, had this to say:


That is the threat to the ability of low-income earners and middle-income earners to maintain their private health coverage.


He called Labor's reforms a 'retrograde step' in terms of public health policy.


He was not alone. I am very much looking forward to the contribution of the member for Leichhardt in this debate because when he comes here he will have to retract the things that he said in 2012 when he spoke on Labor's bill, which introduced the private health insurance rebate threshold. He had this to say:


I raise serious concerns about the grave impact these changes will have on our public health system, …


He called it 'blatant cost-shifting':


… blatant cost-shifting measure, shifting costs from the Commonwealth to the states' …


I welcome the comments that were made by the member for Leichhardt in respect of his concern about cost shifting. He did not have the same things to say about cost shifting when the GP tax legislation was before the House. In fact, we did not see him in there backing in the Liberal-National Party government's comments about the government's budget cuts through the tearing up of the health and hospital agreements, where the Liberal and National Party premiers said that there would be immediate impacts on front-line services.: from 1 July this year there will be a reduction of funding for 1,200 hospital beds across Australia. Where was the member for Leichhardt? Backing in his own LNP colleagues in Queensland, in New South Wales and right around the country when the serious criticisms were made about the government's policies.


There is more embarrassment for those on the other side. The then member for Barker had this to say—and I am always very concerned about the impact of any health measure on regional Australia:


Regional health relies on private health insurance. Visiting specialists to regional areas rely on both public and private patients. If the number of private patients drops off, which is inevitable,–


according to the member for Barker—


the visiting specialists will not visit anymore. Just on this fact, what does the government expect will happen if private health insurance is made more expensive? Of course people will drop out of private health. This means insurance will go up for those remaining in the system, weakening the health system not strengthening it.


You have to wonder, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, whether the new member for Barker agrees with what the old member for Barker had to say on this measure.


I expect the member for Cowper to make a powerful contribution as well. He always does when he comes into this place. In 2012 in relation to Labor's legislation, he said:


If you were to lose your private health insurance, you may well lose your private hospital. If you lose your private hospital, you may well lose your specialists. If you lose your specialists, you lose the local provision of services and that is a bad outcome for all people in regional Australia.


I can just imagine the member for Cowper's contribution in the party room caucus: was he channelling the member for Cowper in 2012 or had he a conversion—a Damascene conversion—in view of the obvious facts? So while we welcome the legislation we are deeply cynical of those opposite; as I said at the outset, of the many vanities that we can accuse those opposite of, a dogged and adherence to principal and consistency is not one of them.


The reason that we are willing to support the government in the passage of this legislation is because we are willing to be consistent when it comes to this area of health policy. The private health insurance rebate legislation in 2012 achieved savings of around $3 billion. And despite the fear mongering of those opposite, we did not see a massive exodus from private health insurance in this country. In fact, those Australians who had private health insurance coverage continued to rise.


We need to have a look at the broader context for this legislation, because I have heard many speakers on the debate. I heard the member for Banks earlier, saying that the sole reason that this legislation is necessary and the reason why the Prime Minister had to abandon an article of faith—his promise to remove the rebates on private health insurance—the reason that he had to breach that firm promise to the Australia people, was because health spending was in a crisis and it had to be brought under control.


Unfortunately, the facts do not agree with the member for Banks or anybody else who mounts this spurious argument. If we have a look at what has happened to health spending we are told that 10 years ago the PBS spending was half of what it is today. And we are told that 10 years ago Medicare—the MBS—was 50 per cent of what it is today as well. But the facts are somewhat different. Ten years ago PBS was 3.2 per cent of government spending—that is right, 3.2 per cent of government spending. And if you expected a runaway break-out in costs for PBS—an important part of our overall health spending—you would expect as a proportion of government outlays for that to be three, four, five or six times what it is today. Unfortunately, that is not the case for those who put that spurious argument. In fact, it is less: 3.2 per cent of government outlays 10 years ago; just 2.3 per cent today—in large part because of tough measures that Labor put in place, including the accelerated disclosure regime, which was not always popular but necessary to rein in costs. Ten years ago, Medicare cost 4.8 per cent of government spending. Again, if you expected a galloping, out of control, unsustainable increase in health spending, you would expect it to be three, four or five times what it is today in terms of total government outlays. It is not. It has actually gone down, slightly—I do not make a big point of that—4.8 per cent of government outlays 10 years ago; 4.6 per cent today.


These spurious arguments that are put up by those opposite about the need to introduce a two-tier health system, where we effectively remove bulk-billing, where we put in place massive increases in the costs of medicine through changes to the PBS safety net, where we massively reduce the support that the Commonwealth is giving to the public hospital system and the state-run health and hospital system in this country—around $55 billion worth of cuts—are all built on a fabrication, and it is the Australian people who are going to pay for it.


You must have some sympathy for the Australian people, who are facing massive increases in the cost of their health care on top of one of the largest increases in private health insurance premiums that has been seen in decades—approved by this government, one of the largest increases in private health insurance premiums that we have ever seen. Far from being the champions and far from those who are moved by the DNA, the articles of faith and whatever else floods through their veins, what we have seen is inconsistency and broken promises. But we, on this side of the House, are not going to take an unprincipled approach to it. In government we supported similar provisions. In face of the opposition of those, we will support a similar measure here today. (Time expired)

Mr ROBB
 (Goldstein—Minister for Trade and Investment) (13:25):  I appreciate the opportunity to sum up the Private Health Insurance Amendment Bill No. 1 2014. In doing so, I would like to thank all of the members for their contribution to this debate.


The purpose of the Private Health Insurance Amendment Bill No. 1 2014 is to implement a budget measure that pauses the income tiers for the Australian government rebate on private health insurance and the Medicare levy surcharge at the 2014-15 rates for three years. These amendments are being made to the Private Health Insurance Act 2007. It is important to note that these changes will not affect individuals with an income that remains $90,000 or below, or couples and families with an income that remains $180,000 or below. It is estimated that the changes will only impact four per cent of private health insurance policies.


These initiatives, along with many others over previous weeks and more to be presented, formed part of a most substantial budget in May this year. They were required because the coalition have inherited an enormous debt. These measures are just a small part of the government's strategy to clean up the mess left behind by the former Labor government. If we do not tackle these issues, if we do nothing and if we have no policy change at all in the years ahead, we would see what is now a $1 billion interest bill a month—$12 billion a year—grow in a short period of time to some $3 billion a month. That is $36 billion a year. Seventy per cent of all of our public debt is owed to foreign interests. In other words, we would be paying $36 billion a year back overseas and, as a consequence, we must clean up this mess. This bill is all about that.


In summary, this bill will amend the Private Health Insurance Act 2007 to pause the income threshold for the Australian government rebate on private health insurance and the Medicare levy surcharge at the 2014-15 rates for three years, and I put the bill to the House.

"Coleman, David, MP",LP,2014-10-28,"



Mr COLEMAN
 (Banks) (12:41):  I am pleased to continue my remarks on this important piece of legislation and this important area of public policy. What I want to do in my remarks today is to bust a few myths in relation to health policy and talk about the important changes encompassed in the Private Health Insurance Amendment Bill. I will also talk about the financial situation that the government confronts, not only in health policy but in policy more generally because of the extreme waste of the previous government. Broadly, the government inherited, a fiscal mess—high levels of debt growing very rapidly. It is incumbent upon the government to address that debt and deficit situation, which we are doing, in a sensible and purposeful fashion right across the board in government spending. Indeed, we are returning the budget to near balance within four years and, importantly, investing in areas that require public investment, such as health, in a substantial way. So we want to get the budget back on track, back to a near surplus situation, while at the same time investing in health and other areas.


Let us go to some of the numbers to demonstrate the gravity of the fiscal situation we confront. When Labor came into office there was $50 billion in the bank, no debt at all and no interest payments—because you do not pay interest when you do not have any debt. Over the six sorry years of Labor administration we saw a consistent overspend—deficits of $27 billion, $55 billion, $48 billion, $43 billion and $19 billion, culminating in $50 billion in 2013-14, based on the previous budget. They are very consistent high levels of debt. We will recall that one of the excuses given for this financial mismanagement was that revenue had collapsed—there was this thing called the GFC, which of course was a very convenient excuse for the previous government. It was pretty much trotted out in virtually all situations but it was certainly trotted out as a reason why running these huge deficits on a continuing basis was unavoidable.


The problem with that excuse is that government revenue under Labor actually rose very strongly. In 2008-09, the first full year of the previous government, government receipts were $289 billion; in 2013-14, the last year they were in government, they were $361 billion; and in FY13 they were $348 billion. So over that six-year period government revenue rose by 25 per cent and in fact averaged an increase of 4.5 per cent every year—the compound annual growth rate, as it is called. So government revenue did not go down at all, with the exception of 2009-10 where it did pause momentarily; it went up very substantially. It went up in 2010-11 by six per cent, in 2011-12 by 10 per cent and in 2012-13 by another six per cent. These were very substantial increases.


So there really is no excuse for not being able to make the expenditure match the revenue, but that is of course what happened. As a consequence we have a very big debt that we must address. This government, therefore, has to take a different approach. We cannot sleepwalk into the future, pretend everything is okay and go on running up deficits of tens of billions of dollars every year. We will not do that. So what we have laid out in a methodical and detailed fashion is a plan that gets the budget back on track. The plan means that by 2017-18 there will be a deficit of just $3 billion, so next to nothing in the context of a $460 billion organisation. We have done that by making sensible changes to government expenditure right across the board. Obviously there have been changes in areas such as foreign aid, where we have quarantined some of the larger increases that were planned.


Obviously the principal focus of the discussion today is health. As I said, the government has provided for a situation which gets the budget back under control and gets it back broadly to a surplus while at the same time the government has provided for significant increased investment in health. It is absolutely not the case that government expenditure in health is declining; in fact, it is increasing quite substantially. So the health budget was $64 billion in 2013-14 and will go up to $79 billion in 2017-18. That works out to be an average increase in health expenditure over the next four years of about five per cent. That is a very important point. Health investment is not going down; it is going up and going up at a very solid rate.


There are a number of different areas in which the government invests in health care but the three biggest are Medicare and dental services—they are sometimes treated separately but for the purposes of this it is probably easier to treat them together—assistance to the states for hospitals and the PBS, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, which provides subsidised drugs to Australians. Let us have a look at what this government is doing in terms of investing in these areas. We should bear in mind that this is in the context of getting the budget back under control. We know that government spending is moderating because we know we are not going to be running massive deficits. We will actually be getting the budget under control but, whilst we are doing that, we will continue to invest very solidly in important health services.


Let us take a look at Medicare services and dental. In 2013-14 total expenditure was just over $19 billion and in 2017-18 the forecast total expenditure is just over $23 billion, so that is growth of about 21 per cent, or annualised close to five per cent. Let me be very clear. Expenditure by this government on Medicare and related dental services is forecast over the next four years to increase by more than 20 per cent. That is not going down by 20 per cent; it is going up by 20 per cent. That is a very important point to note.


Let us look at assistance to the states for hospitals. Mr Deputy Speaker, you may have heard stories of supposed cuts to spending by the Commonwealth on hospitals. That is absolutely false. There is $13.8 billion in FY14 and that is forecast to rise to $18.9 billion in FY18. That is an increase of 37 per cent, or about eight per cent on an annualised basis. So again it is absolutely flat out false to suggest that Commonwealth spending on hospitals is declining. It is not declining; it is increasing substantially. This government is spending significantly more on public hospitals than the previous government ever did. That is an important point: this government is spending considerably more on assistance to public hospitals than the previous government ever did. It is going up very substantially. In fact, by 37 per cent over four years.




Mr Tudge:
  What? Thirty-seven?




Mr COLEMAN:
  The member for Aston is commenting on that very substantial increase. This government is spending 37 per cent more than the Labor Party ever spent on assistance to public hospitals. That does not seem to be consistent with the narrative of those opposite, but it has the tremendous virtue of being true. There is a 37 per cent increase in investment in public hospitals.


Let us look at the investment in the PBS. There are sensible changes to the PBS but nonetheless government expenditure on the PBS will be increasing by 10 per cent over the next four years, an average growth rate of about 2.5 per cent. We see incremental money coming in for the medical research fund—going up to $4 billion by 2017-18—and a total annual increase in health expenditure of just over five per cent per year. That is not five per cent going down; that is five per cent going up. But importantly, whilst there is an increase it is an increase which is being managed in the context of a sensible budget, under which we say goodbye to the years of rampant uncontrolled spending and we say, 'How do we as a government sensibly plan to get back on track for a surplus whilst at the same time invest as required in important areas such as health?' It is very important that that narrative is understood. We see investment in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health increasing over the next four years. We see investment in the subsidies to private health insurance going up in the next four years.




Ms Hall:
  No joke!




Mr COLEMAN:
  These figures—and I am quoting directly from the budget, so I don't know if the member for Shortland has a different interpretation on numbers which are factual—are a very significant increase in health expenditure. The changes in this bill are a part of that sensible approach to health expenditure. The freezing of the indexation in relation to the private health insurance rebate and related matters will assist in addressing some of those broader budget challenges whilst at the same time being part of an overall approach to the health area of government policy, where health expenditure continues to increase—going up, not down—on an annual basis every year. That is a very important point to note.


What we cannot and will never do as a government is go into that intellectually dishonest and lazy place of putting out press releases, saying there are going to be surpluses and not doing the hard work to actually make them happen. That is not what this government are about. We are about sensible and methodical planning and a part of that is sensible planning which enables continuing investment in health services.

Ms HALL
 (Shortland—Opposition Whip) (12:54):  I strongly encourage members of the government to agree to the amendment. The contribution from the member for Banks was a disgrace: an absolute disgrace. It shows just how statistics can be manipulated. No wonder people distrust the Abbott government as much as they do. The member for Banks is a stark contrast to the previous member for Banks, who was such an honest and straight-shooting member of parliament. I would encourage him to go and talk to the health minister in New South Wales and to talk to the Premier in New South Wales, and see whether or not they believe that this government—the Abbott government—is actually ripping money out of the health budget. In actual fact it is over $1 billion a year that it is ripping out of the budget. 


Listening to the member for Banks talk about returning the budget to surplus and investing in health, then in between the lines I got the feel of a member who is arguing in favour of a GST and a GST being placed on health along the lines of all the other things that this government has done. They promised before the election that there would be no new taxes—and I will talk a little bit about the GP tax in a moment—and now there is the possibility of a GST. You get the GP tax plus on top of that you get your GST. Really that is an absolute disgrace. No cuts to health? Well, I will be dealing with that in great detail as I go through this speech because this is a government that is cutting essential services. This is a government that is making cuts to health and making cuts to education. It is a government that has absolutely no commitment whatsoever to universal health care, which underpins our health system here in Australia. 


It is a government of broken promises and a government that does not really understand health. The Prime Minister did not understand health when he was actually the health minister. When he was the health minister bulk-billing rates in the Shortland electorate were 60 per cent. Following the time since we had the Gillard and the Rudd governments in power, bulk-billing rates were not 70 per cent, not 80 per cent, but 82 per cent. So on one hand we had in the Howard government, when the current Prime Minister was health minister, a man that undermined the universality of our health system.


I think it is really important to make comparisons to health systems in other countries. In Australia, we spend about nine per cent of GDP on health, which is much less than the UK and much less than the US, which is the model that I am sure the Prime Minister would like to see introduced in Australia. I am thinking about the legislation that has been introduced by the health minister. Last week we debated dental legislation. The dental legislation was not legislation to ensure that all Australians had access to dental health; rather it was legislation to waive the debt that dentists incurred when they did not abide by the guidelines of the chronic dental health program. This government and the previous Howard government have an appalling record on health.


To get to the bill that we are talking about today, the Private Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2014: it pauses the income threshold which determines the tiers for Medicare levy surcharges and the Australian government rebate on private health insurance. Talking of private health insurance, that reminds me that this government, when in opposition, said they were going to remove the means testing from private health insurance. We have not seen that legislation in the parliament yet and I suspect we will not, which will be another broken promise. But I think it was a promise that was very sensible for the government to walk away from.


When we looked at the independent analysis before the last election and when the means testing was placed on the health insurance rebate, the detailed analysis predicted that in the first year 175,000 people would withdraw from private health hospital cover and a further 583 people would downgrade their private health cover. Over five years they predicted 1.6 million Australians would drop cover and 4.3 million would downgrade their cover. Now let us look at the facts: in fact, private health insurance is at its highest level ever and continues to increase despite the means testing. Just for the record, before the election the Health Minister asserted that this level of private health insurance would decrease. It was 46 2.2 per cent; now it is 47.2 per cent of Australians who have hospital cover—hardly a decrease.


Everyone knows that those on the other side of this House, those in government will manipulate every figure and will cut services to those people that need them. They have no compunction whatsoever about cuts and putting new taxes on those people that cannot afford them. The effects of this budget that still has not really passed through the parliament is that the budget savings of over $1 billion a year will be made off the backs of the most vulnerable Australians. And people who miss out on safety nets will now miss out on care. So if a person cannot afford to pay for their health care, what they will do will be go without.


This is a government that has wielded unfair cuts on so many Australians in this budget. It just shows its lack of understanding of the struggle that people have each and every day to pay their bills, to be able to afford their health care, to be able to buy their medicines and to be able to access the quality universal health care that has become the rule not the exception in Australia. I really believe that many of those on the other side cannot remember what it was like before there was Medicare, which morphed into Medibank, which morphed into Medicare. They cannot remember how people were constantly hauled before the courts simply because they could not pay their hospital bills or how people did not get the treatment that they needed.


The broken promises and the unfair agenda, the attack on people through this budget is phenomenal. We on this side of the House really strongly support health and medical research. We demonstrated this support when we were in government through commitments of more than $3.5 billion in health and medical research funding, including $700 million to upgrade the health and medical research facilities across the country. In actual fact, the Hunter Medical Research Institute was a beneficiary of that investment in health. It is a fine institution and the research that is being undertaken there is second to none. I would like to put on the record my congratulations to the Hunter Medical Research Institute. I know that they will continue to undertake cutting-edge research.


But what this government has done is give us an excuse the reason it is hitting Australians with a GP tax that will go into medical research. Those in the department did not even know anything about it until three weeks before and is sending medical researchers that should be undertaking research and working in their institutions to Canberra to talk to members of parliament to try and convince them that there is a valid reason to support the change. When questioned, they say, 'We are still working on the higher level aspects of it and we cannot give you any details whatsoever.' So there are absolutely no details about it. There has been no consultation. They did not consult with the Chief Scientist until afterwards then tried to blackmail the health and medical research sector into coming down to Canberra to support a very flawed proposal.


The savings are being made in an environment where the government is really making significant cuts to the health system despite what previous member for Banks said on the other side of the parliament. He is really holding the people of Australia in contempt by making those very flawed statements and he is also showing just the difference between him and the previous member for Banks, who was in there always fighting for the constituents that he represented in this parliament. Rather than fighting for his constituents, fighting for Australians the current member for Banks is making excuses.


The taxes on GP visits are also taxes on pathology and diagnostic imaging. We heard in this parliament over the last week just what sort of an impost those increases, those taxes will have on people. Those opposite have increased the cost of medicine and they have made changes to the pharmaceutical benefits safety net. All these cuts, all these changes are hurting people when they are sick, when they are vulnerable and when they need to look to the government to ensure that they are going to have access to universal health care. But unfortunately the Abbott government does not have that commitment to universal health care.


It is cutting $368 million from the National Partnership Agreement on Preventative Health. One of the first actions of this government was to get rid of the Preventative Health Authority, a body that was undertaking some cutting-edge work in the area of preventative health. The minister and the Abbott government as a whole do not understand that the biggest savings in health can be made in prevention. If people can change their behaviours, if they can undertake activities that will lead to better health outcomes, then our health spending will decrease. But, unfortunately, this government does not see it like that. That was funding that the states relied on for preventative health. That $368 million helped tackle obesity, smoking and alcohol abuse, and now it is gone. 


Cutting $229 million from the dental Flexible Grants Program. Once again, that is an attack on dental health; once again, it will to lead to poorer dental health outcomes. Dental health cannot be looked at in isolation because dental health impacts on a person's overall health. Those on the other side of this House do not get that. Every area you look at in relation to dental health care this government is walking away from it. They have made changes based on lies about the sustainability of the health system—a system that is much more sustainable than the UK system, or the US system. This government would like us to replicate the US system, but no-one agrees with the government on these issues. 


Professor Owler, the President of the AMA, said that these figures in relation to healthcare spending are not out of control and that there is absolutely no reason to introduce a GP tax. This government stands condemned for its attack on the health system. (Time expired)

"Jones, Stephen, MP",ALP,2014-10-28,"



Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (13:09):  It is a great pleasure to follow the member for Shortland in this important debate. You could not find a more passionate advocate for the interests of health consumers in this country. It is an area of long-standing interest for the member for Shortland—indeed, before she came to parliament she was an allied health professional herself. 


The bill before the House is an important one. It deals with private health insurance, the government's subsidies to the private health insurance industry, and how they can be managed in a sustainable way over the long term. It gives parliament the opportunity to focus on how we fund our health system and the role that private health insurance has in that funding arrangement. 


Private health insurance is important. It costs the Commonwealth budget in terms of the rebate approximately $5.8 billion a year. That's right: $5.8 billion in 2014-15, which is a little bit less than 10 per cent of the Commonwealth's total health expenditure. It is right and proper that Commonwealth government and this parliament regularly focus on the performance of private health insurance and how much we are paying for this subsidy. 


In terms of how private health insurance funds the contribution to total health expenditure in this country, it plays a very important role. The Commonwealth does the heavy lifting directly; nearly 41½ per cent of total health expenditure in this country is paid for by the Commonwealth; followed by states and territories at close to 27 per cent. It may surprise many on the other side of the House who are stern advocates for a price signal when it comes to access to primary healthcare services to learn that individuals already foot close to 18 per cent of total health expenditure in this country. Private health insurance is about eight per cent of the total expenditure on health insurance. So it is an important part—by no means the most important part—of health expenditure. At nearly $6 billion a year, it is something the parliament ought to focus on. 


When this bill came before the House, it was met by a collective arching of the eyebrows from those on this side of the House, from each and every Labor member of parliament. That is because the subject matter of the bill is interesting. It was perhaps once seen as controversial by those on the other side of the House. It freezes the threshold for private health insurance rebate and the Medicare levy surcharge. The bill has the effect of reducing the amount of health insurance rebate that will be paid compared to if indexing were to occur as usual—that is, it freezes the rate at which the private health insurance rebate cuts out. It also—and this is not known by everyone—means that some individuals who would not pay the Medicare levy surcharge will pay that surcharge compared to if the surcharge was left alone. 


Labor does support the legislation and we will support responsible measures, well-targeted measures, which are aimed at keeping health spending at sustainable levels, and I will go through some of the measures that Labor took in government. When Labor was in government, we introduced measures that ensured that private health insurance incentives were means-tested and made fairer. That was just one of the measures that we put in place.


At the time, those who introduced this bill before the House today opposed it most vehemently. When in opposition they opposed similar measures that we brought before the House. I have to say that, of the many vanities that we accuse the current government of, a dogged adherence to principles is not one of them; when you turn your thoughts to many of the things that were said in this place in 2012 in relation to Labor's fairer private health insurance legislation, you are left rolling around the floor laughing because there is such a gap between what was said then and what is being said by members opposite now in support of similar legislation. 


The member for Flinders had this to say:


Significant numbers of consumers will withdraw from their private hospital cover—


1.6 million consumers over five years, he estimated—


or downgrade to lower levels of private health cover (4.3 million consumers over five years) following the proposed policy change.


So there you have it: the member for Flinders predicting a massive exodus as a result of the introduction of means testing for the private health insurance rebate. We know what happened, and that is the exact opposite. Private health insurance coverage rates continue to increase. In fact, they were at record levels when we left office.


But the member for Flinders, never one to be slowed down by facts or principle, had this to say:


That is the threat to the ability of low-income earners and middle-income earners to maintain their private health coverage.


He called Labor's reforms a 'retrograde step' in terms of public health policy.


He was not alone. I am very much looking forward to the contribution of the member for Leichhardt in this debate because when he comes here he will have to retract the things that he said in 2012 when he spoke on Labor's bill, which introduced the private health insurance rebate threshold. He had this to say:


I raise serious concerns about the grave impact these changes will have on our public health system, …


He called it 'blatant cost-shifting':


… blatant cost-shifting measure, shifting costs from the Commonwealth to the states' …


I welcome the comments that were made by the member for Leichhardt in respect of his concern about cost shifting. He did not have the same things to say about cost shifting when the GP tax legislation was before the House. In fact, we did not see him in there backing in the Liberal-National Party government's comments about the government's budget cuts through the tearing up of the health and hospital agreements, where the Liberal and National Party premiers said that there would be immediate impacts on front-line services.: from 1 July this year there will be a reduction of funding for 1,200 hospital beds across Australia. Where was the member for Leichhardt? Backing in his own LNP colleagues in Queensland, in New South Wales and right around the country when the serious criticisms were made about the government's policies.


There is more embarrassment for those on the other side. The then member for Barker had this to say—and I am always very concerned about the impact of any health measure on regional Australia:


Regional health relies on private health insurance. Visiting specialists to regional areas rely on both public and private patients. If the number of private patients drops off, which is inevitable,–


according to the member for Barker—


the visiting specialists will not visit anymore. Just on this fact, what does the government expect will happen if private health insurance is made more expensive? Of course people will drop out of private health. This means insurance will go up for those remaining in the system, weakening the health system not strengthening it.


You have to wonder, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, whether the new member for Barker agrees with what the old member for Barker had to say on this measure.


I expect the member for Cowper to make a powerful contribution as well. He always does when he comes into this place. In 2012 in relation to Labor's legislation, he said:


If you were to lose your private health insurance, you may well lose your private hospital. If you lose your private hospital, you may well lose your specialists. If you lose your specialists, you lose the local provision of services and that is a bad outcome for all people in regional Australia.


I can just imagine the member for Cowper's contribution in the party room caucus: was he channelling the member for Cowper in 2012 or had he a conversion—a Damascene conversion—in view of the obvious facts? So while we welcome the legislation we are deeply cynical of those opposite; as I said at the outset, of the many vanities that we can accuse those opposite of, a dogged and adherence to principal and consistency is not one of them.


The reason that we are willing to support the government in the passage of this legislation is because we are willing to be consistent when it comes to this area of health policy. The private health insurance rebate legislation in 2012 achieved savings of around $3 billion. And despite the fear mongering of those opposite, we did not see a massive exodus from private health insurance in this country. In fact, those Australians who had private health insurance coverage continued to rise.


We need to have a look at the broader context for this legislation, because I have heard many speakers on the debate. I heard the member for Banks earlier, saying that the sole reason that this legislation is necessary and the reason why the Prime Minister had to abandon an article of faith—his promise to remove the rebates on private health insurance—the reason that he had to breach that firm promise to the Australia people, was because health spending was in a crisis and it had to be brought under control.


Unfortunately, the facts do not agree with the member for Banks or anybody else who mounts this spurious argument. If we have a look at what has happened to health spending we are told that 10 years ago the PBS spending was half of what it is today. And we are told that 10 years ago Medicare—the MBS—was 50 per cent of what it is today as well. But the facts are somewhat different. Ten years ago PBS was 3.2 per cent of government spending—that is right, 3.2 per cent of government spending. And if you expected a runaway break-out in costs for PBS—an important part of our overall health spending—you would expect as a proportion of government outlays for that to be three, four, five or six times what it is today. Unfortunately, that is not the case for those who put that spurious argument. In fact, it is less: 3.2 per cent of government outlays 10 years ago; just 2.3 per cent today—in large part because of tough measures that Labor put in place, including the accelerated disclosure regime, which was not always popular but necessary to rein in costs. Ten years ago, Medicare cost 4.8 per cent of government spending. Again, if you expected a galloping, out of control, unsustainable increase in health spending, you would expect it to be three, four or five times what it is today in terms of total government outlays. It is not. It has actually gone down, slightly—I do not make a big point of that—4.8 per cent of government outlays 10 years ago; 4.6 per cent today.


These spurious arguments that are put up by those opposite about the need to introduce a two-tier health system, where we effectively remove bulk-billing, where we put in place massive increases in the costs of medicine through changes to the PBS safety net, where we massively reduce the support that the Commonwealth is giving to the public hospital system and the state-run health and hospital system in this country—around $55 billion worth of cuts—are all built on a fabrication, and it is the Australian people who are going to pay for it.


You must have some sympathy for the Australian people, who are facing massive increases in the cost of their health care on top of one of the largest increases in private health insurance premiums that has been seen in decades—approved by this government, one of the largest increases in private health insurance premiums that we have ever seen. Far from being the champions and far from those who are moved by the DNA, the articles of faith and whatever else floods through their veins, what we have seen is inconsistency and broken promises. But we, on this side of the House, are not going to take an unprincipled approach to it. In government we supported similar provisions. In face of the opposition of those, we will support a similar measure here today. (Time expired)

Mr ROBB
 (Goldstein—Minister for Trade and Investment) (13:25):  I appreciate the opportunity to sum up the Private Health Insurance Amendment Bill No. 1 2014. In doing so, I would like to thank all of the members for their contribution to this debate.


The purpose of the Private Health Insurance Amendment Bill No. 1 2014 is to implement a budget measure that pauses the income tiers for the Australian government rebate on private health insurance and the Medicare levy surcharge at the 2014-15 rates for three years. These amendments are being made to the Private Health Insurance Act 2007. It is important to note that these changes will not affect individuals with an income that remains $90,000 or below, or couples and families with an income that remains $180,000 or below. It is estimated that the changes will only impact four per cent of private health insurance policies.


These initiatives, along with many others over previous weeks and more to be presented, formed part of a most substantial budget in May this year. They were required because the coalition have inherited an enormous debt. These measures are just a small part of the government's strategy to clean up the mess left behind by the former Labor government. If we do not tackle these issues, if we do nothing and if we have no policy change at all in the years ahead, we would see what is now a $1 billion interest bill a month—$12 billion a year—grow in a short period of time to some $3 billion a month. That is $36 billion a year. Seventy per cent of all of our public debt is owed to foreign interests. In other words, we would be paying $36 billion a year back overseas and, as a consequence, we must clean up this mess. This bill is all about that.


In summary, this bill will amend the Private Health Insurance Act 2007 to pause the income threshold for the Australian government rebate on private health insurance and the Medicare levy surcharge at the 2014-15 rates for three years, and I put the bill to the House.

Ms CHESTERS
 (Bendigo) (13:29):  Over 60 per cent of metro students say they are keen to go to university, compared with only 32 per cent from regional and remote communities. There is already a divide between city and country when it comes to students wanting to access university. The fact we are now facing $100,000 university degrees is only going to exacerbate the problem.


Regional students moving to the city already face increased costs—the costs of setting up a new home and of going to university. Regional students also face barriers when it comes to their own university. The facts are simple: if you increase university fees and deregulate the sector, less students will go. Cost will be a barrier. The pressure that will put on our regional universities cannot be underestimated. We have already seen it happen in the TAFE sector in my state of Victoria. When funding was cut from the TAFE sector and TAFEs were allowed to increase fees, we saw drops in student numbers. We then saw courses and campuses close. The exact same thing will happen in our regions and at our regional universities.


This government has to reverse its plans to increase university fees. Students will not go to university. Regional students will be disproportionately affected if this government proceeds and introduces $100,000 degrees.

The SPEAKER
 (15:18):  Yesterday, the Manager of Opposition Business raised with me, as a potential matter of privilege, whether the Hansard record of an answer provided by the Minister for Agriculture, last week on 20 October, had been changed in a way that amounted to 'misconduct'. The Manager of Opposition Business asked whether such changes might relate to 'deliberately misleading the House, conspiracy to deceive, falsifying documents or disobedience to the rule or orders of the House'.


For this to be considered it is necessary for there to be evidence of a prime facie case that the alleged misconduct is conduct which, and I quote section 4 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987, 'amounts, or is intended or likely to amount, to an improper interference with the free exercise by a House or committee of its authority or functions, or with the free performance by a member or the member's duties as a member'.


I note that the Minister for Agriculture attended in the House shortly after the matter was raised with me, and explained to the House the circumstances around the changes made to the Hansard record of his answer in the House, including that he had counselled his staff about their actions and requested the Hansard record to be corrected. Given the minister's explanation I have not reviewed the tapes. In light of the minister's explanation, it does not appear that a prime facie case as intimated above has been made out and I consider that the matter is now closed.

Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Leader of the Opposition) (15:22):  For two days now, the Prime Minister has travelled around from federation lectures to the parliament pontificating about how we should all think for the long term. This Prime Minister, the most narrow, negative politician in Australian history, is now trying to lecture Australians about planning for the future. Who does this person think he is—that a leopard cannot change his spots after 20 years of relentless negativity? When their unfair budget is failing desperately, the Prime Minister seeks to run up an emergency beacon saying, 'Hang on, we want to have a sensible, mature discussion about the generations ahead.' Well, Tony Abbott, here is our advice about your sensible discussion: demonstrate your bona fides in higher education. Nothing can be more important to the future of this country than higher education and the opportunities that our young have to better themselves and to contribute to this nation. 


This Prime Minister has the temerity and the cheek, and he almost convinced me that he is so out of touch except that I just do not believe him. He knows that his plan for Australia is to radically recast it and to create two Australia's. He has a chance to demonstrate—don't shake head over there, Sunshine! You know I'm right.



The SPEAKER:  The Leader of the Opposition is always keen to have people referred to by their proper titles and will in fact observe that.




Mr SHORTEN:
  Okay, thanks. The Prime Minister needs to come out of his hiding place. We know he never goes out to mix with real people any more. He does safe picture opportunities at medical research facilities or he talks to Liberal Party faithfuls at fundraisers—oh, that is right, he did go to the Peter McCallum after the fundraiser. The real test here today is that education is one challenge the parliament should not fail. No parliament, no government and no Tasmanian backbenchers should ever look back and say, 'We failed the test of making the education system better. I do not know how a single Tasmanian Liberal can be backing these higher education changes. Opportunity in education is a pact between generations.



Mr Nikolic interjecting—




Mr SHORTEN:
  The member for Bass is interjecting but he is not in his seat, Madam Speaker.



The SPEAKER:  The member for Bass will not interject if he is not in his seat.




Mr SHORTEN:
  The Tasmanian Liberals need to stand up along with the Labor Party and understand that the solemn responsibility of every government is to pass on an education system better than the one they inherited. Now the government has abrogated this responsibility and has failed this test. Labor believes if you work hard, you get good marks, that if you can do well, you deserve to go to university. Destiny should not be predetermined by your parents' wealth or the postcode for where you live. We should be opening doors to children from the bush, to children from poor families, to first generation migrants. We should be helping mature age Australians, dislocated by economic change, to get new skills and retrain for the jobs of the future. We should be supporting the opportunity of women to get access to higher education. 


Labor believes that a university system that gives every Australian the chance to fulfil their potential, to strive, to seek and to reach for higher ground, is a fair system. That is the system we built from the great Gough Whitlam onwards. It is the system that is under attack from the backward looking government, from this Prime Minister of negativity and narrowness, to the partition pretender, the education minister. Look at the schemes they want to introduce, at the changes they are creating. 


A nursing degree in Victoria—that is state, by the way, members of the government. We do not expect to see the Prime Minister visit before the state election, although we hope he does. Mind you, we do not expect to see him and Premier Denis Napthine does not want to see him. A nursing degree in Victoria under the government's rules is now $23,000 over eight years. Under the Abbott empire, the Minister for Education and Prime Minister model, it will cost $63,000 over 17 years. What a marvellous contribution to education this education minister is making—$40,000 more and nine years longer to pay off! 


Talk about a teaching degree in Victoria: $31,000 over nine years, under the so-called Minister for Education and the Prime Minister it will cost $81,000 over 14 years—that is, courtesy of the government, $50,000 more and five years longer to pay off.




Mr Nikolic:
  Did you model that, Bill? Who did your modelling?




Mr SHORTEN:
  Calm down, Member for Bass. I know you are upset about how I pinged you before. The other problem we have about education is the unfairness for women who take time off to start and to raise a family. They know these costs are impossible for mature age students. The students of Australia and their families, they know this government is fundamentally changing access to universities. They understand Australians. They understand exactly what this government is doing. For months and months, this education minister has been asking the divisive dog-whistling question: why should the 60 per cent of taxpayers who do not attend university contribute to the 40 per cent who do? Why should those who have not been to university contribute to the fees of those who do? The answer is simple, Minister for Education. Not all Australians are like you. They  do not believe that education is just a private privilege; they believe it is a public benefit.


Australian university graduates also pay for their education not just through HECS but through their economic and social contribution. They pay to their countries and they pay to their communities. Now we see that the changes the government are making are indeed creating anxiety. The numbers at open days and the numbers of potential enrolments are down. Why should the future doctors and nurses who will keep us healthy, the teachers who will educate our children, the architects, engineers and city planners who will shape our infrastructure, the scientists who will make discoveries that will determine our future health and opportunity all be slugged with doubling and tripling of their university fees? 


Australians are smart enough and generous enough to reject Liberal ideology. They understand that greater access to higher education is in fact an advantage to all of us. I have never met a parent or a grandparent who had not gone to university who begrudged the chance for their child or their grandchild to go to university. I have never met a parent or a grandparent who complains about the taxes they pay because their loved ones are getting a better start in life than they had. Anyway, we are in this debate now and higher education is absolutely one of the issues for the next election. The next election will be a referendum on the best ideas and the real vision for a prosperous and fair Australia—absolutely.


Nothing is more important to the future prosperity of our nation than education. We believe in affordable education which is accessible to all Australians. That is why we will fight to stop Tony Abbott's plan for $100,000 degrees and more. We will never support a two-tier, Americanised higher education system which divides between different levels in our society and entrenches disadvantage. This Minister for Education loves to talk about 80,000 scholarships. But he never talks about the 700,000 domestic students currently enrolled. He is proposing to provide 80,000 scholarships, but students in the remaining difference between 700,000 and 80,000 are going to pay more fees. This is not a bargain. This is a tricky, slippery Minister for Education who loves to talk about one aspect of his package but never tells the full picture.


Let's look at what the government want to do in higher education. We have seen the Minister the Education propose doubling the rate of HECS repayments. Imagine if what we did in Australia on home interest rates before an election was say, 'No problem,' and after an election, upon forming a government, we said, 'We want to double the rate of payment.' That is what this government, this education minister and Tony Abbott have done. They are changing the interest rate for HECS payments for nearly one million Australians.


This government love to talk about debt and deficit. They never talk about the debt and deficit they are putting onto ordinary Australians and their families. Labor will never consign Australians to generations of debt on higher education. Labor will never tell Australians that the quality of their education depends upon their capacity to pay. I love hearing the government members crow in disagreement and feigned outrage. Because what they know and we know and the Australian people know is that this government cannot be trusted on higher education. However loudly they complain about what we say, it does not change the truth of what we are saying.


Make no mistake: for higher education, the game is on. We will talk to every student. We will talk to every family member of every student. We will talk to the parents of secondary students. We will talk to everyone who is interested in higher education. There will be a choice at the next election. There will be a choice between this government issuing students a debt sentence by deregulating universities to the point where students simply cannot afford to go to university—shame, government, shame— (Time expired)

"Pyne, Christopher, MP",LP,2014-10-28,"



Mr PYNE
 (Sturt—Leader of the House and Minister for Education) (15:32):  I am very pleased to respond on this matter of public importance. I thought that the fact that it was moved by the Leader of the Opposition meant that it would be a serious debate about a very serious issue: the future of Australian universities. But instead, unfortunately, I feel I have been drowning in a sea of cliches. In such circumstances, often the response is to match cliche for cliche, but on this side of the House we take government policy very seriously.


When the public elected us a year ago, they wanted to elect adults to run a serious country in a calm and methodical way—and that is exactly what we are proposing to do. In higher education, we have put on the table and passed through this House the most substantial reform to higher education since the Dawkins period, a reform that will free and deregulate universities in a way that will allow them to focus and concentrate on their areas of excellence so they can have more of them and have them be even better, so they can keep up with their Asian competitors and stay in front of them and so they can defend and grow our $15 billion international education market. Our third largest export industry, after iron ore and coal, is education, followed by gold. We take this seriously.


At the same time, we want to give Australian young people the opportunity to get a higher education qualification because, if they do, they will be able to earn 75 per cent, on average, more over their lifetimes than people without a higher education qualification. They will actually have a longer life expectancy, better health outcomes and the lowest unemployment rate of anybody in the community. We want to spread that opportunity to more Australians. We want to follow in the footsteps of Sir Robert Menzies, the real father of education in Australia.


Do not take my word for that. It was not me who first said that Sir Robert Menzies was the father of higher education in Australia. It was, in fact, Gough Whitlam, who we have been hearing a lot about in the last week since his death, in a speech to the Harvard Club of Australia in June 1973, the first year of his prime ministership. Mr Whitlam said: 'No Australian has done more to serve the cause of university education in this country than Sir Robert Menzies. Under the responsibilities accepted by his government, more young Australians were given access to universities and more money was spent to equip universities.' This was followed by Lindsay Tanner in his book of much more recent times. He wrote: 'Sir Robert Menzies began the transformation of higher education in Australia, and he helped to change attitudes to education. Thousands of Australians of my generation benefited from Gough Whitlam's university reforms, but the changes in public attitudes that helped to make them possible came from the Menzies era.' So what we on this side of the House are doing is continuing the relationship that the coalition has had with valuing and expanding higher education for decades.


In the Whitlam period of three years, so-called free education was introduced, where all taxpayers paid for the privileged few to go to university. By 1988 the Hawke and Keating government reintroduced fees, through the Higher Education Contribution Scheme, because they recognised the inequitable nature of what the Whitlam government had done. Maybe it was with good intentions, but the demographic breakdown of universities in 1988 was no different to what it had been in 1974 when so-called free education was introduced. All that had happened was that the poorest Australians had transferred wealth to the richest Australians. The same people went to university in 1988 who had gone to university in 1974. That has only changed—not because of the Whitlam period, not because of the Higher Education Contribution Scheme—because of programs implemented by the Howard government and then by the Rudd and Gillard governments to expand, in a very direct way, the access to universities of low-socio-economic students. In this reform we want to expand that; we want to continue that work. One thing that Julia Gillard did not do too badly was education reform. She was a very bad prime minister, but she did actually put in place a number of measures to expand education to low SES Australians, which we supported then and we want to expand now.


In this reform that will go before the Senate tomorrow we want to expand the demand driven system to sub-bachelor courses. These are the pathways that low-SES and mature age students typically use to get back into undergraduate degrees to improve their education. Let's put some facts on the table rather than the hyperbole of the Leader of the Opposition. The facts are that the Kemp Norton report that I initiated after our election said that students from a low-SES background who have done pathways programs had two per cent dropout rate; when they did not do a pathways program and went straight to an undergraduate degree they had a 24 per cent dropout rate. What this government wants to do is expand opportunity to those low-SES students. I would have thought that the Labor Party would have supported that. I would have thought that Labor would have supported expanding opportunity to more low-SES students, but they are not going to do that because they just want to play politics. With Labor it is all about politics—it is never about policy.


Through our plan to expand the Commonwealth Grant Scheme to the non-university higher education providers, through our plan to have the largest Commonwealth scholarships fund in Australia's history and through our plan to expand the demand driven system that I have already described, we believe that by 2018 80,000 more young Australians from low-SES backgrounds will get the opportunity to go to university and get that higher education qualification I had. Labor is running a scaremongering campaign—it is as simple as that—and they are prepared even to talk about the so-called Americanisation of Australian universities. Never mind the fact that America does not have the Higher Education Contribution Scheme, which is the envy of the world and the most generous loan scheme in the world. Before you have to pay any money back to the taxpayer that you have borrowed up-front, you have to be earning over $50,000 a year and even then you can only be charged two per cent of your income at the best interest rates you will ever receive on any loan in your life. 


Labor is scaring students in most disgraceful way and I would have expected better from the member for Kingston. In a speech on 1 October this year, Mike Gallagher from the Group of Eight said:


Students … deserve to be rid of the scaremongering. One example of just how cruel and dangerous are the misrepresentations—at recent University Open Days, many students were under the impression, on the basis of statements made by some senior politicians—


including the member the Kingston—


…that tuition fees would have to be paid up-front because HECS HELP was being dismantled. 


… … …


Interestingly, once the prospective students were advised that HELP was staying and there would be no reintroduction of up-front fees many of their concerns were allayed …


In other words, Mr Deputy Speaker, when students knew that the Higher Education Contribution Scheme was remaining unchanged and when it was stated that they could borrow every single dollar up-front from the Australian taxpayer, their concerns were immediately allayed. That does not suit the Labor Party because they do not want students to be comfortable about our reforms. 


I can tell you that it was reported to me that, when students were convinced that the HECS scheme was staying, their concerns were much less than they were before. I have been all over Australia visiting university campuses and I find I am very much welcome at them. In fact, the students at the La Trobe campus at Mildura had to bus in protesters from Melbourne because they could not find anybody in Mildura against my reforms—they could not find any and so they had to get a busload from Melbourne of NUS activists to come to Mildura. I refused to speak to them. I said, 'Go back; stop spreading your misinformation among students.' 


Labor created this mess and the adults in the room are going to fix it. We are going to work with this Senate to bring reform to higher education that delivers more opportunity for students and higher quality for universities. At the next election in two years' time, this will be one of the great achievements of the coalition government—that we made the decisions that Labor refuse to make for six years.

Ms RISHWORTH
 (Kingston) (15:42):  I am very pleased to speak on this matter of public importance. While the Minister for Education tells us about the reports he has been getting I am assuming from his staff who are talking to university students, it has been the Labor members and senators listening to the Australian people. You can imagine members and senators hearing a lot of anger and dismay from the community, because, of course, they were never told about this plan before the election. They were never told that fees would be unlimited under this government; that university fees could go as high as the universities wanted with the Americanisation of our university system. The debt sentence that students will be lumped with, if this legislation goes ahead, is not just a debt that is big at the beginning but one that grows and grows and it does not stop growing—because this legislation has real interest rates attached to student debt.


We hear that there has been absolutely no modelling of this legislation. This is an ideological frolic from those of opposite because no modelling was done and there was no mention before the election. We can only look to overseas where we have seen in the UK only two universities out of 123 go to the top threshold of university fees. Of course we hear about America—America where students are facing $1.2 trillion worth of student debt. Student debt there, now, is greater than credit card debt. This is the type of system that is being put up by those opposite.


We always hear from the Minister for Education that his reforms are universally accepted by the university sector. We know they are not supported by students, or parents, or grandparents; but they are also not universally supported by the university sector. In the Senate estimates evidence that was given, the Chief Executive of Universities Australia, Belinda Robinson, stated:


We are not backing the package as it is currently presented, far from it. Of course we do not support a reduction of 20 per cent to the revenue of Australian universities. That translates to an almost $2 billion cut to the revenue of universities. Of course we don't support that.


That was very recent. There is no support from Universities Australia for the package, despite what the Minister for Education would have you believe. We have the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Canberra, Professor Stephen Parker, who said:


I … think it is unethical for a generation of leaders who by and large benefited from free higher education to burden the generations behind them in this way.


Then we have the Victoria University Vice-Chancellor Professor Peter Dawkins who said:


 … unless there are some changes to the plan as outlined in the budget, these risks to look too high.


As we can see, we have a plan in front of the parliament that will really affect the livelihoods of many. It is, quite frankly, appalling of this government to come in here and say this will help students get access. We all know that is not true. No how much huffing and puffing there is from the Minister for Education, it will not mean greater access.


He likes to hang his hat on the Commonwealth scholarship scheme. He invoked Menzies in his speech. Indeed, Menzies did have Commonwealth scholarships; they were paid for by the government. But this government is not paying for—not putting one cent into—Commonwealth scholarships. What they are doing is increasing fees for students and then providing scholarships from that money. What we know is that for every $5 increase in fees above the cost of delivering that degree, $1 will be hived off to go to these scholarships. What that means is the higher the number of scholarships, the higher the fees of everyone else at that university; that means less access for the majority.



The Minister for Education likes to think of himself as Robin Hood. What he is actually doing is making the sector less accessible for the hundreds of thousands of young people who aspire to go to university. They will not make the choice to go to university because of the price point. This is an appalling set of circumstances and I condemn it. I call on the Senate to reject this bill. (Time expired)

"Porter, Christian, MP",LP,2014-10-28,"



Mr PORTER
 (Pearce) (15:47):  There was a recent article jointly authored by the Vice-Chancellor of La Trobe University and the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Melbourne. In it, they said:


It is no small achievement when an often divided and fractious sector unites around a major change.


Having lectured and, indeed, been involved in administration at a number of Australian universities, I must say that is an understatement of Goliath-like proportions. It is like herding cats wearing tweed jackets, trying to get universities to agree on anything. But with the notable exception of the University of Canberra, which is sticking out like a sore thumb on this one, there is almost unanimous agreement among the university sector that these reforms should be supported. In the same article it is stated that:


At stake is whether a viable higher education system can endure.


Though much rhetoric focuses on the Whitlam promise of free higher education, the present system was established by the Hawke government from 1989; it abandoned a brief experiment with free places as inequitable. What has been amazing about listening to successive runs of this debate is there is a 1974 argument, with respect to higher education reform, and then there is a 2014 argument. The 1974 policy argument dominated the higher education space for close to three decades—probably 25 years. The 1974 question is this: could Australia increase the percentage of low-income students in tertiary education by making tertiary degrees free for all tertiary students? That was the social policy argument that dominated this space for decades. But the argument was also conducted for decades in an environment where the Australian tertiary sector existed in a global market that was relatively stable—comparatively, amazingly stable.


For decades we were asking ourselves whether universal low fees, or no fees, would achieve greater participation for the sons and daughters of low-income earners. That was a logical question to ask for several decades. It was logical because we were involved, firstly, in a ceteris paribus environment internationally; things were not changing around us. But it was logical, also, because we really did not have the answer. There are two observations to make about that debate. The first is that the central question of that debate has now been unequivocally and empirically answered by every single major factual review of the sector. Does introducing deferred fees for students decrease the percentage of low-income students? No, it does not. Once introduced, does expanding the share of their fees that students are required to fund decrease the percentage of low-income students? No, it does not. Are fees the primary, or even a substantial, determinant of the percentage of low-income students? No, they are not.


In 1996 payments went up, largely under the members opposite, nearly eightfold to $900 million. Higher education participation went up from 400,000 to 525,000. Lower fees, or no fees, do not address the real or actual determinants of participation which are social conditions, parental expectations and secondary school preparation. The social policy question has been answered. No member opposite has offered anything that resembles empirical evidence to suggest otherwise. It is a dead question. The way in which you increase participation is by increasing scale.


More fundamental to that point is that the circumstances which have prevailed for decades while we answered this question have now changed irrevocably, fundamentally and with quite astonishing speed. There are two basic changes. Firstly, the number and quality of Asian universities has increased at absolutely astonishing speed and the number of students that now move from nation to nation to pursue tertiary education has similarly risen in astonishing numbers. Basically, what we are facing is that tertiary education has become a globally traded commodity. What happens if you do nothing in that environment? We had the lesson of that under the members opposite: from the 2009-10 peak, when there was no reform—and, I admit, some bungling along the way under the members opposite—there was a loss of billions of dollars in export income from the tertiary sector. Between 2009 and 2012, the number of international student enrolments fell by 130,000 students. That is not an indicator that the Australian tertiary education sector is in good health; that is an indicator of an education sector in great need of reform. To see the consensus for the grave necessity of reform, you need go no further than the universities themselves. The Australian Catholic University said:


Rejecting the package wholesale is not a vote for university equity. It is a vote against reality.


Universities Australia said:


It is simply not possible to maintain the standards that students expect or the international reputation that Australia's university system enjoys without full fee deregulation.


The Regional Universities Network said:


… the only way the sector can maintain quality and remain internationally competitive is through the deregulation of student fees.


The 1974 argument is over.

Ms BUTLER
 (Griffith) (15:52):  Today we have heard people from the government benches try to justify this incredibly terrible attack on higher education in this country. They should be ashamed. What they are doing is making it harder for working- and middle-class kids to get a higher education—and they know it. They should think twice about this terrible, regressive policy. They should think twice, because they know as well as anyone else in this chamber just how terrible this policy is. They have had the backlash from the working people of this country, from people on low and fixed incomes. 


People are not standing for these attacks on higher education. People are not going to stand for funding cuts of up to 37 per cent for undergraduate courses. They are not going to stand for it. They are not going to stand for the wholesale deregulation of university fees that is going to lead to $100,000 degrees—a lifelong debt. They are not going to stand for higher fees, nor are they going to stand for real interest rates on higher education fees. They are not going to cop fees for higher research degrees either. Most of all, they are not going to somehow start thinking those fees are a good idea just because the Minister for Education threatens to cut research—as he has so shamefully done.


These changes are atrocious. We are talking about changes that are going to see cuts to higher education funding. Where will those cuts be recouped from? They will have to be recouped from the deregulated fees. We have already seen some of the research and some of the modelling showing what the costs of these courses are going to be in the event that fees are wholly deregulated. Universities Australia tells us that, to make up for the cut to funding, the cost of engineering and science degrees will have to increase by 58 per cent, nursing degrees by 24 per cent, education degrees by 20 per cent, agriculture degrees by 43 per cent and environmental studies by 110 per cent. These are terrible figures because they speak to the gross inequity that this government is perpetrating on the Australian people. They are saying that people should not go on to higher education unless they are prepared to take on a lifetime of debt. It is the Americanisation of our university system—the sort of system where you see people paying off debt their entire life just for the privilege of getting a higher education.


On our side of this chamber we believe that higher education is a right not a privilege. We believe that education is a fundamental right. We know that the government understands that Australians think that too. Why else would Tony Abbott, when he was making every promise under the sun in a desperate attempt to get elected last year, have said that there would be no cuts to education? Because he knew that the Australian people wanted there to be no cuts to education. He understood the backlash that would come if people knew his real plans for the higher education sector. Now people do know and they are not going to stand for it.


These sorts of funding cuts of up to 37 per cent for undergraduate degrees are going to mean that universities will have to recoup those moneys from students and their families. Why would anyone think that a lifetime of debt might not be a consideration when a young person is deciding whether or not to go to university—the choice of whether to go in the first place? That is not to mention mature age students. What are mature age students expected to do with hundred-thousand-dollar degrees? How are they meant to reskill?


I have spoken in this House before about a mature age student who has written to me worried about the effect of a real interest rate on the HECS fees that she has already been incurring—and she is not the only one. A lot of students have spoken to me about their concern about what such an interest rate would mean—and not just students. From a workforce planning perspective those industries where jobs are lower paid than those at the top end of town—for example, corporate lawyers—are worried about whether people are going to be prepared to come and work in those lower paid jobs when they have such a big debt with such a high interest rate.


People who work in a not-for-profit organisation, for example, or a smaller firm or a lower paid occupation already pay a penalty in the form of lower wages. But they are going to have to pay an additional penalty. Not only are they going to be slugged with a massive debt, but because it will take longer to pay off that debt, they will pay more because of the effect of the real interest rate. That is why people who are running those small not-for-profits are very worried about the effect that these changes are going to have on their ability to attract good quality staff.


It is not just a question of what might happen to those people who are worried about workforce planning. This is a policy area that has led to a massive backlash across this nation from people concerned about the way that this government intends to change the shape of this nation.

 (Barker) (15:52):  So much to say, so little time. I will begin by calling this what it is: one hell of a scare campaign. I would love to say I am not a punter, but I am—and I would be prepared to lay odds that the Labor Party have focus-grouped the words 'Americanisation', 'debt sentence' and 'hundred-thousand-dollar degrees'. It would be nice to come into this place and have a mature debate about an important structural reform that this country needs. But that is not what we are getting. In the lead-up to question time, during 90-second statements, the member for Perth came in and talked about a constituent who was already, as a result of the 'changes', modifying the way she was going about her tertiary degree. These are changes that would come into effect, if we legislate them, in 2016! 


Because this is a scare campaign, the debate is being reframed by the Labor Party. It is no longer about increasing competition in the tertiary sector. It is not about telling the Australian people that they will not need to pay for their degrees up-front and that they will only be asked to repay the cost of their degree once they are earning over $50,000. It is not a debate about the fact that currently 60 per cent of the Australian population subsidise the 40 per cent to get a tertiary degree to the tune of 60 per cent and that this legislation will recalibrate that to a split of fifty-fifty; but rather, disingenuously, it is a debate about, effectively, free education—a debate that was put to bed in the seventies.


I thought I might just reflect on a once proud leader of the Labor Party, Paul Keating:


There is no such thing, of course, as ""free"" education. Someone has to pay. In systems with no charges, those somebody's are all taxpayers.


But do not take it from a former leader of the Labor Party; let's take it from a member of the current Labor Party who sits just down there—I suspect he is just outside being subjected to another re-education program—Dr Andrew Leigh:


Australian universities should be free to set student fees according to the market for their degrees. A deregulated or market based HECS will make the student contribution system fairer, because the fees students pay will more closely approximate the value they receive through future earnings.


That is sensible and it is probably the reason why he is being re-educated as we speak!


In the time I have a remaining I want to highlight the benefits to regional students.



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr PASIN:
  You know what? I am going to give you an example of sub-bachelor degrees. If those opposite new where Mt Gambier was, I could tell that recently a collaboration between the University of South Australia and the world-renowned Australian jazz musician James Morrison was formed to established the James Morrison Academy of Music. That is a collaboration between James Morrison and the University of South Australia. When it begins it will provide sub-bachelor degrees to 70 students. They are diplomas and associate degrees. These tertiary opportunities would not be funded under the existing HELP legislation. Under the current legislation that those opposite support who want to get a Diploma in Music or an Associate Degree in Music from Mt Gambier's jazz centre of excellence, the James Morrison Academy, would have to—wait for it—stump the money up-front. Do you know what they get if those in the other place accept our very sensible reforms? Would they get is an opportunity to undertake that study and become world renowned jazz musicians, and they get it via a mechanism wherein they do not have to pay any money up front—not a cent. Under those opposite they would have to pay up-front every single cent. Under our proposals they are eligible for the Higher Education Loan Program.


I would love the member for Kingston to come to Mt Gambier with me next year and we will talk to those students and we will tell them—the member for Kingston will be honest with them, I am sure, and she will say, 'I wanted you to pay up-front, but that bloke over there, the member for Barker, he was happy for you to— (Time expired)

Mr CONROY
 (Charlton) (16:03):  It is a great pleasure to follow the member for Barker, who was a great loss to Mt Gambier City Council, I must say! I was glad to hear him quoting Keating, because being lectured by the member for Barker is 'like being flogged by a wet lettuce'.


Let's go back to taws on MPIs, because when we go back and talk about the Liberals' higher education policy, we like to go to their source material. We cannot trust what they say; we have to see what they put in writing. Plenty of speakers in these debates have gone to Real solutions, their election policy shield. But I am not going to touch on this today. I am going to go back to the two thought pieces that guided the brains trust of the coalition, and that is Battlelines and Hockey: Not Your Average Joe.


When I turned Battlelines, which is the Prime Minister's manifesto—his bible—can people guess how many mentions of higher education there are in the book.




Mr Laurie Ferguson:
  Two.




Mr CONROY:
  Sadly, the member for Werriwa is very optimistic. There are zero mentions of universities. But that actually stands in good stead compared to Hockey: Not Your Average Joe, which, for the Treasurer has been the publication that his damaged his career the second most. Unfortunately, the budget has been the publication that has damaged his career the most. But when you go to Hockey: Not Your Average Joe and I look at his first mention of university and I read from it—this is in chapter 3:


The first of his siblings to make it to university, Joe walked into his class on day one drunk. 'I walked into my first lecture and fell asleep.'



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr CONROY:
  Exactly! Sadly, the Liberals' policy on higher education shows all the seriousness and commitment that the member for North Sydney demonstrated on his first day at university. That is a great tragedy, because this is an incredibly serious debate. Education is vital for our economy and vital for our society. What those on the other side are doing is closing the door on a generation of working class students. In the seat of Charlton four out of five graduates are in nursing and education. What these changes do, according to Universities Australian—a group those on the other side are very keen to quote all the time—is that a female nursing graduate could have a debt at the end of the course of $100,000. She would generated a debt of $100,000 for a nursing degree and she will pay it off over the course of 27 years. How is that fair—to have a 100,000 grand debt over the course of 27 years; or engineering—we need more engineers in this country and we need more female engineers? But according to Universities Australia, they could face a total debt to be paid off of $200,000. What a disgrace.


Let us look at the equity aspects, because those on the other side like to talk about the sub-bachelor degree level. One of the great avenues for education in higher education is for mature age students participating in part-time studies. I am proud that the university in my area, the University of Newcastle, has got a great tradition in this. I often hear the member for Newcastle talking about this all the time, because it is a great contribution. Fifty per cent of University of Newcastle are not school leavers and they will face the greatest disadvantage because they are turned off the most by high debt, high interest rates that mean in their limited time left in the workforce they will be paying off this debt.


I was asked earlier for evidence. You do not have to go further than the United Kingdom, where before their changes to university fees they had part-time undergraduate enrolments of 230,000 people. Within two years it fell to 139,000, an almost 100,000 drop in part-time undergraduate students. That is what we face in this country. This is what we face with their Americanisation of the system—a system where you will see registered nurses paying 100 grand and taking 27 years to pay off a degree, where you will see female engineers facing a $200,000 debt. This is the great vision they have for this country—a myopic, short-term vision that will penalise working-class people who want to be the first in their family to get to university. They will stand condemned by history for their focus on petty penny-pinching rather than investing in this nation's greatest asset: our next generation.

"Christensen, George, MP",Nats,2014-10-28,"



Mr CHRISTENSEN
 (Dawson—The Nationals Deputy Whip) (16:08):  We see from the attitude of the member for Charlton in his speech why they call him 'the nasty Conroy'! The member for Barker was unfairly compared to a wet lettuce; I have to say a head of lettuce is normally fresh and crisp, but the previous speaker was certainly nothing of the two. It showed that he did not even have a head there with what he said about university fee deregulation in the United Kingdom. As the facts show, lower socioeconomic students have actually taken up more university education in that country since fee deregulation.


I speak from personal experience here because I come from a low-socioeconomic background. I was the first in my family to attend university. I did not come from a background with a silver spoon; both parents were on welfare at the time. I went to university through a bank loan to fund the accommodation and set-up costs that I needed. I did not worry about the fees, because I knew we had a system—a system we are still going to have in place—where I could put that on the future. I could put those university fees into a debt system that would be the best ever because I did not have to repay that until I started earning over $50,000, and then it was quite affordable.


That is the experience for many other regional students, I have to say. The biggest challenges for them and their families are the accommodation and set-up costs, not the fees which do not have to be up front and can be paid at a later time when you can afford to pay them. The accommodation, food and electricity—the establishment costs—are the biggest detractors for regional students in particular in going off to university.


We in the regions wonder where the Leader of the Opposition is coming from on this. The member for Barker put it quite rightly that these reforms actually ensure that sub-bachelor degrees are not just going to be the up-front fee degrees. They will be able to be put on the HELP system. These reforms will make it better for those students who are impacted by the tyranny of distance and have to pay all those up-front fees. A university could decide now—and this is something that CQ University, my alma mater, might be deciding upon—to package up a degree which incorporates the costs of accommodation and set-up in their residential college, so you could have students who can move from afar and put the whole cost of the degree, including the living costs, onto the FEE-HELP, which they can pay later on in life when they can afford to do it. That is a better outcome for lower socioeconomic students and a better outcome for regional students.


We have heard about $100,000 degrees, and isn't that ridiculous? The University of Western Australia, one of the world's top 100 universities, has announced that they will charge $16,000 a year for an undergraduate degree under the fee deregulation. A three-year degree will cost less than $50,000; and, if it did cost as much as $50,000, they will not pay a cent until they earn $50,000 or over. When they earn $50,000 or over, they will repay about $20 a week, less than $3 a day, to earn more than 75 per cent of non-university graduates. That is a great investment.


So regional students are supported by these measures, and so they should be. The abolition of the unfair 20 per cent loan fee on VET FEE-HELP loans will benefit another 80,000 students. The abolition of the unfair 25 per cent loan fee on FEE-HELP will benefit more than 50,000 students. The Commonwealth scholarship scheme will be the largest in Australia's history, helping students who, like me, are from low-socioeconomic backgrounds, helping them with their living costs and other supports. That is where the disincentive is, as I said.


I want to talk very briefly about CQ University very briefly. The vice-chancellor there is very keen for these reforms. He said:


There are two types of universities: those that see change, wring their hands and say 'Oh woe is me'. And then there are others that lick their lips. We are a lip-licking university.


These reforms will allow unis like CQU to offer those packages I talked about. That is what regional students need. They do not need the Labor Party blocking this. They should be working with us to develop a sustainable funding model for university education instead of harping on. This opposition leader's MPI is like his name: short in substance, short in truth!

"O'Neil, Clare, MP",ALP,2014-10-28,"



Ms O'NEIL
 (Hotham) (16:13):  It has been such a significant week for us Labor people as we have celebrated the life and leadership of Gough Whitlam. Gough Whitlam was an enormous visionary, and we have heard over the last week such important statements of that on both sides of the House—of this big man, this big thinker who brought big ideas into this parliament. Gough Whitlam spent a decades-long career in this parliament fighting for a fair go, for the right of all Australian children to have the best quality health care and, most importantly, to have access to education.


Since that time, education and access to education has become an article of faith for Labor. Labor leader after Labor leader after Labor leader has fought for the right of every Australian child to have the opportunity to get the best education. We saw under the Hawke and Keating governments year 12 retention rates go from about 45 per cent of all young people in this country to 77 per cent—one of the great unsung achievements of that government. And every leader since then has joined this fight. We do today in this same tradition.



Mr Ewen Jones interjecting—


I have spoken a little bit about Gough Whitlam, and we know it was a very different Australia that he was the leader of.




Mr Ewen Jones:
  Where's the injustice?




Ms O'NEIL:
  If you don't mind, I will have a few moments to have my own words on this.


Australia was a very different place under the time of Whitlam. My mother tells me that people put on a hat and gloves before they went into town. God Save the Queen was our national anthem. But one of the features of that time was that families and parents around Australia had to make very cruel choices about which of their children would go on and access higher education that all of those young people deserved. In my mother's family, they had to make that difficult decision. Three daughters and one son: who do you think got the chance to go on and access higher education? So I say today, in this tradition, that we are opposed to the Americanisation of our system. We are opposed to $100,000 degrees. We are opposed to a system where the young people of this country have their access to higher education determined by the size of their parents' wallets rather than the intellect and motivation of those young people.


I want to talk about some of the issues that we see with this system. When we hear those on the other side of the House argue about this system, they are unfortunately very clouded by their vision of Australia—the chums that they went along to private schools with or that they went to university with; the people who many of them represent in their electorates—but I want to tell them a little bit about what happens in my electorate. I want to talk about the suburb of Springvale—one of the suburbs I am very proud to represent. Do you know what the median income is in Springvale per household? It is $49,000. That means half of the people who live in the electorate of Springvale live in a household where $49,000 is less than their entire family income. I think it is important that we put this into context: when we talk about $140,000 or $100,000 for degrees—that we will see, that we know we will see because Universities Australia have told us this—we are talking about more than double the entire annual household income for one of these families. When I talk to these families about how this will affect their decision to educate their children, they tell me that they would be incredibly uncomfortable with taking on anything like that level of debt, and I think if your household income was $49,000 a year you probably would not feel too excited about taking out a $100,000 loan either.


I really want to spend some time addressing the argument that has been made that because there will be scholarships provided that somehow this will resolve the equity argument. Firstly, I want to point out how profoundly unfair that is. Why should we take a handful of the brightest young people from lower socioeconomic families and decide that they are allowed to go to university while a much broader range of students from more wealthy families will get the opportunity to go to university. In Australia that is simply not how we do things. Secondly, I want to point out that when we look at trying to deal with the equity problem by looking at the experience of scholarships overseas, we see that it just simply does not work. We know that those on the other side are so in love with the American-style system—




An honourable member interjecting
—





Ms O'NEIL:
  I will take a lead from there. When we look at a university like Harvard, they have enormous problems getting equity in their undergraduate population. So what do they do? They say to every American family, 'If your family earns less than $40,000 you can come to Harvard 100 per cent for free'—they will pay your fees, they will pay your board, they will pay for your food, they will pay for everything. Of their 1,650 freshman students that came in last year, do you know how many came in under that program? Fifteen. The reason for that is because this is about setting expectations. We want the message to go out to every young person in this country that you are entitled to a fair go, and like every Labor Party caucus before us, we will fight to the end on this issue.

"Whiteley, Brett, MP",LP,2014-10-28,"



Mr WHITELEY
 (Braddon) (16:18):  The people opposite, they have no shame. I would not think the universities of this great country are normally on the side of the blue team, I would not think so, but right now every university in this country, bar one, is supporting this legislation, with some amendments. That is a fact.


What universities want is to see an end to the uncertainty of funding, and let me give you an example of what happened. When this lot over here, the Labor Party, took the reins of power in 2007, they undertook to make these great promises to the higher education sector to win great popularity and support. And what happened in that six years? That lot over there, the so-called supporters today of higher education, cut $6.6 billion out of higher education funding. They wanted to fund Gonski; where did they find the first $1.2 billion? Higher education. Let us have a look here. Removal of the 10 per cent HECS-HELP discount—I would have thought that would have been a huge help to lower socioeconomic people in this country—for a saving of $276 million, or what they would call a cut. Would you believe it? A cut from the Labor Party! Converting students' start-up scholarships—again, these are for people who need that little bit of help. They converted them into what? Student loans—$1.182 billion; $6.6 billion of cuts from that lot over there. They are hypocrites to the nth degree because those people over there claim that they are the friends of higher education. They are not. The universities of Australia are crying out for certainty. They want to get rid of the uncertainty and the ongoing argy-bargy of funding because they want to get on with educating our young people.


Let us get this right; it is very simple: higher education is the third biggest exporter in this country—$15 billion. Have a guess how much it was when this lot over here, the Labor Party, took power in 2007. It was $19 billion. We have already lost $4 billion because they took their eyes off the ball. All I can say is that the future of higher education under Labor in this country is totally unsustainable. We are already falling behind other competitive areas in the world, behind Asia. We are going to continue to see, if we do not make reforms, fewer and fewer people coming to this country to study. Do you know what that means over there, Labor? It means that the cross-subsidies that are going into the education of our children today will be lost and education fees will go through the roof—but that is under your vision, not ours.


The competition from Asia now is intense. We need to get back in the game and that is what the universities of Australia want; that is what they are asking for. And as I said when I started this speech, they are not normally on our team but on this occasion they are. They are rock-solid behind the education reform of the minister of this government, and that is what they are looking for. They are seeing you as nothing but cheap shooters; you are all about cheap shots, scaring the hell out of everybody across Australia with this $100,000 fee.


I know a little bit about American education, I have got family that are in it, and in this country grandparents do not have to give up their superannuation and their savings to help put their grandkids through university. Parents do not have to take mortgages against their homes to put their kids through university. That is the great thing about this country: no-one will have to come up with one cent of cash. It does not matter how rich or how poor you are, not one cent to enter the best universities in this country. And it is an absolutely dishonest campaign by that party over there, the Labor Party, who have lost their way; they have no vision. They should be ashamed of themselves. They should start telling the truth, and that should start with the Leader of the Opposition—I am not sure the last time I heard a straight sentence come out of his mouth.

Ms GAMBARO
 (Brisbane) (16:22):  On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I present the committee's report entitled Review of the Defence Annual Report 2012-13. I ask leave of the House to make a short statement in connection with the report.


Leave granted. 




Ms GAMBARO:
  On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I have pleasure in presenting the committee's first report for the 44th Parliament, entitled Review of the Defence Annual Report 2012-13. 


The review of the defence annual report is an important oversight activity. It provides an opportunity for the committee to inquire into a broad range of defence issues as part of the process of accountability of government agencies to parliament. The Defence Subcommittee considers this to be a key part of its role. 


The subcommittee resolved to focus on five main areas for its review: 


Asset management and capital investment programs;


Defence Cooperation Program;


Naval combat capabilities;


Air combat capability; and


Defence Materiel Organisation and Capability Development Group.


The subcommittee heard from Defence officials at the public hearing held on 6 June. It also received evidence from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, and two small- to medium-sized enterprises, QinetiQ and Nova Systems.


As part of its review, the subcommittee considered Defence estate issues, including the cost pressures associated with the maintenance of heritage listed buildings. The committee recommends government should review the process by which Defence properties are placed on the Commonwealth Heritage List and how their maintenance is funded. 


The subcommittee also considered the efficacy of Defence contracts to ensure that SMEs are paid in a timely manner by prime contractors. Based on evidence received, the committee recommends that the government should review its contract templates and procurement processes.


The subcommittee considered the scope of the Defence Cooperation Program and options for a whole-of-government approach to supporting regional partners. Noting the complexities of achieving a structured and coordinated regional security effect, the committee commends Defence on the development of a future framework in the Pacific. However, Australia needs to ensure that it is achieving value for money with the Defence Cooperation Program, and specifically the Pacific Patrol Boat Program.


During the course of the review it became apparent that, despite some positive developments, Defence's approach to capability management remains fragmented. There does not appear to be a single continuous system which Defence can use to conduct capability assurance from definition, through acquisition and service life, to disposal. 


The committee believes that the introduction of such a system, managed by the Vice Chief of the Defence Force, would increase transparency and enhance oversight by the government and the parliament of capability management by Defence.


That being said, it was pleasing to see some positive outcomes arising from the SEA 1000 Industry Integrated Project Team—a working group made up of Defence and industry experts who are developing the design brief for the new submarines and examining potential industries able to execute such a project. The committee encourages the further development of this initiative along with transparent communication of the team's view to government.


The committee believes that expertise within the private sector could be leveraged for all stages of the capability development life cycle. Rather than contracting for specific packets of work, greater benefit could be gained by entering into teaming arrangements as part of a whole-of-life approach to identifying and managing risk.


The committee was also concerned by the lack of detail in the Defence annual report on the progress of implementation of all the Coles review recommendations relating to the Collins class submarines. This is something that needs to be expanded upon in future Defence annual reports.


Other recommendations made by the committee include the use of independent subject matter experts in a system of gate reviews as part of the seaworthiness system, and enhanced reporting on Defence's cybersecurity capability.


It is disappointing to note that the committee is still awaiting a response from Defence to the recommendations of its previous Defence annual report review, which was tabled in June last year. The committee hopes to receive a response to its previous review shortly.


I also would like to commend the chair of the Defence Subcommittee, Senator David Fawcett, and Deputy Chair, Deb O'Neill, and other members for their great diligence and great efforts in producing this report. My special thanks go to the committee secretariat. I would like to thank Jerome Brown and all of the work that the secretariat have done, and their professionalism. 


The committee acknowledges the dedication and the commitment of the service men and women of the Australian Defence Force and commends them on the outstanding service that they have provided to the nation. The committee recognises that the members of the ADF are supported by an enduring network of families, friends and loved ones and to these people we owe our thanks.


Finally, the committee notes the loss of Lance Corporal Todd Chidgey during 2014. Our deepest condolences and our thoughts are extended to his family and friends.


I commend the report to the House.

"Gray, Gary, MP",ALP,2014-10-28,"



Mr GRAY
 (Brand) (16:29):  The opposition will be supporting the Parliamentary Entitlements Legislation Amendment Bill 2014. The bill adjusts entitlements for serving parliamentarians and the bill attends to issues that affect retired parliamentarians. The bill also abolishes the gold pass. 


Although the opposition will be supporting this bill through this place and will support the bill when it gets to the Senate, there are issues attached to this bill and the bill should be improved. It should be improved for its content, its purpose and its practical operability. That is why I have referred it to the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee. I hope that in that committee process we can improve the poor structure and purpose of the bill and that can be attended to in an effective and efficient manner.


The government's purpose here is good. Abolishing the gold pass is a good thing to do. We had closed the gold pass in 2012. We believed that that was both a safe course of action and a prudent course of action. The government's choice to abolish the gold pass is an action that is supported by the opposition and an action that is contained in this bill.


I am concerned that other changes in the bill have not been driven by or even properly considered by the Remuneration Tribunal. They should have been. Any matter affecting the entitlements and remuneration—certainly the salary and conditions—of MPs should only ever get into this place after it has been thoroughly considered by the Remuneration Tribunal and recommended by the Remuneration Tribunal. Not to have the Remuneration Tribunal fully considering and recommending is a weakness. I accept that the Remuneration Tribunal has been consulted in part on these measures, but these measures do not arise organically out of the consideration by the Remuneration Tribunal.


The reason the Remuneration Tribunal is structured as it is is to simply separate decisions about MPs' entitlements and conditions from us the parliamentarians. We carefully select the Remuneration Tribunal members. Some have been members for in excess of a decade. They have in mind why decisions were made in 2008 and why they were made in 2012 and how they might relate to decisions that get made in 2014. That body of wisdom and that consideration has not been brought to bear on this bill. Politicians should not be writing their own entitlement arrangements even though on this occasion what this bill does is abolish a significant entitlement and create new entitlements in other areas.


Let us go through it in some detail. It cuts travel for dependent children. I can see no good purpose, at a time when our work and lifestyle in this place are hard enough on families, to make that change for the travel of dependent children, albeit for children aged over 18 and under 25. They are still in the category of dependent children. No parliament has ever done that.


It cuts the entitlement to travel for former prime ministers. We have never in this chamber cut an entitlement for a former Prime Minister. I was asked to do it once by former Prime Minister Julia Gillard and I refused to do it. We should refuse to do it this time too. Our former prime ministers do immense good work. Even when that immense good work is in a partisan way and even when that immense good work is to support their political parties, they are still functioning in our community as former prime ministers. 


I can tell you quite honestly that John Howard coming down to campaign in my electorate would be a good thing for visibility in the city of Rockingham, Kwinana or Mandurah, as it was when Bob Hawke came to Kwinana, Rockingham and Mandurah. These are good things for former prime ministers to be doing. But more important than that our former prime ministers travel our country bringing exposure to issues and communities in ways that only add to the service that they have already committed to in this place. I would not cut one single entitlement of a former Prime Minister.


The bill imposes cost-recovery onto ministers for errors made by others. The ministers may not even know of, or even reasonably be expected to know about, these errors that may have occurred by the minister's staff. The bill creates a cost-recovery process that the minister may not understand that comes from a future travel entitlement payment to that minister. This is not transparency. This is not effective governance.


No-one is standing in this place arguing in support of loosening our system, but it has to be practical and it has to be workable. The measures in this bill take it beyond the workability stage. It is not wise legislation and I would replace it if I were the minister at no additional cost to the taxpayer. I would seek advice and publish the advice from the Remuneration Tribunal. There are unwise measures in this bill and they can be fixed at no additional cost to the taxpayer and they will produce, I am convinced, better outcomes, better transparency, better management systems and hold not just members and senators accountable but also those people in the Department of Finance who sign off on travel and travel allowances for members. It was my experience as a former minister that there were occasions when my then department got things wrong. Embarrassment was created for members of parliament when the department got things wrong. I used to ask the department to apologise directly to the members and senators who had been the victims of the errors made by the department. I think that is an important point of accountability too.


I understand some retired members will challenge this legislation in the High Court. I disassociate myself from that. I am enthusiastic to support the parts of this bill that abolish the gold pass and previous legislation under my time as minister that may also be challenged in the High Court. Labor supports this bill but thinks it can be improved. It will not be improved in the High Court. In government I worked with the opposition minor parties and even the crossbenchers to introduce measures that were proposed, always proposed, by the Remuneration Tribunal. They addressed areas of salaries. They addressed areas of entitlement use. They addressed areas of accountability, and they were always agreed on the basis of the independence of the Remuneration Tribunal and, dare I say it, the integrity that was brought to the table by a genuinely bipartisan approach to resolving these issues. I congratulate the now Speaker of this place on the terrific role that she played when shadow minister.


In 2012, one measure that we changed was to remove the non-gold passed, post-service travel from 25 return trips, which is what it was from 2004—25 return trips at business class to anywhere in Australia, and that applied for five years. We replaced it with five trips to Canberra in the six months after leaving parliament. That may have been an extreme cut, but I do not think any of us could genuinely justify 25 return trips at the conclusion of parliamentary service. Those five fares in six months have changed in this bill to 10 trips per year over six years. That seems excessive when the Remuneration Tribunal had been asked to consider cost-less measures—measures that did not cost the taxpayer anything, such as making the resettlement payment a redundancy payment, a measure that would not have cost the taxpayer. 


Currently, when a member or senator ceases their term of duty and are thrown out by the people—they lose an election—there is a resettlement allowance paid if you have served more than one term in the parliament, or two terms or three. Because that is paid as salary it is taxed as salary. It should be a redundancy payment. It is a cost-less measure that could be attended to that is about fairness and is about the proper equal treatment of parliamentarians as with other classes of employees, albeit employed by the parliament. I regret that I did not get an opportunity to attend to that measure; I simply did not know it existed as a problem until after the last election.


I have had raised with me since the last election the possibility of self-managed superannuation funds also being available to receive parliamentary superannuation payments. It never occurred to me that that was not the case. That is a cost-less measure. I would have done that in a blink of an eye if I had been asked. There are measures that can be done that support, enhance and assist parliamentarians that literally do not cost a cent.


Other measures that are needed could be funded through winding back the 60 post-service travel trips, and they include occupational health and safety sickness benefit insurance. It is missing for MPs and senators. An MP or a senator who is injured at work is entirely at risk for that cost themselves. I know that because I enjoyed the hospitality of the Western Australian hospital system as a consequence of a cardiac event that I sustained in the north of Western Australia in 2011 on the duty of a parliamentarian. 


It should be the case that from the point of election to the point of not being a parliamentarian, 24 hours a day and seven days a week, we in this place are covered for simple occupational health and safety benefit insurance. It is a cheap thing to do, especially for a class of people such as parliamentarians and senators whereas individually the cost of carrying that insurance is quite high—on occasions for an individual as high as $6,000. We have seen former MPs and senators leave their service having been harmed. Our resettlement provisions are not adequate and should be considered by the Remuneration Tribunal in light of modern employment practices. Any changes should be funded by reconsideration of the 10 trips per year as allocated in my earlier reference.


The measures in this bill do not build upon the processes that had been created throughout what we used to call the Minchin protocol or the high-level Department of Finance processes for considering when an MP or a senator has got something wrong or has deliberately made a mistake. The process right now is under the Minchin protocol—so called because former Special Minister of State, Nick Minchin, in the late 1990s designed it. Should any of us—any of the 226 members or senators—have even a reference made in a newspaper or on a website about potential entitlement abuse, the Department of Finance looks at it. They consider it, they look at it and they make a decision as to whether or not they need to carry out a further level of investigation. It is a good system. The member is not informed until such time as the member or senator needs to be informed. The minister is not informed. It is a good process. It protects the integrity of our system and it allows all of us to know that, should a question be raised about the behaviour of any of us, there is a very good system that has survived 15 years, designed by former minister Nick Minchin in order to protect not only the taxpayer but also the integrity of parliamentarians.


The measures in this bill, unless amended, will cause ministers great concern, and that is not productive. It is not useful, and in my view it is not probity. The opposition will support the government to pass this bill. When governments wish to attend to matters such as the gold pass in this way, they deserve to have the complete support of our parliament and they will have that. We would prefer to improve the bill. As I have said, at the first opportunity I will support a full reconsideration of the measures funded by the unnecessary expenses created by this bill and on the advice of recommendation of the Remuneration Tribunal will present an amending bill.


We believe better processes exist to deal with incorrect payments. I am not here referring to the 25 per cent surcharge for any incorrect claims; that is fine. I am dealing here with the processes for investigating and then allocating that decision. Transparency should also include the Department of Finance documenting the advice it gives to MPs and senators. It should provide advice and it should keep that advice on file for consistent advice's purpose. Consistent advice is important to parliamentarians. For instance, the bill requires that all travel post-service be for public benefit. It sounds good, but I do not think it would include travel to attend Gough Whitlam's funeral—and I think it should. And I am not even prepared to advise any of my friends who are former parliamentarians to seek advice from the department on whether or not they could utilise their travel to attend the funeral of the former Prime Minister; it is just too risky, and this bill makes it unnecessarily risky.


Because we cannot get the advice that helps parliamentarians and senators do their job well, sometimes there are things that we just cannot do. The bill cuts the ability of former Prime Ministers to function. We have never thought this dignified or useful. We should not be cutting the ability or capability of our former Prime Minister's, even to campaign. I know that if any us or if any journalists contact a former Prime Minister, any of our former Prime Minister's would say: take it away. They are decent people. They deserve to be protected by us. They do not deserve to be cut by us.


I would like to see our former Prime Ministers travel. I would like to see Malcolm Fraser, Bob Hawke, John Howard, Paul Keating, Julia Gillard and Kevin Rudd all active and travelling our country. Let's not cut the ability of our former MPs to function in our community or in our political community. Let's make their travel and their ability to function unlimited, as annoying as that would be to all of us on occasions. But enjoyable it would be to the fabric of our political community and our broader community to see these men and women continuing to do their work in our community and for our community. The bill introduces even more bureaucracy, paperwork and cost. It does nothing to make the work of MPs or ministers or officers of the parliament more effective.


In conclusion, I want to work with the government to fix this bill. By all means pass it if you need to but let's do better than that. Let's improve its effect upon MPs and senators, fix some of the problems and save some money. Get the gold pass abolished and do some good, and do it on the advice of the Remuneration Tribunal not on the thoughts and the whims that have come to us in the form of this bill. When this bill is put to a vote, the opposition will support it and support it to a person. I tell the government: we can do better, we should do better and we are prepared to do better. Through the Senate committee, I hope that is one very good way that we can make this bill do better.

"Taylor, Angus, MP",LP,2014-10-28,"



Mr TAYLOR
 (Hume) (16:47):  I rise today to support the Parliamentary Entitlements Legislation Amendment Bill 2014, which will reduce the life gold pass travel entitlement before abolishing the scheme for all other than former Prime Ministers. The bill will also strengthen the rules governing parliamentarians' expenses.


The issue of parliamentary salaries, allowances and entitlements generates much interest and comment in the community and, of course, much interest and comment around this building. In my own electorate of Hume, I often receive correspondence, calls and personal approaches from constituents on this issue. Many believe that current parliamentary entitlements are out of step with what the community thinks is reasonable. I accept that some of this commentary and feedback is driven by a level of cynicism in the community in relation to politicians and political life. But for me, as the federal member for Hume, I never forget that it is the taxpayers of Australia that pay my salary. I know that the majority of my constituents work hard each day to meet their commitments and to pay their bills at the end of every week and every month. As their local representative, I know they want me to work hard and act with integrity to ensure that their lives and burdens get easier, not harder. I know that most reasonable constituents do not begrudge my salary if they believe I am quite literally busting a gut for them. And that is what I seek to do every day.


I am delighted to report that one year into this job, I know what most representatives in this House do for their constituents every day. Some of the very best work in this place goes completely unnoticed but that is the nature of public service. I think that some of the cynicism about politicians stems from the lack of transparency about how we spend our time and that is something which I seek to address with, amongst other things, very regular Facebook posts. But it is crucially important that the remuneration and benefits we receive are in line with community expectations and are in line with changing employment patterns outside of this parliament.


We know that many former parliamentarians have a very successful career beyond their time in this place, often facilitated by the experience and networks they developed while here. Years ago, one career was enough. But these days many of us have a series of careers, and that is a good thing. This legislation is simply one of a series of reforms in this area over the last 10 years intended to bring parliamentary remuneration and entitlements more into line with changing community expectations and changing employment arrangements.


In relation to superannuation, a very common bone of contention for some of my constituents, changes have previously been made to the parliamentary contributory superannuation scheme. This was a defined benefit scheme which provided for rates of retiring allowance varying from 50 per cent of parliamentary allowance after eight years' service up to 75 per cent parliamentary allowance after a service of 18 years or more. The changes closed the scheme to new members from 2004 and moved parliamentarians to an accumulation scheme under the Parliamentary Superannuation Act 2004. I believe this is in line with most of my constituency in their own employment agreements and so it was a good reform.


Senators and members can have their superannuation paid to a complying superannuation fund or to a retirement savings account of their choice, subject to the same rules that apply to employees in the private sector and public service, and it has the same preservation age. It is true that the contribution from the Commonwealth at 15.4 per cent of salary, is, I acknowledge, more generous than most employer schemes.


In relation to MPs' entitlements, in 2009 the Australian National Audit Office highlighted the shortcomings in the management of these entitlements. The ANAO said that it was difficult to understand and manage for both the parliamentarians and the Department of Finance, which administers the entitlements. 


The audit supported a review of the entitlements framework and greater transparency in the system. Before this, entitlements had not been comprehensively reviewed since 1971. In December 2009 in response to the ANAO report, the government set up a committee to review parliamentary entitlements, chaired by a former senior public servant, Barbara Belcher. The report from this review, the Belcher review, drew a distinction between remuneration and tools of trade, or entitlements, such as office facilities and transport. It recommended that salary be dealt with by the Remuneration Tribunal, while entitlements would be dealt with by a single piece of legislation. The government accepted the recommendations of the Belcher review, and from August 2011 the Remuneration Tribunal was given the power to determine parliamentary base salary and is required to publish reasons for its decision on parliamentary remuneration. Under legislation the parliament does not have the power to disallow parliamentary remuneration determinations made by the tribunal. In other words, our remuneration is no longer in our hands. 


Further in December 2011 the Remuneration Tribunal made a number of recommendations, including: the parliamentary base salary be set at $185,000; the prospective closure of the Life Gold Pass Scheme; termination of the overseas study travel entitlement; greatly limited severance travel entitlement; severance of the link between pensions under the old superannuation scheme and current parliamentarians' salaries. These recommendations were accepted and legislation to effect these changes came into effect March 2012.


Since coming to office, this government has been exploring opportunities to make sensible changes to the parliamentary entitlements framework, including those of former parliamentarians, to ensure that we deliver value for money, openness and transparency. This is always an extremely tricky area. I fully acknowledge that we are impacting many who have made an enormous contribution to this country over a long period of time. Former parliamentarians from all sides of politics deserve our greatest respect. And, as a parliamentarian myself, I now understand the scale of the commitment so many of these people make to our country.


But travel entitlements beyond the life of a job are unusual in this day and age. Community standards and expectations are changing dramatically, and it is unreasonable to expect taxpayers to pay for something that they cannot expect from their own employment relationships. In addition, it is increasingly true that parliamentarians can expect a career, often a lucrative career, beyond their time in this place. 


Some of my constituents argue that former parliamentarians should be constrained in some way, particularly with respect to lobbying. However, I will always defend the right of former parliamentarians to remain involved in the political process. They have a wisdom and experience that makes them extraordinarily valuable to society for many years beyond their time here. 


The changes announced in November 2013 and in the 2014-15 budget and encompassed in this legislation reflect community standards, ensuring that taxpayers' money is well spent. This bill amends the Members of Parliament (Life Gold Pass) Act 2002 and changes the title to the Parliamentary Retirement Travel Act 2002 to better reflect the intent of the legislation. It will reduce, remove and reform travel entitlements for holders of the parliamentary retirement travel entitlement for both current and former senators and members. 


Specifically, the bill: imposes time limits on using the entitlements; and imposes limits on access to the entitlements, including closing it to people who have not met the qualifying periods before 14 May this year, and mandating that no-one can access benefits under the scheme, except for a former PM, if they retire from 1 January 2020 onwards. The bill reduces the number of trips per financial year under the entitlement for the time it is still in operation. The bill removes the ability of spouses and partners to access the entitlement, other than retired former PMs, and removes the entitlement to travel by a spouse or partner of the PM or a sitting former PM.


Lastly, and importantly, the bill requires that all parliamentary retirement travel, including travel by the spouse or de facto partner of a retired former prime minister, be for the public benefit. That is an extremely important aspect of this; it should always be for the public benefit. That means that in practice it does not include travel for a commercial or private purpose. 


This current legislation will also amend the parliamentary entitlements framework to: impose a 25 per cent penalty on travel claims that require subsequent adjustment more than 28 days after being first submitted; limit the entitlement provided to the dependent children of senior officeholders to those who are less than 18 years of age. Just to clarify that: a senior officeholder is a minister, the President of the Senate, Speaker of the House or Leader of the Opposition. 


At this point I thought it might be useful to complete a scorecard in relation to the main bugbears of community members and many of my constituents, in relation to MPs' entitlements once this legislation is in place. The first and most common complaint is that MPs and senators pensions are too generous. On this point I think the changes made to MPs' superannuation, moving to an accumulation plan or nominated superannuation fund, addresses this key concern. I do acknowledge that there are MPs and senators who entered politics 25 or 30 years ago who have accrued entitlements under previous arrangements, and that for many in the community this remains a concern. However, I would emphasise that, wherever possible, we should respect a defined benefit scheme established some time ago. Those parliamentarians came into and in many cases left this place with a legitimate expectation that their defined benefit scheme would remain intact. 


The next complaint I often get is that politicians should no longer vote themselves a pay rise. Again, the changes made in 2011 move this power to the Remuneration Tribunal, which now determines base salaries and is required to publish reasons for its decisions, as I said earlier.


Lastly, I often hear that politicians should not be entitled to a gold pass for travel. Of course, the purpose of this legislation is to reduce that entitlement and to set up a path to the eventual termination of the scheme. So, clearly, some important changes have been made and we are heading strongly in the right direction.


The other important piece of context here is the budget. The government made a number of difficult decisions in the budget. I have said before in this House that we seek to address two fundamental problems in the budget. The first is the $50 billion deficit in the last financial year, alongside debt expected to reach $667 billion if there is no intervention. But the last government left a far more insidious legacy, of fast rising expenditure—particularly in areas like health and welfare.


This is the most dangerous problem we face, because expenditure rising faster than revenue over an extended period drove the US and Europe into deep and sustained economic crises. The government is working very hard to turn that around, to get spending into line with tax revenue. It is totally inappropriate that we should keep borrowing from our children and grandchildren to fund expenditure today. I fear that those opposite intend to pass the buck to our children and our grandchildren. If not, it must be that they intend to raise taxes; time will tell. My money is on a sharp increase in taxes if Labor ever gets into power in the coming years. But as each day passes, the need for fiscal responsibility becomes even clearer.


For instance, the Parliamentary Budget Officer, Phil Bowen, recently commented that commodity prices could fall faster than expected, increasing our budgetary challenge. I think that this prospect is now very real, particularly with respect to iron ore prices. His key point, I believe, was not to cry wolf or to inject a flavour of panic. He was identifying the need for prudent budgets which include building a sensible buffer—a sensible buffer—against economic shocks.


There is much in this bill that some current and past parliamentarians do not love, and understandably so. But the process of bringing our remuneration and benefits into line with community standards and expectations is an important one, and one that I strongly endorse. I commend this bill to the House.

"Henderson, Sarah, MP",LP,2014-10-28,"



Ms HENDERSON
 (Corangamite) (17:02):  I rise to speak in support of the Parliamentary Entitlements Legislation Amendment Bill 2014. In making what will be a relatively brief contribution today I would like to start by reflecting on one very important point: members of parliament are elected to serve the community. And, in the case of members of the House of Representatives, they are elected to serve their electorates. Members of parliament are duty-bound to serve with integrity, honesty and transparency. The standards which apply to members of parliament are high, and so they should be. Australians deserve no less.


I digress for one moment, noting that the former member for Corangamite was in the House today. It reminded me of the failure of the former member for Corangamite to serve with integrity when he ran a very dishonest campaign in relation to a particular—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Mitchell
):  I will ask the member for Corangamite to withdraw that. Those imputations are not acceptable. The standing orders clearly say that you cannot impugn a member or claim that his motives are improper, and that is what you have just done.




Ms HENDERSON:
  I am not impugning a member. I am reflecting on—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  You just said that he ran a dishonest campaign and the statement you made before that was impugning him.




Ms HENDERSON:
  He is not a member, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker. He is a former—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  It does not matter!




Ms HENDERSON:
  He is a former member and—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I have asked you to withdraw it!




Ms HENDERSON:
  Unfortunately, the record does stand—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I have asked you to withdraw it!




Ms HENDERSON:
  Well, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, I will reluctantly withdraw it—




Mr Dreyfus:
  No! Unreservedly!




Mr Fletcher:
  Let's have some more bullying from that side!




Ms HENDERSON:
  because there is no question in relation to the conduct of the former member for Corangamite. It is unfortunate that you have made that ruling, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, but in light of the fact that you have I will withdraw it.


In any event I think that the people of Corangamite understand how important it is to serve with integrity. The Australian community needs to have every confidence that their elected representatives are serving in a way which also delivers value for money and openness. I think that most people in the community understand that most members of parliament work hard. They understand that politics is pretty much a 24/7 business and that the commitment to public service requires a commitment to long hours and the capacity to deal with many issues concurrently.


In the electorate of Corangamite, which I am honoured to represent—a large regional electorate of more than 7½ thousand square kilometres and consisting of some 166 different communities—there is much work to be done to build a strong and prosperous economy and a safer and more secure Australia. Of course I work to be a strong local voice for the people of Corangamite.


Australians understand that members of parliament, when doing their job, have legitimate business expenses. But Australians have a right to expect that the parliamentary entitlements system is robust and transparent, and reflects community standards. This bill will make changes to the Parliamentary Entitlements Framework as announced by the government on 9 November 2013. It will also reduce parliamentarians' retirement travel entitlements as announced by the government in the 2014-15 budget.


The bill will amend the Parliamentary Entitlements Act 1990 in order to impose a 25 per cent penalty loading on travel claims that requires subsequent adjustment more than 28 days after being first submitted, including a legal right of recovery of the 25 per cent penalty loading. It will also limit the travel entitlement provided to the dependent children of senior officeholders to those who are less than 18 years of age.


This bill also amends the Members of Parliament (Life Gold Pass) Act 2002 in order to: reduce the travel entitlements for holders of the parliamentary retirement travel entitlement for both current and former senators and members; remove spouse travel, except for retired former prime ministers; and require all parliamentary retirement travel to be for the public benefit. As the member for Hume has said in his contribution today, that is a very important component of the changes in the bill. The bill also establishes a statutory basis for recovering overpayments to address the risk that certain payments made in the administration of entitlements may constitute a breach of section 83 of the Constitution. 


Australians understand that parliamentarians have an important job to do and that that costs money. I certainly concur with the member for Hume in emphasising that parliamentarians on all sides of politics make a very important contribution. But let us be blunt, Australians do not like any suggestion that politicians have their snout in the trough. Our government's decision to apply a 25 per cent penalty loading on travel claims that require substantial adjustment sends a very clear message that any mistakes, oversights or, unfortunately, abuses, as has been alleged in the past, by members of parliament with respect to travel claims will not be tolerated. There will be a penalty and it is one that our government takes seriously.


Our government's decision to remove, cease, limit and reduce travel entitlements once an MP retires also demonstrates a commitment to adapt to changing community standards. As the member for Brand said today in his contribution, abolishing the life gold pass over time is a good thing to do. Special entitlements, of course, have been preserved for former prime ministers, and that is appropriate. The member for Brand has been critical of the cut in the entitlements of former prime ministers, but I wish to remind the House that former prime ministers will continue to be entitled to 30 trips per year for life and 20 trips per year for the former Prime Minister's spouse or de facto partner. 


The Special Minister for State has explained each of these measures in detail in the second reading speech to the bill. I do not propose to go into much more detail than has already been done in this debate. I simply say, in my view, the people of Corangamite and Australians more broadly will appreciate the efforts of this government to tighten up the access to various entitlements, to add an extra layer of accountability and transparency, and to send a very strong message that being an elected representative comes with appropriate limitations on the cost to the taxpayer.


In getting Australia back on track and in getting our budget back on track, each of us has to make a contribution. That includes, of course, members and senators of the Australian parliament. I commend this bill to the House.

"Fletcher, Paul, MP",LP,2014-10-28,"



Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications) (17:10):  I thank all members for their contribution to the debate on the Parliamentary Entitlements Legislation Amendment Bill 2014. This bill gives effect to the changes announced by the government on 9 November 2013 that require amendments to the Parliamentary Entitlements Act 1990 and to the changes announced in the 2014-15 budget that require amendments to the Members of Parliament (Life Gold Pass) Act 2002.


Firstly, in relation to the changes announced in November 2013: the bill limits the domestic travel entitlement of dependent children of senior officers from those under 25 to those under 18 years of age. The bill establishes a 25 per cent penalty loading on any adjustment of a parliamentarian's claim for prescribed travel benefits, other than where the adjustment is made within 28 days of the claim or was the result of an administrative error by the Department of Finance. 


In addition, the bill establishes a mechanism to minimise the risk that payments made in the course of administering the Parliamentary Entitlements Act 1990 or the Members of Parliament (Life Gold Pass) Act 2002 breach section 83 of the Constitution. This mechanism is comparable to mechanisms included in other acts, such as the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Act 1948. As part of this mechanism, the bill establishes a statutory right for the recovery of payments that are beyond entitlement from parliamentarians or former parliamentarians. The bill also establishes a statutory right for the recovery of the 25 per cent penalty loading. 


Secondly, the bill amends the title of the Members of Parliament (Life Gold Pass) Act 2002 to the Parliamentary Retirement Travel Act 2002 to better reflect the entitlement, following the amendments contained in this bill. The bill removes eligibility from parliamentarians who did not meet the qualifying period for parliamentary retirement travel on or before 13 May 2014, other than for the spouse or de facto partner, or surviving spouse or de facto partner of a retired former Prime Minister. 


The bill also removes eligibility for parliamentary retirement travel from spouses and de facto partners of retired parliamentarians, as well as sitting senators and members, who have met the qualifying period for parliamentary retirement travel. The bill requires that parliamentarians, other than former prime ministers, who met the qualifying period for parliamentary retirement travel on or before 13 May 2014 retire before 1 January 2020 in order to access the entitlement. The bill requires that all parliamentary retirement travel, including travel by the spouse or de facto partner of a retired former Prime Minister, be for the public benefit.


The bill ceases parliamentary retirement travel for former ministers, other than former prime ministers, presiding officers and leaders of the opposition—that is, senior officeholders—who left the parliament on or before 13 May 2008. The bill limits the parliamentary retirement travel entitlement of senior officeholders who left the parliament after 13 May 2008 to 10 return domestic trips per year from their retirement date to whichever is the lesser of six years or the second end of a parliament that occurs after their retirement. 


The bill ceases parliamentary retirement travel for former parliamentarians, other than senior officeholders, who left the parliament on or before 13 May 2011. The bill reduces the parliamentary retirement travel entitlement of former parliamentarians, other than senior officeholders, who left the parliament after 13 May 2011 to five return domestic trips per year for three years from their retirement or the next end of a parliament that occurs after their retirement, whichever is the lesser. The bill removes the current restriction on a prime minister who enters or re-enters parliament on or after 6 March 2012 becoming eligible for parliamentary retirement travel. The bill reduces the parliamentary retirement travel entitlement of a retired former prime minister to 30 return domestic trips per year. The bill also reduces the entitlement of a spouse or de facto partner of a retired former prime minister who qualified for parliamentary retirement to 20 return domestic trips per year.


These are sensible reforms to improve accountability in the spending of taxpayers' money, which will strengthen the parliamentary entitlements system. I commend the bill to the House.

"Gray, Gary, MP",ALP,2014-10-28,"



Mr GRAY
 (Brand) (16:29):  The opposition will be supporting the Parliamentary Entitlements Legislation Amendment Bill 2014. The bill adjusts entitlements for serving parliamentarians and the bill attends to issues that affect retired parliamentarians. The bill also abolishes the gold pass. 


Although the opposition will be supporting this bill through this place and will support the bill when it gets to the Senate, there are issues attached to this bill and the bill should be improved. It should be improved for its content, its purpose and its practical operability. That is why I have referred it to the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee. I hope that in that committee process we can improve the poor structure and purpose of the bill and that can be attended to in an effective and efficient manner.


The government's purpose here is good. Abolishing the gold pass is a good thing to do. We had closed the gold pass in 2012. We believed that that was both a safe course of action and a prudent course of action. The government's choice to abolish the gold pass is an action that is supported by the opposition and an action that is contained in this bill.


I am concerned that other changes in the bill have not been driven by or even properly considered by the Remuneration Tribunal. They should have been. Any matter affecting the entitlements and remuneration—certainly the salary and conditions—of MPs should only ever get into this place after it has been thoroughly considered by the Remuneration Tribunal and recommended by the Remuneration Tribunal. Not to have the Remuneration Tribunal fully considering and recommending is a weakness. I accept that the Remuneration Tribunal has been consulted in part on these measures, but these measures do not arise organically out of the consideration by the Remuneration Tribunal.


The reason the Remuneration Tribunal is structured as it is is to simply separate decisions about MPs' entitlements and conditions from us the parliamentarians. We carefully select the Remuneration Tribunal members. Some have been members for in excess of a decade. They have in mind why decisions were made in 2008 and why they were made in 2012 and how they might relate to decisions that get made in 2014. That body of wisdom and that consideration has not been brought to bear on this bill. Politicians should not be writing their own entitlement arrangements even though on this occasion what this bill does is abolish a significant entitlement and create new entitlements in other areas.


Let us go through it in some detail. It cuts travel for dependent children. I can see no good purpose, at a time when our work and lifestyle in this place are hard enough on families, to make that change for the travel of dependent children, albeit for children aged over 18 and under 25. They are still in the category of dependent children. No parliament has ever done that.


It cuts the entitlement to travel for former prime ministers. We have never in this chamber cut an entitlement for a former Prime Minister. I was asked to do it once by former Prime Minister Julia Gillard and I refused to do it. We should refuse to do it this time too. Our former prime ministers do immense good work. Even when that immense good work is in a partisan way and even when that immense good work is to support their political parties, they are still functioning in our community as former prime ministers. 


I can tell you quite honestly that John Howard coming down to campaign in my electorate would be a good thing for visibility in the city of Rockingham, Kwinana or Mandurah, as it was when Bob Hawke came to Kwinana, Rockingham and Mandurah. These are good things for former prime ministers to be doing. But more important than that our former prime ministers travel our country bringing exposure to issues and communities in ways that only add to the service that they have already committed to in this place. I would not cut one single entitlement of a former Prime Minister.


The bill imposes cost-recovery onto ministers for errors made by others. The ministers may not even know of, or even reasonably be expected to know about, these errors that may have occurred by the minister's staff. The bill creates a cost-recovery process that the minister may not understand that comes from a future travel entitlement payment to that minister. This is not transparency. This is not effective governance.


No-one is standing in this place arguing in support of loosening our system, but it has to be practical and it has to be workable. The measures in this bill take it beyond the workability stage. It is not wise legislation and I would replace it if I were the minister at no additional cost to the taxpayer. I would seek advice and publish the advice from the Remuneration Tribunal. There are unwise measures in this bill and they can be fixed at no additional cost to the taxpayer and they will produce, I am convinced, better outcomes, better transparency, better management systems and hold not just members and senators accountable but also those people in the Department of Finance who sign off on travel and travel allowances for members. It was my experience as a former minister that there were occasions when my then department got things wrong. Embarrassment was created for members of parliament when the department got things wrong. I used to ask the department to apologise directly to the members and senators who had been the victims of the errors made by the department. I think that is an important point of accountability too.


I understand some retired members will challenge this legislation in the High Court. I disassociate myself from that. I am enthusiastic to support the parts of this bill that abolish the gold pass and previous legislation under my time as minister that may also be challenged in the High Court. Labor supports this bill but thinks it can be improved. It will not be improved in the High Court. In government I worked with the opposition minor parties and even the crossbenchers to introduce measures that were proposed, always proposed, by the Remuneration Tribunal. They addressed areas of salaries. They addressed areas of entitlement use. They addressed areas of accountability, and they were always agreed on the basis of the independence of the Remuneration Tribunal and, dare I say it, the integrity that was brought to the table by a genuinely bipartisan approach to resolving these issues. I congratulate the now Speaker of this place on the terrific role that she played when shadow minister.


In 2012, one measure that we changed was to remove the non-gold passed, post-service travel from 25 return trips, which is what it was from 2004—25 return trips at business class to anywhere in Australia, and that applied for five years. We replaced it with five trips to Canberra in the six months after leaving parliament. That may have been an extreme cut, but I do not think any of us could genuinely justify 25 return trips at the conclusion of parliamentary service. Those five fares in six months have changed in this bill to 10 trips per year over six years. That seems excessive when the Remuneration Tribunal had been asked to consider cost-less measures—measures that did not cost the taxpayer anything, such as making the resettlement payment a redundancy payment, a measure that would not have cost the taxpayer. 


Currently, when a member or senator ceases their term of duty and are thrown out by the people—they lose an election—there is a resettlement allowance paid if you have served more than one term in the parliament, or two terms or three. Because that is paid as salary it is taxed as salary. It should be a redundancy payment. It is a cost-less measure that could be attended to that is about fairness and is about the proper equal treatment of parliamentarians as with other classes of employees, albeit employed by the parliament. I regret that I did not get an opportunity to attend to that measure; I simply did not know it existed as a problem until after the last election.


I have had raised with me since the last election the possibility of self-managed superannuation funds also being available to receive parliamentary superannuation payments. It never occurred to me that that was not the case. That is a cost-less measure. I would have done that in a blink of an eye if I had been asked. There are measures that can be done that support, enhance and assist parliamentarians that literally do not cost a cent.


Other measures that are needed could be funded through winding back the 60 post-service travel trips, and they include occupational health and safety sickness benefit insurance. It is missing for MPs and senators. An MP or a senator who is injured at work is entirely at risk for that cost themselves. I know that because I enjoyed the hospitality of the Western Australian hospital system as a consequence of a cardiac event that I sustained in the north of Western Australia in 2011 on the duty of a parliamentarian. 


It should be the case that from the point of election to the point of not being a parliamentarian, 24 hours a day and seven days a week, we in this place are covered for simple occupational health and safety benefit insurance. It is a cheap thing to do, especially for a class of people such as parliamentarians and senators whereas individually the cost of carrying that insurance is quite high—on occasions for an individual as high as $6,000. We have seen former MPs and senators leave their service having been harmed. Our resettlement provisions are not adequate and should be considered by the Remuneration Tribunal in light of modern employment practices. Any changes should be funded by reconsideration of the 10 trips per year as allocated in my earlier reference.


The measures in this bill do not build upon the processes that had been created throughout what we used to call the Minchin protocol or the high-level Department of Finance processes for considering when an MP or a senator has got something wrong or has deliberately made a mistake. The process right now is under the Minchin protocol—so called because former Special Minister of State, Nick Minchin, in the late 1990s designed it. Should any of us—any of the 226 members or senators—have even a reference made in a newspaper or on a website about potential entitlement abuse, the Department of Finance looks at it. They consider it, they look at it and they make a decision as to whether or not they need to carry out a further level of investigation. It is a good system. The member is not informed until such time as the member or senator needs to be informed. The minister is not informed. It is a good process. It protects the integrity of our system and it allows all of us to know that, should a question be raised about the behaviour of any of us, there is a very good system that has survived 15 years, designed by former minister Nick Minchin in order to protect not only the taxpayer but also the integrity of parliamentarians.


The measures in this bill, unless amended, will cause ministers great concern, and that is not productive. It is not useful, and in my view it is not probity. The opposition will support the government to pass this bill. When governments wish to attend to matters such as the gold pass in this way, they deserve to have the complete support of our parliament and they will have that. We would prefer to improve the bill. As I have said, at the first opportunity I will support a full reconsideration of the measures funded by the unnecessary expenses created by this bill and on the advice of recommendation of the Remuneration Tribunal will present an amending bill.


We believe better processes exist to deal with incorrect payments. I am not here referring to the 25 per cent surcharge for any incorrect claims; that is fine. I am dealing here with the processes for investigating and then allocating that decision. Transparency should also include the Department of Finance documenting the advice it gives to MPs and senators. It should provide advice and it should keep that advice on file for consistent advice's purpose. Consistent advice is important to parliamentarians. For instance, the bill requires that all travel post-service be for public benefit. It sounds good, but I do not think it would include travel to attend Gough Whitlam's funeral—and I think it should. And I am not even prepared to advise any of my friends who are former parliamentarians to seek advice from the department on whether or not they could utilise their travel to attend the funeral of the former Prime Minister; it is just too risky, and this bill makes it unnecessarily risky.


Because we cannot get the advice that helps parliamentarians and senators do their job well, sometimes there are things that we just cannot do. The bill cuts the ability of former Prime Ministers to function. We have never thought this dignified or useful. We should not be cutting the ability or capability of our former Prime Minister's, even to campaign. I know that if any us or if any journalists contact a former Prime Minister, any of our former Prime Minister's would say: take it away. They are decent people. They deserve to be protected by us. They do not deserve to be cut by us.


I would like to see our former Prime Ministers travel. I would like to see Malcolm Fraser, Bob Hawke, John Howard, Paul Keating, Julia Gillard and Kevin Rudd all active and travelling our country. Let's not cut the ability of our former MPs to function in our community or in our political community. Let's make their travel and their ability to function unlimited, as annoying as that would be to all of us on occasions. But enjoyable it would be to the fabric of our political community and our broader community to see these men and women continuing to do their work in our community and for our community. The bill introduces even more bureaucracy, paperwork and cost. It does nothing to make the work of MPs or ministers or officers of the parliament more effective.


In conclusion, I want to work with the government to fix this bill. By all means pass it if you need to but let's do better than that. Let's improve its effect upon MPs and senators, fix some of the problems and save some money. Get the gold pass abolished and do some good, and do it on the advice of the Remuneration Tribunal not on the thoughts and the whims that have come to us in the form of this bill. When this bill is put to a vote, the opposition will support it and support it to a person. I tell the government: we can do better, we should do better and we are prepared to do better. Through the Senate committee, I hope that is one very good way that we can make this bill do better.

"Taylor, Angus, MP",LP,2014-10-28,"



Mr TAYLOR
 (Hume) (16:47):  I rise today to support the Parliamentary Entitlements Legislation Amendment Bill 2014, which will reduce the life gold pass travel entitlement before abolishing the scheme for all other than former Prime Ministers. The bill will also strengthen the rules governing parliamentarians' expenses.


The issue of parliamentary salaries, allowances and entitlements generates much interest and comment in the community and, of course, much interest and comment around this building. In my own electorate of Hume, I often receive correspondence, calls and personal approaches from constituents on this issue. Many believe that current parliamentary entitlements are out of step with what the community thinks is reasonable. I accept that some of this commentary and feedback is driven by a level of cynicism in the community in relation to politicians and political life. But for me, as the federal member for Hume, I never forget that it is the taxpayers of Australia that pay my salary. I know that the majority of my constituents work hard each day to meet their commitments and to pay their bills at the end of every week and every month. As their local representative, I know they want me to work hard and act with integrity to ensure that their lives and burdens get easier, not harder. I know that most reasonable constituents do not begrudge my salary if they believe I am quite literally busting a gut for them. And that is what I seek to do every day.


I am delighted to report that one year into this job, I know what most representatives in this House do for their constituents every day. Some of the very best work in this place goes completely unnoticed but that is the nature of public service. I think that some of the cynicism about politicians stems from the lack of transparency about how we spend our time and that is something which I seek to address with, amongst other things, very regular Facebook posts. But it is crucially important that the remuneration and benefits we receive are in line with community expectations and are in line with changing employment patterns outside of this parliament.


We know that many former parliamentarians have a very successful career beyond their time in this place, often facilitated by the experience and networks they developed while here. Years ago, one career was enough. But these days many of us have a series of careers, and that is a good thing. This legislation is simply one of a series of reforms in this area over the last 10 years intended to bring parliamentary remuneration and entitlements more into line with changing community expectations and changing employment arrangements.


In relation to superannuation, a very common bone of contention for some of my constituents, changes have previously been made to the parliamentary contributory superannuation scheme. This was a defined benefit scheme which provided for rates of retiring allowance varying from 50 per cent of parliamentary allowance after eight years' service up to 75 per cent parliamentary allowance after a service of 18 years or more. The changes closed the scheme to new members from 2004 and moved parliamentarians to an accumulation scheme under the Parliamentary Superannuation Act 2004. I believe this is in line with most of my constituency in their own employment agreements and so it was a good reform.


Senators and members can have their superannuation paid to a complying superannuation fund or to a retirement savings account of their choice, subject to the same rules that apply to employees in the private sector and public service, and it has the same preservation age. It is true that the contribution from the Commonwealth at 15.4 per cent of salary, is, I acknowledge, more generous than most employer schemes.


In relation to MPs' entitlements, in 2009 the Australian National Audit Office highlighted the shortcomings in the management of these entitlements. The ANAO said that it was difficult to understand and manage for both the parliamentarians and the Department of Finance, which administers the entitlements. 


The audit supported a review of the entitlements framework and greater transparency in the system. Before this, entitlements had not been comprehensively reviewed since 1971. In December 2009 in response to the ANAO report, the government set up a committee to review parliamentary entitlements, chaired by a former senior public servant, Barbara Belcher. The report from this review, the Belcher review, drew a distinction between remuneration and tools of trade, or entitlements, such as office facilities and transport. It recommended that salary be dealt with by the Remuneration Tribunal, while entitlements would be dealt with by a single piece of legislation. The government accepted the recommendations of the Belcher review, and from August 2011 the Remuneration Tribunal was given the power to determine parliamentary base salary and is required to publish reasons for its decision on parliamentary remuneration. Under legislation the parliament does not have the power to disallow parliamentary remuneration determinations made by the tribunal. In other words, our remuneration is no longer in our hands. 


Further in December 2011 the Remuneration Tribunal made a number of recommendations, including: the parliamentary base salary be set at $185,000; the prospective closure of the Life Gold Pass Scheme; termination of the overseas study travel entitlement; greatly limited severance travel entitlement; severance of the link between pensions under the old superannuation scheme and current parliamentarians' salaries. These recommendations were accepted and legislation to effect these changes came into effect March 2012.


Since coming to office, this government has been exploring opportunities to make sensible changes to the parliamentary entitlements framework, including those of former parliamentarians, to ensure that we deliver value for money, openness and transparency. This is always an extremely tricky area. I fully acknowledge that we are impacting many who have made an enormous contribution to this country over a long period of time. Former parliamentarians from all sides of politics deserve our greatest respect. And, as a parliamentarian myself, I now understand the scale of the commitment so many of these people make to our country.


But travel entitlements beyond the life of a job are unusual in this day and age. Community standards and expectations are changing dramatically, and it is unreasonable to expect taxpayers to pay for something that they cannot expect from their own employment relationships. In addition, it is increasingly true that parliamentarians can expect a career, often a lucrative career, beyond their time in this place. 


Some of my constituents argue that former parliamentarians should be constrained in some way, particularly with respect to lobbying. However, I will always defend the right of former parliamentarians to remain involved in the political process. They have a wisdom and experience that makes them extraordinarily valuable to society for many years beyond their time here. 


The changes announced in November 2013 and in the 2014-15 budget and encompassed in this legislation reflect community standards, ensuring that taxpayers' money is well spent. This bill amends the Members of Parliament (Life Gold Pass) Act 2002 and changes the title to the Parliamentary Retirement Travel Act 2002 to better reflect the intent of the legislation. It will reduce, remove and reform travel entitlements for holders of the parliamentary retirement travel entitlement for both current and former senators and members. 


Specifically, the bill: imposes time limits on using the entitlements; and imposes limits on access to the entitlements, including closing it to people who have not met the qualifying periods before 14 May this year, and mandating that no-one can access benefits under the scheme, except for a former PM, if they retire from 1 January 2020 onwards. The bill reduces the number of trips per financial year under the entitlement for the time it is still in operation. The bill removes the ability of spouses and partners to access the entitlement, other than retired former PMs, and removes the entitlement to travel by a spouse or partner of the PM or a sitting former PM.


Lastly, and importantly, the bill requires that all parliamentary retirement travel, including travel by the spouse or de facto partner of a retired former prime minister, be for the public benefit. That is an extremely important aspect of this; it should always be for the public benefit. That means that in practice it does not include travel for a commercial or private purpose. 


This current legislation will also amend the parliamentary entitlements framework to: impose a 25 per cent penalty on travel claims that require subsequent adjustment more than 28 days after being first submitted; limit the entitlement provided to the dependent children of senior officeholders to those who are less than 18 years of age. Just to clarify that: a senior officeholder is a minister, the President of the Senate, Speaker of the House or Leader of the Opposition. 


At this point I thought it might be useful to complete a scorecard in relation to the main bugbears of community members and many of my constituents, in relation to MPs' entitlements once this legislation is in place. The first and most common complaint is that MPs and senators pensions are too generous. On this point I think the changes made to MPs' superannuation, moving to an accumulation plan or nominated superannuation fund, addresses this key concern. I do acknowledge that there are MPs and senators who entered politics 25 or 30 years ago who have accrued entitlements under previous arrangements, and that for many in the community this remains a concern. However, I would emphasise that, wherever possible, we should respect a defined benefit scheme established some time ago. Those parliamentarians came into and in many cases left this place with a legitimate expectation that their defined benefit scheme would remain intact. 


The next complaint I often get is that politicians should no longer vote themselves a pay rise. Again, the changes made in 2011 move this power to the Remuneration Tribunal, which now determines base salaries and is required to publish reasons for its decisions, as I said earlier.


Lastly, I often hear that politicians should not be entitled to a gold pass for travel. Of course, the purpose of this legislation is to reduce that entitlement and to set up a path to the eventual termination of the scheme. So, clearly, some important changes have been made and we are heading strongly in the right direction.


The other important piece of context here is the budget. The government made a number of difficult decisions in the budget. I have said before in this House that we seek to address two fundamental problems in the budget. The first is the $50 billion deficit in the last financial year, alongside debt expected to reach $667 billion if there is no intervention. But the last government left a far more insidious legacy, of fast rising expenditure—particularly in areas like health and welfare.


This is the most dangerous problem we face, because expenditure rising faster than revenue over an extended period drove the US and Europe into deep and sustained economic crises. The government is working very hard to turn that around, to get spending into line with tax revenue. It is totally inappropriate that we should keep borrowing from our children and grandchildren to fund expenditure today. I fear that those opposite intend to pass the buck to our children and our grandchildren. If not, it must be that they intend to raise taxes; time will tell. My money is on a sharp increase in taxes if Labor ever gets into power in the coming years. But as each day passes, the need for fiscal responsibility becomes even clearer.


For instance, the Parliamentary Budget Officer, Phil Bowen, recently commented that commodity prices could fall faster than expected, increasing our budgetary challenge. I think that this prospect is now very real, particularly with respect to iron ore prices. His key point, I believe, was not to cry wolf or to inject a flavour of panic. He was identifying the need for prudent budgets which include building a sensible buffer—a sensible buffer—against economic shocks.


There is much in this bill that some current and past parliamentarians do not love, and understandably so. But the process of bringing our remuneration and benefits into line with community standards and expectations is an important one, and one that I strongly endorse. I commend this bill to the House.

"Henderson, Sarah, MP",LP,2014-10-28,"



Ms HENDERSON
 (Corangamite) (17:02):  I rise to speak in support of the Parliamentary Entitlements Legislation Amendment Bill 2014. In making what will be a relatively brief contribution today I would like to start by reflecting on one very important point: members of parliament are elected to serve the community. And, in the case of members of the House of Representatives, they are elected to serve their electorates. Members of parliament are duty-bound to serve with integrity, honesty and transparency. The standards which apply to members of parliament are high, and so they should be. Australians deserve no less.


I digress for one moment, noting that the former member for Corangamite was in the House today. It reminded me of the failure of the former member for Corangamite to serve with integrity when he ran a very dishonest campaign in relation to a particular—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Mitchell
):  I will ask the member for Corangamite to withdraw that. Those imputations are not acceptable. The standing orders clearly say that you cannot impugn a member or claim that his motives are improper, and that is what you have just done.




Ms HENDERSON:
  I am not impugning a member. I am reflecting on—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  You just said that he ran a dishonest campaign and the statement you made before that was impugning him.




Ms HENDERSON:
  He is not a member, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker. He is a former—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  It does not matter!




Ms HENDERSON:
  He is a former member and—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I have asked you to withdraw it!




Ms HENDERSON:
  Unfortunately, the record does stand—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I have asked you to withdraw it!




Ms HENDERSON:
  Well, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, I will reluctantly withdraw it—




Mr Dreyfus:
  No! Unreservedly!




Mr Fletcher:
  Let's have some more bullying from that side!




Ms HENDERSON:
  because there is no question in relation to the conduct of the former member for Corangamite. It is unfortunate that you have made that ruling, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, but in light of the fact that you have I will withdraw it.


In any event I think that the people of Corangamite understand how important it is to serve with integrity. The Australian community needs to have every confidence that their elected representatives are serving in a way which also delivers value for money and openness. I think that most people in the community understand that most members of parliament work hard. They understand that politics is pretty much a 24/7 business and that the commitment to public service requires a commitment to long hours and the capacity to deal with many issues concurrently.


In the electorate of Corangamite, which I am honoured to represent—a large regional electorate of more than 7½ thousand square kilometres and consisting of some 166 different communities—there is much work to be done to build a strong and prosperous economy and a safer and more secure Australia. Of course I work to be a strong local voice for the people of Corangamite.


Australians understand that members of parliament, when doing their job, have legitimate business expenses. But Australians have a right to expect that the parliamentary entitlements system is robust and transparent, and reflects community standards. This bill will make changes to the Parliamentary Entitlements Framework as announced by the government on 9 November 2013. It will also reduce parliamentarians' retirement travel entitlements as announced by the government in the 2014-15 budget.


The bill will amend the Parliamentary Entitlements Act 1990 in order to impose a 25 per cent penalty loading on travel claims that requires subsequent adjustment more than 28 days after being first submitted, including a legal right of recovery of the 25 per cent penalty loading. It will also limit the travel entitlement provided to the dependent children of senior officeholders to those who are less than 18 years of age.


This bill also amends the Members of Parliament (Life Gold Pass) Act 2002 in order to: reduce the travel entitlements for holders of the parliamentary retirement travel entitlement for both current and former senators and members; remove spouse travel, except for retired former prime ministers; and require all parliamentary retirement travel to be for the public benefit. As the member for Hume has said in his contribution today, that is a very important component of the changes in the bill. The bill also establishes a statutory basis for recovering overpayments to address the risk that certain payments made in the administration of entitlements may constitute a breach of section 83 of the Constitution. 


Australians understand that parliamentarians have an important job to do and that that costs money. I certainly concur with the member for Hume in emphasising that parliamentarians on all sides of politics make a very important contribution. But let us be blunt, Australians do not like any suggestion that politicians have their snout in the trough. Our government's decision to apply a 25 per cent penalty loading on travel claims that require substantial adjustment sends a very clear message that any mistakes, oversights or, unfortunately, abuses, as has been alleged in the past, by members of parliament with respect to travel claims will not be tolerated. There will be a penalty and it is one that our government takes seriously.


Our government's decision to remove, cease, limit and reduce travel entitlements once an MP retires also demonstrates a commitment to adapt to changing community standards. As the member for Brand said today in his contribution, abolishing the life gold pass over time is a good thing to do. Special entitlements, of course, have been preserved for former prime ministers, and that is appropriate. The member for Brand has been critical of the cut in the entitlements of former prime ministers, but I wish to remind the House that former prime ministers will continue to be entitled to 30 trips per year for life and 20 trips per year for the former Prime Minister's spouse or de facto partner. 


The Special Minister for State has explained each of these measures in detail in the second reading speech to the bill. I do not propose to go into much more detail than has already been done in this debate. I simply say, in my view, the people of Corangamite and Australians more broadly will appreciate the efforts of this government to tighten up the access to various entitlements, to add an extra layer of accountability and transparency, and to send a very strong message that being an elected representative comes with appropriate limitations on the cost to the taxpayer.


In getting Australia back on track and in getting our budget back on track, each of us has to make a contribution. That includes, of course, members and senators of the Australian parliament. I commend this bill to the House.

"Fletcher, Paul, MP",LP,2014-10-28,"



Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications) (17:10):  I thank all members for their contribution to the debate on the Parliamentary Entitlements Legislation Amendment Bill 2014. This bill gives effect to the changes announced by the government on 9 November 2013 that require amendments to the Parliamentary Entitlements Act 1990 and to the changes announced in the 2014-15 budget that require amendments to the Members of Parliament (Life Gold Pass) Act 2002.


Firstly, in relation to the changes announced in November 2013: the bill limits the domestic travel entitlement of dependent children of senior officers from those under 25 to those under 18 years of age. The bill establishes a 25 per cent penalty loading on any adjustment of a parliamentarian's claim for prescribed travel benefits, other than where the adjustment is made within 28 days of the claim or was the result of an administrative error by the Department of Finance. 


In addition, the bill establishes a mechanism to minimise the risk that payments made in the course of administering the Parliamentary Entitlements Act 1990 or the Members of Parliament (Life Gold Pass) Act 2002 breach section 83 of the Constitution. This mechanism is comparable to mechanisms included in other acts, such as the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Act 1948. As part of this mechanism, the bill establishes a statutory right for the recovery of payments that are beyond entitlement from parliamentarians or former parliamentarians. The bill also establishes a statutory right for the recovery of the 25 per cent penalty loading. 


Secondly, the bill amends the title of the Members of Parliament (Life Gold Pass) Act 2002 to the Parliamentary Retirement Travel Act 2002 to better reflect the entitlement, following the amendments contained in this bill. The bill removes eligibility from parliamentarians who did not meet the qualifying period for parliamentary retirement travel on or before 13 May 2014, other than for the spouse or de facto partner, or surviving spouse or de facto partner of a retired former Prime Minister. 


The bill also removes eligibility for parliamentary retirement travel from spouses and de facto partners of retired parliamentarians, as well as sitting senators and members, who have met the qualifying period for parliamentary retirement travel. The bill requires that parliamentarians, other than former prime ministers, who met the qualifying period for parliamentary retirement travel on or before 13 May 2014 retire before 1 January 2020 in order to access the entitlement. The bill requires that all parliamentary retirement travel, including travel by the spouse or de facto partner of a retired former Prime Minister, be for the public benefit.


The bill ceases parliamentary retirement travel for former ministers, other than former prime ministers, presiding officers and leaders of the opposition—that is, senior officeholders—who left the parliament on or before 13 May 2008. The bill limits the parliamentary retirement travel entitlement of senior officeholders who left the parliament after 13 May 2008 to 10 return domestic trips per year from their retirement date to whichever is the lesser of six years or the second end of a parliament that occurs after their retirement. 


The bill ceases parliamentary retirement travel for former parliamentarians, other than senior officeholders, who left the parliament on or before 13 May 2011. The bill reduces the parliamentary retirement travel entitlement of former parliamentarians, other than senior officeholders, who left the parliament after 13 May 2011 to five return domestic trips per year for three years from their retirement or the next end of a parliament that occurs after their retirement, whichever is the lesser. The bill removes the current restriction on a prime minister who enters or re-enters parliament on or after 6 March 2012 becoming eligible for parliamentary retirement travel. The bill reduces the parliamentary retirement travel entitlement of a retired former prime minister to 30 return domestic trips per year. The bill also reduces the entitlement of a spouse or de facto partner of a retired former prime minister who qualified for parliamentary retirement to 20 return domestic trips per year.


These are sensible reforms to improve accountability in the spending of taxpayers' money, which will strengthen the parliamentary entitlements system. I commend the bill to the House.

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler) (21:00):  Last weekend I was very honoured to attend once again the Norton Street Festa, an Italian community festival at Leichhardt in my electorate. As I wandered among the stalls and greeted old friends and constituents, I was reminded of the immense strength that resides with vibrant, dynamic, strong and healthy communities. Australian communities are tightly bound by a powerful collective spirit—a sense of shared experience and history and a feeling of belonging. People in communities like Leichhardt care for each other and their common wellbeing. They understand there is an inherent value in their community. They want governments to respect and build upon that value.


I am concerned that the current government is devaluing the concept of Australian communities. Through its policies and its rhetoric, the government seeks to trigger a shift in our national culture—one that gives the concept of individualism absolute priority, to the exclusion of any concept of common interest. We see it throughout a range of policies, particularly in the budget—regarding cuts to pensions and health and the deregulation of higher education that sees it as an individual commodity that can be bought and sold rather than as a benefit to the nation. This trend is also illustrated when the Treasurer claims that Australians are either lifters or leaners and when government ministers routinely attack disability pensioners as bludgers. This rhetoric is designed to make many Australians think more about themselves and less about the many.


This is a government that does not like public education. It does not like public health, public broadcasting or public services—in fact, it simply does not like the public. And it is not just in Canberra. There is no better example of this conservative campaign to devalue communities than what is happening in the public housing precinct at Millers Point in Sydney. New South Wales Premier Mike Baird is selling about 300 public housing units which for many decades have formed the basis of a vibrant community. This is housing that was formerly controlled by the Maritime Services Board. People who live in the community either worked on the waterfront themselves, or their parents—or even their grandparents—did. So far, six of these homes have been sold. Because of this injection of private investment, the New South Wales Minister for Family and Community Services, Gabrielle Upton, recently said:


… the future for Millers Point is optimistic.


There is not much optimism among those being thrown out of their homes.


It is easy to put a reserve price on a house in Millers Point, but no-one seems to weigh that value against the lost value involved in dismantling the existing community. No-one is asking how much it will cost the government to move these residents to other areas—presumably on the edge of town, away from services, public transport and their support groups.


When Mike Baird looks at Millers Point he sees dollar signs. When I look at Millers Point, I see a living, breathing community which deserves respect and care. Many conservatives seem to hold the view that, while wealthy people should be applauded for accumulating property, the public sector has no right to be a property owner. The fact is this: vibrant communities are part of our nation's complex tapestry. It is not good enough for state or federal ministers to know the price of everything but the value of nothing. I am very uncomfortable with the idea of any government selling public housing stock when there is a public housing shortage. I am concerned that the logic the state government is putting forward would see it sell public housing in precincts like Pyrmont, Ultimo, Woolloomooloo, Glebe and North Sydney. This will change the nature of these communities.


Successful cities are not disconnected enclaves of advantage and disadvantage—they are diverse and vibrant. Successful communities are collections of individuals bound together by threads of history, common humanity, common experience and friendship. We should not toss people aside as if they are disposable. A government that seeks to engage with its community will find the community a willing partner and the entire community will benefit, regardless of its income. That is why the state government's approach is so short-sighted. I call upon them to reconsider this attitude.
