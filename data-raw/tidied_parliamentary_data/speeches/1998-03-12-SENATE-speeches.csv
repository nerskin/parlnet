"Calvert, Sen Paul",LP,1998-03-12,"—On behalf of Senator Gibson and the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, I present report No. 356 entitled An advisory report on the Tax Law Improvement Bill (No. 2) 1997 . I seek leave to have the tabling speech incorporated in Hansard  and I also seek leave to continue my remarks later.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
Madam President, on behalf on the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I present the Committee's Report No. 356: An Advisory Report on the Tax Law Improvement Bill (No. 2) 1997.
Madam President, this is the third occasion that the Committee has reported on a bill arising from the rewrite of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. The first tranche of rewrite legislation was reviewed during 1996 with the Committee tabling its findings in August of that year. The second tranche was reviewed in 1997 with the Committee reporting in March 1997.
The Committee looks forward to reviewing further rewrite legislation as it is introduced to Parliament.
The rewrite is being undertaken by the Tax Law Improvement Project (TLIP), situated in the Australian Taxation Office, and has the aim of simplifying and restructuring the existing law to make it clearer. This should reduce compliance costs to taxpayers. This Bill has attracted considerable interest from stakeholders as it contains the important capital gains tax provisions.
The Committee, because of its long involvement with the rewrite of the 1936 Act, has recognised recurrent themes that have arisen during the review of this Bill, and has commented on these matters in the report.
Firstly, stakeholders have been frustrated for some time with the inability of TLIP to address issues of a small `p' policy nature. The Committee has acknowledged this and in Report 348 —the review of the second tranche of legislation—recommended 
 that TLIP's mandate be extended to encompass the consideration of small policy issues. Although the Government has not agreed with this recommendation, the Assistant Treasurer has put in place a separate mechanism involving stakeholders by which such issues can be addressed. The Committee welcomes this initiative and believes this may satisfy the thrust of its recommendation.
A second recurrent theme observed by the Committee, is the continuing perception among some stakeholders that TLIP defers to an Australian Taxation Office view when translating the existing law into new law. Several submissions have focused on this issue and the Committee notes that the perception is strongly held by some stakeholders and has been rigorously defended by TLIP.
The Committee has discussed this matter in the report and provided some of the evidence as an appendix.
The Committee notes that if individual stakeholders strongly disagree with the stance taken by TLIP on a particular matter, there are various other avenues to seek redress. This is entirely appropriate and forms a keystone of our system of government.
A third recurrent theme, and one which appears to have had a critical impact on this review, relates to the time available to review the Bill.
The Bill contains the important and complex capital gains tax provisions, but unfortunately the time allowed for stakeholders to respond to exposure drafts of the legislation has been truncated, and the time for the Committee to review the Bill after its introduction has been short, especially when compared to the complex issues upon which the Committee has been expected to report.
As well, there is evidence of undue haste in preparing the Bill because it was incomplete when introduced, and one division and several transitional provisions have yet to be released.
The truncated consultation process and incompleteness of the Bill have led witnesses to express a lack of confidence in their ability to adequately review the proposed legislation and identify unintended consequences. They have called for the implementation of the Bill to be delayed or for a no-detriment clause to be added.
The Committee in reviewing the Bill has found itself in a similar position to the stakeholders. The incompleteness of the Bill and the short time for review has prevented the Committee reviewing the legislation with the thoroughness it would like.The Committee has therefore recommended that the implementation of two Divisions and one Subdivision of the Bill be delayed pending its review by the Committee. These provisions were released too late for the Committee to review them or have not been released at all. The Committee also notes that 
 transitional provisions relating to twelve areas have yet to be released.
The Committee considers it inappropriate to go further and has not agreed with calls to delay the entire Bill. The Committee acknowledges the imperative to maintain momentum in the progressive introduction of clearer law to replace the 1936 Act and is encouraged by the fact that witnesses have commented favourably on the clarity of the Bill. Taxpayers should not be denied recourse to legislation which is designed to be clearer and which should reduce compliance costs.
The alternative to delaying the Bill advocated by some witnesses—the introduction of a no-detriment clause—has also not been supported by the Committee. Such a clause would prevent closing off the existing law. In reviewing previous rewrite legislation, the Committee supported the view that the rewritten legislation should replace the provisions of the 1936 Act and should not operate in tandem with that Act. The Committee has not changed its view and believes it is more appropriate for taxpayers to rely on the existing section 1-3 and the traditional avenue of legislative amendment to protect against unintended consequences.
The Committee in reviewing the individual clauses of the Bill has made a number of recommendations which relate to
.	 policy issues which are outside TLIP's mandate;
.	 major technical issues which are sufficiently weighty to require substantial review which may be beyond TLIP's capacity to undertake, or be sufficiently broad in scope to impinge on policy matters; and
.	 minor technical issues of a non-policy nature which TLIP can address.
The report also contains as an appendix, comments on individual clauses of the Bill made in submissions and by witnesses, together with responses by TLIP. The Committee believes this will be a guide to the evidence and assist the debate on the details of the Bill.
In conclusion and on behalf of the Committee, I would like to thank all those who have contributed to this review. Many have provided submissions to the Committee and appeared as witnesses at the Committee's public hearings. In particular I would like to thank the private sector representatives on TLIP and TLIP's private sector consultative committee.
I would also like to thank members of the secretariat, Dr Margot Kerley the JCPAA secretary and Dr John Carter and Ms Tiana Gray who were involved with inquiry. I also thank Mr Gary Martin who was seconded to the secretariat to assist the Committee and its secretariat with the review. 

Madam President, I commend the Report to the Senate.

"Calvert, Sen Paul",LP,1998-03-12,"—On behalf of Senator Patterson, I present the report of the Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee on the provisions of the National Transmission Network Sale Bill 1997  and the National Transmission Network Sale (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1997  together with submissions and the Hansard  record of proceedings.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I seek leave to incorporate the tabling statement in Hansard .
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
The Committee has inquired into the bills and it is recommending that the Senate should pass the bills. The bills provide both the ABC and SBS with the opportunity to have a direct commercial relationship with transmission service providers  a relationship they have been seeking for a long time.
In evidence to the Committee, both organisations welcomed the greater flexibility that the new arrangements would give them. They told the Committee that the sale of the National Transmission Network to a private entity would provide them with an opportunity to achieve control of their transmission services, an objective that they had been pursuing for many years.
Both public broadcasting organisations told the Committee that they had been thoroughly consulted during the development of the bill and that they were confident that the compact that they were negotiating with the government would be satisfactory and would enable them to fulfil their current obligations.
The government has ensured a smooth transition to the new regime by providing the public broadcasters with the opportunity to enter into a 5 year contract with the NTN and subsequently with the 
 new owners to obtain transmission services which the government is committed to fund fully. In addition, the broadcasters have the option of renewing this contract for two further 5 year periods when the initial contract expires.
The bill ensures that after the sale, the public broadcasters will be able to maintain and develop their commitment to rural and regional areas. Through the development of a new access regime to transmission services, the government has been particularly careful to ensure that community service obligations continue to be met.
Community broadcasters who sent submissions to the inquiry acknowledged that the government is providing direct budget supplementation to Radio for the Print Handicapped broadcasting groups to enable them to pay access fees. Other self-help retransmission services and remote commercial television services will also receive concessional pricing arrangements. Those emergency service organisations, largely manned by volunteers, which operate services relating to the preservation of human life will also benefit from concessional pricing and the opportunity of renewing their contracts for two further 5 year periods substantially under the same terms and conditions.
The Committee was concerned that certain ancillary services such as closed captioning for the hearing impaired might suffer if they are not considered a `protected service' under the new regime. Accordingly, it has recommended an amendment to Clause 15(2) so that closed captioning should be a protected service included in the new access regime.

"Woodley, Sen John",AD,1998-03-12,"—I moved this request for an amendment as a fall back position from the previous requests, which, as I pointed out, were supported by the current government when they were in opposition and we had a very extensive inquiry into this matter of the assets of farmers being counted for Austudy eligibility and the problem that created in that farmers find themselves to be income poor but asset rich so often. I thought we would move requests for amendments which fitted in with that report as it had been such a longstanding debate going back over many years. I had moved similar requests previously. As a matter of fact, it was Senator Patterson, Senator Lees and I who agreed on the occasion we had moved, once again, that same request for amendment—that it should go to an inquiry. Having agreed to that we held the inquiry—and I was very pleased that the coalition members of that inquiry signed the report—which agreed that farm assets should not be counted.
That refers to the first three requests I moved. As you know, they were defeated. However, in the lead-up to the 1996 election the coalition released its higher education policy. I want to put that on the record again because we were almost onto the adjournment debate when I began to make this explanation last night. It is important that the Senate know what the coalition said in its pre-election policy because in this particular request all I am trying to do is help the coalition actually fulfil its pre-election promise.
—It must have been a non-core promise!
—I do not know whether it is core or non-core. It does not say, so I will just read what the policy stated:
There are a number of inequities in the current eligibility requirements for Austudy. The coalition will relax the assets test for Austudy so that farmers and other self-employed people are not disadvantaged when the value of business related assets such as the family farm significantly outstrip   actual income. As a first step, a coalition government will increase the discount in the assets test for Austudy from 50 per cent to 75 per cent for farm 
 and business assets in businesses in which the parent is substantially engaged.
That is a very clear policy and this is a chance for the coalition to implement what they themselves recognised first of all in the inquiry we had and then in their own policy.
As a matter of fact, when I pressed Senator Brownhill prior to the election he told me that I would be pleased with the coalition policy on this issue. When I saw it I said, `It's not the 100 per cent the inquiry recommended but it is a first step.' I thought that it would not be long before we saw the coalition bringing this matter into this place so that they could implement it because of their representation of farmers. When this legislation came forward I thought it would be the first opportunity to do so. I was surprised that it was not there. So I thought that we would help the coalition to fulfil a very important promise to give access to education to farm families affected by the nature of farming.
I was pleased that the coalition had extended that beyond simply farm assets to other business assets where there is a similar situation obtaining. I think that we all agree that access to education is a fundamental right and children from farming families must have the same opportunities and should have government encouragement to continue the same studies that other children receive. For these reasons I believe that we should have support for this amendment. I look forward to that.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1

"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-12,"—Thank you, Senator Neal. It is very good of you to give me a chance to have a word. Senator, you would be well aware that there have been concerns for a long time in the farming community about issues to do with assets testing. As a result, as soon as we came into government we set up a rural task force, headed at that time by my Parliamentary Secretary, Senator Rod Kemp, and latterly by my next Parliamentary Secretary, Senator Grant Tambling. 
They went around Australia and they met with organisations and individuals and came up with recommendations as to what needed to be done to best help the farming community in response to issues related to the assets test. As a result, the triple A package, which was announced in September or thereabouts by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Anderson, has been very well received in the farming community as going to the special needs of farmers having difficulty on the land.
An important element of that triple A package was the retired farmers adjustment scheme, which has in fact allowed for the orderly gifting of farm assets from one generation to another where a family farm is not viable to keep two families. That has meant that farmers who have a personal interest of up to $500,000, debt free—and that in itself is quite something, but their personal share in the farm is up to $500,000—are enabled to gift the farm to their family who are working the farm and move onto age pension, provided they meet the criteria. That is really substantial because the average age of Australian farmers is 58, which is way too high. We need a younger generation of farmers coming on and we need to be able to keep our young farmers on the farm, and one of the problems has been the lack of succession planning and the limitations which the gifting provisions have put on people who leave it to the last minute. So the window of opportunity that that legislation will give to struggling farm families who may in fact be asset rich but getting little reward from their farm is going to be a major benefit, not to a wide range of farmers; I do not want to suggest that—
—Something like 60, I think you said.
—Nothing like that; it was 2,100. Those are people who fit the criteria of having real financial difficulty because there is more than one family being fed off that farm. It is an expensive measure to help them; I think it is something like $70 million of public funds to help those farmers who may on paper have what looks like substantial assets. I think we have honoured our commitment to farmers. When you take 
 into consideration in addition to that the substantial benefits that this youth allowance legislation is going to mean for country kids in terms of being able to afford to go away to study, you would have to agree that, as a package of measures, it has meant that we have been very focused on helping farm families.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1
"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-03-12,"—I take on board the minister's description of the provisions that allow farmers to pass on their farm and receive the pension, but that is not what I was asking. I was asking whether the statement made by Senator Woodley relating to the discount on the asset value of a farm was in fact the policy of the coalition; I suppose I should say of the coalition government. It did not relate to the matters that you just raised. Did you miss what Senator Woodley said?

"Woodley, Sen John",AD,1998-03-12,"—The Democrats support the triple A package. It is a very good package, and particularly the measure that Senator Newman was talking about is a very good one. In fact, I wrote a private member's bill on this some time ago and then discovered that the government were taking it up. I will say, though, that we are going to have to amend it fairly heavily because it is far too exclusive, particularly the intergenerational transfer. From round the country financial planners are telling me that they are not able to find farmers who are able to fit all the criteria. So we are going to have to fix up the government's package when it comes into this place, but we have not seen the legislation yet. What I am trying to do is not simply to help the transfer of older farmers out of farming so that younger farmers can come in and take over but to help the families of those younger farmers, particularly the children of those younger farmers, to be able to get education. That is the issue, and it relates particularly to this common youth allowance legislation. That is why I want to press this amendment. While commending the government on the triple A package and giving notice that that will also need to be amended, I want to press this amendment, which is 
 about another matter altogether, as Senator Neal has already indicated.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-12,"—I would like to point out to Senator Woodley that the legislation was actually introduced into the House of Representatives yesterday, so he will be able to spend the next week studying it carefully. I have been doing my best to ensure that accountants, lawyers and farm leaders around the country understand the fine print as well, because one of the things that has not been well understood is that it is not only the net value of the farm but it is the net value of the farmer's interest in the farm that has to be under $500,000. That, for most farms in Australia, is pretty reasonable. But this is not the occasion to be debating farmers. I am glad you think it is a worthy measure. I look forward to that debate and your support. By that stage I hope that you see that the fine print is very good. There have been something like a thousand or more expressions of interest so far in it and I think 400 or 500 have put their names down to apply as soon as the legislation goes through.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1

"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-03-12,"—by leave—I move:
That the House of Representatives be requested to make the following amendments:
(12)	 Schedule 2, item 8, page 172 (after line 9), third flow chart box on the left, omit ""$230"", substitute ""the person's ordinary income free area"".
(14)	 Schedule 2, item 8, page 174 (lines 3 to 9), omit ""$230"" (wherever occurring), substitute ""the person's ordinary income free area"".
(15)	 Schedule 2, item 8, page 174 (lines 10 to 17), omit ""$230"" (wherever occurring), substitute ""the person's ordinary income free area"".
The general thrust of these three amendments is to extend the provision presently contained within the legislation for the benefit of students to another group—the young unemployed. You might recall that, previously, the social security legislation for students had provision for a yearly income test which had similar effects to this, but this is the first time the income test as such—as an income bank—has been included in the legislation. I think it is a very good move.
In most cases students are allowed to earn $230 a fortnight before their Austudy, or youth allowance in this case, is affected. If they earn a larger amount, they can extend it, over a longer period, to allow them to still access the allowance. In the normal lifestyle of a student, that would allow them to work intensively during the vacation period and earn in excess of $230 per fortnight but then to earn nothing, or very little, during the normal studying period and to even out their income over the year so that it is not detrimentally affected. That obviously gives a lot of benefit to students. It ensures that they can maximise their income earning capacity during the vacation periods and maximise their time for studying during the semester periods. I really have to say it is a very positive step. The effect of our amendments is to try to extend this mechanism to unemployed young people—of course, that would include those young people who are presently being case managed.
The provision now for young people is that they can only earn $30 a week before their youth allowance is lowered and, for many people, $30 a week is not a great deal of money. I suppose there may well be an acceptance in the community that if you are earning more than that amount your reliance on the community should be reduced.
What I am concerned about and what the amendments are aimed at is that, with the way that work practices are and with the present level of unemployment, sometimes access to employment may only be in very short bursts. I do not believe that it is unusual for a young person to be offered employment for, say, a short period of one or two weeks. That person would obviously earn substantially in excess of the $30 a week. What I am concerned about is that we, as a community, want to maximise the possibility of that young person ultimately being employed—hopefully in a career that they enjoy—and that the best way of ensuring that they eventually enter full-time and ongoing employment is that they obtain some sort of work experience. It is really not a very unusual story to hear from young people that their biggest impediment to getting work is that, 
 when they apply for the job and are asked what experience they have, their answer is none. I do not think that is through any fault of their own. You have to start somewhere.
By allowing the income bank to be applied to those young people, I am not suggesting in any way that their income-free area should be extended beyond the $30 a week but they should be able to average it out over time. If they, say, get a couple of weeks employment but then are unemployed for a substantial period, their income should be evened out so that their youth allowance is not affected. I think this would be a very useful mechanism to emphasise to young people that they should take up work, even if it is only for a very short period, and to encourage them to gain that sort of short-term experience in the hope that, ultimately, that will serve them in good stead in getting long-term work. It is unfortunate but, with our present levels of unemployment and in particular our levels of unemployment for young people, it is often extraordinarily difficult for young people to get work, and we should be assisting in any way we can.
I suppose what the minister may say in response is that we cannot be too lenient—that if they are earning above the $30 a week, their youth allowance should be reduced. But, in terms of encouraging young people to get that work experience, I am prone to lean on the side of leniency and to say that it is more important to get them back to work in the long term than it is to apply strictly an income-free zone without exception in the short term. One of the great problems that has been developing—only in the last three to five years, maybe less, it seems to me—is that of long-term unemployment. I do not mean that in the technical sense of over two years. I am talking about people who are unemployed, with few skills, little experience and a limited expectation of ever being employed. This group starts at 18—not at an older age—and, with each passing year that they remain unemployed and without work experience, the chances increase of their ultimately becoming one of the entrenched long-term unemployed. I plead very strongly with the Senate to consider these requests for amendment care 
 fully, to vote for them and for giving unemployed young people a better opportunity of gaining experience and of ultimately being gainfully employed.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-12,"—The Greens (WA) thought this was such a good idea that we also had this in our amendments. But, because we knew the ALP were moving it, we dropped it off our sheet. Naturally, we will be supporting this. One of the issues that is very prevalent amongst young unemployed people is the level of indebtedness. It is not unreasonable to suggest that seasonal work of some nature hardly delivers a sovereign's ransom. It would be unfortunate if they were punished for trying to get a Bankcard debt down or trying to get on their feet and cover some other costs in their life by utilising those kinds of seasonal work opportunities or, as Senator Neal suggested, other potential work opportunities.
A work opportunity could arise from somebody in an office going on leave and an unemployed person then has an opportunity to fill that position and get some real experience. We should try to find ways to deal with that transitional time: from the point of being unemployed to the point of gaining the confidence to go out into the workplace and earn a real living. Unfortunately, the government is not doing a lot about that, so the very least it can do is assist young people to get that experience, to utilise seasonal work where it exists, and to have the potential to stay out of debt.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-12,"—I caution the Senate against accepting this opposition amendment. One of the most telling things is that, as I am advised, it would cost around $27 million a year to extend this provision to the young unemployed from being given just to students. I remind the Senate that Department of Social Security statistics show that on average young people now remain on unemployed payments for five months. That would not seem to be an enormous problem when you compare their ability to take up opportunities for part-time work with the situation of students, who may be on a youth allow 
 ance—Austudy, as it is now—for a number of years.
There are differences in this element between students and the young unemployed. Students have a much more constrained opportunity to take work because of the nature of their studies and their time commitments. It is much more difficult for them to take part-time work during the year, but they can take it during semester breaks and the long break in the summer. That is why we have tried to make special arrangements for students. 
The current income test for unemployment benefits is a fair balance. It is one for which I give credit to the previous government, as I have done before in this place, for having introduced in 1995 a better arrangement for people trying to get some part-time work while they are on benefits. As Senator Neal has said, that is $30 a week without losing one dollar of benefit; for the next $40 a week they lose only 50c in the dollar; and beyond that it is 70c in the dollar. It is a long taper for income testing, which I do not believe is unfair.
The current system gives people an incentive to find work. When the Labor Party introduced that tapered means test, the argument was very strongly put that that was in order to give a real incentive to find work and to reward people for finding work. We agree with that; it was the right thing to do. It certainly has proved its worth. More and more people are taking up part-time or casual work opportunities when they arise.
Also, they are not likely to be unemployed or to be on income support for as long as students are and do not have the same constraints on when they earn their income. But, if you extend the student income bank, you would effectively be undermining means testing for young people. That is why the Senate should recognise that the result of that would be extra expenditure of around $27 million a year and that would be totally unacceptable to this government.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-12,"—Considering the minister has not answered any of my questions I asked yesterday about her costings, it is extraordi 
 nary that she is so confident of this one. Even if it were the case that it would cost $27 million a year, it would be $27 million a year well spent.
It seems to me that the government's priorities are all wrong. We have committed ourselves to billions of dollars to bail out Western speculative banks in South-East Asia for taking out unsecured loans—billions of dollars! Here we are talking about giving our kids the chance to gain confidence, self-reliance and an ability to make their own decisions, to meet some of their own needs and potentially to get out of some disastrous debts by using opportunities that often are only available through seasonal work for people who have no other skills. The government is being mean-spirited. It is forgetting that $27 million a year to the young people of Australia is a great deal and would be very much appreciated by them, rather than it being in the pockets of governments who simply are prepared to give billions of dollars away to Western speculative banks for unsecured loans.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-03-12,"—The Australian Democrats will be supporting the opposition's requests for amendments just as we would be supporting the Greens (WA) amendment, if that were being put. We support the extension of this income bank. But I was quite curious to hear just then the minister's comments in relation to the differences between the circumstances of young people—specifically young unemployed people—and students.
I might put on record that many of those differences, financial or legal, are of the government's own making. Many of them are manufactured by governments themselves. I include in that the disparity, until recently, in benefits if you were a student accessing student financial assistance as opposed to a young unemployed person getting the dole.
Of course, as to job opportunities, while I recognise the particular constraints, certainly time wise on young people who may be students or mature age students, I do not think job opportunities are particularly good for any young Australian at the moment. And why 
 would the government then, conscious of these differences, conscious of the difficulties that face students in particular, seek to perpetuate the differences—and the unfair differences at that—by insisting on an age of independence of 25, which is at least four years different from that for a young unemployed person?
Many of the constraints to which the minister referred that affect young students are there because the government has made it very difficult for young people—be they students or not—not only to obtain work but to have money in the bank.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1

"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-03-12,"—Yes, I did—basically the average point. The trouble with averages is that, if there is a large number of young people who get work almost immediately, that may well bring the average down. I suspect—and I would seek some guidance from the department on this—that there is a large number that get work virtually within one or two weeks, but then there is another group that waits for substantial periods of time before actually becoming employed. This particular policy is aimed at that second group. I suppose that the first group, which works almost immediately, would be largely unaffected.
I think that sometimes averages can be misleading in that this putting together of two 
 groups—one which waits a long time, and one which gets employed almost immediately—gives you an average of five months. But, really, as a representation of how the group operates, it is not terribly helpful. Can you give me any guidance on the profile of young people's period of unemployment?",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1

"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-03-12,"—Bearing in mind that obviously this is fairly crucial to the debate, I think it is important that we wait for that information to be provided. I was a little startled by the minister saying that $27 million was an unacceptable amount to pay for getting or assisting young people to get back to work.
I know that we sometimes get a little cynical in this chamber when we talk about that side and this side of politics. But is it really too much, from an annual budget the size of Australia's, to spend $27 million on a provision that potentially may mean in the long term that young people—and eventually they become middle-aged people and older people—do get into the work force? I do not know whether that is true. I do not think that sort of money to encourage people into work is that huge.
I listened to the minister's comments about the tapering of the income-free zone, how that was a great measure and that it encouraged people to look for part-time and casual work—and I am sure that is true, and I appreciate her comments. But I do not believe that in the fight against unemployment—and, in particular, youth unemployment and long-term unemployment—making one change, putting in place one measure and saying, `Well, that's fair enough; we're quite happy with the levels of unemployment, and we're not going to do any more' is really a satisfactory position to take.
—I am not saying that, and you know it.
—If that is not what the minister is saying, I am very pleased to hear it. I think the fact that we did introduce a longer tapering of the income-free zone was 
 a good thing. The provision proposed in our amendment of having the income bank for young unemployed people can also assist. The fact that the minister is leaving her mind open to that possibility, that her mind is not closed to making further provisions to get the unemployed back to work, is very pleasing to hear.
—The government is focused on getting young people into jobs.
—If you go out into the community—both at the local and national level—overwhelmingly the community's view is that the reduction of unemployment should be this government's, and any future government's, absolute first priority. It certainly will be a very difficult thing for this government. They have relied very much on predictions of economic growth which obviously appear to be very inaccurate, and will continue to be even more inaccurate as the impact of Asia's deteriorating economic climate comes into effect.
So, if the policy of fighting unemployment that this government has been pursuing is by way of economic growth—and I think it is fairly well accepted that you need economic growth of at least four per cent, and probably closer to 4.5 per cent, to really reduce the level of unemployment—then certainly the levels of growth this government is creating are not coming anywhere close.
If the government is failing in that area, what else is it doing to deal with unemployment—not just over the next week or next fortnight or the next six months but for many years to come? As I say, the seeds of long-term unemployment—sometimes for generations—are sown by a failure to do everything possible to get young people into work. This is why the opposition has moved these requests for amendments. Again, I hope that the minister will consider the matter very carefully. Maybe the minister has some information for me now about the length of employment of young people.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-12,"—I would also like to ask a question about the so-called long taper. I cannot imagine in a tax regime going from $30 a week to $31 a week and having half of your allowance taken off you as a result of 
 going from $30 to $31. That is extraordinary. It might be better than what it was—I am not sure—but that is not a long taper. Basically, if you go from $30 a week without having your youth allowance affected to $31 a week and having it halved, that is not a long taper. That is extraordinary.
—It is nothing of the sort.
—It is only for the dollar above the $30.
—Oh, it is for your marginal rate. But it is quite extraordinary and it is more than you would have in a taper on a tax system. Can the minister guarantee that it is the marginal rate above that? How does that work? It is not going to affect a person's income; it is going to affect their youth allowance, is it not? How does that actually work? That does seem to be a fairly steep taper, not a long taper.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-12,—This is an outrageous response. We are actually dealing with the item on student income bank. The minister said this is a very generous taper.

"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-03-12,"—I must confess that this happens more and more regularly, Minister. You have a group of six people there and none of them have any idea about that fairly obvious issue. I find that quite extraordinary. I also find it quite extraordinary that so often when information is requested in a debate you seem to make no effort to access it before the issue that it relates to is actually dealt with. In fact, I would go so far as to say that in some cases it is a strategy because the information that has been requested might not necessarily assist your case.
—We are bringing it forward as fast as possible.
—When we were in government the information requested was dealt with in a much more responsive and responsible fashion. The minister seems to hold the view that the information is to be used solely in support of her and her government's arguments rather than it being a resource available to the whole chamber so that we can properly assess what our response should be to questions we have to decide. I do not think it assists decision making in this chamber for the minister to be so slow and, frankly, uninterested in providing information requested. ",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-12,"—I obviously have to defend myself against that because it is untrue. Senator Neal knows that every time she has asked for information I have done my utmost to get it for her in a speedy fashion. As she was in government—although not as a minister—only relatively recently, she would realise that this can be a problem for ministers in debates, no matter what the political colour, no matter which department we are talking about. If oppositions or minority parties want additional information to what is available to the officers who are present in the chamber, then sometimes it can take some time to get.
I am sorry, Senator, if you do not feel that you have had speedy enough service. I have done my utmost to accommodate you. I understand that you would like more information on this, but I have given you the information that was very relevant to this debate. It is that on average young people between the ages of 18 and 20 are on unemployment payments for five months. That is very relevant to this question about incentives and questions about young people taking up work, because it means that they then go either into work or into study after that period of unemployment. You are asking for additional information on that. I do not have that yet, and I am sorry about that, but you have enough to be going on with because, quite clearly, the issue is one of incentive.
Your government—obviously Senator Margetts did not realise this—introduced what I think was a very good change to the Social Security Act which did provide for much greater incentives for people of any age to take up available work, and I have commended you for it. That remains. It is not something we have introduced, but it is a good thing. Therefore, I think the young unemployed people who do have more available time to look for work and to take up opportunities for work do not need the income bank provisions which are provided specifically for students because they do not have those same opportunities to take up job opportunities of one kind or another during an academic semester. You would recognise that 
 is the case. I cannot believe that you would be prepared to spend $27 million per annum extra in order to extend the income bank provisions to a group of young people who, because of your own government's actions, already do have substantial incentives to take up what work is available.
Before I sit down, I point out to you that the whole purpose of youth allowance—there are several, but a very primary purpose of youth allowance—is to make sure that young people by the time they are 18 are much more employable than they are now, because too high a proportion of them are offering themselves on the job market without skills. When this measure is introduced, we will start to see young people acquiring the skills up to the age of 18 that they will need to offer employers. Hopefully we will not have the big pool of unemployed young people that we inherited when we came into government.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1
"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-03-12,"—I do not wish to take up the time of the Senate on this issue for much longer, in terms of access to information. I will make two points. The first is that averages can always be misleading. Although the average is five months, it may well be that there is not one single young unemployed person who gets a job after five months. I am sure that is a matter you understand fully. That is why it is not always the most indicative statistic.

I must say that it has been a fairly general criticism of the government by the opposition that it seems unwilling to indicate on the record that it has even a particular level of employment or unemployment that it is aiming at. It seems quite extraordinary to me, and I think probably to most of the opposition, that the government believes the level of unemployment that is expected and the level that the government is aiming at with its policies are matters that cannot be disclosed to the public, who are totally affected and interested in knowing what the outcomes will be.

That the House of Representatives be requested to make the following amendment:
(1)	 Page 181 (after line 28), at the end of the Bill, add:
Schedule 3—Newly arrived resident's waiting period for special benefit

This amendment that I have moved on behalf of the Democrats was circulated when we first started considering this bill two weeks ago. It is an amendment to the Social Security Act relating to the two-year waiting period for newly arrived residents and it seeks to exempt those people from the waiting period simply in relation to special benefit. The reason why I am moving this—I understand the Greens (WA) have an identical amendment that they are seeking to move as well—is in response to a growing number of calls from community and charity groups, groups that work with newly arrived residents, who are seeing the impact that this measure of the two-year waiting period is having on a number of people.
Those community groups are being left to pick up the pieces when our newly arrived residents find themselves in circumstances of destitution, unable to meet their most basic requirements and needs of life. That situation is a direct result of the legislation that was passed by this parliament last year which does leave a number of people finding that they cannot meet even their most basic requirements of life. These are legal Australian residents who have been invited into Australian society. They are unable to buy sufficient food to eat, unable to access safe or suitable accommodation and unable to feed their children an adequate and nutritious diet. In fact, some newly arrived residents have found that they have been left with no option but to have their children cared for by other people simply because they cannot access adequate financial resources to care for themselves. In the Democrats' view, that is a totally unacceptable situation.
The two-year waiting period overall for social security benefits for newly arrived residents was introduced in March last year and passed through the parliament at that time. At that time the Democrats opposed that measure. We continue to do so because we believe that the principle that it is founded on is fundamentally flawed and discriminatory and also counterproductive, not only socially but we believe economically.
A number of organisations have criticised the measure. Welfare rights groups and ACOSS in particular have said that the introduction of the social security waiting period for newly arrived migrants is basically creating a nightmare for those people and is perhaps the most serious undermining of the basic fabric of Australia's social security safety net. The Democrats believe that leaving newly arrived residents, or anyone else for that matter, without access to any income at all when they have no other alternative means of support is completely unacceptable.
However, this amendment is not seeking to re-run the whole debate about the two-year waiting period. The Democrats are still opposed to it but we accept that the government is committed to that, and that is their choice. What we are really getting at today is specifically removing that solely for special benefit, which is the payment of last resort. It has traditionally been the very bottom safety net of our social security system available to people who are in desperate need of income support, are not eligible for any other form of social security benefit and have no other alternative means of support.
Since last March, apart from some exemptions, such as family members of refugees and citizens, special benefit can only be paid to a migrant within two years of their arrival if they prove they have suffered a substantial change of circumstances beyond their control. That is the wording from the legislation. The government argues that that provides sufficient discretion for the department to provide special  benefits for newly arrived residents who are in need. I think that was the argument they used that convinced enough of the Senate to support the measure last year. The reason why we need to re-visit this particular 
 aspect of it now is because of the evidence that is now coming through that that is not sufficient to meet all the circumstances that people are finding themselves in.
That exemption has been interpreted in a manner that still leaves a number of newly arrived residents whose funds have run out being denied special benefit despite being completely destitute. These people are then confronted with additional problems because, being ineligible for a social security payment, they are also ineligible for other assistance such as access to labour market programs and concessions that may assist them in becoming a more productive member of Australian society. Even worse, because they are unable to support themselves and their families, many new migrants are also effectively barred from participating in migrant English program courses, which again would assist them in more adequately being able to be productive members of Australian society. So it is really a catch-22 situation for these people. They are finding themselves with no way out. Many of them came to Australia with very high expectations. Many of these people are skilled migrants who have a lot to contribute to Australian society in economic terms as well as socially and culturally.
Is it really any wonder that a recent study by the Ethnic Communities Council, which was done in conjunction with the University of Sydney, showed that 46 per cent—nearly half—of recently arrived migrants now wish they had never come to Australia? The government may say, `That is good. That shows that we are giving the message that we are not giving migrants an easy ride.' I think that is an unfortunate interpretation. To think that half of the newly arrived migrants in this country are now wishing they were not here does not give a very hopeful sign for the future in terms of how those people are going to feel and the many more who are going to follow them who may feel likewise. How are they likely to feel in terms of how connected they feel with the broader social fabric in Australia?
I think it is important to emphasise that the government has been looking very closely at ensuring that the amount and quality of 
 information they give to people who are considering coming to Australia is as accurate as possible. Through the immigration department they are continually searching to improve the service in that regard to ensure that people are fully informed about not only the existence of this two-year waiting period but also their prospects of getting jobs when they get here, what the cost of living is and whether their qualifications are likely to be recognised.
I accept the government's efforts in that regard. I think it is important to recognise that no matter how good that becomes you will never be able to make sure that everybody knows everything they need to know in all aspects before they come here. The Democrats believe that to simply say to those people who get here and run into trouble, as people often do, that that is just their bad luck is totally unacceptable.
Once many of these migrants do arrive in Australia they are finding the reality much different from what they had envisaged. That is always going to be the case with some people. Many find it difficult to get a job. We have heard a lot during the course of this legislation about unemployment and the difficulties of young people who have lived here all their lives getting a job. Many young migrants included amongst those obviously have even higher hurdles they have to try to get over to get employment. That is particularly the case for those who come from non-English speaking backgrounds.
I imagine many senators have been getting letters from some of the community organisations that are dealing with this problem out in the field. It is important to emphasise the burden that that is putting on them—not just the financial burden on their resources but also the time involved and the emotional burden on those workers. These are groups like the Welfare Rights Centre, the Council of Social Services groups, a number of other groups and the migrant resource centres that are working at the grassroots level. I have had letters from the Fairfield youth workers network and the non-English speaking background youth issues network specifically addressing the impact of this measure on 
 young people. That is partly why I think it is particularly relevant that we are dealing with this matter as part of the youth allowance legislation.
There is any number of case studies those organisations have provided of the situation that people are finding themselves in which are enough to demonstrate that there are people in total and absolute need through no fault of their own. Maybe they did not get the correct information; maybe they were just naive about how well they thought they would go when they got here. From the Democrats' point of view, that really does not matter and it is not the role of departments or government or society to judge people on that matter. The bottom line is that people are being left with no means of support whatsoever and no opportunity for getting it; they are totally destitute in situations of extreme need, putting massive burdens on emergency relief operations—the Salvation Army and related services like that—which are not set up to deal with those sorts of situations over a long-term basis. I believe, and the Democrats believe, that that is totally unacceptable.
I do not believe that the government intended or envisaged that that situation would necessarily occur or that the government is so harsh. I recognise they want to send a strong message out with the two-year waiting period. I have already indicated that the Democrats do not agree with that, but I do not believe the government is so harsh that they want to have a situation which now exists through the existing legislation with such harsh consequences being visited on people through no fault of their own. For that reason, the Democrats are presenting the government and all of the Senate with the opportunity to reconsider this matter solely in relation to the special benefit and address the real need that is being demonstrated out in the community.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-12,"—I have listened very carefully to Senator Bartlett. I do not want to engage in a re-run of the previous debate we had on this in previous times. As a former social security staff member, he would well understand what good review and appeal processes are available to 
 people. They are working, Senator. The recent AAT cases have shown that people can demonstrate that they fit within the guidelines for special benefit, and decisions can be overturned. That is an indication that that review and appeal process does work and is working for people in these circumstances. No doubt we will see some more. It is important to recognise and acknowledge that.
Another sign that the system is working is that there are currently over 300 migrants receiving special benefit—in fact, it is about 340 at the moment. That is growing month by month, as you would expect. So we are recognising that there are cases that fit within the criteria for the special benefit and that they are receiving it. I do not make any apology for the wording of the current law. It is not something I really want to talk about now because of time constraints.
If, through circumstances beyond their control, people come to this country and find that they cannot support themselves—for example, because their sponsor has died or because the job that they have been contracted to come to has gone—then special benefits step in. But we do not believe that Australians expect new migrants to come here and walk straight on to welfare without sponsors being prepared to honour their commitments. In the case of independent migrants, they should either prearrange a job for themselves or bring sufficient money with them to support themselves. If there was no particular test for migrants wanting special benefits, as we said in the previous debate, it would simply be a backdoor method to actually accessing support from the taxpayer. It would be circumventing the migrant waiting period altogether.
I do appreciate, Senator, that you are well meaning in your motives in proposing it, but I think it would send all the wrong signals to people. We have been trying to say, `You come here; you are welcome; we welcome your contribution to our country, but you are expected to make proper provision for yourself in those first two years.'
I do not know that there is anything additional I should put on the table except that the amendment has been costed by my department for 1998-99 at $13.3 million and for 
 1999-2000 at $19.5 million. It is interesting here that ACOSS claims that it would be a cost of some $30 million. One of the reasons they are wrong is that they are accessing special benefit now, as I just demonstrated.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-03-12,"—Thank you for that response, Minister. I would just like to raise a couple of points out of it. I recognise and agree with your comments about the appeal and review processes that are available through the social security system and the appeals tribunal. I could sidetrack here about the proposed changes to tribunals and whether that is the way to go given how effective the Social Security Appeals Tribunal currently is, but I will leave that one for another time.
I think there are two issues here. One is the extra difficulty that newly arrived migrants in particular would have in being aware of all their rights in that regard. It is a constant battle, as you know, for the department to ensure that people in the general community are aware of all the avenues open to them, and newly arrived residents in particular are less likely to be aware of all their rights. I do not believe it is satisfactory to expect people—particularly people who are in desperate situations, who are new to the country and who often have language difficulties et cetera—to have to battle their way up through all the levels of the appeal system just to get enough to eat. That is not satisfactory.
I also think the way the department appears to be interpreting `a substantial change of circumstances beyond their control' is operating in a way where it is being interpreted very tightly, so the fact is that people have run out of money. We are not talking about people who are ignoring assistance from their sponsor or whatever. We are talking about people who have explored all of those avenues, or those avenues have dried up and they now have no other alternative.
We are looking at the situation where they have no alternative means of support at all. That is a situation which applies with the special benefit in any case, and that has always been the case. This extra hurdle is something that newly arrived residents and nobody else have to jump—they have to show 
 that the circumstances of absolute need that they are in have arisen due to things beyond their control. The provision is being interpreted, it appears to me, as something that they could not have envisaged. The problem seems to be that the department is saying to people, `You have run out of money but you should have been able to see that was going to happen because you could not have expected to get a job or you could not have expected to have survived with the amount of money that you have.'
Maybe these people have made a misjudgment. I am loathe to make this look like it is all a matter of foolish migrants who have not thought through what they were going to do before they came here, because I do not think that is the case in a lot of circumstances. But, even in the circumstances where that is the case, I do not believe it is appropriate that people who are in those circumstances and have no means of support whatsoever should basically be told, `Tough luck. You should have stayed at home.'
That is the message here and I believe most Australians, whether or not they support the overall principle of the two-year waiting period for migrants, would accept the reality of the situation that some people are being put in where they have no alternative means of support, whether through their own misjudgment or through being given this information or whatever, and are basically left to starve. I do not believe the average Australian would support that situation, so I would ask the minister to reconsider that.
I have a couple of specific questions to try and focus some of the issues here, and I do not want to prolong the debate too much. Firstly, in regard to the cost figures that the minister gave of about $13.3 million and $19.5 million a year, what are the actual numbers of people that they represent? Hopefully that is not a secret. As for the other question, I ask: in relation to the recent appeals tribunal rulings that have received a lot of publicity, is the department likely to reconsider its directive to the regional offices about its interpretation of the clause `a substantial change of circumstances beyond their control'. As part of the wash-up of reviewing 
 that decision, is the department likely to change its interpretation of that clause in any way?",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1
"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-03-12,"—I wish to harken back to that point you made earlier, Senator Bartlett. I think you quoted a figure of 46 per cent of immigrants who regretted having come to Australia. I wonder what the source of that was.
—That was from a study done through the Ethnic Affairs Commission in conjunction with the University of Sydney. It was a survey of recently arrived migrants.
—Was it in the paper just the other day?
—I am not sure.
—If it was the one I was thinking of, it was 95 Migrants . I am not sure if it is the same one.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1998-03-12,"—I rise to express a great deal of concern about the operation of the so-called safety nets for newly arrived migrants within their period of two years of being in Australia. I well recall the discussions that have been held in this chamber over the last few years. I have pages and pages of Hansard  in which there have been questions asked of the minister and expressions of concern made by various honourable senators and myself.
I am personally distressed that the situation has arisen whereby people are in a situation of absolute destitution. Many are not picked up and even those who are picked up very often do not have their situation catered for by any sort of safety net. I say that personally, but I know that there is also a considerable amount of concern amongst agencies such as St Vincent de Paul, Anglicare and City Mission—organisations which are more at the coalface than we are. We do, in the course of our duties, run across very difficult situations and people in great poverty.
I do not want to remind honourable senators of the reading about the rich man Dives and Lazarus but we do have a considerable responsibility to address this issue and address it urgently. I understand the point of view of the chamber at the present moment. It appears that the feeling is that maybe  this is not the 
 place to do it but I commend Senator Bartlett for raising it here. I feel so strongly about it at this time that I would like to support him in this measure.
I was given certain indications, if that is the word—rather than undertakings—that there would be a satisfactory safety net in the form of a special allowance for those migrants whose circumstances change significantly for reasons beyond their personal control after their arrival in Australia. I would like to know from the minister why that is being interpreted so narrowly. Those are the issues. We really do need to have some indication from the government that the tragic circumstances of quite a number of newly arrived migrants—I cannot put a figure on it—will be alleviated. I remember that the government did have regard to a number of things that I raised, including the parenting allowance, the maternity payments and so on. Clearly they do alleviate the problems that are being experienced and about which other senators have made some comment.
It has been made perfectly clear to the chamber that, without the social security payment, unemployed migrants are not entitled to access government labour market programs, transport concessions, which are rather important, particularly when looking for jobs in the larger cities, public housing, rent assistance and so on. The impact of all of this in malnutrition and the declining health of some of those migrants is there to be seen. No doubt the minister has received representations from a number of organisations. I thought that one of those organisations, the Council for Social Services in New South Wales, did present a very thoughtful and well-constructed letter which pointed out the problems. It was that letter of 9 March 1998. No doubt other honourable senators and the minister have received a copy of that letter. The minister may wish to comment on the matters that have been raised with her by a number of groups and also now in the chamber.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-12,"—As I said to Senator Bartlett, the review system is working. We are seeing the AAT cases which 
 have found in favour of the migrants. That is a pretty good example that it still works in this area and that if we make a decision that is found to be outside the guidelines then the review process works. Senator, we are also reviewing the operation of the guidelines continuously. As I said to you, something like 340 people were receiving this special benefit as at January; it has been increasing month by month. You might be interested to note that the rejection rate in the last three months has been trending down. In November last year, for example, 39 people were rejected; in December, 28 were rejected; and in January, 22 were rejected.
—Out of how many?
—I think it was out of total claims of 173. Those figures could be due to a couple of things. There could be fewer people coming who were not adequately advised at the beginning or who did not take in the advice they got. It could be that the initial operation of the guidelines has settled down and there is greater consistency across the Centrelink system. I cannot say, Senator. Given the concerns that you have, that trend over those three months has to be more reassuring. Rejection numbers are reducing. At the same time we have a substantial number of people on the benefit and those that have been unsuccessful in getting the benefit—three cases, to my knowledge—have come through to the AAT and been successful. Other people could have been successful at earlier levels either in the authorised review officer process or in the Social Security Appeals Tribunal process. I do not have that information here with me but that system is certainly still continuing and available to migrants, many of whom had some help from the Welfare Rights Centre.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-12,"—I looked at those figures that the minister just gave us—39, 28 and 22. Even if that was averaged at, say, 30 a month, that looks like it is over 300 a year. The minister mentioned that there were 340 migrants receiving special benefits, and it could be extrapolated that around half were being knocked back, that is, half of the people who actually know that they can have an 
 appeal. We know that the government has been very mean-spirited. Worse than that, I believe it has denied basic human rights of many newly arrived migrants and people seeking to be migrants in terms of access to legal advice. We know that court costs have increased, we know that costs of justice have increased and we know that to do anything in the system when you do not know that you have rights is almost impossible. I really think that these figures of 340 migrants and growing could indicate a growing problem that is perhaps massively more than the figures actually portray.
I think the signal this government basically is giving is that it is all right to come to Australia if you are rich. If you have got resources behind you, a big fat bank balance or some rich relatives, that is just fine. But, if you are an ordinary person who has come to Australia for a variety of reasons and have been accepted on the normal basis—and that is fairly restrictive these days—you are going to have a really hard time from this government if you are not rich or if you are not immediately able to access jobs. We know it is going to be really difficult if you do not have access to language classes and other support and employment services. So it is all stacked against you from this government's point of view.
I believe the reason is that it is really very useful to have a group of people or several groups of people that you can blame for the current economical woes. The government does not actually come out and say that, but that is exactly the effect that it has. If you target migrants, refugees, unemployed and Aboriginal people, you have a way of directing the anger of people of Australia who have had such a hard time over the past few years because of the current economic situation—not just about their levels of income but what is happening with the things they can buy and the things they cannot buy, and what is happening with their own job security—towards those people who are not in a position to fight back. That is called scapegoat politics. This is, unfortunately, what we see, and what the Greens (WA) and the Democrats are trying to do here is to redress some of the 
 worst aspects of scapegoat politics. We know that this six-month waiting period was started by the previous government, but that is no excuse. Senator Harradine, the Democrats and the Greens were on all of those occasions standing up strongly against that level of cheap politics, scapegoat politics, which was intended basically to direct attention from the economic and social outcomes of government policies towards those people who cannot easily fight back.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-03-12,"—Briefly, I put in a plea to the government to support the not unreasonable amendment that has been moved by Senator Bartlett. I thank the minister and the government for accepting one of my earlier amendments in relation to the waiting period for newly arrived residents, particularly in relation to what we consider the retrospective aspects of that provision as it relates to the common youth allowance. This amendment relates to special benefits. Senator Bartlett has outlined, as have other honourable senators, many good reasons for the government accepting this, but I think that when we are talking about special benefits those arguments apply even more so.
The Democrat opposition to the two-year waiting period has been put on the record squarely and many times. At the time we expressed our concern at the original inclusion of benefits from disability wage and carer's pension through to the common youth allowance and, of course, parenting, maternity and special benefits. Senator Harradine is right in saying that some of those concerns were taken on board by the government when the issue was re-debated, and it was a number of times. But special benefits are the payment of last resort for those people in the most anxious and dire straits, and we know that people are in dire straits.
As Senator Harradine pointed out to the chamber, we are all receiving correspondence from various community and advocacy groups, in particular the Welfare Rights Centre, who have described cases of individuals and families who are really unable to get shelter, to feed themselves properly and to 
 attend AMEP classes. This is a reality. I share Senator Bartlett's hope that the government is not so harsh that it will reject this amendment, because it is in relation to those really special cases. I thank the government again for taking on board one of my amendments, though not quite our ambit claim amendment in relation to the two-year waiting period, and I hope that they will extend that logic and that concern to accepting Senator Bartlett's amendment before us.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1
"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-03-12,"—You may recall that we had this debate earlier about the extension of benefits generally during that two-year waiting period for immigrants. Clearly the opposition have made a decision in that regard. Special benefits are in a special category in that special benefit is a payment of last resort, it is not an entitlement. Whatever other requirements must be satisfied, it is essentially discretionary. It is a payment where all else fails. I suppose there is a general feeling in the community that it should not be the Australian taxpayer who supports people who decide to emigrate to Australia and intentionally come here knowing that they have no support and believing that they are unlikely to be able to obtain support for themselves while they are here.
What is less clear and what is of concern to the Labor opposition is whether it is acceptable that, if people who do not immigrate with that intention but rather with the intention of supporting themselves by being employed or who have sufficient assets to look after themselves until they are employed find themselves in circumstances where they cannot support themselves or their families, we should wash our hands of them as a community and say, `We will do nothing. We will allow you to remain without any support at all.'
At the moment there is some provision that says that if circumstances have changed you can, at the discretion of the secretary to the department, have access to that special benefit, even if you are an immigrant or an immigrant family, within that two-year period. It appears that that definition of changed circumstances has been expanded somewhat 
 by interpretations of the AAT. If you check with your adviser you will find that is the case, Minister. The question that we need to determine here today is whether the provisions for special benefits that already exist are a sufficient safety net for immigrants who do come here and who do, in most circumstances, come here in very good faith.
Minister, you have said there have been a number of applications and in the last six months there have been some refusals. I would be interested to know if you have any information about the basis of those refusals and whether there were a large number of refusals on the basis that their circumstances had not changed. I would also be interested to know—as all sensible people making these sorts of decisions would like to know—the cost involved in the extension of special benefits. Really, what we are saying is that the change of circumstances provision is no longer required. Maybe the minister could provide us with that information.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-12,"—In response to Senator Neal, I understand that the rejections of people have been, I think almost entirely but certainly mostly, because there has been no evidence of a change in circumstances beyond their control, which is the basic criterion. Essentially people have come here without adequate means to support themselves.
I do not know how the family category can possibly cause a problem for people coming here because they are coming with a sponsor. If the sponsor dies or goes bankrupt, those are considered to be circumstances beyond their control and they are eligible for the special benefit. It tends to be more of a problem for people in the skilled migrant class, some of whom are coming regardless of the fact that, on any reasonable understanding—and they are given information about the cost of living and also the employment circumstances in Australia—they come with a totally unrealistic idea of how they could keep themselves for more than a week or two. Some people are coming hell or high water, as I understand it from some of the cases that I have been 
 reading about. Does that answer what you were getting at?
—Yes.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-03-12,"—I did ask a question of the minister to which I have not yet got a response, although I can understand that, given that she has had people throwing all sorts of requests and questions at her over the last half an hour or so. The question I asked was about the number of claims represented by the $13.3 million and the $19.5 million annual costs that she provided earlier. Perhaps this is part of what the minister was just saying in terms of this probably not relating much to the family reunion and being more to do with skilled migrants coming here without adequate means of support or adequate funds.
I understand that recently the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Mr Ruddock, indicated finetuning of the skilled migrant program to put a higher requirement on the amount of funds people would need to have before they could come to Australia. One question I would ask is whether the minister can confirm that that is the case, without going down another sidetrack about the appropriateness of the direction of the immigration policy of the government. That is another issue we could talk about, but I will refrain. I would also ask the minister whether, assuming that my understanding is correct, those likely changes coming into effect would possibly reduce the cost of the measure that the Democrats are proposing here today.
Again, it comes down to a basic situation of people who have arrived legally in this country and whom we have welcomed here. It is not a matter of people migrating here and walking straight down to the dole office; it is a matter of people who migrate here and find themselves, for whatever reason, without any means of support. That is what the special benefit is about. It is a discretionary payment. It is about helping people who do not have a sufficient livelihood and who have no alternative means of support. The basic principle here is that we have people who are legal Australian residents and to whom we have said, `Yes, come to our country.' Using 
 phrases to describe people being determined to come here `hell or high water' I think gives a bit of a strange signal about people we are legally allowing into the country. If we do not want them to come in then we should not let them in. Again, that is another debate on immigration policy about which there would different views.
If we are going to allow people in through all of the appropriate processes and expect them to, and indeed insist that they, contribute as much as they can to Australian society and our economy, if they find themselves with no means of support whatsoever—no options, total destitution—then surely it is a fundamental principle in those circumstances that those people have the same right to the last resort safety net as anybody who was born here or who is a legal resident of this country. It astonishes me that such a discriminatory principle can be defended in a situation that does not apply to a large number of people. It applies to people who have fallen through all of the nets available and who are in dire straits.
We need to recognise that, if we are going to allow these people into the country, we have a duty as a civilised society to assist them. It gets back to what appears to be too tight a definition or interpretation of the legislative provision about requiring a `substantial change in circumstances beyond their control', and that hurdle having to be put on new migrants and nobody else. One of the examples among many—and there are any number of case studies that have been provided by organisations that have had to deal with this situation—which perhaps highlights more than most the way the application of that provision is too tight is the example of a man who came here as a skilled migrant—an engineer—from Bangladesh. His qualifications and employment background had been closely scrutinised by the Australian authorities before he came here. He did not bring a large amount of money with him, which was obviously a bad idea, but that was all he had left of his savings after all the costs of migrating.
He was not able to find work quickly, did not have adequate funds, et cetera, and ap 
 plied for a special benefit. He did not succeed initially. It went to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, and this is one case where the appeals tribunal worked in an applicant's favour and paid a special benefit. The minister may say that that again proves that the system is working but, according to the Welfare Rights Centre who assisted this client at the tribunal, the reason why he won his appeal on the grounds of changed circumstance was because he had become so destitute that he was suffering from malnutrition and depression. That was determined by the tribunal to be the circumstances beyond his control—that it was unreasonable for him to have perceived that he would get here and become malnourished. If we are getting into a situation where people have to become malnourished simply to be able to qualify for assistance then, surely, that is a situation that is totally unacceptable. I would urge the minister to look at that sort of situation and recognise that, because of the way this legislation is being interpreted, it is not catching everybody and also recognise that, as a civilised country, we have a duty to that small number of people—and I hope we eventually get those numbers—who are in situations where they have no opportunity at all to support themselves.
It is probably worth bringing to the attention of the Senate and the minister some of the case studies—and, as I said, there are a number available, and I will not go through all of them—that the Welfare Rights Centre has provided not only of the people who have gone through the Welfare Rights Centre but also those which they have provided on behalf of a wide range of organisations, mainly in the Sydney and New South Wales region. We have heard from the Migrant Resource Centres of Illawarra and Newcastle and different parts of New South Wales, the Ethnic Community Councils, the Canterbury Bankstown Migrant Resource Centre, et cetera. Some of the case studies that have been provided relate specifically to people who were sponsored migrants and then found themselves in situations where they were not able to be adequately supported.
One case study that was provided was of a woman who was sponsored by her sister for 
 permanent residence and, upon her arrival, it then became apparent that she had basically been brought here by her sister to work as an unpaid housekeeper and to care for the mother who was suffering from dementia. It became a fairly abusive situation which involved being subjected to domestic violence, et cetera. According to that case study, that client claimed a special benefit but was refused and there was no investigation into the domestic situation. That is another situation where the department's processes fell down somewhat, but those sorts of things are going to happen.
As I mentioned before, in terms of the attempts of the immigration department to be as efficient and as clear as possible, I am sure they do try as hard as possible and I know that Social Security tries as hard as possible, but you are never going to get it perfectly right. You are going to get people who are in desperate situations coming in to apply and the officer at the counter will tell them, `Look, you came here less than two years ago. You're not eligible. Don't bother applying,' rather than saying to them, Well, put it in, we'll test it out and we'll see.' That sort of situation can happen and, in those circumstances, the person is not going to appeal because they have not applied and are not aware of the opportunity to test their case. Quite reasonably, if they go to a government department and the person who represents the department at the counter tells them that they are not eligible, they will take that on good faith and go away.
Those sorts of situations can happen and they are hard to track officially because they are not ones that enter the system. It is only when they come to the attention of specific community organisations that they can actually be measured and addressed, and I think it is important to emphasise that point. Apart from all those who are coming to the attention of these groups, how many others are there who are perhaps going into the underworld or illegal activities out of a need to support themselves? They will not be picked up by these other organisations and they will not be contributing in a positive way to Australia if they have to get into illegal or exploitative 
 situations to be able to survive. Again, I ask the minister for the figures about the number of cases.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-12,"—The answer to Senator Bartlett is that the number of cases is 1,100 and 1,800.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1
"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-03-12,"—Minister, I am not quite sure what you said then.
—There were two figures: 1,100 and 1,800.
—Were they the number of applications?
—They were the number of cases that were underpinning the dollar numbers that I gave you some time ago—$13.3 million and $19.5 million.
—Is that on an annual basis?
—For 1998-99 it was $13.3 million; for 1999-2000 it was $19.5 million. The number of people was 1,100 and 1,800.
—Minister, one of the pertinent issues is what happens to those people who do not have any means of support who seek the special benefit and do not get it.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-12,"—Firstly, some people will have family here. Even if they are not sponsors, one would expect that families will support their own. Secondly, as happened under your government, substantial payments are made by the Department of Health and Family Services, I think, to the welfare organisations by way of emergency relief payments of some many millions of dollars. We have increased that since we came into government. As I recall, in the first year of government we worked with the agencies to improve the formula on which that funding is based. I am out of my own territory here, but I think the funding is driven by demand. Those are two sources by which people are assisted here.
If some of them do not have family here, they have close friends here who have been urging them to migrate. In one of the cases 
 that I was reading recently, it was the urging of friends that persuaded a couple to come with what anybody would have thought would have been totally inadequate funds to last them for any length of time at all.

"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-03-12,"—My concern ultimately is that, if you take away special benefits—the safety net; the second net—from people who do not have any family or friends who are prepared to support them—I do not think that that would be entirely unusual—the outcome appears to be that either they have no support at all, and essentially they are unable to buy food or shelter and eventually they will pass away and die, or they find illegal means of supporting themselves.
Despite the obvious deterrent from not providing special benefits to people who have been silly, stupid, thoughtless or irresponsible, neither the proposition that some people will be entirely without support, in what is a reasonably affluent country, nor the proposition that they will find alternative support by being involved in some sort of illegal income producing activity—criminal activities—is a particularly attractive outcome. Do you see any other answer for that group of people besides those two answers and apart from the alternative that you suggested, which is the support of some groups. I was not sure exactly which groups you meant, but you must mean the Salvation Army, Barnardos and people like that.
—Organisations that get government funding for that purpose.
—My understanding of those sorts of groups, though they do a very good job of providing supplementary type help, is that most people would not be able to survive solely on that. Normally they provide things like limited food parcels and, in some cases, emergency accommodation refuges. I am not certain how a person could exist 
 indefinitely on the sorts of provisions that are made by those organisations.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-12,"—Those organisations provide the sort of support you are talking about as well as monetary assistance through this emergency relief fund. I wish I could remember how much it was; it is a very substantial amount of money. That is not to suggest that there is not always going to be needy people who need that help. I am not suggesting that it is a bottomless pit, but quite a lot of money goes in that direction for these sorts of circumstances.
In the discussion that we have had today I have referred a couple of times to circumstances beyond somebody's control—for instance, the sponsor dies or becomes bankrupt or the job is not there. In fact, there is a very long list of criteria which are not binding on the secretary but are indicative of the sorts of circumstances which it would be reasonable to say were beyond people's control. The secretary is not limited to that list. If the secretary believes the circumstances are beyond a person's control, then the secretary can exercise discretion. It is not something I have any discretion over, of course, but the secretary does. That is how it has been operating.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1998-03-12,"—I sense around the chamber a good deal of concern that maybe we do not have a grasp of all the situations of which we have been advised. For example, it would be disconcerting if you have people who are in desperate situations—and we know that there are, such as new migrants. We have that information not only from very good sources, such as the Welfare Rights Centre, but also from other excellent sources. I have gained the information independently as well, as no doubt have other honourable senators.
I have listened carefully to what Senator Neal has been saying, and she also has been indicating the opposition's concern about the prospects of persons living in destitution because of the administration, I suppose, or interpretations that have been given to certain words in the statement that was made by the 
 minister last year. I am also aware of the AAT decisions and their significance.
But what I believe we all need is more information, more detailed information, which is not readily available to us. I would like to see, for example, an opportunity for these organisations—welfare organisations and other organisations—and individuals to come before a committee to give that committee the evidence and information upon which we can make a valid decision, together with the information that we will receive from the various departments—Immigration, Foreign Affairs and the Department of Social Security.
I do not know whether the committee would consider this possibility. Obviously, we cannot adjourn this requested amendment because that would hold up the legislation, and I do not think it is in anybody's interests to do that. I just wonder whether Senator Bartlett might consider withdrawing the request at this stage—and he has other options, of course—and that would be on the basis there is an understanding around the chamber that the issue will be referred to a committee for a short hearing enabling this matter to come back to us in time to deal with it in some legislation.
I personally would like to see it dealt with in the consequential legislation that comes back. But I understand from the minister that that would cause a great number of difficulties with putting into place the legislation that we are passing now. But, as has been indicated to me, there are other measures coming forward—the  Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill 1997 —which can deal with this particular matter. There would be no problem; that is an appropriate peg to hang such amendment on.
If we have the benefit of the work of a committee on this particular matter—and I would hope that it does not go for very long—if we have all the information, then we can make a better judgment on a motion such as this that is before us. I would hope that perhaps Senator Bartlett might consider that. If he does not and chooses to go ahead with his request now, that is entirely up to him.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-03-12,"—I thank Senator Harradine for his attempts to try to progress the matter to an eventually positive outcome. I think the suggestion he makes about getting the issue more thoroughly examined, getting some of the people together who are involved in this issue out in the community to address a Senate committee, as well as departmental people, would be a very helpful thing in terms of clarifying and giving us some more of the specific detail of what the situation is out in the community.
Nonetheless, I might respectfully decline his kind offer and proceed with moving the amendment. I do not want to delay the debate any further on this, but I do think the bottom line is, as Senator Harradine himself said in his most recent contribution: we do know that there are people in desperate need in the community now. For that reason, I believe that this is an urgent matter that needs to be addressed now. It is not one that is going to go away. Regardless of whether this request goes down, as it may well—and I recognise that the government is not disposed to accept it—or returns to the lower House, I think it is important to at least signal the strength of concern about the situation as it stands now.
As I have said, this matter is not going to go away anyway. Hopefully, there will be an opportunity—whether through the budget and other measures bill, another social security bill or a specific reference—for this situation to be examined in a bit of detail by a Senate committee. But I think at the moment, because of the fact that there are people in need now in the community, it is incumbent on the Senate now to signal its position on this issue.
It is the view of the Democrats that it is one where we should be recognising the need that people have. It is not a situation where charities should be picking up the pieces. They are there for emergency relief; they are not there to support people for one or two years. It is those groups who are pushing the need for change because of the burden that is being placed on them, the drain on their resources, so that they cannot then utilise those resources for other members of the community who are in crisis need.
So I would like to proceed with my requested amendment. I do thank Senator Harradine for his suggestion, but I think this is an issue that we will need to keep looking at in any case.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1998-03-12,"—That puts us in a bit of an awkward position. I should have said, for the benefit of Senator Bartlett and his colleagues, that I was going to move, at the appropriate stage, to add to the motion for the adoption of the committee report something like `and that the following matter be referred to the Legal and Constitutional Committee for inquiry and report'—by a certain date—`matters arising from the committee's consideration of the request for amendment, moved by Senator Bartlett'—you see, you are there up in lights, Senator Bartlett—`relating to newly arrived residents' waiting period'.
Senator Bartlett perhaps was not aware that that very firm intention is there. I hope that it would get the unanimous support of the committee when the time comes—and I hope that is in 10 minutes time.

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-12,"—I want to remind the chamber briefly that earlier I gave examples where, on issues like the age of independence, committee after committee came up with very solid suggestions about what that age of independence should be. Governments have ignored that. So I would like to emphasise that it would be good if this were advanced in a committee, whether or not this chamber votes on an amendment. We have had amendments before. It should not make any difference to whether the government is willing to bring this up in a committee.
I would not like to think there was a gun to anyone's head not to move amendments because the government will not look at things in a committee if they do put amendments, because that would be a breach of the separation of powers and it would potentially be the minister interfering in the role of the Senate. I am sure the ministry would not do such a thing. But I am sure that, if there is a willingness to look at things further in a committee stage, this chamber and the community would be very grateful. I would like to think that, unlike things like the age of majority, the age of independence, whatever positive outcome came from that committee would be taken on board and brought in in a positive way to amending legislation in that regard.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-03-12,"—To respond briefly to Senator Harradine's further elaboration and try to give it due consideration in the short space of time available, I understand what he is suggesting in referring the matter to a committee via a motion at the end of the committee stage. I understand that can be done anyway and, as I said in my previous contribution, I think that would be a good idea. I would still like to proceed simply because I think there is a clear situation of need now and I would like to indicate the Democrats' position at this stage of how serious we think this matter is.
If other senators feel they still need more information before they are convinced that it is a situation that should be changed, that is fine for them to express. I can understand that situation. Hopefully, a committee inquiry would provide that extra information. Whilst I am loath, with my minimal degree of experience in this chamber compared with Senator Harradine's, to back my judgment against the reasoning he has put forward, I still feel it appropriate to proceed with the specific request for amendment that I have moved.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1998-03-12,"—I move:
That the House of Representatives be requested to make the following amendment:
(1)	 Page 2 (after line 2), after clause 2, insert:
2A Application
Subsection 543A(2) does not apply to a person who last left school more than 12 months before the commencement of this Act.
Thank you, Minister; it is good to know that the government will support this amendment. It will go a long way to addressing the problems that schools foresee in this legislation. The effect of the Democrats' amendment is to remove the obligation of 16- and 17-year-olds who had already left school at the beginning of this year to return next year in order to be eligible for the youth allowance. So it takes that away. This effectively is a phasing in approach and removes the retrospectivity of the measure. We also welcome the government's move to defer the implementation of this bill from July this year to January 1999. The difficulties that schools would face in taking back 13,000 students—and I think that is a conservative estimate—two-thirds of the way through the school year has been recognised. I think that is much to the relief of principals, parents and teachers.
Next year, 1999, would have been a particularly difficult year. Young people who left school at the beginning of this year in year 10 or 11 and who might have been looking for work—many of them living independently—would be forced back into a school that they left 12 months earlier. This would have been an one-off situation next year and something of a nightmare for schools. As a former teacher I can tell you that students who do not want to be in school can make it very difficult for those who do. There are students who some years ago would have left school at year 10 or 11 and taken on a proper apprenticeship or gone straight into jobs—jobs which are largely non-existent these days.
As governments have wound back spending on education and adopted a return to basics approach to schooling, the sorts of alternative programs that were once available in technology, the arts, outdoor education and that kind of thing have largely disappeared too. Principals will tell you that the alienation, particularly of boys, in senior secondary school is a huge problem, in fact the biggest issue that they face. These young people do much better in the TAFE system, where they are surrounded by adults, but that is not an option for 16- and 17-year-olds whose families are on low incomes. The fact is that most of them would have to go back to the school that they left. For those who have already left and no doubt think themselves adults, to return to school uniforms, a timetable and no real change in the programs would not necessarily be a happy experience.
It goes without saying that the Democrats support the idea that young people should stay in education for as long as possible, but this bill effectively raises the school leaving age to 18 and will cost state governments—according to my calculations—an extra $52 million every year. That is what it will cost those governments to accommodate the extra 13,000 students. Of course, this will have to come out of federal assistance grants. No doubt the states are not pleased with this arrangement, especially coming on top of the EBA cut of $11.9 million this year and higher EBA cuts each year thereafter.
The federal government is tipping in $22.66 million over four years for special programs related to the return of these students. That works out to be just $435 per student. The reason I wanted to speak to this amendment, even though the government is supporting it, is that I wanted to get the minister's assurance that this money will not be reduced at all by this amendment.
The federal government will pay a $550 per capita grant on average to these students who are in schools, but the rest will have to be found by state governments. That is, of course, if they find it at all and do not expect the schools to simply do more for less. As we know, it costs around $4,500 to educate a student in a government school. However, the principals estimate that the cost to provide worthwhile programs for returning students is more like $7,500. Instead of providing $435 per student for the so-called full risks or at risk programs, the Commonwealth ought to be providing around $3,000 extra for this measure.
Another matter I wanted to raise was the fact that there is no money in the proposed budget for capital works. There will be another 13,000 students in the school system. By my calculations, if that is 30 students per classroom as it is in Victoria by and large, that is an extra 400 classrooms and there is no money here for capital works.
I have concerns about the process for distribution of this money. This $22.66 million over four years is a very small sum of money. Schools must put in bids to a state board committee which will somehow be gathered at a regional level, and that is not entirely sorted out yet. Schools will not necessarily get the funding. They will have to go through a bidding process and they may well lose. Questions arise about what happens to the schools that do not get any funding. What happens if they end up with two extra classrooms full of students? What happens if that school does not get the funding? Is it intended that the students would go elsewhere where the program was in place? How will those schools cope with that? Is it expected that students will travel to other schools? Is 
 there a special allowance for that? Apparently not.
The government says it will not give the money to schools on a simple per capita basis. That is unfortunate. Presumably, the schools cannot be trusted to manage that money. This idea of schools having to bid for the money, regardless of how many of these students they have, is fairly ridiculous, given that this kind of project does not lend itself to that competitive ethos, especially when there just simply is not enough money around. Presumably it will be a question of who writes the best, most sparkly application which will determine which school gets the money.
I have those reservations. The Democrats are pleased that the government is supporting this, but I needed to get on the record those other serious concerns that schools have about having inadequate funding for what will be very necessary programs for these students who would otherwise have left school and be looking for jobs at 16 or 17.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1998-03-12,"—The opposition supports this amendment. In doing so, I draw the attention of the Senate to some concerns we have about these proposals put by the government. I emphasise that our fundamental concern is that this government is introducing a policy here without proper consideration of its practical implications for our education system in particular, and of course for families in terms of their requirement for families to meet additional expenditure, many of whom will not have the money available to fulfil that additional commitment. Our concern also is for the schools and TAFE systems of this country which we require to take on additional responsibilities without adequate resourcing.
There may well be quite significant damaging effects to a much greater number of students and their opportunities in life as a consequence of not providing the resources necessary to adequately provide for the additional students that are being required now to rejoin the education system.
I say this because we must bear in mind the nature of the particular students we are talking about in this bill. The Department of Employ 
 ment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs and, I expect, the Department of Social Security would have by now appreciated that the students who are affected by this measure—that is, people who have been unemployed for some period of time and are being forced back into the education system—will have particular learning difficulties and social disadvantages which have a profound effect on the capacity of those people to actually do well at school.
The very fact that students were forced out of the education system is all too often a reflection on the failure of the education system to actually provide for the special needs of students, many of whom are often described as at risk—that is, in educational jargon, they are students who leave school early because of their low levels of school achievement. That is due to their low literacy levels, often because of their low numeracy levels and because they have particular learning difficulties which are the result of a range of factors, including social and physiological or economic factors which relate to the capacity of students to do well at school.
The very fact that these particular students will often come from families who have suffered family dislocation, itinerancy, violence, abuse, poverty and homelessness; have a record of truancy and may well have a record of substance abuse. These are the sorts of issues that the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs drew to the attention of the government and which this government has failed to respond to. It has failed to respond to those fundamental questions about providing the necessary resources for students, particularly those at risk of educational failure. Failure is a word that I do not like using but I think it often explains in simple terms the consequences of people not being able to achieve well educationally.
The fact is that people leave the school system as a result of a range of factors. We cannot simply say that it is because they do not want to be there. They do not want to be there because of the social, economic and often physical conditions that they have to endure. It seems to me that if the school 
 system is to be more effective, it has to be able to provide more relevant experiences for those students. That inevitably means that there are additional requirements upon school authorities, particularly teachers, which have to be met in terms of providing that service to those particular students with learning difficulties. This government has not provided the resources to back up this initiative in that regard.
The government talks about expanding educational opportunities. It says, `We will have VET in schools. We will provide $20 million out of ANTA funds and give that to the schools.' It does not explain what moneys are provided to back that up in terms of in-service training, curriculum development or the provision of resources. Equally, it says, `We have to get the industry more involved in the delivery of specific programs.' Again, it does not address the practical problems. These expressions are easy to draw attention to but they are not easy to develop programs around without the necessary funding to back them up.
This is a position that the states have identified. The states have identified their concern only too clearly. Senator Allison has given figures which show a $53 million shortfall in the states' resources—that is, an additional demand on the states to meet the requirements of the 13,000 extra places. She bases her figures on a calculation of about $4,500 per place. That is a very modest view of the cost of educational places. It is certainly not the costs that the states themselves have put to the Commonwealth with regard to various submissions through the Commonwealth-state educational forums. The Victorian government, for instance, calculated an amount of $7,000 per spot and argued that they were some $40 million short in Victoria alone as a result of this government's initiatives and requirements by this government to meet those matters.
A similar pattern emerges with the TAFE colleges. It is often the case that the schools themselves will not be able to cope with these particular students. This amendment points to the fact that they are not excluded from TAFE colleges. Here again, you will see very sub 
 stantial sums of money being withdrawn from the TAFE system by this government and demands by the states to meet additional requirements in terms of Commonwealth programs, yet no additional money has been provided by the Commonwealth to meet the requirements under their new ANTA arrangements. In fact, we have no new ANTA agreement to meet these particular initiatives that are being proposed by the government. What we do have though is the government announcement on 28 January that it will provide some $42 million. I say that that is $100 million short on what has been proposed by the Department of Employment, Education, Training Youth Affairs through its cabinet processes. What this government produces is $42 million or thereabouts.
One of the initiatives is for a full service school for students at risk. But in the estimates process we were not able to establish what it is that the government means by the concept of a full service school. There is no definition given and no understanding within the bureaucracy of what that term actually means. Again, it looks great on a press release. You can go around the country, put your hand on your heart and say, `We care.' But you do not actually do anything in a practical way to actually assist the people that you are obliging to enter into these particular programs.
So what you have is an initiative being taken, as I understand it—a name taken from the American education system—and applied to Australia without any understanding of the cultural conditions in this country or without the resources that go into the American education system. Americans fund their public education system at a much higher level than we do in this country. So we have a government engaging in a highly cynical device—telling people that they are concerned about their sons and daughters but not concerned enough to provide the resources necessary to ensure that they get a fair go when they are forced back into the education system itself.
The initiatives that the government has proposed and the Prime Minister announced in a hail of publicity in late January—the jobs pathway program and new apprenticeships 
 and access programs—are not moneys that go towards the schools. These are in fact moneys that are supposed to be used out of the school arena. So you cannot actually argue that the government has provided additional resources for the education system, but has provided them for a period of transition from school to work. I am not saying that that is a bad thing, but it does not address this fundamental problem.
We have the issue of the way in which these funds are being distributed. I am greatly concerned, given the run-down of the department, that there will not be the resources available through the department itself, given the way in which the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs has been gutted, to be able to administer these programs effectively and to ensure that the money actually goes to the people who need it, as distinct from being dished out on a basis of some sort of shoddy bidding process which does not guarantee that the money actually goes to the places that it is actually needed.
We still do not have within this government an understanding of where these particular students are going to be located. There is no sense, from the estimates answers I have, that the government has commitments from the states or an understanding of the particular regions other than the most broadest concept of the impact of these measures. They are not able to actually identify the school districts, the school regions, where the additional resources will need to go. They say, `That's all up to the states; we'll let someone else worry about that; and we'll let someone worry about that in the fullness of time.'
Meanwhile, this is a program that is due to come into operation from the beginning of next year. They had to put it back six months because the administrative arrangements were not in place. I say that they are still not in place. But what we have is a program being initiated by the government which has no real understanding of the social and educational consequences of its actions. As a consequence, while we support the amendment, we raise these concerns with the Senate and express our very deep frustration with the government, which seems to be so intent upon 
 undermining our educational system and undermining the opportunities of tens of thousands of Australians.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1

"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-03-12,"—The opposition supports the 
NRS Levy Imposition Bill 1997  and the Telecommunications Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997. They are being debated at a non-controversial time so obviously everybody else supports them. There are some minor amendments in the package but there are two important points about the National Relay Service.
This bill will enable non-carriers to be eligible for the provisions of the NRS. In the new competitive market that we now have with carriers and non-carriers providing telecommunications services, that is a useful and necessary development. The other point is that the funds for the provision of the National Relay Service will be paid on a quarterly basis rather than on a yearly basis. This helps carriers and non-carriers with their cash flow. At the moment about $7 million a year is provided.
The National Relay Service is an excellent service that provides people who are hearing or speech impaired with access to a standard telephone service on terms and in circumstances comparable with those that other Australians have to a standard telephone service. This bill enhances that service for those people with those impairments. In the future, with the development of more and more sophisticated value-added services and telecommunications, I have no doubt that there will be consideration given to the National Relay Service not just being provided to the standard telephone but to those other add-on services. I do not know what the cost of that would be but that will have to be debated at the time. One can imagine that, with all the new on-line, broadband and Internet services, sooner or later, and quite rightly, people will say that they should be available to those who have those impairments of hearing or speech.

Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
I table the Committee's report on the National Environment Protection Measures (Implementation) Bill 1997.
This bill represents the commitment of the Commonwealth and the States and Territories to work co-operatively to implement national environment protection measures developed by the National Environment Protection Council—a commitment  which was made by the Council of Australian Governments in the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Environment in 1992.
The National Pollutant Inventory has recently been adopted by the National Environment Protection Council, and other national environment protection measures are now at draft stage.
IMPLEMENTATION OF NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES IN COMMONWEALTH JURISDICTION
The bill provides several means by which the Commonwealth can implement national environment protection measures in its jurisdiction. Those means are:
1.	 applying provisions of State and Territory laws, by declaration of the Commonwealth Environment Minister.
2.	 making regulations.
3.	 using an existing Commonwealth law which can deliver appropriate environmental outcomes.
4.	 carrying out an environmental audit and preparing an environmental management plan.
The government envisages that applying State and Territory laws will be the first option considered. There was a perception in submissions to the 
 Committee's inquiry that the Commonwealth does not intend to apply provisions of State or Territory environment law to its activities as a first option for implementation. However, the structure of the Bill ensures that the Commonwealth Environment Minister considers the application of provisions of State or Territory environment law to Commonwealth activities before considering the use of regulations under Part 4. The Bill reflects the Commonwealth's intent to apply provisions of State and Territory environment law to Commonwealth activities under the recent COAG Heads of Agreement  on Commonwealth/State responsibilities for the environment.
Where State or Territory law is not the mechanism for implementation of a particular national environment protection measure, there is an obligation on Commonwealth authorities to implement the measure either through an existing Commonwealth law which will deliver the necessary environmental outcomes, through Commonwealth regulations or through an environment management plan. The government intends that this option will be used where an activity or premises have been exempted from Parts 2 or 3 (applying State laws) or Part 4 (implementation by Commonwealth regulations) on the ground of `a matter of national interest'.
The bill provides for community consultation in the preparation of environmental management plans.
COMPLIANCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY
The Commonwealth and the States and Territories will have to comply with national environment protection measures. The government intends that an exemption from implementing a particular measure at a certain Commonwealth place or with regard to a specific Commonwealth activity will ONLY be given on the ground of a matter of `national interest', as defined in the bill.
The definition of `national interest is not intended to be the basis for widespread exemptions from the application by the Commonwealth of provisions of State and Territory law and total exemptions are expected to be rare. The government intends that any such site or activity which is exempted will be subject to an environmental audit and environment management plan under Part 5.
There were some concerns in submissions to the inquiry about the extent of the Environment Minister's discretion in the bill. While re-iterating the intention to apply State or Territory environment law as a first option, the level of discretion available to the Environment Minister reflects the need for flexibility in deciding which mechanism is likely to provide the most appropriate environmental outcomes.
Non-compliance with a national environment protection measure by a Commonwealth authority will be published in the Gazette, and the details of 
 authorities not complying will also be publicly available through the annual report to Parliament on implementation of the measures.
CONCLUSION
National environment protection measures will ensure that people, wherever they live in Australia, enjoy equivalent protection from air, water, soil pollution and noise, and secondly. They will ensure that decisions by business are not distorted and markets are not fragmented by variations between jurisdictions in environmental protection. There will be greater certainty for business, and a greater capacity for industry to manage environmental issues which cross State borders.
The Bill provides the framework by which the Commonwealth is able to implement NEPMs in its jurisdiction in all circumstances. The application of provisions of State or Territory environment law may not always achieve the most appropriate outcomes, though the Commonwealth will apply provisions of State and Territory environment law as the first option and wherever possible.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1997</title>,"<title>Report of the Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee</title>",Bills,14,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1998-03-12,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Parer), to questions without notice asked today, relating to the financial interests of Senator Parer.
Despite what is overwhelming evidence to the contrary, Senator Parer is proclaiming that he is not guilty of any conflict of interest nor any other sackable offence. But I think it is worth examining closely these protestations of innocence from Senator Parer. Firstly, let us look at the issue of the Senate's requirements in relation to its system of disclosure of pecuniary interests. Senator Parer has failed to declare to the Registrar of Senators' Interests his directorship of Investment Management Pty Ltd, his family trust company. He has failed to declare his shareholding in that company or his family trust shareholdings.
Senator Parer claims not to be aware of the letter of 20 March 1997 from the Registrar of Senators' Interests informing all senators of the requirements to `notify actual shares held by relevant family or business trusts as of 20 March 1997'. He claims to be only in technical breach of the guidelines. But he conveniently fails to mention the fact—he ignores the fact—that he has also failed to declare his shareholding in Queensland Coal Management ESP. This was a requirement of the Senate disclosure system from the very beginning. It is not a technical breach; it is a serious breach.
Then there is the issue of compliance with the code of conduct of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). That is now an infamous and much discredited document. Surely we need to go 
 no further than the requirement on page 11 of this code, which says:
Ministers are required to divest themselves of all shares and similar interests in any company or business involved in the area of their portfolio responsibilities. The transfer of interests to a family member or to a nominee or trust is not an acceptable form of divestment.
Does Senator Parer possess shares or similar interests in any company or business involved in the area of his portfolio responsibilities? The answer to that question is yes, he does. Has Senator Parer divested himself of these shares and interests? The answer is, of course, that he has not. Is he in compliance with this much discredited prime ministerial code of conduct? No, he is not. Of course, you could look, in relation to ministerial conduct, at page 10 of the code:
The nature of their duties is such that they may need to have regard to the interests of members of their immediate families (to the extent that ministers know their interests) as well as their own when ensuring that no conflict or apparent conflict between interests and duties arises.
Again, the same problems. But what the opposition in the Senate has been asking today is: what about his compliance with the Prime Minister's requirements for a confidential declaration of interests from all his ministers?
Here we only have Senator Parer's word. Why should we accept it? He would not answer direct questions from Senator Cook which were directed to him in question time today on a range of issues in relation to disclosures he made to the Prime Minister. He insists that he fully complied with the Prime Minister's requirements. We invite him to table confidential documentation in the Senate to prove that that is the case.
The truth is that on those three grounds—the Senate requirements, the ministerial code of conduct and the Prime Minister's confidential declaration; on all three counts—Senator Parer has failed. He is a liability to the government. Our view is that there is no alternative for him but to resign or be sacked by the Prime Minister.

"MacGibbon, Sen David",LP,1998-03-12,"—I am not going to give respectability to a perfectly scurrilous attack on the charac 
 ter of one of the best senators in this place. I have known Senator Parer longer than anyone in this parliament. I knew him many years before he came in here 12 years ago. Senator Parer's integrity, his honesty and his probity is beyond dispute in any way at all; way beyond challenge. He is a fit and proper person to discharge the duties of a minister in this place. That ought to be the end of the argument.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Minister for Resources and Energy</title>,Miscellaneous,19,1
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,1998-03-12,"—We have just heard from Senator MacGibbon on this. Senator MacGibbon, the Prime Minister marched into the House of Representatives, puffed up, in May 1996 and said, `I'm setting a whole new standard.' He implicitly criticised the previous government, even though a lot was drawn from the cabinet handbook. We are simply asking that Senator Parer and every other minister observe those standards.
There is no use saying that we are being scurrilous in this. The first question we raised was: why didn't Senator Parer comply with the March 1997 directive from the registrar? What is his response to that, Senator MacGibbon? `I'm guilty,' he says. We have established that. It is not a completely threadbare assault on Senator Parer. Then we asked the second question: why didn't you declare your 44 shares which were declarable long before the March 1997 directive? We did not really get an explanation as to why they were not declared. We asked him whether he declared them to the Prime Minister. Through all the fog of the answer I got the impression that he did not. Then we hear the Prime Minister over there in the other place absolutely asserting that he was notified of the 44 shares. We need to clear that up.
The one thing that is difficult for Senator MacGibbon or anyone else to argue about is the clear reference in the ministerial code of conduct to disposing of shares which directly affect your portfolio area. He did not do that. They were not easy to dispose of—we can see that. But if he had let us know that he had them and that he had difficulty in disposing of them we would have some idea that there was a potential or a perceived conflict of interest. 
Senator Parer jumped on the point I made yesterday. I will repeat it for him if he wants to jump on it every time and grab it like a lifeline. I do not think Senator Parer would ever deliberately go out and enrich himself in this area by an action to favour a particular company where he has an investment. But neither will I accuse Senator Short or Senator Gibson of that. They breached the ministerial code. They went; Senator Parer does not go.
The other side gets upset when we question the basis of these financial arrangements. But he was someone, absent from a meeting in 1993—but, nevertheless, as chairman of that area later concurring—who got 16 C-class shares at $1 each which, within three years, have a minimum value, because they cannot be established at the maximum, of $2.3 million. He has to explain that to the battlers. How many battlers can go out and get given sixteen $1 shares that have a value three years later of $2.3 million? The income stream from those shares to the family investment company to the family trust in 1995 was $99,000. In 1996 the two payments into the family trust totalled $290,000. Not bad going for a battler. But the really strange thing is that Senator Parer cannot seem to remember any of this. He cannot remember the odd $99,000, the $149,000 and the $140,000 cheques coming in.
—Small change.
—You are right, Senator Evans. Is it small change? Those things should be answered. The biggest joke of all is that Senator Hill comes in here and says that the Prime Minister has cleared him, that it is okay by him. That has sent the boat out very quickly. Is the Prime Minister the one to really judge in this particular case? At least the Prime Minister says that he relies on the judgment of his senior public servant Mr Max Moore-Wilton, the most political appointee in the history since federation.
It is so coincidental that he brings down his report on 9 May and then on 10 May at 9 o'clock in the morning the Prime Minister rings Dr Shergold and says, `I want you now to do a review of Mr Max Moore-Wilton's entitlements because the horrible senators have been raising it in the Senate committee 
 the week before.' Then the same Dr Shergold gets promoted in December last year to departmental secretary.
If you want to bring in someone to judge this, bring in a neutral judge. Putting Max Moore-Wilton in charge of this particular investigation is like putting Dracula in charge of the blood bank. But if there is anyone I feel sorry for—and he does not want me to mention it—it is Senator Brian Gibson. Senator Brian Gibson left executive office for the most minuscule thing—nothing like this. (Time expired)
—I call Senator Coonan.
—See if you can go for longer than one minute, which is all David MacGibbon could do.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Minister for Resources and Energy</title>,Miscellaneous,19,1
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,1998-03-12,"—Yes, Senator Faulkner, I will certainly be going longer than a minute because isn't it about time that we got a bit of reality into this? This is approaching the farcical. Finally we get as an interjection from Senator Robert Ray that what seems to be worrying the opposition comes down to just a perception that there might be some infringement. For goodness sake!
Isn't it about time that we, as the elected representatives of this country, actually addressed the real issues affecting the people of Australia rather than going on with this eternal trawling about things that real people out there do not seem to be really too worried about? Real people out there must be rubbing their eyes in disbelief at what has taken the time of this chamber for the last couple of days. The real issues and the real problems do not seem to be of the remotest concern to Senator Ray, Senator Faulkner and those in the opposition.
I wonder how many people are actually lying awake at night wondering about Senator Parer's family trust. There is not one shred of evidence to suggest that Senator Parer has ever misused his office for any improper purpose or even an allegation that he has been guilty of some actual conflict of interest. Not only is this a grubby exercise; it shows the utter lack of appreciation by those on the 
 other side of how a trust actually works. We do not really know whether whoever is feeding all this stuff to the opposition has ever really looked at the memorandum and articles of association of this company. Senator Ray seems to be aware that we are looking at C class shares, which invariably have restrictions, and, of course, Senator Parer has said until he is practically blue in the face that the trust has 16 non-voting shares. We almost need to put the words to a song here—`16 non-voting shares'—but the message does not seem to be getting through.
It is very difficult to value shares, and certainly we question the sorts of values of non-voting shares that have been tossed around here at random as Senator Ray sought to do when he took note. These are not publicly listed shares. They are certainly not easily divested. They are very difficult to market. I think Senator Cook said all you have to do is consent to sell the shares in Queensland Coal Mine Management Pty Ltd. That's a laugh! If it were that easy to get rid of non-voting shares, I am sure a lot of people would do so with alacrity. 
The truth of the matter is that you do not have much control over non-voting shares, and certainly very few people want to buy them if they cannot exercise any vote in relation to their interest. So the matter of whether or not there is a market for non-voting shares is critical in this case, and it is certainly one that ought to excuse Senator Parer from having to adopt the sort of wild values that have been tossed around in this chamber.
Quite apart from the fact that there has been no conflict of interest at all, there is further evidence—and I cannot believe that those on the other side of the chamber would not accept Senator Parer on this—that he has obtained no personal benefit from his ministerial responsibilities. That is really the critical issue. There is absolutely nothing to suggest that he has ever had any personal benefit from his office. Senator Parer has not breached the ministerial guidelines and the worst that can be said is that there is some technical breach of the Senate explanatory note. Are you really going to seek to hang 
 Senator Parer for this? As I said when I started my speech, let us get a bit of reality into this debate. It is time that this is played out. I say to honourable senators on the other side, give it a rest.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Minister for Resources and Energy</title>,Miscellaneous,19,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1998-03-12,"—That was an amazing speech; I don't know that it would hold up anywhere but in this chamber. This question is about probity in public office and, most of all, it is about the integrity of the Prime Minister. It is about that because the Prime Minister himself declared to the Australian electorate before the election that he would bring new standards, and after the election he did. Although they embodied most of the ministerial handbook, he declared what those standards are and they are on the public record. The particular standard under debate here is:
Ministers are required to divest themselves of all shares and similar interests in any company or business involved in the area of their portfolio responsibilities.
The transfer of interests to a family member or to a nominee or trust is not an acceptable form of divestment.
That is the Prime Minister's own standard. We have just heard that that is fine as long as you can't say that the person has benefited from them in his own right. That is a preposterous notion. It says, in the Prime Minister's own standards, that there cannot be any `apparent conflict' between the exercise of public duty and that of the private potential gain of the individual minister.
It is not just a matter here of whether there was an actual conflict; it is also a matter of whether there is a potential conflict and it is also a matter of whether there is an appearance of conflict. This is the well trodden area of law that justice has to be done and justice has to be seen to be done. Both precepts have to be met. Let us compare this case with what happened to Senator Short. On 14 October 1996 the Prime Minister said, in the case of Senator Short after he had resigned, that there was `an apparent conflict of interest'. Those are the words of the Prime Minister in the case of Senator Short.
Where are those words now? Does the Prime Minister uphold his own standards? He has been silent on this. He will not answer that question. He needs to set his consistency on the line. He either upholds the standards he has imposed or he does not. And if he does not he is a hypocrite and he never intended those standards to be upheld anyway. It was simply a way of gulling the Australian electorate.
Short said at the time that he had made a `careless and distressing oversight'. He confessed to an apparent conflict of interest. We have here a similar confession to an apparent conflict of interest by the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Parer), who has said, in a quaint way of putting it, `I made a technical mistake.' There is no provision for technical; you either made one or you didn't and a confession of a mistake is a confession of a mistake. He also went on to say that he did not read the letter that alerted him to what his public duty was. Since when was that a defence? Try standing up in a court and saying that you did not know what the law was and therefore you are innocent. That is exactly what is being said here. Why should that standard apply to ordinary Australians and not to a minister of the Crown? Why can a minister of the Crown say, `I didn't know; therefore I am innocent,' but an ordinary Australian say, `I didn't know what the law was,' and be convicted? That is a direct comparison of their hypocrisy on this matter.
There is a series of comparisons I would like to make—and I know that I will not have time to complete the list—between Senator Short's conduct and the conduct we are now witnessing from Senator Parer. Senator Short confessed to owning 6,679 ANZ shares, through the Short family trust, worth approximately $64,000 at the time of his resignation. Senator Parer owns just over one per cent of the issued capital in QCMM Pty Ltd, worth an estimated $2.3 million. Is it because of the higher value of the shares that a different level of conduct is acceptable? Is it because Senator Short was a supporter of the Prime Minister but not a personal mate, as is Senator Parer? Is that why a different standard of conduct is acceptable? Is that what it means?
Senator Short went on to say that he had held the shares in the trust, the ANZ Bank, for a considerable amount of time and that this holding had been recorded in the Register of Senators' Interests since its inception. Parer claims, as some sort of defence, that the trust has been in existence for 28 years and that he has a one-ninth interest in it. This must mean that he is one of nine family beneficiaries. At least Short declared it.
—Senator Cook, could you please use their correct titles?
—At least Senator Short declared it; Senator Parer did not. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Minister for Resources and Energy</title>,Miscellaneous,19,1
"Crane, Sen Winston",LP,1998-03-12,"—I too would like to enter this debate and make a number of points. It is quite obvious from the tactics we have seen here involving our colleague Senator Parer and what occurred last week that the Labor Party came back after the break with one intent, and that was to sling mud, slur and try to pick individuals out and not deal with the issues that are required to be dealt with today—particularly when we have the Native Title Amendment Bill coming back into this place. This is just a sloppy, dirty diversion away from the real issues facing Australia.
We hear from those on the other side about Senator Parer using the words `technical breach', which he did. But I have never heard such a mishmash of argument as that put before us in that last contribution from Senator Cook. You could not even call it a technical argument. In fact, one could quite fairly and freely say that Senator Cook mislead this place when he said that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) remained silent on this. Aren't you aware that the Prime Minister went into the other place last night and made a statement? For your benefit I will quote it. I will read out a couple of these points:
I inform the House that I am satisfied on the basis of the advice I have received since question time that Senator Parer has not breached the ministerial guidelines.
That is from the Prime Minister himself. If the Prime Minister stands up in the other place and says that, then I am satisfied. He 
 also made a number of other points, as Senator Parer has done: there was no personal benefit out of the arrangements that were put in place; there is no conflict of interest in carrying out his job. These are very important aspects of what we have here before us at this particular time.
I had the benefit not so long ago of being in Kalgoorlie with Senator Parer. What did he do? He got on and dealt with the issues before us. In Kalgoorlie he discussed the problems that the goldfields and the mineral fields of Western Australia have with native title, which I have already mentioned. He talked about the issues of transport, the problems there and the need for infrastructure development to assist in the great industries we have in my state in those particular areas. There was no conflict of interest whatsoever or any pretence of conflict of interest in what Senator Parer was doing in carrying out his particular job and in performing his responsibilities as a minister. And to try to run a comparison between other people and Senator Parer and his particular position is absolutely a nonsense argument and position to be in. Senator Cook has left the chamber. He may have aspired at one time to be a lawyer but after that contribution he has a long way to go. He is certainly no Rumpole as far as I am concerned.
Returning to the issues that are very important: there is no conflict of interest, no profit and no voting rights. What more do you want from a particular individual? What amazes me most is, and it also  applies to the Democrats and that silly question that was asked by their leader, Senator Meg Lees today: why do they so desperately hate anybody who is successful? I thought we should have this place full of successful people—people who know how to run a business, how to do things, how to be successful. I doubt whether you can find one senator on the other side who has ever made a buck of their own, who has ever taken their shirt off their back and done a decent day's hard work. And here you are attacking the man who has done it himself. He is a self-made person who has contributed an enormous amount to this economy of ours. You should be congratulating him for his performance. 
—Take your shirts off!
—Yes, take your shirts off, absolutely. You have never risked a dollar of your own or put a bit of risk capital out in the investment field. This is really just a slur campaign to try to put individuals down and a refusal to address the issues.
—Like Senator Bolkus.
—We saw today another rise in employment, albeit a small one, but it is coming up. You mention Senator Bolkus. What did he do? He is trying to keep Skase out of the country—
—You slurred him.
—I did not slur Senator Bolkus. He brought it on his own head. He read out confidential documents and got caught; that is what happened to Senator Bolkus. He absolutely trapped himself in.
I come back to this matter. Why do you hate somebody who makes a profit and makes a success? At the end of the day there is no conflict of interest. The Prime Minister has looked at the issue very carefully and he is satisfied, and if the Prime Minister of this country is satisfied with that particular explanation, so am I, and so should everyone else in this chamber be.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Minister for Resources and Energy</title>,Miscellaneous,19,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1998-03-12,"—There are two fundamental questions involved here. There is the question of whether or not Senator Parer has been open and direct in his declarations to this parliament under the pecuniary interest requirements of the Senate, and there is the issue as to whether or not the Prime Minister has failed in his duty to uphold the ministerial guidelines that he himself has flourished as a great hallmark of his government and the allegedly higher standards that he is representing in this country at the moment.
In the first instance, it is undoubtedly the case, as Senator Parer himself acknowledges, that there has been at the very minimum, on his own admission, a technical breach. There is a more fundamental question, however, as to whether or not that technical breach goes to the issue of whether there has been a more fundamental conflict of interest between his activities as the minister for coal and his 
 ownership of shares in coalmining in this country.
For the Prime Minister, however, there is a more substantial question still—not that the issues regarding Senator Parer in themselves are trifling affairs. What the Prime Minister said in regard to Jim Short when he laid down the benchmark here on 10 October 1996 was that he felt that, although Senator Short, as he then was, did in fact breach the guidelines, it was only a minor breach. That was his first position. He said that he thought that, while he believed that Senator Short did not comply and had acknowledged that to the Senate, he had discussed the matter with Senator Short. He had considered sacking him but he felt that, because there was no personal benefit directly to the Assistant Treasurer, as he was at the time, that he had made no consideration directly to benefit himself, as he saw it, it involved no impropriety. So Senator Short, as he was then, ought not be forced from the ministry. He said:
I think anybody who knows Senator Short will be aware that he has not been guilty of any deliberate dishonesty. In all the circumstances, I do not believe that he has profited from any deliberate decisions. I do not think the ownership of those ANZ Bank shares influenced decisions that he took. In those circumstances, I have taken the decision that I have and I remain confident of the minister's capacity.
Of course, the problem for Senator Short and for the Prime Minister was that by the weekend, by 11 October 1996, Minister Short was writing a letter to the Prime Minister resigning his portfolio. He said that he had become aware, as a result of staff going through his papers, that he had in fact undertaken a number of decisions involving ANZ interests. What he said in a letter to the Prime Minister was that he had found several dozen approvals relating to the administration of banking laws. In his letter to Mr Howard, according to the Sydney Morning Herald  of 14 October, Senator Short said that the ANZ request was a routine one and his approval had been based on the recommendation of both the Reserve Bank and the Treasurer. There were no grounds on which the request might have been decided differently. He said:
My approval was influenced in no way whatsoever by the fact of my shareholding in the ANZ Bank. When I spoke with you on Wednesday evening I had not recalled having given the particular approval, and similarly during the Senate sittings on the Thursday. Now my attention has been drawn to that approval, I feel that the circumstances of the matter have changed, and in light of this I have given the deepest consideration to the circumstances and I have decided to tender to you my resignation as Assistant Treasurer.
What is a difference between Senator Short, as he then was, and Senator Parer now?

It purports to reveal an aspect of the ACIL Economics report that was delivered to the government in 1996 and which this government declares as commercial-in-confidence and cabinet-in-confidence. The press release says that the aspect of the report that it reveals has been authorised to be revealed by Minister Reith.
I have also stated in this chamber—and it has not been denied—that this and other reports which are the subject of returns to order in this chamber and which have not been produced to this chamber and are allegedly commercial-in-confidence have been revealed to the National Farmers' Federation.
I call on the minister responsible in this chamber, Senator Alston, to come in here and to produce for the Senate the documents which are the subject of the returns to order which relate to the waterfront consultancies, as I will call them, and which are the subject of the particular press release that I received from ACIL Economics today. If it is good enough for these items to be given to the National Farmers Federation or for parts of them to be given to the media for the purpose of the government's argument, then it is good enough for the Senate to have all of those documents.

"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,1998-03-12,"—I rise tonight in the adjournment debate to discuss a matter which goes to the heart of this government's inability to recognise the consequences of its decisions on regional Australia. Over the next few minutes, I wish to discuss a matter which, when you look at the issues in detail, raises a number of questions about the commitment of this government to our regions. In doing so, I will highlight the hypocrisy of the government, who for years have claimed the small business constituency as their own and who went to the last election promising to give small 
 business a bigger slice of the government procurement cake through changes in purchasing policy and practice.
The matter I wish to raise tonight is the decision of the Australian Taxation Office to terminate a contract with a small Tasmanian security firm in favour of a national contract with an international security services provider. Senator Newman should be well aware of this case because, as I understand from the constituents concerned, the firm has forwarded to her all the relevant documents. However, we have not heard anything from Senator Newman, so I intend to take up the matter directly with the Minister for Finance and Administration (Mr Fahey) myself. It is his responsibility to ensure that the government's promise to small business on purchasing policy is delivered.
I would like to begin by telling the Senate a little bit about the security firm concerned, which is Pelham Security. Pelham Security are a Tasmanian owned and operated company. The directors, Kevin and Gail Pelham, advised me they employ directly and indirectly 75 Tasmanians. It has provided 75 jobs in the state with the nation's highest unemployment rate. I am also advised that all profits from this business are spent in Tasmania.
Pelham Security have been providing security services to the Australian Taxation Office at their Collins Street offices since 1995. The original contract was for two years, and it was renewed last October for a further 12 months. This all may seem pretty straightforward to most senators, except for the fact that the government has decided to terminate this contract with effect from 31 March—a decision which is all the more outrageous, given that Pelham Security have neither breached, nor been accused of breaching, their contract at any time. Whilst the contract provides for early termination, what is particularly concerning for me is that, for Pelham Security to seek just compensation, in accordance with section 9.1 of their contract, expensive and resource intensive legal action will now be required.
This now takes me to the substance of my concerns: the failure of the government to understand the connection or nexus between 
 decisions such as these and their inevitable and exponential impact on employment in regional Australia. The issue of costs associated with seeking compensation is an important one for small business. Pelham Security have advised me that, on the basis of this contract, business decisions were taken to increase investment in capital equipment—investment that is critically important to regional Australia; investment that, in turn, delivers the jobs growth that regions require to continue to be viable in social and economic terms.
The decision to make significant investments is a difficult one for most businesses, but it is particularly difficult for small businesses. A situation where a small business can have its contract cancelled—the carpet pulled out from under them—at any time does not augur well for future investment and employment growth. It is important to remember that, when we look at employment growth, the small to medium business sector is the key contributor.
So, in a nutshell, what we have here is a government which is gushing in its rhetoric with respect to small business, employment growth and regional development. But it is a government that fails to understand the important role that its expenditure plays in this cycle of development.
In conclusion, I would like to return to the plight of Pelham Security. It is critical that the government resolve this matter quickly and with minimal inconvenience to Pelham Security and its staff. Quite apart from the fact that this problem should never have occurred in the first place, it is important that the government learn from this case study in small business insensitivity.
As I mentioned earlier, the contract concerned allows for early termination, but it does so in conjunction with clause 9.2, which allows for `fair and reasonable compensation'. I urge the government to abide by this clause, and to do so swiftly. I also urge the government to move beyond rhetoric and deliver on its commitment to give small business a fair go—and to particularly sort the situation out with regard to Pelham Security. If it fails to do so, it will—as far as Mr Pelham, his security firm and myself are concerned— 
continue to demonstrate its complete contempt for regional Australia.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Pelham Security</title>,Adjournment,27,1
