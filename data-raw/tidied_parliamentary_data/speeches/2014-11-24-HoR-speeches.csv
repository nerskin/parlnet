Mr EWEN JONES
 (Herbert) (10:08):  On behalf of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Education and Employment, I present the report of the committee entitled TAFE: an Australian asset, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee.


On 24 February 2014 the Minister for Industry asked the committee to inquire into and report on the role of the technical and further education system and its operation. In undertaking this inquiry, the committee continued the work of the education and employment committee of the previous parliament, although with slightly revised terms of reference.


The TAFE sector is the largest education and training provider in Australia, with 61 government-owned institutes and university TAFE divisions. TAFE is also a major public provider of vocational education and training, or VET, accounting for just over 70 per cent of equivalent full-time VET students in 2010.


The committee has spent the best part of this year taking evidence on TAFE, and this report is the culmination of the committee's work. The report considers the commonwealth's involvement in VET; the development of skills in the Australian economy; the pathways that TAFE provides to employment and university; and TAFE's place in the competitive VET market.


Wherever the committee went, strong support was expressed for TAFE's role in vocational education and training, both during formal evidence and more informally. Our report acknowledges the positive impact that TAFE can have on people's lives and the critical role that TAFE plays in the Australian community.


Yet there is no foundational statement in the Council of Australian Governments framework that recognises the crucial importance of TAFE in the VET sector. The committee recommends that the Australian government should make such a statement through COAG defining the role of TAFE within the sector and acknowledging the unique functions that TAFE can contribute. The statement should also set the future direction of TAFE in the competitive training market, and recognise that the affordability and accessibility of this market is underpinned by a strong public sector provider.


As the major public provider of vocational education and training, TAFE plays a vital role in the development of skills for the Australian economy. A broader issue that emerged here was the wide variability of training quality in the VET sector—something noted last year by the Australian Skills Quality Authority (ASQA) in its review of the important aged and community care training sector. The committee recommends that this be addressed, either through increased prescription and precision around national training packages, or through the development of measures for assessing skills acquired.


A range of evidence, including the committee's online survey and personal stories, highlighted TAFE's importance as a provider of pathways to employment and university. Related to this is TAFE's significant role as a provider of opportunities for those in positions of disadvantage and vulnerability. TAFEs are often the main provider of VET for those in remote and rural areas, and have a higher ratio of disabled and disadvantaged students compared to private providers. For those who are disadvantaged or vulnerable, TAFE can be life-changing: its courses can help people to gain confidence and skills and can lead to better employability and access to mainstream education.


This important function is a particular issue for TAFE—one of several—as it operates in the competitive training market, and the committee recommends that the Australian government should seek to ensure that VET funding takes into account TAFE's role in providing opportunities for those in positions of disadvantage or vulnerability.


Another factor for the TAFE sector in the competitive market is the level of capital investment TAFEs require. The committee was particularly interested in the capital costs needed to run some TAFE courses such as those requiring large lathes, computer-programmed sheet metal cutters and 3D printers. It is concerning that the current Australian government VET funding structure does not appear to take these capital requirements into account. Capital costs should be taken into account, and the committee recommends accordingly.


Over the course of its inquiry the committee became aware of poor marketing practices in the VET sector and other practices of concern such as the collection of fees in advance. The committee is encouraged by ASQA's recent work in this area, and recommends that the Australian government should continue its current actions through ASQA and other regulators to address loopholes that allow high-risk and unscrupulous practices.


The committee also heard that Australian government VET funding provided for TAFE via the states and territories is not currently quantified at the federal level. This is unsatisfactory, and the committee recommends that reporting should be put in place to capture the exact federal financial contribution made to TAFE. 


I would like to thank everyone who participated in this, and the secretariat. The committee also appreciated the positive engagement of the TAFE sector itself—Hunter TAFE in Newcastle, Regency TAFE in Adelaide, Central TAFE in Perth and the Barrier Reef Institute of TAFE in Townsville.


I commend the report to the House.

Ms MacTIERNAN
 (Perth) (10:13):  Likewise, I thank all who have been involved in the preparation of the committee's report. The report very clearly reaffirms the centrality of government providers in the vocational education and training sector. While recognising there are shortcomings in the TAFE system across the states and territories, the overwhelming weight of evidence of this inquiry leads us to conclude that affordability, accessibility and investment in innovation in the trade training market must be underpinned by a strong, stable public-sector provider with institutional knowledge and a capacity for long-term investment.


I quote the evidence of Anthony Kittel, the driving force behind the award-winning South Australian company REDARC Electronics that is showing that, with a commitment to R&D and the dedication of staff, Australia can manufacture and sell into the globally competitive market. Mr Kittel said:



My concern is that we are going to this privatisation model and we will lose that long-term relationship we have developed with a provider that has got the facilities and the capital equipment to be able to provide for our needs.



…   …   …



… my experience with private providers is that they are short term. They win a contract and they are gone tomorrow. 


…   …   …


For us to remain competitive, for a long-term goal, we need those foundation skills maintained in an entity like TAFE.


He goes on to say:


My experience over 17 years of running my own company is that private providers will do everything possible to get that course down the shortest amount of time. I can come in tomorrow and borrow someone else's course, but I will not deliver the quality that I would if it was my normal day-to-day job and I was doing over a large number of people and had the ability to upskill myself to deliver that training.


I congratulate REDARC for recently winning the Telstra Business of the Year award.


Of course, there are challenges in the TAFE sector. We had some very interesting evidence from South Australia—this time the Australian Submarine Corporation. They told us that TAFE was considered a vital contributor to their workforce and that TAFE had delivered approximately 56 per cent of total trainees that the air warfare destroyer workforce has undertaken. Mr Hamilton stressed that we need a VET system that ensures 'graduates are technologically malleable and are thereby able to rapidly assimilate new technology and procedures'. Mr Hamilton expressed concern that TAFE was using equipment that was out of date. With the rate of technological change in the manufacturing sector, equipment needs to be turned over much more than every 20 years. In Germany it is more like five years. The TAFE sector needs to look at leasing rather than buying equipment in order to help deal with this problem. The Minerals Council pointed out some of the rigidities in pay scales in TAFE that prevented people with skills in high demand from being paid differently—and others in the industry agreed with that—and the need to ensure that staff have contemporary industry experience.


The committee inspected provisions around the state, as the chairman said, including WA Central TAFE. The facilities we saw were fantastic, including the mine simulator that uses an old sewer viaduct and enables shot-firer and rock-driller trainees to learn not only the skills required but also whether they can deal with the physical issues of working underground.


I commend the evidence presented by the principal and VET instructors at Morley Senior High School. This school has been an RTO for the past decade and has a profound understanding of the benefit of introducing serious trade training in schools. In the adolescent oriented environment of a school, students can be introduced to a variety of trade and get a sense of the trade or industry they are suited to. They then can complete pre-apprenticeships in the secure environment of the school. This reduces the very high attrition rate of kids who leave school at 15 and 16 to start a trade from scratch. It offers as much better use of time at school for those students and ensures that there is less wasted investment by employers and TAFE. I support the need for us to look very closely at the skills that are being attained. I would urge ASQA and its WA counterpart to become much more active in monitoring whether those students being assessed as having skills actually have them. We have students facing much higher fees and, indeed, they are now having to borrow to fund these courses under the HELP scheme. It is more important than ever that we impose real quality control on those we allow to deliver this training.

"Wilkie, Andrew, MP",Ind.,2014-11-24,"



Mr WILKIE
 (Denison) (10:20):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


This bill would see that mandatory pre-commitment is implemented for all poker machines in Australia, that one-dollar-maximum bets were introduced, that a withdrawal limit of $250 was imposed on all automatic teller machines and EFTPOS devices in poker machine venues, that jackpots were restricted on poker machines throughout the country to $500, that the maximum banknote that can be inserted into any poker machine at any one time would be $20, and that the maximum credit that any poker machine could accrue would be $20.


The timeline for these reforms is that all machines sold must be capable of complying with all of the above by 31 December 2015 and that all machines sold must comply with all of the above criteria by 31 December 2019. Moreover, venues with five or more poker machines must be compliant by 31 December 2019, but there is consideration for smaller venues and the limited resources that they have, so that the venues with five or fewer poker machines would need to be compliant by 31 December 2021—an extra two years.


My private member's bill is entirely consistent with the work of the Productivity Commission and, importantly, is consistent with the recommendations of the Productivity Commission in 2010, when it brought out this very hefty report—in fact, its second substantial report into poker machines and problem gambling in Australia. Regrettably, this report was released in 2010 on the day that Julia Gillard became Prime Minister at the expense of Kevin Rudd, and those dramatic political events that day greatly overshadowed what is and what remains Australia's benchmark inquiry and benchmark blueprint for gambling reform—the best we have ever seen. It is a shame that in 2010 that very good work by the Productivity Commission was overshadowed in the way it was. It remains the blueprint and the best guidance for the way ahead to deal with problem gambling, in particular from poker machines.


Obviously, poker machine reform was a big issue in the 43rd parliament, and some of the spotlight has gone off it in this parliament. But mark my words: poker machine problem gambling remains just as serious a problem in the Australian community as it ever has been, and there is just as much pressure in the community for reform—just as much expectation that people like ourselves in this place and in the other place will finally do something to diminish problem gambling in this country. 


The fact is that something approach 100,000 Australians are poker machine problem gamblers. And they are losing in the order of $5,000 million a year. In fact, the Productivity Commission found that something like 600,000 Australians are playing poker machines on a weekly basis Something like 15 per cent of those people are poker machine problem gamblers, and another 15 per cent are at risk of becoming poker machine problem gamblers. In other words, more than half a million Australians play the pokies every week, and almost a third of them are poker machine problem gamblers, or at risk of becoming problem gamblers. So, why on earth is it so hard to get reform in this place? Truly, it beggars belief that when we have a problem as serious as this there is complete and utter disregard in this place for the cost to the community.


Those approximately 100,000 poker-machine problem gamblers—yes, it is a big figure, but it is not just a figure. Every one of those nearly 100,000 Australians is a human being with a very human story. They are all losing more money than they can afford. As a direct result of that, some of them are losing their relationships with their families, some of them are losing their jobs and some of them are losing their houses. Some of them are pinching from the till in their workplaces, and their employers are in financial difficulty because of these thefts. At the very worst, some of those people are taking their own lives. They are taking their own lives because they can no longer live with the cost to them of poker-machine problem gambling. 


And what has this place done about it so far? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. The only reason we had the prospect of some reform in the previous parliament was that the then Prime Minister and the then government were forced by the challenges of a power-sharing parliament to sign a deal for meaningful poker machine reform. But what did previous government do the first opportunity it got, as soon as it could move Peter Slipper into the Speaker's chair—as soon as it had the numbers? It ditched those reforms. That will be forever a shameful black mark against the Labor Party and the other people concerned in the 43rd parliament. 


But I tell you what, Mr Deputy Speaker Vasta: no-one is covered in glory in this place on this matter, because, as soon as there was a change in government and the Liberal-National coalition came to power, what did they do? They overturned the modest reforms that we did get in the previous parliament, the very modest reforms that the Labor Party was forced to implement if only because of the public pressure that had built up over that period of time. What did the new government do? It overturned those reforms. How did the new government get the overturning of those reforms through the Senate? With the support of the Labor Party.


I am going through the history of this because the Australian community needs to understand and needs to be reminded that the Australian parliament and the major parties have consistently let the community down when it comes to meaningful poker machine reform. After all of the carrying-on in the 43rd Parliament and the repeal of the reforms in this parliament, what are we left with? Nothing—absolutely nothing. There has been no action by the Australian parliament to clamp down on a dangerous product that is adversely affecting about 100,000 people. By the way, the research shows that, for every one of those 100,000 people who are poker-machine problem gamblers, between five and 10 other people are affected. Their mums, their dads, their brothers, their sisters, their sons, their daughters, their friends, their work colleagues, their employers: they are all adversely affected. In other words, there could be a million people in this country adversely affected by poker-machine problem gambling. But what is this parliament done? Nothing—and that is to the enduring shame of this place and the people that have populated this place during the 43rd and the 44th Parliaments. 


I am pleased that my colleague the member for Melbourne is here to second this bill and I applaud the Greens for being the only other party that has covered itself in any glory when it comes to pushing for the need for poker machine reform. I thank the member for Melbourne.


The industry thinks it has won this fight. Mark my words, Mr Deputy Speaker: the industry has not won this fight. Yes, it has paid off the Liberal Party. Yes, it has paid off the Nationals. Yes, it has paid off Labor. They are all on the take; they all take general donations from the poker machine industry. In fact, the Labor Party even operates poker machine venues in the ACT. They are all on the take. Why, at the time the 43rd Parliament was considering these matters, Packer gave Katter's party hundreds of thousands of dollars, and no-one batted an eyelid: 'What's unusual about that?' The fact is we have a cruel and dishonest industry trading on the misery of Australians, and just about all of the parties are in cahoots with the industry and on the take. That is how we find ourselves in these circumstances. 


Again, mark my words, Mr Deputy Speaker Vasta: reform is coming, because a wrong like this in the community has never been allowed to go on forever. Sooner or later, a government with a bit of backbone, with a bit of integrity, will come along and it will drive reform. It will be the community that will make that happen because the community will keep insisting that this place finally do something to help those people and to stop people taking their lives. Change will come eventually; it is just a matter of when. I encourage the community to keep up the good fight.


In closing, I commend my bill to the House. I would like to thank a member of my staff, Alex Moores, who has done a really good job on crafting what I think will be an exemplar for poker machine reform in the future.

"Henderson, Sarah, MP",LP,2014-11-24,"



Ms HENDERSON
 (Corangamite) (10:41):  I rise to move a motion concerning the East West Link, one of the most important infrastructure projects in Victoria's history. I move:


That this House:


(1)   recognises that:


(a) the Australian Government will contribute $1.5 billion towards the completion of the western section (Stage Two) of Melbourne's East West Link;


(b) the commitment to Stage Two of the East West Link is in addition to the Commonwealth's $1.5 billion contribution towards the $6 to $8 billion Stage One section of the East West Link; and


(c) together, Stage One and Stage Two will create some 6,700 construction jobs which are so important for Melbourne, Geelong and south-west Victoria; and


(2) notes that the:


(a) East West Link is critical to:


(i) easing congestion on the West Gate Bridge and improving Geelong's transport links to Melbourne;


(ii) easing congestion on the Eastern Freeway and alleviating major traffic bottlenecks at Hoddle Street and Alexandra Parade; and


(iii) improving freight efficiency and connections for major industries in Melbourne's outer east, north and south east to the Port of Melbourne and international airports;


(b) East West Link will never happen under a Labor Government—state Labor opposes the project despite estimates that the cost of Melbourne's road congestion will grow to $5 billion per annum by 2021 and $7.2 billion by 2031, more than double current levels; and


(c) Victorian Leader of the Opposition has described the East West Link as a 'grand hoax' and has threatened to rip up any contracts that are signed in respect of the project and in doing so, has shown contempt for the people of Victoria.


The East West Link is vital to Victoria, vital to Geelong and vital to Corangamite, the electorate I proudly represent. Often, governments are accused of not having vision, of not thinking long term. Here is yet one more project which reflects the Victorian government's long-term vision for our great state: its long-term commitment to investment in transport infrastructure. As I have mentioned, the federal government is proudly backing this project, to the tune of $3 billion, building the roads of the 21st century—money which will be lost, of course, if state Labor is elected on Saturday. 


I note we have a very proud Geelong delegation in the House gallery today, all of whom are backing the East West Link because they know how important this is for our region. They know how important it is for jobs, for our future, for our economic prosperity, at a time when every job in our city is important. Darryn Lyons, the mayor of the City of Greater Geelong, is here. Deputy Mayor Bruce Harwood; the CEO, Gill Miles; Kylie Warne and Bernadette Uzelac from the Geelong Chamber of Commerce; Elaine Carbines, representing G21; and, just so as to not miss anyone out, the former member for South Barwon Alistair Paterson are all here. All are backing the East West Link because they know how important it is. 


Look, in contrast, at Daniel Andrews. He is no John Brumby; he is no Steve Bracks. That is quite clear. His commitment to tear up the contracts for the East West Link and shut this project down is one of the most politically reckless, economically destructive actions of any political leader we have seen. Ripping up contracts will expose the state to millions of dollars of liability and signal to the rest of the country and the world that we cannot be trusted when they are doing business with us.


Today I want to focus on the benefits of the western section to Geelong and my electorate of Corangamite. Under a Napthine government, construction will start at the end of 2015. At the moment, some 14,000 Geelong motorists commute to Melbourne every day for work. From Werribee onwards, it is a quagmire. The western section will save commuters three hours a week in travel time, it will deliver a second river crossing and it will unblock the terrible quagmire—the carpark—we see leading up to West Gate Bridge. The West Gate Bridge is currently terribly congested, carrying some 200,000 vehicles a day, and the new western section will provide capacity for around 100,000 vehicles per day. 


As we in Geelong know, it is all about jobs. Here is one of the most important projects for jobs we have seen in many years—6,700 jobs. The western section alone will create 3,000 jobs. We in Geelong need these jobs. These are jobs that Labor is trying to shut down. Frankly, it is an absolute disgrace. Two weeks ago I was very proud to stand side by side with the member for South Barwon, Andrew Katos, and with local candidates in the Geelong region—Paula Contelj in Geelong, Ron Nelson in Bellarine, Tony McManus in Lara—fighting for the East West Link. They know how important this is for our future, as is the Great Ocean Road upgrade. Unfortunately, the member for Grayndler, who is speaking next, fought against that one as well. But Andrew Katos and those local candidates understand how important this project is for business. I note that the Assistant Minister for Infrastructure is also in the House—a great champion for building the roads of the 21st century.

  That is not true! The member for Grayndler has just made another false statement to the House—saying that we do not build anything. Construction on the Great Ocean Road has already commenced. It is so exciting to see our investment in the roads of the 21st century. I tell you what: the East West Link is going to revolutionise our city—and that is what we need!


Let me just give an example. Journey Management, a wonderful transport and logistics company in Geelong, employs some 200 people. They estimate that the East West Link—I met the CEO, Shane Blakeborough, just a few days ago—will save the company a million dollars a year in fuel, in maintenance and in productivity gains. Currently, it is cheaper for his trucks to drive from Geelong to Albury than it is for them to drive from Geelong to Dandenong. The East West Link will also mean that, rather than do one trip a day, he will be able to do two trips a day from Geelong to Dandenong. That is a massive boost to the productivity of a very important business in Geelong. 


What is extraordinary about Labor's position is that just six years ago the Leader of the Opposition, along with the member for Gorton and the former members for Gellibrand and Lalor—former Prime Minister Gillard—threw his support behind an east-west link. They actually said in a submission to the East West Link needs assessment study:


We support a cross-city road link from the western suburbs to the Eastern Freeway. The consequences of doing nothing are negative and far-reaching. They will threaten Melbourne's future economic success and liveability. Substantial new investment is needed in the transport network to avoid these consequences and to support the changes taking place across Melbourne, including opening up new jobs and business opportunities across the city. Doing nothing therefore is not an option. 


That is why I have launched a petition. I urge anyone who has not signed it to go onto my website, sarahhenderson.com.au, and sign the petition, calling on all MPs in this place including Labor MPs, particularly the Leader of the Opposition, particularly the member for Corio and the member for Ballarat—and I note that unfortunately the member for Corio is not even speaking on this debate, which is very telling, I have to say. I can say that already hundreds have signed this petition, urging members on both sides of the House to back the East West Link.


I have also called on local unions and local union leaders to back the East West Link. Previously, they were supportive of the western section because they know how important this is for jobs and for economic growth, and now there is deafening silence. They are putting their partisan political games ahead of jobs. I say to Geelong Trades Hall and to other local union leaders: put jobs ahead of politics and back the East West Link.


It is vital to have coalition governments in Spring Street as well as Canberra if Victorian families are to have the job creation they need and deserve. The simple fact is: Victoria cannot afford to lose all the hard-gained earnings of the last four years by going back to Labor. Labor cannot be trusted to keep Victoria's finances in order. Labor cannot be trusted to manage money. They cannot be trusted to deliver on their promises. The promise of Daniel Andrews and his insidious links with the CFMEU, which seems to be running the Labor opposition more than anyone else, is the most reckless and economically destructive commitment that has ever been seen in the state of Victoria. Look what they are also doing with Bay West, another destructive project for our environment. So I urge all MPs to get on board and back the East West Link. For Victoria, vote Denis Napthine's government in on Saturday.

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler) (10:52):  American diplomat and thinker Benjamin Franklin once made an astute observation about the nature of advice. 'Wise men don't need advice,' Franklin said, 'and fools won't take it.' When it comes to investing in infrastructure, the Prime Minister, like Franklin's fool, won't take advice. The Prime Minister is investing a total of $3 billion in the East West Link road project in Melbourne. This is precisely the same amount that was cut from the Melbourne Metro project. This is in spite of the expert advice from Infrastructure Australia and Victoria's planning and traffic experts that the Melbourne Metro is a higher priority. The expert advice is that the metro will deliver more public benefit for the investment, improving the reach, quality and frequency of public transport services in Melbourne. It would take thousands of cars off the roads. It would improve commuting times for train users. It is necessary work if other new lines, such as a link to the airport, are to be possible. It would make more room for people who continue to use the city's roads.


But the Prime Minister has his own ideas. He outlined those ideas in his 2009 political manifesto Battlelines, in which he wrote:


Mostly, there just aren't enough people wanting to go from a particular place to a particular destination at a particular time to justify any vehicle larger than a car, and cars need roads …


This loopy view explains why, upon taking office, the Prime Minister cancelled all Commonwealth investment in public transport projects right across the nation. Whilst the Treasurer believes that poor people do not drive too far, the Prime Minister believes that people do not use public transport. This kind of weird ideology, this complete ignorance of the daily lives of millions of everyday Australians who rely on public transport, is the policy context of the motion before us. Of course, the political context is Saturday's Victorian election. The motion's mover seeks to boost the political stocks of her Liberal Party colleagues, who are in real trouble leading up to Saturday's election.


The truth is that both projects, in terms of roads and rail, seek to address traffic congestion. I believe you need to invest in roads, but you need to invest in rail also—not one or the other but both—and you need to direct the priorities based upon Infrastructure Australia's advice. It is why we allocated more investment in public transport than all other Commonwealth governments combined since federation. 


Importantly, Infrastructure Australia was created to give advice based upon cost-benefit analyses which are published. Why is it that the East West Link cost-benefit analysis is still not published and still not available, in spite of the fact that $1½ billion has already been forwarded? In its 2013 Infrastructure Priority List, the Melbourne Metro and the upgrade of the M80 road were right at the top. The East West Link is further down the list, with potential, but the cost-benefit analysis had not been completed. The former Labor government took this advice and allocated money for the M80 upgrade and for the Melbourne Metro. The Victorian government initially backed the Metro and in 2012 spent $118,000 of public funds to produce a video simulating a journey on the new train line, as was published by The Age last week. The federal government had already invested $40 million on the planning. The Metro was ready to go, recommended by Infrastructure Australia, so the Abbott government cut $3 billion from the budget. The next stage of the M80 upgrade is ready to go, with all planning completed, positive BCR, over $1 billion already invested to improve productivity on this ring road. It was recommended by Infrastructure Australia. So the Abbott government cut $500 million from the budget. Then there is the project that is part of the Managed Motorways program, to the east of Melbourne. This use of smart infrastructure has the highest ever benefit-cost ratio of any project recommended by Infrastructure Australia. The Monash Freeway section between Warrigal Road and Clyde Road has a benefit-cost ratio of 5.2—$5.20 return on every dollar invested. So what did the government do? The Abbott government cut $68.6 million from the budget. The Napthine government now also champions the East West Link, but it was revealed in The Age last week that the Victorian government's senior traffic planners wanted to stick with the Metro. Instead, they have an alternative plan that does not even pass through the Melbourne CBD.


Ignoring expert advice is bad enough, but the Prime Minister's actions also breach one of his fundamental election promises. Just days before the federal election the Prime Minister told the National Press Club:



I have given a commitment that we won't spend more than more than $100 million on any single infrastructure project without a published cost-benefit analysis.


Well, there is no published cost-benefit analysis and as recently as 20 October the head of Infrastructure Australia, John Fitzgerald, told the Senate budget estimates committee hearing:


We are still in the process of assessing that project. We have not formed a final view on that.


I have got news for Mr Fitzgerald—the government does not care what Infrastructure Australia thinks about this project. It has already handed over $1½ billion, including $1 billion for stage 2 of the project, which will not start until 2016 at the earliest. This is at the same time that the government is demanding widows, invalid pensioners, students and average mums and dads do their best for the so-called budget emergency that they talk about. But they have a billion dollars to hand over years in advance of this project, in spite of the clear commitment that was given by the assistant minister that there would be a milestone payments. He said:


That we're hitting milestones, that we're only making payments to states when they actually deliver the milestones, that they're not getting money in their bank account prior to milestones being delivered.


Yet, $1½ billion is in their bank account—earning interest; not creating jobs, not doing anything to build infrastructure, just sitting in a bank account earning interest. 


Our cities are under siege from worsening traffic congestion. You do not need to be a Rhodes scholar to know that roads alone are not the solution. Public transport is part of the solution, and here is a good example— construction of the Regional Rail Link began in 2010. The project will untangle freight and passenger lines connecting the Melbourne CBD to Ballarat, Bendigo and Geelong. It will provide an extra 54,000 commuter seats a day. It is the biggest single Commonwealth investment in public transport in the nation's history, with more than 15,000 workers involved so far. The Regional Rail Link will take 45,000 cars off the road during peak periods and save the state's economy $300 million per year. Best of all, it is ahead of time and under budget. 


What was the incoming coalition government's response in Victoria to this project? They stopped it. They paused the project when they came into office and tried to renegotiate for funding to go to other projects. They said that this was a project that was over budget—not true. They did that by refusing to take into account the contingency reserve that were factored in for this vital project for Melbourne and for Victoria. Eventually, after spending months criticising it, attempting to negotiate with the federal government, it went ahead—but it went ahead in spite of the Victorian government. And in spite of the fact that they said this was a wasteful project, they have not missed a photo opportunity. They do not invite the federal members who were responsible for getting the funds for this project or the local state members, but state ministers have been turning up at these openings of new stations such as West Footscray. There are other stations in the Werribee region that are ready to be opened but the state government now pretends that this is their project—nothing could be further from the truth. 


The fact is that, if our nation wants an effective, properly integrated transport system that delivers productivity gains for the entire economy, the Commonwealth must invest in public transport. If we want to liberate long-suffering Australians in drive-in, drive-out suburbs, the Commonwealth must invest in public transport. If we want to reduce carbon emissions, the Commonwealth must invest in public transport. We need an infrastructure strategy that is about integrated transport in our cities and in our regions, and that is the way forward.

Mr SUKKAR
 (Deakin) (11:02):  We have just heard the member for Grayndler speak for 10 minutes on this motion, and he is so embarrassed by his party's position that he barely mentioned the East West Link in those 10 minutes. I can understand why he is embarrassed by Labor's position. For more than two years, I have spoken endlessly about the importance of building the East West Link, both to my electorate of Deakin and Victorians more broadly. As I rise to speak here today, on the eve of the state election in Victoria, I do so with an even greater sense of urgency and awareness of how this piece of nation-building infrastructure will lift up our state and what Labor's recklessness is putting at risk.


I congratulate my friend the member for Corangamite for putting forward this motion today as a timely reminder of the benefits of building the East West Link and the federal government's very significant contribution to this project. I know that people in her electorate are calling for the East West Link, just as people in Melbourne's eastern suburbs, including in my electorate of Deakin and in the member for Chisholm's electorate, are eager for construction to commence on this major road project so that traffic can be reduced on the Eastern Freeway and the Monash Freeway. 


Deakin families are fed up with wasting their precious time being stuck in traffic on the Eastern Freeway or the Monash Freeway—time that they could be spending with their loved ones at home or being productive at work. I know just how fed up the people in Deakin are with traffic congestion, because they literally tell me every day. That is why my commitment to the Deakin electorate at the last election was to deliver federal funding for the East West Link, to secure jobs, to reduce congestion and to boost productivity. I am therefore very proud of our $3 billion contribution to this project. This includes $1.5 billion for stage 1, the eastern section, which is a six-kilometre link from the Eastern Freeway through to City Link at Parkville; and another $1.5 billion for stage 2, which the member for Corangamite has spoken about. 


Anyone who has made the daily commute, east to west, across the city—as many of my constituents do—understands the incredible pressure placed on the existing infrastructure. By 2031, there will be an additional 400,000 vehicles doing that commute. Quite simply, it is unsustainable. But I have good news for members opposite—there is a solution, and the solution will be the construction of stage 1 of the East West Link, which will cater for an additional 120,000 vehicles by 2031. It will drastically cut travel times between the Eastern Freeway and City Link, and significantly reduce congestion at the end of the Eastern Freeway. Construction of the eastern section will create 3,700 jobs and provide a much needed boost to our economy, with 90 per cent of construction funds to be spent on local services. My colleague the member for Corangamite has spoken about the similar benefits for the western section, which of itself will create 3,000 jobs. This funding will enable 6,700 jobs. 


Whatever way you look at it, this is a vital project for Victoria—a fact which, until not long ago, had bipartisan support. Those opposite agreed to it. In July 2008, none other than the Leader of the Opposition put his name on a submission to the Department of Transport, supporting the East West Link. I suppose we all know that the opposition leader is prone to changing his mind from time to time—just ask Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard. So, federal Labor has now done an almighty backflip to oppose the East West Link project—all for the sake of supporting the Victorian Labor Party, as it desperately tries to protect a handful of inner-city votes from the Greens. In doing so, the Labor Party has abandoned Melbourne's east.



Ms Burke interjecting—




Mr SUKKAR:
  I look forward to the member for Chisholm rising to support this motion. I suggest to the Victorian Labor members that they leave their inner city suburbs of East Melbourne or Fitzroy and actually spend some time in our suburbs to understand how draining a commute on the Eastern Freeway in peak hour can be. Those opposite have stood by as their Victorian counterpart led by Daniel Andrews—or Dan Andrews—has vowed to tear up the contracts for the East west Link. It is absolutely clear that only coalition governments in Spring Street and in Canberra will deliver the East west Link. As part of the coalition, I will continue to fight for the delivery of this project for the people of Deakin and all residents of the eastern suburbs, including those in the electorate for Chisolm.

Ms BURKE
 (Chisholm) (11:07):  I also rise to speak on this motion, but I will neither surprise nor disappoint the member for Deakin when I say that I do not support this completely wasteful tunnel. This is a truck tunnel—an $18 billion truck tunnel that will mean no other project built in Victoria from here to eternity. That much money going to one project will ensure that all our electorates never have anything else built, particularly in regional Victoria.


It will not resolve the problem of traffic congestion that, yes, my constituents feel every day. Yes, I understand this problem. I drove down that road this morning to get to the airport and, yes, when I hit the end of the Eastern Freeway, got to Alexander Parade and got through all those traffic lights, it was a crawl—a moaning crawl. The tragedy is that this traffic problem and this congestion will not be resolved by this $18 billion fest by the coalition government in Victoria or federally. Indeed, actual modelling has demonstrated that the time will increase for commuters who want to go to town. The majority of my constituents and those in the electorate of Deakin, when they get to the end of the eastern, are not turning right, as I did this morning to go to the airport. 


It may resolve some issues for commuters to the airport and for freight, but it is not going to help the majority of my electorate who  turn left to go to work in town. Indeed, the travel time for them will increase. It will increase—I am not wrong; I have the modelling to prove it. The modelling from Veich Lister reveals that building the tunnel will actually increase traffic on key sections of Melbourne's road network. Hoddle Street near the Eastern Freeway will increase the morning peak time by 35 per cent; Manningham near Bulleen Road will increase 25 per cent in the am and 20 per cent in the pm; the Eastern Freeway link near the East west Link Tunnel will increase travel time by 69 per cent—it will not decrease travel time. The cost blow-out is enormous.



If we are talking about backflips, let us look at the backflip on this one. Terry Mulder in 2010 said:


You made that up … you were wrong …We are not going to this election with a plan …


for an East West Tunnel. That is what they said in 2010. Terry Mulder is on my side because he also said:


You're not going to drive yourself out of a problem. Our view is that the answer is an effective, reliable public transport system. That's what's needed here—more investment in public transport.


Why don't we hear those opposite talking about putting the light rail down the Eastern? Let's talk about that and let's talk about really resolving congestion problems in this area. 


The designers of City Link, Alan Hale and his colleagues at engineering firm Acer Wargon Chapman have criticised the East west Link:


Mr Hale says the 5.2 kilometre toll road is ""the wrong priority and will not alleviate congestion across the city"" and that the Napthine government is set to sign on to a project that will set Melbourne back for years.


""The evidence from cities around the world where real renewal has been achieved is public transport should be the primary focus,"" he said.


""For those of us who have been involved in major transport projects long enough, the lessons learnt, often the hard way, are that building more roads without investing in public transport is simply a recipe for inducing more vehicular travel."" Mr Hale, no public transport purist, argues completing the ""missing link"" in the ring road between Greensborough and the Eastern Freeway would ""make a lot of sense"" because, unlike the East West Link, it would divert traffic from the inner suburbs.


That was reported in The Age in September 2014, entitled 'Wrong Way on Road Link'. Yes, it is the wrong way on this road link. This is an enormous amount of money going into a tunnel that will not resolve the problem and will put a huge impost and impact on our community and our assets.


You just need to look at what is going to happen around the Parkville precinct: the Parkville Cricket Club, the Seeing Eye Dog training centre, the Urban Camp, the impact on the Moonee Ponds Creek, the birdlife in Kensington, Flemington and North Melbourne area, the loss of playground space at the Flemington housing estate, the significant loss of trees on Flemington Road, the Clifton Hill Primary School and the Chinese aged-care facility at Parkville. This will be a huge impost on my electorate with many people concerned about what is going to happen to their aged people. This tunnel is the wrong way to go.

Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon) (11:12):  It is a pleasure to rise today to talk on this issue because this is an issue about trust and it is an issue about who we should trust to govern the state of Victoria. We all know the Victorian people will go to the ballot box on Saturday, and they have to think clearly about their decision on Saturday. Ultimately they need to decide who they will trust to run the state of Victoria for the next four years. Will they trust Daniel, Dan or Danny Andrews—or is it Andrew Daniels? Or will they trust Denis Napthine and the competent job that he has done in governing the state over the last couple of years. Will they trust Dan Andrews? He said: 


A government that actually values our state's reputation and good name doesn't rip up contracts.'


That is what he said on 13 August this year. And yet by 11 September, less than a month later, he said:


I think a ream of Reflex paper would be worth more than those contracts.


He said he would rip the contracts up. Is this a man that the Victorian people can trust?


To quote Friedrich Nietzsche, 'I'm not upset that you lied to me,' Daniel Andrews,' I'm upset that, from now on, I can't believe you.' This is what the Victorian people need to think about on Saturday. They cannot trust this individual. He has lied to them, and it will mean that from now on they will never quite be able to believe what he has said to them, because in the back of their minds they will know that when it came to East West Link he said one thing in August and then, a month later, he said completely the opposite—and he was absolutely shamefaced about it. This election is going to boil down to trust. As far as I am concerned, there is only one person that I can trust to lead the Victorian government for the next four years, and that is Denis Napthine.


Let's have a look at what this project will do. Let's have a look at the key facts around East West Link and what it will mean for Victoria. It will provide capacity for around 100,000 vehicles per day; reduce congestion on the West Gate Bridge, which is currently carrying an unsustainable 200,000 vehicles a day; provide a 15- to 20-minute time-saving for people travelling from Geelong, Werribee, Altona and Laverton to the city; provide a 10- to 15-minute time-saving for people travelling from Ballarat, Melton and Caroline Springs to the city; cut 15 to 20 minutes off a typical trip from the freight and logistics precinct in Truganina in Melbourne's west to the Port of Melbourne; and create up to 3,000 jobs during construction. That last point is the most significant. 


The coalition federally and at a state level want to grow the Victorian economy. We want to provide jobs for the Victorian state. We want to make sure that Victoria will go ahead, like it did after the Kennett government built the infrastructure that the state needed. This state government, with the support of the coalition federal government, wants to do exactly the same thing again. It wants to put Victoria in first place when it comes to first-class infrastructure. It wants to Victoria to lead the way when it comes to first-class infrastructure. It wants to provide jobs that will result in us putting in place that first-class infrastructure. Yet what do we have from the other side at the state level and here? We have opposition to job-creating infrastructure.


I plead with the Victorian people when they go to the ballot box on Saturday: think long and hard about your decision. You need to think ultimately about who you can trust to deliver for Victoria for the next four years.

"Ryan, Joanne, MP",ALP,2014-11-24,"



Ms RYAN
 (Lalor—Opposition Whip) (11:18):  I welcome the opportunity to speak in this timely debate, with the state election in Victoria some five days away. On this side of the House we do not support the East West Link, and we have various reasons for not supporting it. We support the Victorian opposition leader Daniel Andrews's position against the East West Link. We do so because the Eddington report recommended a west-east link, that the west section be the first priority. This is now stretching out—the budget papers suggest until 2023; I would suggest it is at least 15 years away. The member for Corangamite earlier cited support from the previous member for Lalor for the project. Of course, the previous member for Lalor's support for the project was for the initial west-east link. Since then, under a Napthine government, many things have changed. 


One of the things that has changed is that the Western Distributor was taken off the agenda. The Western Distributor, which Daniel Andrews's government will deliver if elected on Saturday, is exactly what the west of Victoria needs, it exactly what the Western suburbs need and it is exactly what Geelong needs, because it is immediate—it would be delivered in four years—and it would take 5,000 trucks off the West Gate Freeway. It is shovel-ready and ready to go. But, instead, we have the member for Corangamite in here talking about the East West Link as a saviour for the west, with a time line leading out to the never-never. It certainly will not be delivered under a Napthine government if it gets another term. It will take three terms for this to be delivered. Meanwhile, the number of people on the roads from the west of Melbourne accessing the city increases daily, as do the number of trucks, as do the dangerous accidents that are occurring involving cars and trucks.


The other part of this argument is to look at the federal funding for the eastern section, stage 1 of the East West Link, where we have contributed $1.5 billion. It is difficult to make the case for stage 1 of the East West Link being of any benefit to the west of Melbourne—any benefit whatsoever. It will not improve travel times from the west to the airport like it will in the east, and it will not be a significant improvement on travel times for people from the west to get to the east. 


Then there is the issue we have with cost. The true cost is unknown. We did have some academics recently determine that they think that the cost is actually going to be closer to $18 billion, with no value at all for the west of the state. Then there is the issue of the contract and the secrecy around the contract to date and the fact that there has not been a business case put to the Victorian public—put to anyone in fact. So the rush to get the contracts signed before this state election is something that the Victorian public are struggling to come to terms with. As the member for Chisholm so nicely put it, there is also the question of the absolute incessant priority around roads over public transport. What we are going to get with the Western Distributor, as the first cab off the rank for an Andrews government, would be fewer trucks on the road for the West Gate, at a fraction of the cost, and we will not wait in the west for the year 2023.


Another thing that people on the other side talk about a lot in this debate is jobs. Let's be clear.


I seek leave to continue my remarks.

Mr TONY SMITH
 (Casey) (12:01):  On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, I present the committee's second interim report on the inquiry into the conduct of the 2013 federal election and assessment of electronic voting options.


In accordance with standing order 39(e) the report was made a parliamentary paper.




Mr TONY SMITH:
  by leave—Our voting system has changed and evolved over the 113 years since the first federal election in March 1901. But one thing has remained a constant from the election of the first parliament to that of the 44th last September. We still vote with a pencil on a paper ballot that is then manually counted.


In recent decades some democracies have moved to a form of electronic voting. The USA has electronic voting machines in many states and Estonia offers electronic voting over the internet.


While one system requires you to still visit a polling booth and the other offers online convenience, advocates argue that both offer faster and potentially more accurate results.


With the close of polls the results are known within minutes rather than hours, days and weeks and arguably without the human error that occurs in the long paper ballot count.


Many think it sounds like a good idea for the next federal election. No matter your view, this is not feasible.


Even the most ardent electronic voting advocates must recognise that in logistical terms it would be impossible for our electoral authorities to roll it out next polling day, which is less than two years away—at the latest.


But what about future elections?


I once simply assumed so, but that was before I had given it a lot of thought.


After hearing from a range of experts and surveying the international electoral landscape, it is clear to me and the rest of the committee that Australia is not in a position to introduce any large-scale system of electronic voting in the near future without catastrophically compromising our electoral integrity.


Machine electronic voting at a polling place is vulnerable to hacking to some degree. This can be mitigated by a system that not only records your vote electronically but also produces a printed ballot for physical counting and later verification. In other words, there is a lot of expense to still visit the polling booth, queue up and complete your vote on a machine rather than a paper ballot.


For this reason, internet voting seems to be naturally the most attractive to many voters. As an election expert from the USA said to me recently: 'When it comes to voting, folks would rather be online than in line.'


But the weight of evidence tells us that at present this is highly vulnerable to hacking.


While internet voting occurs in Estonia, it does not mean that system cannot be hacked. With all the internet security architecture available, the academic experts swear they can, and have proved they can, hack such systems.


In future it is likely, given the turbo-advances in technology, that a system of online electronic voting could be delivered with acceptable safety and security. But even when we reach this time, there should be considerations beyond just the convenience that it would offer.


Given we complete so many transactions online, I am often asked why voting should be any different. My answer to that is that voting once every three years to determine our democratic destiny is not an everyday transaction.


Not only do we have the right to a ballot; we have the right enshrined within our system to a secret vote. Voting at a polling booth guarantees this; voting over the internet would threaten it.


Internet voting would expose some voters to family and peer pressure by removing the individual isolation of voting at a secluded booth and replacing it with voting in a home, a workplace or a public place. It also potentially opens up a market for votes where disenfranchised or financially desperate voters could be offered money to vote a certain way, which could be verified in a way not possible at a polling place.


This is not to say that we should not be striving to make better use of modern technology, but it is to say that technological convenience must be balanced against electoral integrity.


There are other aspects of our voting system that should be brought into the modern electronic world, aspects that will not compromise the security, sanctity and secrecy of the ballot.


We can progressively replace the paper roll at each polling booth with an electronic interconnected roll. At present, every booth within an electorate has an identical paper roll. When you vote your name is crossed off at the polling place you attend. With an interconnected electronic roll, your name would be crossed off and you would be provided with a ballot. It would also, almost simultaneously, be crossed off at every other booth. This would dramatically reduce the opportunity for multiple voting in your name at other polling places and would reduce administrative errors.


At the same time we should start to introduce electronic scanning of ballot papers. This would enable an electronic count, the results of which would be delivered minutes after the close of the polls. The same physical count that occurs now would still be performed for verification. Such a system would offer faster results, at a manageable cost, without any of the risks or compromises to electoral integrity of stand-alone electronic voting. Indeed, it would provide a checking mechanism, thereby providing a measure of surety to the count.


This report makes seven recommendations. Recommendations 1 to 4 call for the rollout of electronic, certified lists to all prepoll centres and mobile voting teams, initially at the next election, with eventual introduction to all polling places. The committee also considers there is an opportunity for this technology to be developed collaboratively and shared with the states and territories.


Recommendations 5 and 6 propose the consideration of electronic counting and storage of ballot papers. This would offer a number of benefits in terms of speed and verification of the count. Were ballots to be scanned for counting, they may also be able to be stored digitally. Currently ballot papers are destroyed after a prescribed number of years. Were they to be scanned and stored digitally, they could be retained indefinitely and, in doing so, could capture part of the electoral history of Australia.


Finally, the committee acknowledges the real benefit of the current telephone assisted voting system that is available to blind and low-vision voters and recommends it be extended to voters with assessed mobility or access issues to provide them with easier access to voting.


Technology is moving at a rapid pace. The committee believes we should be utilising it to ensure that the systems underpinning how we vote are sound and that persons with disabilities have easy access to the vote. In doing so we should harness that which enhances our electoral integrity and not that which could endanger it.


I want to place on the record my thanks to all the members of the committee for their work on this matter, which has produced a second unanimous report. The committee has already completed an extensive series of hearings in relation to this inquiry and, as I said at the outset, this is the second interim report. Over the course of twenty hearings to date and after reviewing 207 submissions, the committee has worked collaboratively in an impartial manner.


The committee is continuing its broader work on the inquiry into the conduct of the last election. It recently heard from the Auditor-General on his latest report on AEC workforce management, which had been undertaken at the committee's request. This audit made some serious findings about staff training and preparation for elections. The committee also questioned the AEC about the audit, including in relation to its serious findings about polling staff training during and before the last election. 


The committee will address these and many other important issues relating to the last election and the circumstances surrounding the lost votes in Western Australia, voter identification and the integrity of the electoral roll in its final report, which I hope to be in a position to table in the first quarter of next year. I commend the report to the House.

Mr TONY SMITH
 (Casey) (12:01):  On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, I present the committee's second interim report on the inquiry into the conduct of the 2013 federal election and assessment of electronic voting options.


In accordance with standing order 39(e) the report was made a parliamentary paper.




Mr TONY SMITH:
  by leave—Our voting system has changed and evolved over the 113 years since the first federal election in March 1901. But one thing has remained a constant from the election of the first parliament to that of the 44th last September. We still vote with a pencil on a paper ballot that is then manually counted.


In recent decades some democracies have moved to a form of electronic voting. The USA has electronic voting machines in many states and Estonia offers electronic voting over the internet.


While one system requires you to still visit a polling booth and the other offers online convenience, advocates argue that both offer faster and potentially more accurate results.


With the close of polls the results are known within minutes rather than hours, days and weeks and arguably without the human error that occurs in the long paper ballot count.


Many think it sounds like a good idea for the next federal election. No matter your view, this is not feasible.


Even the most ardent electronic voting advocates must recognise that in logistical terms it would be impossible for our electoral authorities to roll it out next polling day, which is less than two years away—at the latest.


But what about future elections?


I once simply assumed so, but that was before I had given it a lot of thought.


After hearing from a range of experts and surveying the international electoral landscape, it is clear to me and the rest of the committee that Australia is not in a position to introduce any large-scale system of electronic voting in the near future without catastrophically compromising our electoral integrity.


Machine electronic voting at a polling place is vulnerable to hacking to some degree. This can be mitigated by a system that not only records your vote electronically but also produces a printed ballot for physical counting and later verification. In other words, there is a lot of expense to still visit the polling booth, queue up and complete your vote on a machine rather than a paper ballot.


For this reason, internet voting seems to be naturally the most attractive to many voters. As an election expert from the USA said to me recently: 'When it comes to voting, folks would rather be online than in line.'


But the weight of evidence tells us that at present this is highly vulnerable to hacking.


While internet voting occurs in Estonia, it does not mean that system cannot be hacked. With all the internet security architecture available, the academic experts swear they can, and have proved they can, hack such systems.


In future it is likely, given the turbo-advances in technology, that a system of online electronic voting could be delivered with acceptable safety and security. But even when we reach this time, there should be considerations beyond just the convenience that it would offer.


Given we complete so many transactions online, I am often asked why voting should be any different. My answer to that is that voting once every three years to determine our democratic destiny is not an everyday transaction.


Not only do we have the right to a ballot; we have the right enshrined within our system to a secret vote. Voting at a polling booth guarantees this; voting over the internet would threaten it.


Internet voting would expose some voters to family and peer pressure by removing the individual isolation of voting at a secluded booth and replacing it with voting in a home, a workplace or a public place. It also potentially opens up a market for votes where disenfranchised or financially desperate voters could be offered money to vote a certain way, which could be verified in a way not possible at a polling place.


This is not to say that we should not be striving to make better use of modern technology, but it is to say that technological convenience must be balanced against electoral integrity.


There are other aspects of our voting system that should be brought into the modern electronic world, aspects that will not compromise the security, sanctity and secrecy of the ballot.


We can progressively replace the paper roll at each polling booth with an electronic interconnected roll. At present, every booth within an electorate has an identical paper roll. When you vote your name is crossed off at the polling place you attend. With an interconnected electronic roll, your name would be crossed off and you would be provided with a ballot. It would also, almost simultaneously, be crossed off at every other booth. This would dramatically reduce the opportunity for multiple voting in your name at other polling places and would reduce administrative errors.


At the same time we should start to introduce electronic scanning of ballot papers. This would enable an electronic count, the results of which would be delivered minutes after the close of the polls. The same physical count that occurs now would still be performed for verification. Such a system would offer faster results, at a manageable cost, without any of the risks or compromises to electoral integrity of stand-alone electronic voting. Indeed, it would provide a checking mechanism, thereby providing a measure of surety to the count.

 (Wannon) (12:16):  On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, I present the committee's advisory report on the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill (No.1) 2014.


Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).




Mr TEHAN:
  by leave—I am pleased to present the committee's report into the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2014. The bill contains a series of amendments to the Criminal Code and the Intelligence Services Act. The amendments are primarily aimed at: (1) facilitating Australian Secret Intelligence Service support for and cooperation with the Australian Defence Force, (2) amending the emergency ministerial authorisation arrangements for the Intelligence Services Act agencies, and (3) enabling the AFP to seek control orders for a broader range of individuals of security concern and to streamline application processes.


The committee has made 15 recommendations in its report aimed at further strengthening the bill's safeguards, transparency and oversight mechanisms. The recommendations include: with regard to ASIS support for the ADF, providing greater clarity around how a class of Australian persons will be defined; on emergency ministerial authorisations, requiring the relevant minister of an intelligence services agency to be notified within eight hours of any emergency authorisation where the relevant minister or ministers was not initially contactable; requiring the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security to oversee such authorisations and to notify the committee within 30 days of each instance; regarding changes to the control order regime, basing the terms 'supports' and 'facilitates' in relation to control orders on language in the existing Criminal Code to the extent possible; requiring the Attorney-General's consent for an urgent interim control order to be obtained by the AFP within eight hours of a request being made; and retaining an existing requirement for the AFP, in applications to make or vary a control order, to explain why each condition in the order should or should not be imposed on the person.


The committee has also recommended that the government finalise the appointment of the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor and that the INSLM be tasked with advising on possible additional safeguards for the control order regime to, importantly, take account of both the recent changes to control order legislation and the heightened security environment. The committee has also made a serious of other recommendations aimed at clarifying key terms and retaining existing safeguards in the processes underlying the control order regime.


The measures included in this bill were introduced into the parliament following urgent requests from agencies to fill legislative gaps and to assist in the current fight against terrorism, both in Australia and abroad. Following consideration of its recommendations, the committee has recommended that the bill be passed by the parliament.


I wish to thank the other members of the committee for their cooperative approach to the inquiry and for the ability for the committee to once again come forward to the parliament with a bipartisan list of recommendations. I would also thank the organisations and individuals who participated in the inquiry. I thank them once again, given what were short time frames, for participating in the committee's deliberations. I also thank the secretariat for the very professional and diligent way that they have supported the committee in its works.


I commend the report to the House.

Mr FITZGIBBON
 (Hunter) (13:30):  What a dark day it is for public broadcasting in this country. We are now starting to see the real effects of the Prime Minister's broken promise on ABC and SBS funding. Today, one-third of the team at ABC 1233 Newcastle lost their jobs and much of the station's programing went with them. I am not yet sure what will be the impact on ABC Upper Hunter in my electorate.


This will tear at the heart of the Hunter's social and economic fabric. Our ABC is not just a broadcasting service; it is an institution, delivering balanced news, community information and stimulating public debate. The ABC can always be relied upon to promote and defend the Hunter's interest and, in times of crisis, including natural disaster, it plays the role of emergency broadcaster. This is true in every region in the country. Rural and regional towns everywhere rely on the ABC for their local news, for special rural programing and for programs like Bush Telegraph, which, I understand, has been axed. This is a disgrace and every Australian who heard Tony Abbott make his promise not to touch the ABC and SBS is entitled to be very angry.


This morning on ABC Newcastle we had the member for Paterson blaming Mark Scott for the demise of ABC services in rural and regional Australia. This is a disgrace. And all those representing rural and regional seats on that side have abandoned their local communities.

Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Prime Minister) (14:00):  I move:


That the House record its deep regret at the death on 15 November 2014 of the Right Honourable Reginald Greive Withers, former Senator for Western Australia and Minister, place on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tender its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.


Reg Withers was a great servant of our country. Starting in the Royal Australian Navy during the Second World War, he went on to become a senator for Western Australia, a minister in the Fraser government and, finally, Lord Mayor of the City of Perth. As everyone who knew him well discovered, he was a political warrior with a deep love for his country and passion for its future. Reg Withers entered the Senate in 1966 and served for some 20 years. He gained the nickname 'the toe-cutter'. He was actually quite proud of this nickname. It seemed that he thought it was better to be a toe-cutter than a fence-sitter. As opposition leader in the Senate, his tactic of deferring rather than defeating the supply bills was a key to the resolution of the dismissal crisis of 1975. In the Fraser government he served as Minister for Administrative Services from 1975 to 1978, and he was the last Privy Councillor to serve in the Australian Senate. After leaving the Senate in 1987, he still contributed to our country as Lord Mayor of Perth between 1991 and 1993. During the 1999 constitutional referendum I was proud to work with Reg in the campaign to keep the Crown in our Constitution.


For a committed and passionate Liberal, Reg Withers had an unusual political pedigree. His father was actually a state Labor member of parliament and in earlier days had introduced him to John Curtin and Ben Chifley. One day one of Reg's Labor colleagues discovered that Reg's dad had actually moved the socialist objective at the 1929 ALP conference; and the Labor man said to Reg, 'You must be the black sheep of the family,' and Reg said, 'No, my dad was the red sheep of the family!'


Some years ago, during a condolence motion in the Senate, Reg 's long time Labor friend Fred Daly was watching from the gallery and famously sent a note down to Reg. Fred's note to Reg read: I'm sorry I won't live another 50 years because I'd love to be here when they speak on your condolence motion and every hypocrite will get up and say, ""He was loved by all""!' Reg Withers fought with many but he had the respect of all and he had the love of many. He will be remembered as a man of integrity who stood up for his convictions and the institutions that make our country strong. On behalf of the government, I extend our condolences to his widow, Shirley, to his children and to his grandchildren.

Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Leader of the Opposition) (14:03):  The opposition rises to join with the Prime Minister to express our condolences on the passing of Senator Reg Withers. Reg Withers did not go into politics to be loved, especially not by his opponents. But he was by all accounts a genial man. He was an intelligent man. He was a man with a good sense of humour. And he came from a robust political party—the Western Australian division of the Liberal Party, a party whose ups and downs shaped Withers' own legendary resilience. I think it is fair to say that, in a tough business, he was one of the toughest customers. There was nothing naive or romantic about his view of public life. As he once said: 'Politics is about getting power and keeping power. We're not indulging in some afternoon tea party, for goodness sake!'


Today we pay our respects for Reg Withers' life. As the Prime Minister said, in an interview on ABC Radio in 1983, Reg Withers recalled his old friend and sparring partner Fred Daly sitting in the gallery. He said, 'Freddie and I looked at each other in a rather bemused way,' and he did grab hold of a sheet of paper. And Fred Daly said, 'I'm sorry that I won't live another 50 years because when they speak on your condolence everyone will get up and say ""He was loved by all""!' In speaking to Labor colleagues who served in the time of Reg Withers, they do recognise that he was a formidable foe and he was a man who strongly represented the convictions that he held. He gave service to the Royal Australian Navy, to the law, to the Liberal Party, to our parliament and to the City of Perth as mayor. Labor offers our condolences to his family and friends. May he rest in peace.



The SPEAKER:  As a mark of respect, I invite honourable members to rise in their places.

That so much of standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent that Honourable the Leader of the Opposition from moving the following motion immediately.


That this House censures the Prime Minister for:


(1) repeatedly and deliberately misleading the Parliament and the Australian people by promising:


(a) “no cuts to the ABC or SBS” but cutting over $500 million and at least 400 jobs from these organisations;

(g) to build submarines in Australia but going back on this promise; and


(h) no new or increased taxes but ambushing the Australian people with a $2.2 billion petrol tax; and


(2) his dishonest and unfair budget which is hurting Australians.


The Prime Minister stared down the barrel of a camera the night before the election and he promised: 


… no cuts to education, no cuts to health, no change to pensions, no change to the GST and no cuts to the ABC or SBS.


This is why we must suspend standing orders. In question after question in this parliament today, the words of the Prime Minister were put back to him. Did he have the honesty to say: 'I said this'? Not at all. Instead he ran all sorts of disingenuous, dishonest defences.


He said he promised no special treatment. Well, actually, he did. He said, 'no cuts to ABC, no cuts to SBS'. We did not make him say that script. I am sure there are now ministers in the government slapping their hands over their foreheads and saying, 'What on earth was the Prime Minister thinking?' But this is a Prime Minister who was adrift in terms of his own policy. He has no regulators or breaks in terms of what he says and when he says it. He promised no cuts to education, no cuts to health, no changes to pensions, no changes to the GST and no cuts to the ABC or SBS.


This is why we should suspend standing orders: he is cutting half a billion dollars from the ABC. This Prime Minister says, 'It's just waste.' How dare this man say to 400 people that you are just a waste. How dare he say, as he shuts down the ABC radio in Morwell, that that is just a waste—and in Gladstone and in Nowra. This is a Prime Minister who does not know the value of the people who work for the public service of Australia. He has taken over $45 million as a down-payment out of the Australia Network. Then he sent Malcolm Turnbull, a man who spent his adult political life trying to pretend he is different from Tony Abbott—



Opposition members:  Stay! Stay!




Mr SHORTEN:
  Actions speak louder than words for Malcolm Turnbull. 


What we see with the ABC is that the Prime Minister is engaging in an extremist, ruthless right-wing campaign to silence the ABC.



The SPEAKER:  The member for Lalor will go back to her seat or remain silent.




Mr SHORTEN:
  This is a Prime Minister who has no integrity when it comes to keeping his commitments to the Australian people. The reason we believe that standing orders should be suspended to censure this Prime Minister is that it is not just about the cuts to the ABC. What he is seeking to do is lay waste to the moral basis of pluralism and democracy in this country. He is a narrow man and he has no ideology other than extremism.


Look at what they seek to do to our hospitals. In the budget—the document that dare not speak its name, the document that has effectively destroyed the authority of the Treasurer in this parliament once and for all—they say there are no cuts to hospitals. But when you study their budget documents they clearly show that there are massive cuts coming to hospitals. Tony Abbott has now excised the state of Victoria from the Australian Commonwealth—that is why he sends his foreign minister to visit Victoria. And of course his poor old beleaguered Victorian MPs love the petrol tax three weeks out from an Victorian election—another gift from a foreign nation called Tony Abbott! They are going to cut $13 billion from the hospitals of Victoria over the next 10 years. Shame Liberal, shame. 


Then we look at schools. Before the last election the Prime Minister said no cuts. They send out the petition meister, the education minister—I tell you what, if you ever need a cabinet minister, don't ring him, but if you want an ineffective petition, Christopher Pyne is your man. He would actually be hilarious if he were not a cabinet minister. The issue is that they are going to cut billions from schools. 


This is a government that is adrift. They have no domestic policy. The budget indicates their failure to have a plan for Australia. There is no future plan for Australia under this government. They say before the election they support needs based funding. They say before the election that they are the best friends that public schools will ever see. Then, once they get elected, they break their promise. But it does not just stop at hospitals and it does not just stop at schools. 


How about the submarines promise? Who knows what deal this Prime Minister has done with the Prime Minister of Japan and the Americans not to build submarines in Australia? That will come out. But the Prime Minister promised. It does not matter about the shouting from the beleaguered backbench of the government. Late at night, when they pull the doona over their head, in that fearful part of their heart they know that the Prime Minister has led them into a colossal disaster. Why on earth did the Prime Minister lie? This is a Prime Minister who made his reputation, more than any other figure in modern Australian politics, when he tried to crucify Julia Gillard by saying he would not break his promises.



Honourable members interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  There will be silence on both sides!




Mr SHORTEN:
  But there is no Prime Minister who has ever broken so many promises. Look at this smirking fellow—he is so happy with himself. What did he say today? 'I didn't say there'd be special treatment.' He has attacked the media, the ABC, for being wasteful. Who are you to defame so many people in our public broadcaster? 


It is not just the submarines. What about the petrol tax? How many Victorian MPs have asked Tony Abbott to come and open their launches in the state campaign? If there are more than none, I will be amazed. But it is not just that. Then we look at the GST. This is a Prime Minister who has turned his back on all his own views in Battlelines and believing in a strong national government. He is disowning the functions of the federal government, he is turning his back on 50 years of cooperative federalism and he is saying, 'We are going to cut and cut and cut the funding to the states to force them to have a GST debate.' This is a Prime Minister who does not have the courage to advocate his own reforms. I would have more respect not for his ideology but for his policy courage if he would come out and advocate a GST, because that is what he thinks. And Australia knows what he thinks.


Then of course we get to arguably the greatest travesty of this government—the attack on the hopes and dreams of millions of Australian students and their families. Those opposite want to create a two-class Australia and a two-tier education system. What they wish to do to higher education is disgraceful: a 20 per cent cut to the funding of universities, doubling the bond rate of the repayment debts of students who go to university. Listen to the silence now. It speaks volumes. Even those opposite know the truth.


This is a government who deserves to be held to account, and that is why standing orders should be suspended. No cuts to pensions, no cuts to the ABC or SBS, no cuts to hospitals or education, no changes to taxes. This is a government who not only lies to the Australian people, who cheated their way into the election by lying to the Australian people; they now lie about lying. Shame, Prime Minister, shame.

Mr PYNE
 (Sturt—Leader of the House and Minister for Education) (15:07):  I do appreciate the opportunity the Leader of the Opposition has given us to actually talk more generally about the points he has been making.



Opposition members interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The member for Lingiari will remove himself from the chamber under standing order 94(a).




The member for Lingiari then left the chamber.





Mr PYNE:
  This is a very broad motion and I would remind the Leader of the Opposition that at no point during his rambling speech did the government take the general point of order that he was not talking to the suspension of standing orders, so I intend to use this as an opportunity to outline to the House and to the Australian people the realities of the political situation that we found ourselves in 12 months ago.


Twelve months ago, after 2007 to 2013, one of the most rotten governments in Australia history was cut down by the Australian people in a landslide defeat. It was not a fluke. It did not just happen. They did not just fall out of office. It was not by one or two seats or half a per cent. They were beaten and beaten badly, because they had six years of the most grotesque chaos and dysfunction that the Australian public has ever had to tolerate.


Let's go through it. They had a Prime Minister in Kevin Rudd. They went to bed one night with Kevin Rudd as the Prime Minister and they woke up the next morning with Julia Gillard was the Prime Minister. They went to bed one night with Julia Gillard as Prime Minister and the next morning they woke up and Kevin Rudd was Prime Minister again. In a six-year period they managed to knife two Prime Ministers in the back, led by the Leader of the Opposition, 'Bill the knife'. In fact, it was exposed by Paul Kelly in his excellent book, where he wrote: 'The Gillard camp was contemptuous of Shorten, considering him weak and duplicitous'.


The Australian public know that for all of the huffing and puffing, all of the confected outrage from the Leader of the Opposition, he has not at any point said that he would put any of the money back that he claims has been taken from any of the areas of government spending. Whether it is efficiency dividends or whether it is a reduction in the increase in spending, he has not said he will put any of that money back or return things to the state they were in in 2013, because he knows that he cannot.


At the next election, in 2016, the Australian public will be faced with the prospect of electing a weak and duplicitous Leader of the Opposition, who could not stay loyal to one Prime Minister, let alone two Prime Ministers, because he was so ambitious, so ruthless and so relentless in his pursuit of power that he stabbed two Prime Ministers in the back, not just one.


During those six year we had Harry Jenkins stabbed in the back and replaced by Peter Slipper, as the Speaker. We had Craig Thomson defended and supported by this Leader of the Opposition and by Julia Gillard throughout the tawdry period when we were trying to bring Craig Thomson into this House to explain himself. We had the pink batts disaster. We had 'cash for clunkers'. We had $16.5 billion wasted on school halls throughout Australia. We had the live cattle export disaster, based on one television program on Four Corners. The Labor Party thought it was good public policy to destroy the live cattle export industry in Australia, putting 1,000 Indigenous workers out of their jobs, destroying livelihoods, destroying farms and breaking people all across Northern Australia.



Opposition members interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The member for Watson!




Mr PYNE:
  They thought that was good government policy. This particular shadow minister here was the one who brought the great super-trawler to Australia, and when the heat came on he stopped the super-trawler from coming into Australia. He was one of the most dangerous vandals to ever hold office in the cabinet of Australia.


The list goes on. When we took over, in 2013, thanks to the Australian public, we were faced with $123 billion of deficits as far as the eye could see. If we had done nothing at all, our debt would have risen to $667 billion—$123 billion of deficits and $667 billion of debt. That is the legacy that Labor left us.


But it is even worse. It was this Leader of the Opposition who brought the CFMEU back into the cabinet room and gave them a seat at the cabinet table. As the minister for industrial relations, he structured industrial relations in this country so that the CFMEU would be able to bring their thuggery, their standover tactics and their outright criminality to building and construction sites throughout the country, once again, having been forced off them by the Australian Building and Construction Commission, set up by the current Prime Minister many years ago.


The list is endless. They misled Australians on a grand scale. Who can forget the current member for Lilley standing up and announcing the 'three years of surpluses that I deliver tonight', knowing that they were never going to deliver a surplus and having not delivered one since 1989. This is the chaos and dysfunction that greeted us when we took over the Treasury benches in 2013. They mugged the mining industry with the mining tax. They mugged export exposed industries through the carbon tax. They cost households at least $550 a year in the electricity bills. They shut down small businesses reliant on electricity and gas, because of the carbon tax. They did all of these things and not unnaturally the Australian people decided to hand over the reigns of power to the current government.


What did we say? Our commitment was this, and I quote the current Prime Minister: 'This is what a Liberal and National Party government will do. We will build a stronger economy so that everyone can get ahead. Free trade agreements with Korea, China and with Japan. A growing economy with 109,000 jobs, at least, created by this government. We will scrap the carbon tax so that your family will be $550 a year better off.' Done. The carbon tax has been abolished. Labor wants to bring it back. We will get the budget back under control by ending Labor's waste, and that is what we are doing, right across government. No agency, no authority and no department should be immune from trying to be less wasteful and spend taxpayers money as well as they possibly can. The government's money is not sitting in the Treasury somewhere, belonging to the government; it belongs to the Australian people, Madam Speaker, and we should never waste one dollar—let alone never apply an efficiency dividend—to an authority that has a $6.9 billion dollar budget over the next five years—for 20 years. The ABC had no efficiency dividend for 20 years. We will stop the boats—tick; we have certainly stopped the boats. This shadow minister, again, said it could not be done. The Left said: 'It is not possible. It is impossible to stop the boats.' What has happened? In the last 12 months, while the Minister for Immigration has been at the helm, the boats have stopped. The children are getting out of detention. We are closing detention centres, whether it is at Curtin or whether it is at Inverbrackie. The Australian public are not stupid, Madam Speaker. They see all these things. They certainly listen to the static that goes on in this place and elsewhere—but they know in their heart of hearts that the government is delivering on its promises.


The Prime Minister also said, 'and we will build the roads of the 21st century'—and that is exactly what we have done; we have started the process, having picked up the broken infrastructure portfolio from the current member for Grayndler. We are getting things done. They were good at announcing things, Madam Speaker. They were good at photo opportunities, although it did not save them. But the current minister for transport and infrastructure is actually getting the work done—to make sure that there are bulldozers moving, and that there are sods being turned on roads infrastructure—whether it is the North-South Corridor in South Australia or the East West Link in Victoria, this government knows that we have to get things done to create jobs and to create growth.


The fundamental difference between us and Labor and the Greens is that we do not just play politics every day; what we do, as cabinet minsters and as members of this government, is every day we think: 'How will we get more jobs flowing into our electorates? How do we get more growth in the economy? How do we repair the damage done by Labor, so that business can create jobs?' That is what we on this side of the House do. We did it in the Menzies era, we did it in the Fraser era, we did it in the Howard era, and we will do it again in the Abbott era. All Labor does is think every day, 'How can we play politics? How can we play politics with people's lives? How can we play politics with household budgets? How can we play politics with big developments like the Olympic Dam in South Australia? How can we give the unions more power and control, so they keep voting for us in preselection?' The fundamental difference between this side of the House and the opposition is this: we care about the Australian public, and they care about the Australian Labor Party. So we will keep doing what we are doing. We will keep governing for the betterment of Australia, and I am absolutely confident that at the next election, the Australian public will support us.

"Clare, Jason, MP",ALP,2014-11-24,"



Mr CLARE
 (Blaxland) (15:17):  There is an old 1957 movie called Witness for the Prosecution, where Charles Laughton plays a crusty old barrister called Sir Wilfrid, and in cross-examination he says to the witness, 'Were you lying then, are you lying now, or are you just a chronic and habitual liar?' Well, Madam Speaker, that is what the Australian people are now asking about this Prime Minster. Put him on a lie detector and it would blow up—because he has broken so many promises. He broke his promise that there would be no cuts to health. He said that there would be no cuts to education—broken. He said there would be no changes to the pension—broken as well. And he said there would be no cuts to the ABC, and no cuts to SBS—so many broken promises.


It is so bad that this is now an issue of trust. People are wondering if they really can trust this Prime Minister. He has become the thing that he once so despised. Remember: this is the man who ran around the country for three years, screaming about broken promises, and saying some things that deserve repeating. He said things like this: 'What I want to do is re-establish the bonds of trust that should exist between government and the people.' So he says all of that—and then he gets into government and breaks every promise he ever made. Hollywood could not make this sort of stuff up. It is like Jekyll and Hyde. I sometimes think he must have amnesia, because by making all these promises and then breaking them, he has shredded his credibility. People trusted this Prime Minister. They might have had their doubts, but they put their faith in him. They trusted him. I do not think they will again.


People do not like it when politicians lie to them, but there is something they hate even more than that. They hate it when people lie about lying—and that is what we have seen in the last few weeks. Last week we had the finance minister, Senator Cormann, say, 'there are no cuts'. And then today, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Eric Abetz, said, 'nobody has lost their job'. Well, hang on a second; last week they announced hundreds of millions of dollars worth of cuts to the ABC, and today we find out that up to 400 people are going to lose their jobs. So what is the Liberal party's new strategy here? Is it the Jedi mind trick? What is going on here?


Then you have Minister Turnbull—



An opposition member:  He is not even in the chamber!




Mr CLARE:
 Minister Turnbull is not here. Or, as I like to call him, the new Dennis Denuto of the Australian parliament—because his answer to this broken promise last week was, 'It is all the context. It is all the context.' It is getting ridiculous. It reminds me of that old Bill Clinton story about when he takes his old dog, Buddy, to the vet. He takes his dog to the vet to get desexed, and the vet says, 'don't worry, I will fix him.' And Bill Clinton says, 'that is not a fix; that is a cut.' And we know that this is not a fix; this is a cut, and it is a broken promise, made even more ridiculous by old 'Pontius Pilate' Pyne over there, who cannot fight for the ABC in the cabinet room—he has to put up a petition. And then you have Barnaby barnstorming around the country saying, 'no cuts to the ABC in the bush', and Malcolm Turnbull saying: 'It will all be back-office. Don't worry about that.' Well, today we learned there will be cuts to five regional radio stations; we will lose the 7.30 state editions, Lateline will go to ABC News 24, foreign bureaus will be cut, there will be less sport on the ABC, and 400 people will get the sack—that is why people are angry. They do not like being lied to and they do not like their government lying about lying. That is why people right across this country are thinking the same thing that Charles Laughton said in that old movie: were you lying then, are you lying now, or are you just a chronic and habitual liar?



The SPEAKER:  The question is that the motion be agreed to.




Mr Abbott:
  I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.

Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Leader of the Opposition) (14:57):  I move:



That so much of standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent that Honourable the Leader of the Opposition from moving the following motion immediately.


That this House censures the Prime Minister for:


(1) repeatedly and deliberately misleading the Parliament and the Australian people by promising:


(a) “no cuts to the ABC or SBS” but cutting over $500 million and at least 400 jobs from these organisations;


(b) before the election “no cuts to education” and “no cuts to health” but cutting $80 billion from schools and hospitals;

(g) to build submarines in Australia but going back on this promise; and


(h) no new or increased taxes but ambushing the Australian people with a $2.2 billion petrol tax; and


(2) his dishonest and unfair budget which is hurting Australians.


The Prime Minister stared down the barrel of a camera the night before the election and he promised: 


… no cuts to education, no cuts to health, no change to pensions, no change to the GST and no cuts to the ABC or SBS.


This is why we must suspend standing orders. In question after question in this parliament today, the words of the Prime Minister were put back to him. Did he have the honesty to say: 'I said this'? Not at all. Instead he ran all sorts of disingenuous, dishonest defences.


He said he promised no special treatment. Well, actually, he did. He said, 'no cuts to ABC, no cuts to SBS'. We did not make him say that script. I am sure there are now ministers in the government slapping their hands over their foreheads and saying, 'What on earth was the Prime Minister thinking?' But this is a Prime Minister who was adrift in terms of his own policy. He has no regulators or breaks in terms of what he says and when he says it. He promised no cuts to education, no cuts to health, no changes to pensions, no changes to the GST and no cuts to the ABC or SBS.


This is why we should suspend standing orders: he is cutting half a billion dollars from the ABC. This Prime Minister says, 'It's just waste.' How dare this man say to 400 people that you are just a waste. How dare he say, as he shuts down the ABC radio in Morwell, that that is just a waste—and in Gladstone and in Nowra. This is a Prime Minister who does not know the value of the people who work for the public service of Australia. He has taken over $45 million as a down-payment out of the Australia Network. Then he sent Malcolm Turnbull, a man who spent his adult political life trying to pretend he is different from Tony Abbott—



Opposition members:  Stay! Stay!




Mr SHORTEN:
  Actions speak louder than words for Malcolm Turnbull. 


What we see with the ABC is that the Prime Minister is engaging in an extremist, ruthless right-wing campaign to silence the ABC.



The SPEAKER:  The member for Lalor will go back to her seat or remain silent.




Mr SHORTEN:
  This is a Prime Minister who has no integrity when it comes to keeping his commitments to the Australian people. The reason we believe that standing orders should be suspended to censure this Prime Minister is that it is not just about the cuts to the ABC. What he is seeking to do is lay waste to the moral basis of pluralism and democracy in this country. He is a narrow man and he has no ideology other than extremism.


Look at what they seek to do to our hospitals. In the budget—the document that dare not speak its name, the document that has effectively destroyed the authority of the Treasurer in this parliament once and for all—they say there are no cuts to hospitals. But when you study their budget documents they clearly show that there are massive cuts coming to hospitals. Tony Abbott has now excised the state of Victoria from the Australian Commonwealth—that is why he sends his foreign minister to visit Victoria. And of course his poor old beleaguered Victorian MPs love the petrol tax three weeks out from an Victorian election—another gift from a foreign nation called Tony Abbott! They are going to cut $13 billion from the hospitals of Victoria over the next 10 years. Shame Liberal, shame. 


Then we look at schools. Before the last election the Prime Minister said no cuts. They send out the petition meister, the education minister—I tell you what, if you ever need a cabinet minister, don't ring him, but if you want an ineffective petition, Christopher Pyne is your man. He would actually be hilarious if he were not a cabinet minister. The issue is that they are going to cut billions from schools. 


This is a government that is adrift. They have no domestic policy. The budget indicates their failure to have a plan for Australia. There is no future plan for Australia under this government. They say before the election they support needs based funding. They say before the election that they are the best friends that public schools will ever see. Then, once they get elected, they break their promise. But it does not just stop at hospitals and it does not just stop at schools. 


How about the submarines promise? Who knows what deal this Prime Minister has done with the Prime Minister of Japan and the Americans not to build submarines in Australia? That will come out. But the Prime Minister promised. It does not matter about the shouting from the beleaguered backbench of the government. Late at night, when they pull the doona over their head, in that fearful part of their heart they know that the Prime Minister has led them into a colossal disaster. Why on earth did the Prime Minister lie? This is a Prime Minister who made his reputation, more than any other figure in modern Australian politics, when he tried to crucify Julia Gillard by saying he would not break his promises.



Honourable members interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  There will be silence on both sides!




Mr SHORTEN:
  But there is no Prime Minister who has ever broken so many promises. Look at this smirking fellow—he is so happy with himself. What did he say today? 'I didn't say there'd be special treatment.' He has attacked the media, the ABC, for being wasteful. Who are you to defame so many people in our public broadcaster? 


It is not just the submarines. What about the petrol tax? How many Victorian MPs have asked Tony Abbott to come and open their launches in the state campaign? If there are more than none, I will be amazed. But it is not just that. Then we look at the GST. This is a Prime Minister who has turned his back on all his own views in Battlelines and believing in a strong national government. He is disowning the functions of the federal government, he is turning his back on 50 years of cooperative federalism and he is saying, 'We are going to cut and cut and cut the funding to the states to force them to have a GST debate.' This is a Prime Minister who does not have the courage to advocate his own reforms. I would have more respect not for his ideology but for his policy courage if he would come out and advocate a GST, because that is what he thinks. And Australia knows what he thinks.


Then of course we get to arguably the greatest travesty of this government—the attack on the hopes and dreams of millions of Australian students and their families. Those opposite want to create a two-class Australia and a two-tier education system. What they wish to do to higher education is disgraceful: a 20 per cent cut to the funding of universities, doubling the bond rate of the repayment debts of students who go to university. Listen to the silence now. It speaks volumes. Even those opposite know the truth.


This is a government who deserves to be held to account, and that is why standing orders should be suspended. No cuts to pensions, no cuts to the ABC or SBS, no cuts to hospitals or education, no changes to taxes. This is a government who not only lies to the Australian people, who cheated their way into the election by lying to the Australian people; they now lie about lying. Shame, Prime Minister, shame.

 (Blaxland) (15:17):  There is an old 1957 movie called Witness for the Prosecution, where Charles Laughton plays a crusty old barrister called Sir Wilfrid, and in cross-examination he says to the witness, 'Were you lying then, are you lying now, or are you just a chronic and habitual liar?' Well, Madam Speaker, that is what the Australian people are now asking about this Prime Minster. Put him on a lie detector and it would blow up—because he has broken so many promises. He broke his promise that there would be no cuts to health. He said that there would be no cuts to education—broken. He said there would be no changes to the pension—broken as well. And he said there would be no cuts to the ABC, and no cuts to SBS—so many broken promises.


It is so bad that this is now an issue of trust. People are wondering if they really can trust this Prime Minister. He has become the thing that he once so despised. Remember: this is the man who ran around the country for three years, screaming about broken promises, and saying some things that deserve repeating. He said things like this: 'What I want to do is re-establish the bonds of trust that should exist between government and the people.' So he says all of that—and then he gets into government and breaks every promise he ever made. Hollywood could not make this sort of stuff up. It is like Jekyll and Hyde. I sometimes think he must have amnesia, because by making all these promises and then breaking them, he has shredded his credibility. People trusted this Prime Minister. They might have had their doubts, but they put their faith in him. They trusted him. I do not think they will again.


People do not like it when politicians lie to them, but there is something they hate even more than that. They hate it when people lie about lying—and that is what we have seen in the last few weeks. Last week we had the finance minister, Senator Cormann, say, 'there are no cuts'. And then today, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Eric Abetz, said, 'nobody has lost their job'. Well, hang on a second; last week they announced hundreds of millions of dollars worth of cuts to the ABC, and today we find out that up to 400 people are going to lose their jobs. So what is the Liberal party's new strategy here? Is it the Jedi mind trick? What is going on here?


Then you have Minister Turnbull—



An opposition member:  He is not even in the chamber!




Mr CLARE:
 Minister Turnbull is not here. Or, as I like to call him, the new Dennis Denuto of the Australian parliament—because his answer to this broken promise last week was, 'It is all the context. It is all the context.' It is getting ridiculous. It reminds me of that old Bill Clinton story about when he takes his old dog, Buddy, to the vet. He takes his dog to the vet to get desexed, and the vet says, 'don't worry, I will fix him.' And Bill Clinton says, 'that is not a fix; that is a cut.' And we know that this is not a fix; this is a cut, and it is a broken promise, made even more ridiculous by old 'Pontius Pilate' Pyne over there, who cannot fight for the ABC in the cabinet room—he has to put up a petition. And then you have Barnaby barnstorming around the country saying, 'no cuts to the ABC in the bush', and Malcolm Turnbull saying: 'It will all be back-office. Don't worry about that.' Well, today we learned there will be cuts to five regional radio stations; we will lose the 7.30 state editions, Lateline will go to ABC News 24, foreign bureaus will be cut, there will be less sport on the ABC, and 400 people will get the sack—that is why people are angry. They do not like being lied to and they do not like their government lying about lying. That is why people right across this country are thinking the same thing that Charles Laughton said in that old movie: were you lying then, are you lying now, or are you just a chronic and habitual liar?



The SPEAKER:  The question is that the motion be agreed to.




Mr Abbott:
  I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.

Mr ROBB
 (Goldstein—Minister for Trade and Investment) (15:36):  by leave—It is with great pleasure that I table the first protocol to amend the agreement establishing the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Area, AANZFTA, and the accompanying national interest analysis for the parliament's consideration. I signed the first protocol along with ministers from each of the other 11 AANZFTA parties in Nay Pyi Taw, Burma, on 26 August this year, at the time of the ASEAN economic ministers' closer economic relations trade ministers consultations. In accordance with the government’s treaty-making procedures, the parliament's Joint Standing Committee on Treaties will now review the first protocol and, in due course, provide its report. The tabling of the first protocol today will also give the public the opportunity to scrutinise in detail the provisions of the treaty.


The first protocol will cut down the time spent by business on paperwork and, in a number of areas, make AANZFTA more consistent with Australia’s other free trade agreements. It will remove the need for business to provide certain information—which some regard as commercial-in-confidence—to obtain the benefits of the free trade agreement. The first protocol will simplify the presentation of the agreement’s rules of origin and bring them into line with the current version of the World Customs Organization’s harmonized system. Finally, the protocol will improve the process for administering the agreement.


This protocol makes doing business under the AANZFTA easier. It means more businesses will be able to access the opportunities the agreement provides. This is another example of the government cutting red tape to ensure our businesses reap the full benefits of our free trade agreements. This is a priority for the government. With the recent conclusion of trade agreements with Korea, Japan and now China, I am committed to ensuring our farmers, service providers and manufacturers can fully access the new opportunities these agreements create.


The protocol is an example of how our free trade agreements are living agreements. The conclusion of free trade negotiations is not an end. It is the start of a new discussion with our trade and investment partners, built on the foundation of the agreement, on increasing economic opportunities and on addressing persistent trade barriers. The China FTA, for example, includes a commitment to reopen negotiations on sensitive agricultural products in three years. The Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement establishes an annual joint committee meeting to review implementation of the agreement and recommend amendments. The government will use these agreements to continue to create new market openings for Australian exporters and investors.


The protocol also reflects Australia’s long history of working with both New Zealand and the nations of South-East Asia to promote trade. This year we celebrate the 40th anniversary of ASEAN-Australia relations, with Australia having become ASEAN’s first dialogue partner in 1974.


The AANZFTA agreement is the largest free trade agreement Australia currently has in force.  Together, the parties to AANZFTA accounted for around 14 per cent of Australia’s exports of goods and services, valued at over $45 billion, and around 21 per cent of our imports of goods and services, valued at over $69 billion, in 2013. In 2013, almost 20,000 export shipments from all parts of Australia used the FTA to access AANZFTA markets.  These shipments covered a broad range of products, including dairy and meat products, fresh fruit, cereals, biscuits and other food preparations, pet food, chemicals, plastics, copper and aluminium products, paper products, automotive parts and accessories and scientific instruments. 


AANZFTA opened the door for Australia’s participation in the negotiations on a Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. This involves all ten ASEAN member states and the six countries with which ASEAN has free trade agreements: China, India, Japan and Korea as well as Australia and New Zealand.


The protocol amending AANZFTA will reduce red tape for business and make it easier for business to access AANZFTA benefits. It demonstrates the ongoing value of FTAs as vehicles for continuing to open new trade and investment markets and demonstrates the government’s strong commitment to making free trade agreements business friendly. 


I commend this agreement to parliament and hereby table the First Protocol to Amend the Agreement Establishing the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Area with its national interest analysis. I present a copy of the First Protocol to Amend the Agreement Establishing the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Area and the national interest analysis, and a copy of my ministerial statement.


I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the honourable the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to speak for five minutes.


Leave granted.

"Plibersek, Tanya, MP",ALP,2014-11-24,"



Ms PLIBERSEK
 (Sydney—Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (15:42):  On behalf of the opposition, I welcome the tabling of the signed First Protocol to Amend the Agreement Establishing the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Area and the accompanying national interest analysis. The ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Area agreement is a trade liberalisation agreement between 12 countries in the South-East Asia region—namely, Australia, New Zealand, Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. The agreement is still acknowledged today as the most ambitious free trade agreement negotiated by Australia. It was signed on 27 February 2009 by former Labor trade minister Simon Crean. Since its coming into effect on 1 January 2010, trade between Australia, ASEAN and New Zealand has continued to flourish. In 2013, the parties to this regional free trade agreement accounted for 17.6 per cent of Australian two-way trade in goods and services. The amendments agreed to in this first protocol will further enhance and promote this trade. This protocol aims to reduce red tape and increase harmonisation. Such aims will translate into trade efficiencies for our exporters and increased growth.


The protocol aims to facilitate trade by incorporating the consolidated product-specific rules, using the most recent version of the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System. This system is an international system first established in 1983, pursuant to the International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System, commonly referred to as the harmonised system, or HS, code. This system is maintained by the World Customs Organization. Australia signed on to this trade-facilitating international convention during the period of the Hawke Labor government. Australia has continued to seek uniformity in its subsequent trade agreements by utilising the HS system.


Labor welcomes this amendment as well as others made by this first protocol that are aimed at facilitating trade by addressing administrative requirements and implementation issues. These include the removal of the requirement to reflect sensitive commercial information on the free-on-board value in the certificate of origin in cases where the regional value content criteria is not used. Other amendments include simplifying the presentation of the agreement's rules-of-origin provision.


Continuing to increase trade security and cultural relations in our South-East Asia region is crucial for Australia's future prosperity. Forty years ago, under the visionary stewardship of Australia's former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam, Australia became ASEAN's first dialogue partner. In 2012 Labor Prime Minister Julia Gillard tabled a comprehensive road map for Australia in the form of the white paper Australia in the Asian century. It is a shame that the intellectual rigor underpinning the long-term goals of that white paper have been archived by the current government.


The regional trading relationship reflected in the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand free trade area has been successful for Australia and its partners. It has also served as a springboard to wider and deeper regional multilateral trade. As stated by the Minister for Trade and Investment, it was the ASEAN member states that initiated negotiations on the regional comprehensive economic partnership. Former trade minister Dr Craig Emerson participated in the formal launch of the regional comprehensive economic partnership negotiations in November 2012 at the ASEAN summit in Cambodia. Labor has since participated in subsequent negotiation rounds, and we support the government's efforts to make progress on this multilateral trade agreement. In addition, we urge the government to focus its trade negotiations on the more efficient and effective multilateral negotiations in priority of bilateral agreements.


Finally, I would like to acknowledge that trade facilitation measures that make trade easier and more consistent, such as those effected in the first protocol, are not considered controversial and are welcomed by business. I urge the government to properly build on these enhancements in a global context. The WTO's trade facilitation agreement, concluded for Australia by Dr Emerson in Bali in December last year, was a breakthrough on the Doha Round. Prompt implementation of this agreement was a key priority recommendation by the B20 at the recent G20 summit.


We urge the government to proactively work with other WTO members to quickly get this agreement back on track. We can assure the government of Labor's strong bipartisan support on this WTO agreement which will lift economic growth and jobs. Labor welcomes the tabling of the AANZFTA first protocol. We encourage business to become familiar with the terms of the protocol and to make submissions to the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties during the committee's inquiry on the protocol.

"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2014-11-24,"



Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR
 (Gorton) (20:29):  I rise to oppose the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment Bill 2014. This bill, if enacted, will directly and indirectly risk the workplace health and safety of Australian workers. It will also remove the rights of Australian workers to fair and reasonable cover when they suffer the misfortune of a work related illness or injury. The coalition, I contend, did not consult regarding these changes and these changes were not flagged by the coalition prior to it gaining government. This bill did not form any part of their election policy, therefore there is no mandate for this bill. This bill has no sound policy justification whatsoever. In fact, it undermines all the existing workers compensation schemes in Australia. This is an ill-conceived bill that ignores the founding principles of Australian workers compensation schemes and why they were established in the first place.


The main purpose of any workers compensation scheme is to prevent work related illness and injury from occurring in the first place. The secondary purpose is to provide adequate benefits to assist and compensate those workers who are unfortunately injured or ill as a result of their work. This bill does the opposite. As a consequence of the proposed legislation there will be workers—who want nothing more than to earn a dignified living—who will in future bear the full brunt of work injuries for life without any assistance from a workers compensation scheme. We will see an unequal and unfair system where two employees—working side-by-side, with different employers—who suffer similar injuries will have different workers compensation rights and different health and safety standards applied to them. The worker who is covered by Comcare will have less rights and less health and safety oversight and protection.


The proposed legislation takes away the rights of injured workers and then provides that companies, on a national basis, should be allowed to exit state workers compensation schemes—to stop paying premiums to state schemes and instead to self-insure and pay licence fees to Comcare. Some companies may be enticed by the chance to save money, with further savings to be had from a further step proposed by the bill: namely, to remove the jurisdiction of the states to regulate health and safety in relation to any Comcare licensee. Workers compensation schemes, however, are designed to provide a safety net for workers injured in workplace accidents, not as a business model to reduce costs for employers.


The government argues this bill might, if enacted, save a bit of money. However, the opposite is true: it will create huge costs by effectively creating high-risk gaps in health and safety monitoring in this country. If the government has any support for this bill, it seems the supporters have gone very quiet. On the other hand, opponents of the bill come from across the country and have been remarkably open in expressing their views. The opponents of the bill have clearly articulated the negative consequences of this bill and warned of the risks associated with the national expansion of the Comcare scheme. This is a government that does not listen, not even to their own conservative state and territory counterparts—their own mates; indeed, Deputy Speaker Griggs, they do not even listen to the government of the state in which you reside.


It is important that all members of this place, including coalition members, are aware of the problem this legislation would create. They should listen to the following critique. In a submission to the recent Senate inquiry on this bill, the Queensland government said it has:


 … the potential to lead to increased red tape, increased costs and reduced productivity resulting from duplication and overlap in the regulation of work health and safety arrangements.


The Queensland government's own submission goes on to say:


 … small businesses may not be in a position to absorb premium fluctuations from a reduced premium pool.


The Queensland government's submission also raises concerns about the enforcement of work health and safety laws, particularly in high-risk industries such as mining, where Comcare has no history or expertise in regulating the sector. I remind the House: this is the Campbell Newman-led Queensland government. The Queensland government, however, is not alone in being ignored by the Abbott government when raising the very significant consequences of the bill—significant consequences not just for workers but for small- to medium-sized businesses too. I wonder whether the Minister for Small Business had a decent look at this bill; it would appear not. An extract of the submission on the bill by the Northern Territory government to the Senate inquiry says the following:


It is difficult to estimate how many employers would pursue an option to participate in the Comcare scheme but the potential consequence could be:


withdrawal of insurers;


loss of competition;


increased premiums for employers;


loss of jobs for insurance industry workers;


loss of employment and career opportunities;


impact on other businesses who supply services; and


the loss of an NT based claim service for injured workers.


Why would the coalition ignore the clearly articulated and very serious policy concerns put forward from so many parts of Australia, including state and Territory governments and conservative governments? It is because, in many ways, this proposed legislation demonstrates what the coalition stands for. This legislation strikes a blow to potentially all Australian workers, and it hits the most vulnerable and the disadvantaged the hardest. The blow really hits its mark when a worker is injured.


It has become increasingly apparent that taking away vital support and protection for vulnerable and injured workers is what the coalition represents. Indeed, we have seen this assault on vulnerable Australians before; we saw it writ large when the Treasurer sought to hand down a budget. Currently, if I can return to the bill, workers under a state scheme who are injured during recess or who have undertaken an abnormal risk of injury or who have died or become permanently incapacitated and are alleged to be at fault for the accident would receive (1) the ongoing payment of the reasonable cost of medical treatment, (2) income replacement for periods of incapacity for work, (3) payment of a lump sum for permanent impairment, (4) support to participate in rehabilitation programs, (5) in the case of a tragic loss of life, death benefits for dependent family and (6) access to the common law in cases of employer negligence. If an injured worker were to come under Comcare in future, if this bill were enacted, they would be denied all of these things that I have just outlined. In aid of a meagre saving for big companies, injured workers and their families will bear inestimable financial and emotional costs and hardship by being excluded from workers' compensation benefits. 


There are three new additional exclusionary provisions in the proposed legislation, which would not just leave sick and injured working Australians and their families worse off but would drive them into poverty—seemingly something the Abbott government is insistent on doing to all disadvantaged groups in our country. I will take each of the proposed exclusionary provisions and explain why Labor opposes them and why we believe the Senate should oppose them too. The first is off-site recess breaks. This bill proposes the reintroduction of an exclusion from eligibility for compensation during recess breaks. The current act provides that an employee is covered if temporarily absent from work during an ordinary recess. This new bill proposes to repeal this protection and instead to reinsert a new clause modelled on the Howard government provisions. The government in its explanatory memorandum cites the South Australian scheme in support of the removal of recess break coverage, which coincidentally is perhaps the only workers' compensation scheme in the country that is currently challenged financially, more so than even Comcare. The government fails to mention that all other major Australian workers' compensation schemes—New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia—provide cover for off-site recess breaks. In fact, all Australian workers' compensation schemes currently cover injuries during recess breaks except for South Australia. When the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act was first enacted in 1988 by the then Hawke Labor government, establishing the current Comcare scheme, it provided compensation for workers who were temporarily absent from their place of employment during an ordinary recess.


In 2007, under John Howard's loathed and thoroughly repudiated Work Choices regime, off-site recess claims were removed from the scheme. In 2011, Labor was able to restore this protection to provide coverage to injured workers under Comcare on a similar footing as provided to the vast majority of the Australian workforce. Unfortunately, in line with what this government stands for, the bill now proposes to again remove off-site recess break cover from Comcare—yet another way in which this government seeks to turn its back on Australian workers, make them more vulnerable and indeed look for the lowest common denominator when it comes to affording protection to the Australian workforce. The regulation impact statement tabled with the bill states that this may save Comcare licensees $850,000 per annum. It appears savings would be spread across 31 licensees, including some of Australia's richest corporations—Telstra, Optus, the Commonwealth Bank and so on. 


What the government will not tell you, and what they do not want you to know, is that these savings for these companies will be directly paid for by injured workers who will no longer be protected. To justify this unfair measure the minister in his explanatory memorandum has provided a misleading 'illustrative example' designed to provoke sympathy for the removal of off-site recess cover. This example is so out of touch it is bizarre—a mythical construction worker who goes surfing at lunchtime and gets injured. This is just to suit the government's conclusion and is not the real experience of Australian tradespeople, police or nurses, let alone construction workers on a 30- or 45-minute lunch break.


The second provision I refer to is the exclusion of deceased and the seriously and permanently impaired workers as result of wilful misconduct. This provision is truly appalling. This change would see the removal of protection and compensation in cases of 'death or serious and permanent impairment' in cases where 'wilful misconduct' may be alleged. This is perhaps the most gratuitously nasty proposal in the bill because the government acknowledge negligible savings from this measure in its regulation impact statement. There are no individuals, I would contend, no organisations that we know of, that have called for this change. It is just the Abbott government's own thought bubble—a very nasty provision if enacted. To quote from the regulation impact statement:


The potential impact of this amendment in cost savings to licensees and premium payers in claim costs or premiums is expected to be negligible as the cases under this provision are rare.


Rare they may be, but the consequences for those involved if those allegations were to be accepted as possible or fact could be devastating. It is already the case that most jurisdictions have exclusionary provisions that set out circumstances in which workers' compensation will be denied for physical injuries. An injury or disease that is solely attributed to serious and wilful misconduct or is deliberately or wilfully self-inflicted are typical exclusionary provisions in most schemes. However, in the case of death or significant/serious and permanent incapacity, Australian workers' compensation schemes have for more than a century made an exception in cases of deceased workers and significantly and permanently incapacitated workers and provided them and their families with protection. Currently, all Australian workers' compensation schemes provide benefits to deceased and seriously and permanently impaired workers irrespective of serious and wilful misconduct—alleged or real. The Law Council of Australia in its presentation to the Senate inquiry on 20 June this year provided this historical point of significant when they said:


That [this] provision has in fact been a feature of the Commonwealth compensation laws right back to the first … Commonwealth Compensation Act 1912—Section 4(2) (b) of that Act.


The evidence of the Law Council continues:


We think there is great value in consistency when it has in fact been the [current] policy of the Commonwealth and remains the policy of every other jurisdiction.


Amendment of this provision also contradicts the purpose of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act, being a no-fault workers compensation scheme. If the bill proceeds, Comcare will be the only workers compensation scheme in Australia to exclude deceased and seriously incapacitated workers from receiving assistance.


The third new exclusionary provision in this bill is 'voluntary assumption of abnormal risk'. Currently under Comcare, a worker who 'voluntarily and unreasonably submits to an abnormal risk of injury' will be denied compensation if the injury is suffered during an ordinary recess—that is, in circumstances where they have not sustained the injuries whilst undertaking their usual employment duties. This legislation proposes that an exclusion from compensation should apply when the worker is at their usual place of employment during their usual working hours. The government's explanatory memorandum and regulation impact statement do not explain the rationale for this measure or estimate savings.


This change is being proposed with so little explanation, it is almost as if the government were hoping that the parliament wouldn't notice. What is or is not a voluntary assumption of abnormal risk when undertaking work duties would, if this bill is enacted, be the subject of endless and costly dispute. There is no protection for vulnerable workers who are asked or directed to do dangerous tasks by their co-workers or for the young worker or the older worker afraid of losing their job. There is also no protection for people in hazardous professions—for police, for nurses, for workers who respond throughout the day and are exposed to risk but must perform tasks to ensure the health, safety and wellbeing of others.


Labor agrees that the Comcare scheme is in need of reform. We need to make the scheme fairer for the injured workers it was designed to protect. However, this bill is not reform, it is a series of exclusions from compensation that will make Comcare an anomaly in Australia for the harsh and unjust way that it would treat injured and deceased workers. If the coalition has its way, if this bill is enacted, many workers will no longer have any support from the Commonwealth workers compensation scheme, support of a kind that has existed for workers in this country since the Commonwealth Workmen's Compensation Act 1912.


A further concern that Labor has with this bill is the proposed national expansion of Comcare. Comcare, I would contend, is not equipped or designed to cope with the expansion that is being proposed by the Abbott government. With only 44 health and safety inspectors to cover the breadth of the nation, Comcare does not have the regulatory capacity to cope with an increase in licensees.


We know there are all types of costs associated with making public policy, but the government, by bowing to the economic interests of big business in this instance, has not considered the economic impacts of injury, disability and death in this legislation. It is of great importance to people in this place who care about good policy and good and co-operative Commonwealth-state relations that this bill should not pass. These proposed changes will undermine the financial viability of state and territory workers compensation schemes, with the rising costs of those schemes falling to employers—mainly the small to medium sized businesses that remain in them.


The coalition, in its search for the love of big business, is ignoring the cost of opening up the Comcare scheme upon small to medium sized businesses. They like to call themselves the government for small business. Well, if enacted, this bill would hurt small business. The reduced premium pool in state workers compensation systems means increasing premiums for remaining businesses in those schemes and will put pressure on workers' entitlements.


The businesses left behind will be small to medium sized businesses, mum and dad businesses that do not have the time to apply for a self-insurance licence. Those covered by state workers compensation schemes will be disadvantaged by a loss of critical rights under the Comcare scheme, particularly the lack of common law protection. Their benefits will also be calculated through a scheme that is based around risks of injury that occur in non-blue collar industries.


Employers who choose Comcare will not have to comply with state health and safety laws, including specialised arrangements in high-risk industries such as the mining industry. The proposed amendments abolish the jurisdiction of state health and safety regulators in relation to Comcare self-insurers that obtain a licence under the Commonwealth act. Can the government assure Australians that workplaces will be as safe as they are now if this bill passes? They cannot. State based schemes each have hundreds of inspectors working to ensure workplaces meet safety requirements; Comcare has 44 inspectors nationwide. Compliance obligations under Comcare are weaker than the state systems, Comcare offers lower payments to injured workers and Comcare's capacity to inspect workplaces and enforce laws will reduce further as more businesses gain coverage.


Labor is concerned that Comcare could be open to abuse by employers whose business is in one state or territory because the definition of 'national employer' does not specify a minimum number of employees required in a particular Australian jurisdiction. For example, a company whose location is in Queensland but who offers a Sydney office with one employee would be determined as a national employer. Self-insurance will be open to abuse by employers who do not wish to assist injured members of their workforce as Comcare is not equipped to monitor performance or hold self-insurers to account on a national scale if they do not meet obligations to assist injured workers to return to work. What is also concerning for workers is that an employer moving to Comcare automatically removes from their workers the rights provided by state jurisdictions. Most workers are not likely to learn they have lost rights until they are injured.


In conclusion, Labor will not support this bill because, if enacted, it will create confusion, anomalies and unfairness. The bill will cause injured workers to lose rights and benefits they would otherwise receive under state schemes. The bill will weaken and create gaps in health and safety protection. The bill re-introduces three unfair and unnecessary exclusions to injured workers accessing workers' compensation. On the government's own analysis, any savings the bill will offer for business are small at best. In comparison to the price that would be paid by injured workers and their families if the bill was to pass, the savings are next to nothing. Labor opposes the bill.

Mrs McNAMARA
 (Dobell) (20:52):  I rise to support the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment Bill 2014. The bill implements a range of measures in line with the government's red-tape reduction program to reduce the cost of the regulatory burden on business. This government is committed to reducing red tape, thereby increasing productivity for Australian business. As part of the red-tape reduction program, the government is expanding the Commonwealth workers compensation and work, health and safety scheme, Comcare, to national employers meeting self-insurance criteria. The recommendations enacted by the bill anticipate a total reduction of regulatory burden for eligible corporations transferring to the Comcare scheme averaging $35 million each year over the next 10 years.


The bill implements recommendations in line with the 2013 Hanks review of the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988, which governs the Comcare scheme. The SRC Act establishes the statutory framework for workers compensation in the Commonwealth jurisdiction and for eligible corporations to self-insure under the scheme. The bill seeks to amend the SRC Act and the Work, Health and Safety Act 2011, inter alia, to expand the eligibility of corporations to self-insure through Comcare. The amendments remove the requirement for the minister to declare a corporation to be eligible to be granted a licence for self-insurance, while maintaining the ability for the minister to issue directions to the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission. This will streamline the current two-stage approval process; remove the outdated requirement that a corporation must be in competition with a Commonwealth authority or a former Commonwealth authority to make application to self-insure under the Comcare scheme; broaden the range of eligible corporations to self-insure under the Comcare scheme to 'national employers', which is defined as an employer that is required to meet workers compensation obligations under the laws of two or more jurisdictions; enable the commission to grant group licences to related corporations; extend the coverage provisions of the WHS Act to those corporations that obtain a licence to self-insure under the act; and exclude access to workers compensation where injuries occur during recess breaks away from an employer's premises or where a person engages in serious and wilful misconduct, even if the injury results in death or serious and permanent impairment.


Prior to 2007, certain employers had the option to self-insure for workers compensation coverage through the Commonwealth's Comcare scheme. In December 2007, the Rudd Labor government imposed a moratorium on new entrants to self-insure under Comcare. This was despite evidence from the Productivity Commission's 2004 inquiry into national workers compensation and occupational health and safety frameworks, which found that the cost for multistate employers insuring with multiple compensation schemes was considerable. The moratorium was announced subject to a wide-ranging review of the Comcare scheme by the federal government in consultation with the various state and territory governments and employer and employee groups. In 2008 this review produced 19 recommendations from the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations. The review also included a report by Taylor Fry actuaries and included consideration of the Productivity Commission's 2004 report. In 2009, the Labor government announced a number of changes, including a continuation of the moratorium and, contrary to DEEWR's recommendation, reinstated compensation for off-site recess breaks. Two key recommendations that the government of the time ignored were eligibility to self-insure under Comcare and journey claims. The Hanks review of the SRC Act, released in March 2013, included over 100 recommendations for substantial changes to the scheme, including the lifting of the moratorium. On 2 December 2013, the coalition government lifted the moratorium.


Self-insurance allows an employer to underwrite their own risk. Self-insurers are responsible for the payment of their claim liabilities and for the management of those claims. Self-insurance relieves an employer from accepting a workers compensation policy under respective workers compensation jurisdictional schemes. The bill introduces the concept of a national employer test. This test will provide corporations operating in two or more states or territories the opportunity to be a national employer under the Comcare scheme. Such a corporation, assuming that it satisfies requirements within the act, will be able to obtain a self-insurance licence, bringing all of its employees under a single workers compensation jurisdiction. The SRCC will still determine eligibility for a corporation to become a self-insurer. Concurrent amendments to the WHS Act ensure that the corporation's employees are also brought under a single work, health and safety scheme.


The 2004 Productivity Commission inquiry found that multistate employers faced increased costs of compliance, sometimes amounting to millions of dollars a year, as a result of workers compensation coverage and work, health and safety obligations in multiple jurisdictions. The amendments in the bill are important productivity reforms which are critical for multistate employers. They will provide these employers with the option of continuing to operate under multilayered workers compensation and work, health and safety regimes or to apply to have one set of national arrangements. Multistate employers have always faced challenges in regard to determining correct workers compensation coverage, particularly in determining the state of connection. The lack of national consensus when it comes to state of connection continues to present confusion and uncertainty for these employers. The option for corporations currently covered by workers compensation systems in two or more states or territories to apply to join the Comcare scheme removes this uncertainty. There are significant advantages in being able to operate within one workers compensation framework. Foremost, savings in regard to compliance are likely to be a significant motivation for self-insuring in the Comcare environment, as opposed to self-insuring in multiple jurisdictions. The costs of complying with up to eight separate regulatory frameworks is a significant burden, particularly as each regulator imposes its own set of licensing criteria, reporting arrangements and standards. Corporations self-insuring in multiple jurisdictions are required to comply with prudential requirements as specified by each jurisdiction in which they self-insure. This involves considerable cost replications in meeting financial capability requirements, bank guarantees, security deposits and reinsurance policies to secure claims liabilities. For example, each bank guarantee requires a separate actuarial report with different requirements set by each jurisdiction, and there are numerous differences within jurisdictions in taking out a reinsurance policy.

"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2014-11-24,"



Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR
 (Gorton) (20:29):  I rise to oppose the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment Bill 2014. This bill, if enacted, will directly and indirectly risk the workplace health and safety of Australian workers. It will also remove the rights of Australian workers to fair and reasonable cover when they suffer the misfortune of a work related illness or injury. The coalition, I contend, did not consult regarding these changes and these changes were not flagged by the coalition prior to it gaining government. This bill did not form any part of their election policy, therefore there is no mandate for this bill. This bill has no sound policy justification whatsoever. In fact, it undermines all the existing workers compensation schemes in Australia. This is an ill-conceived bill that ignores the founding principles of Australian workers compensation schemes and why they were established in the first place.


The main purpose of any workers compensation scheme is to prevent work related illness and injury from occurring in the first place. The secondary purpose is to provide adequate benefits to assist and compensate those workers who are unfortunately injured or ill as a result of their work. This bill does the opposite. As a consequence of the proposed legislation there will be workers—who want nothing more than to earn a dignified living—who will in future bear the full brunt of work injuries for life without any assistance from a workers compensation scheme. We will see an unequal and unfair system where two employees—working side-by-side, with different employers—who suffer similar injuries will have different workers compensation rights and different health and safety standards applied to them. The worker who is covered by Comcare will have less rights and less health and safety oversight and protection.


The proposed legislation takes away the rights of injured workers and then provides that companies, on a national basis, should be allowed to exit state workers compensation schemes—to stop paying premiums to state schemes and instead to self-insure and pay licence fees to Comcare. Some companies may be enticed by the chance to save money, with further savings to be had from a further step proposed by the bill: namely, to remove the jurisdiction of the states to regulate health and safety in relation to any Comcare licensee. Workers compensation schemes, however, are designed to provide a safety net for workers injured in workplace accidents, not as a business model to reduce costs for employers.


The government argues this bill might, if enacted, save a bit of money. However, the opposite is true: it will create huge costs by effectively creating high-risk gaps in health and safety monitoring in this country. If the government has any support for this bill, it seems the supporters have gone very quiet. On the other hand, opponents of the bill come from across the country and have been remarkably open in expressing their views. The opponents of the bill have clearly articulated the negative consequences of this bill and warned of the risks associated with the national expansion of the Comcare scheme. This is a government that does not listen, not even to their own conservative state and territory counterparts—their own mates; indeed, Deputy Speaker Griggs, they do not even listen to the government of the state in which you reside.


It is important that all members of this place, including coalition members, are aware of the problem this legislation would create. They should listen to the following critique. In a submission to the recent Senate inquiry on this bill, the Queensland government said it has:


 … the potential to lead to increased red tape, increased costs and reduced productivity resulting from duplication and overlap in the regulation of work health and safety arrangements.


The Queensland government's own submission goes on to say:


 … small businesses may not be in a position to absorb premium fluctuations from a reduced premium pool.


The Queensland government's submission also raises concerns about the enforcement of work health and safety laws, particularly in high-risk industries such as mining, where Comcare has no history or expertise in regulating the sector. I remind the House: this is the Campbell Newman-led Queensland government. The Queensland government, however, is not alone in being ignored by the Abbott government when raising the very significant consequences of the bill—significant consequences not just for workers but for small- to medium-sized businesses too. I wonder whether the Minister for Small Business had a decent look at this bill; it would appear not. An extract of the submission on the bill by the Northern Territory government to the Senate inquiry says the following:


It is difficult to estimate how many employers would pursue an option to participate in the Comcare scheme but the potential consequence could be:


withdrawal of insurers;


loss of competition;


increased premiums for employers;


loss of jobs for insurance industry workers;


loss of employment and career opportunities;


impact on other businesses who supply services; and


the loss of an NT based claim service for injured workers.


Why would the coalition ignore the clearly articulated and very serious policy concerns put forward from so many parts of Australia, including state and Territory governments and conservative governments? It is because, in many ways, this proposed legislation demonstrates what the coalition stands for. This legislation strikes a blow to potentially all Australian workers, and it hits the most vulnerable and the disadvantaged the hardest. The blow really hits its mark when a worker is injured.


It has become increasingly apparent that taking away vital support and protection for vulnerable and injured workers is what the coalition represents. Indeed, we have seen this assault on vulnerable Australians before; we saw it writ large when the Treasurer sought to hand down a budget. Currently, if I can return to the bill, workers under a state scheme who are injured during recess or who have undertaken an abnormal risk of injury or who have died or become permanently incapacitated and are alleged to be at fault for the accident would receive (1) the ongoing payment of the reasonable cost of medical treatment, (2) income replacement for periods of incapacity for work, (3) payment of a lump sum for permanent impairment, (4) support to participate in rehabilitation programs, (5) in the case of a tragic loss of life, death benefits for dependent family and (6) access to the common law in cases of employer negligence. If an injured worker were to come under Comcare in future, if this bill were enacted, they would be denied all of these things that I have just outlined. In aid of a meagre saving for big companies, injured workers and their families will bear inestimable financial and emotional costs and hardship by being excluded from workers' compensation benefits. 


There are three new additional exclusionary provisions in the proposed legislation, which would not just leave sick and injured working Australians and their families worse off but would drive them into poverty—seemingly something the Abbott government is insistent on doing to all disadvantaged groups in our country. I will take each of the proposed exclusionary provisions and explain why Labor opposes them and why we believe the Senate should oppose them too. The first is off-site recess breaks. This bill proposes the reintroduction of an exclusion from eligibility for compensation during recess breaks. The current act provides that an employee is covered if temporarily absent from work during an ordinary recess. This new bill proposes to repeal this protection and instead to reinsert a new clause modelled on the Howard government provisions. The government in its explanatory memorandum cites the South Australian scheme in support of the removal of recess break coverage, which coincidentally is perhaps the only workers' compensation scheme in the country that is currently challenged financially, more so than even Comcare. The government fails to mention that all other major Australian workers' compensation schemes—New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia—provide cover for off-site recess breaks. In fact, all Australian workers' compensation schemes currently cover injuries during recess breaks except for South Australia. When the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act was first enacted in 1988 by the then Hawke Labor government, establishing the current Comcare scheme, it provided compensation for workers who were temporarily absent from their place of employment during an ordinary recess.


In 2007, under John Howard's loathed and thoroughly repudiated Work Choices regime, off-site recess claims were removed from the scheme. In 2011, Labor was able to restore this protection to provide coverage to injured workers under Comcare on a similar footing as provided to the vast majority of the Australian workforce. Unfortunately, in line with what this government stands for, the bill now proposes to again remove off-site recess break cover from Comcare—yet another way in which this government seeks to turn its back on Australian workers, make them more vulnerable and indeed look for the lowest common denominator when it comes to affording protection to the Australian workforce. The regulation impact statement tabled with the bill states that this may save Comcare licensees $850,000 per annum. It appears savings would be spread across 31 licensees, including some of Australia's richest corporations—Telstra, Optus, the Commonwealth Bank and so on. 


What the government will not tell you, and what they do not want you to know, is that these savings for these companies will be directly paid for by injured workers who will no longer be protected. To justify this unfair measure the minister in his explanatory memorandum has provided a misleading 'illustrative example' designed to provoke sympathy for the removal of off-site recess cover. This example is so out of touch it is bizarre—a mythical construction worker who goes surfing at lunchtime and gets injured. This is just to suit the government's conclusion and is not the real experience of Australian tradespeople, police or nurses, let alone construction workers on a 30- or 45-minute lunch break.


The second provision I refer to is the exclusion of deceased and the seriously and permanently impaired workers as result of wilful misconduct. This provision is truly appalling. This change would see the removal of protection and compensation in cases of 'death or serious and permanent impairment' in cases where 'wilful misconduct' may be alleged. This is perhaps the most gratuitously nasty proposal in the bill because the government acknowledge negligible savings from this measure in its regulation impact statement. There are no individuals, I would contend, no organisations that we know of, that have called for this change. It is just the Abbott government's own thought bubble—a very nasty provision if enacted. To quote from the regulation impact statement:


The potential impact of this amendment in cost savings to licensees and premium payers in claim costs or premiums is expected to be negligible as the cases under this provision are rare.


Rare they may be, but the consequences for those involved if those allegations were to be accepted as possible or fact could be devastating. It is already the case that most jurisdictions have exclusionary provisions that set out circumstances in which workers' compensation will be denied for physical injuries. An injury or disease that is solely attributed to serious and wilful misconduct or is deliberately or wilfully self-inflicted are typical exclusionary provisions in most schemes. However, in the case of death or significant/serious and permanent incapacity, Australian workers' compensation schemes have for more than a century made an exception in cases of deceased workers and significantly and permanently incapacitated workers and provided them and their families with protection. Currently, all Australian workers' compensation schemes provide benefits to deceased and seriously and permanently impaired workers irrespective of serious and wilful misconduct—alleged or real. The Law Council of Australia in its presentation to the Senate inquiry on 20 June this year provided this historical point of significant when they said:


That [this] provision has in fact been a feature of the Commonwealth compensation laws right back to the first … Commonwealth Compensation Act 1912—Section 4(2) (b) of that Act.


The evidence of the Law Council continues:


We think there is great value in consistency when it has in fact been the [current] policy of the Commonwealth and remains the policy of every other jurisdiction.


Amendment of this provision also contradicts the purpose of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act, being a no-fault workers compensation scheme. If the bill proceeds, Comcare will be the only workers compensation scheme in Australia to exclude deceased and seriously incapacitated workers from receiving assistance.


The third new exclusionary provision in this bill is 'voluntary assumption of abnormal risk'. Currently under Comcare, a worker who 'voluntarily and unreasonably submits to an abnormal risk of injury' will be denied compensation if the injury is suffered during an ordinary recess—that is, in circumstances where they have not sustained the injuries whilst undertaking their usual employment duties. This legislation proposes that an exclusion from compensation should apply when the worker is at their usual place of employment during their usual working hours. The government's explanatory memorandum and regulation impact statement do not explain the rationale for this measure or estimate savings.


This change is being proposed with so little explanation, it is almost as if the government were hoping that the parliament wouldn't notice. What is or is not a voluntary assumption of abnormal risk when undertaking work duties would, if this bill is enacted, be the subject of endless and costly dispute. There is no protection for vulnerable workers who are asked or directed to do dangerous tasks by their co-workers or for the young worker or the older worker afraid of losing their job. There is also no protection for people in hazardous professions—for police, for nurses, for workers who respond throughout the day and are exposed to risk but must perform tasks to ensure the health, safety and wellbeing of others.


Labor agrees that the Comcare scheme is in need of reform. We need to make the scheme fairer for the injured workers it was designed to protect. However, this bill is not reform, it is a series of exclusions from compensation that will make Comcare an anomaly in Australia for the harsh and unjust way that it would treat injured and deceased workers. If the coalition has its way, if this bill is enacted, many workers will no longer have any support from the Commonwealth workers compensation scheme, support of a kind that has existed for workers in this country since the Commonwealth Workmen's Compensation Act 1912.


A further concern that Labor has with this bill is the proposed national expansion of Comcare. Comcare, I would contend, is not equipped or designed to cope with the expansion that is being proposed by the Abbott government. With only 44 health and safety inspectors to cover the breadth of the nation, Comcare does not have the regulatory capacity to cope with an increase in licensees.


We know there are all types of costs associated with making public policy, but the government, by bowing to the economic interests of big business in this instance, has not considered the economic impacts of injury, disability and death in this legislation. It is of great importance to people in this place who care about good policy and good and co-operative Commonwealth-state relations that this bill should not pass. These proposed changes will undermine the financial viability of state and territory workers compensation schemes, with the rising costs of those schemes falling to employers—mainly the small to medium sized businesses that remain in them.


The coalition, in its search for the love of big business, is ignoring the cost of opening up the Comcare scheme upon small to medium sized businesses. They like to call themselves the government for small business. Well, if enacted, this bill would hurt small business. The reduced premium pool in state workers compensation systems means increasing premiums for remaining businesses in those schemes and will put pressure on workers' entitlements.


The businesses left behind will be small to medium sized businesses, mum and dad businesses that do not have the time to apply for a self-insurance licence. Those covered by state workers compensation schemes will be disadvantaged by a loss of critical rights under the Comcare scheme, particularly the lack of common law protection. Their benefits will also be calculated through a scheme that is based around risks of injury that occur in non-blue collar industries.


Employers who choose Comcare will not have to comply with state health and safety laws, including specialised arrangements in high-risk industries such as the mining industry. The proposed amendments abolish the jurisdiction of state health and safety regulators in relation to Comcare self-insurers that obtain a licence under the Commonwealth act. Can the government assure Australians that workplaces will be as safe as they are now if this bill passes? They cannot. State based schemes each have hundreds of inspectors working to ensure workplaces meet safety requirements; Comcare has 44 inspectors nationwide. Compliance obligations under Comcare are weaker than the state systems, Comcare offers lower payments to injured workers and Comcare's capacity to inspect workplaces and enforce laws will reduce further as more businesses gain coverage.


Labor is concerned that Comcare could be open to abuse by employers whose business is in one state or territory because the definition of 'national employer' does not specify a minimum number of employees required in a particular Australian jurisdiction. For example, a company whose location is in Queensland but who offers a Sydney office with one employee would be determined as a national employer. Self-insurance will be open to abuse by employers who do not wish to assist injured members of their workforce as Comcare is not equipped to monitor performance or hold self-insurers to account on a national scale if they do not meet obligations to assist injured workers to return to work. What is also concerning for workers is that an employer moving to Comcare automatically removes from their workers the rights provided by state jurisdictions. Most workers are not likely to learn they have lost rights until they are injured.


In conclusion, Labor will not support this bill because, if enacted, it will create confusion, anomalies and unfairness. The bill will cause injured workers to lose rights and benefits they would otherwise receive under state schemes. The bill will weaken and create gaps in health and safety protection. The bill re-introduces three unfair and unnecessary exclusions to injured workers accessing workers' compensation. On the government's own analysis, any savings the bill will offer for business are small at best. In comparison to the price that would be paid by injured workers and their families if the bill was to pass, the savings are next to nothing. Labor opposes the bill.

 (Dobell) (20:52):  I rise to support the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment Bill 2014.

"Conroy, Pat, MP",ALP,2014-11-24,"



Mr CONROY
 (Charlton) (21:00):  The Newcastle Herald, in conjunction with Macquarie University, has recently conducted lead-level testing in and around homes near the old lead smelter in Boolaroo—130 soil and vacuum cleaner dust samples were taken from homes, parks, sporting fields and schools in the suburbs of Boolaroo, Speers Point, Argenton and Teralba. They found more than half of the public spaces and all but one of the 19 homes tested recorded higher than acceptable lead levels. For example, a sample from an oval in Speers Point contained 17,500 parts per million of lead, almost 300 per cent above the safe level. Two soil samples from Boolaroo Public School's playground exceeded the Australian standard by 300 per cent, and a sample taken outside Speers Point Public School was eight times over the limit.


Obviously, this is cause for concern for those living in the immediate vicinity, but it is also an issue for the broader Lake Macquarie region as we continue to deal with the environmental legacy of our industrial past. The Cockle Creek lead smelter was in operation for over 100 years, and the surrounding township was born from the employment the 'sulphide corporation' offered. But, of course, throughout its life span, the smelter also emitted hundreds of tonnes of pollution. It produced an abundance of sulphide slag which was used as a landscaping material across the region, and it discharged effluent into Cockle Creek which flowed into Lake Macquarie.


There is no known safe level of lead exposure, but we do know that the impact of lead toxicity is particularly harmful for young children. Our understanding of the health impacts of this kind of pollution have developed over recent decades. So, too, have measures to prevent or respond to the threat posed to nearby communities by the smelter and its operations. These include: blood testing of employees and, later, children in the area; the creation of a buffer zone around the smelter and the acquisition of a number of properties within it; and targeted remediation in homes where children were found to have excessively high blood lead levels, such as recarpeting, soil works and dust extraction from ceiling cavities.


However, it is the success of the most recent works that are called into question by the Newcastle Herald's study. In 2002, the Environmental Protection Agency issued a remediation order on then smelter owners Pasminco. Their response was a remediation action plan which included the collection of slag materials and for contaminated soils to be housed in a buried cell on site. A lead abatement strategy was also put in place which gave nearby home owners the option of soil removal and top dressing in order to lower lead levels. However, unlike the old plant site, removal of soil to the depth of contamination was not a requirement.


Both projects are now complete. Residential land on the former smelter site is now selling and the commercial zone is developing. Major road works, also provided by the administrator, are nearing completion. But, as the Newcastle Herald's report suggests, if the remediation works have failed or have caused higher lead levels in surrounding areas, it must be addressed immediately.


The New South Wales government, through the EPA, is obliged to ensure the conditions of its remediation order are adhered to. It is not appropriate to expect an administrator, whose main role is to seek outcomes for creditors, to ensure the community's safety. It is likewise not appropriate to expect a newspaper and a university to monitor the effectiveness of a major project such as this. Putting aside the limited resources of both, it is a basic tenet of our democracy to expect government to have the capability and the motivation to conduct the most thorough assessments when it comes to our environment and public health.


If further testing of lead levels is required, this must be done immediately. If reduction works are required, a plan must be put in place without delay. Whilst details are limited at this stage, the announcement of further blood testing for children in the area is welcome, and I await those results. If there is cause for the establishment of a fund to deal with the contamination, I will be the first to lead the charge to ensure the government responds accordingly. If there are changes to federal government legislation required to help in this case or to avoid a repeat of this case, I will be at the forefront of a campaign for those. But the first step is a thorough assessment, performed by the body established to do precisely that—and I call on the New South Wales government to respond in this way immediately.


Governments are now aware of the liability issues around lead smelters and other polluting industries, but this was not the case in the past. We must ensure that, on the one hand, governments of all levels learn from these incidents and impose thorough restrictions when assessing the viability of a development, existing or proposed. But we must ensure that the validity of these decisions cannot be undermined by the lack of one very simple principle: what is in the best interest of the community.

Hon. BC Scott
) (10:31):  Before I invite honourable members to make constituency statements, I wish to provide a status report on progress with physical enhancements of this Federation Chamber. All members will recall that, in the last sitting period on 22 September, I made a brief statement in relation to the 20th anniversary of the Federation Chamber and foreshadowed some physical enhancements to improve its facility and authority. I am pleased to report that several of these enhancements are now in place. In additions to the screens displaying captions about proceedings, there is improved signage at the main north-east chamber entrance, a redesigned desk for the Deputy Speaker and the clerks, a central table to accommodate chamber documents and purpose-built lecterns in the front row of members' seats—which I warmly encourage members to use. They have been designed so there are no chairs in front of them, enhancing the lecterns and giving the speaker's words to the chamber greater authority. A new coat of arms, enhanced lighting and some artwork are anticipated in the future. 


A number of routine maintenance matters have also been addressed. I am sure honourable members will agree that the chamber looks very sound and fresh. In closing, I would like to thank the staff of the office of the Serjeant-at-Arms and of the Department of Parliamentary Services for all their efforts in progressing this enhancement project. I am sure they will contribute to the continuing successful operation of this Federation Chamber. Many other parliaments around the world have now adopted the principle behind the Federation Chamber, which has now been successful for 20 years.

Mr SWAN
 (Lilley) (10:32):  Since its election last year, this government has waged an ideological war on climate change. At every opportunity it has threatened any real action against climate change, so much so that we had the extraordinary statement from the Treasurer on Insiders last Sunday week that climate change was not an economic issue. Now we have a war against the renewable energy target and against the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. You cannot hope to be a first-class economy in the 21st century unless you are substantially powered by renewable energy—yet the coalition are waging an ideological war against the renewable energy target.


The RET commits Australian to producing 41,000 gigawatt hours of electricity through renewable energy sources by 2020. It was supposed to be a bipartisan commitment, going back to 2001—and certainly back to 2008. Now it is threatened. It was always set as an absolute amount for a very good reason: to give certainty to industry to make the investments. But the Treasurer hates even the sight of wind farms. He has a personal hatred of a part of the renewable energy sector and he is taking that out on the investors in renewable energy right across this country—because he cannot stand seeing the wind farms as he drives from the northern suburbs of Sydney to Canberra. He cannot stand looking at them, so we have to be rid of the renewable energy target. We have to target all the investors in renewable energy in this country because of the ideological sickness of this government, which does not even accept the very basics of the science of climate change.


That is even before you get to the war that has been waged on the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, an incredibly professional body which this government has done everything in its power to attack and to try to close down. It is now even trying to force a new mandate on that corporation to sabotage the very good work it is doing with investors right across this country. If there were ever an example of where the Liberals have demonstrated just how ignorant they are of the economics of this country—and most particularly the economics of climate change—it is in their ideological attack on climate change, their attack on the renewable energy target and their attack on the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. The RET and the CEFC are all about encouraging long-term investment in renewable energy so that in the 21st century we can be a country which is substantially driven by renewable energy, but the coalition are trying to get rid of them. They deny the science and they deny the importance of climate change to our economy, demonstrating yet again what economic Luddites they are.

Ms RYAN
 (Lalor—Opposition Whip) (11:02):  I move:


That this House:


(1) notes the:


(a)   Government's 2014-15 budget contains the biggest ever cut to schools, leaving classrooms across the country $30 billion worse off over the next decade;


(b)   Government has failed to fund the vital fifth and sixth years of the Gonski reforms and has opened the door to state and territory cuts by promising not to enforce their obligations under the Gonski agreements;


(c)   Government has restricted school funding changes to the Consumer Price Index from 2018; and


(d)   importance of equity and quality—for every child in every school—in improving student results and building a prosperous future; and


(2) calls on the Government to recognise the Commonwealth's role in funding schools by:


(a)   keeping its commitment to honour the signed Gonski agreements; and


(b)   reversing its $30 billion cut to schools.


I move this motion because we on this side will not cede to those opposite and their winding back the notion of commitment to education, winding back hard work, developed over a long-term review, to create equity in our school education system.


We are in the last two weeks of parliament for this year, and for me it is critical that, prior to the school term ending, I raise again the issue of the cuts, the dramatic cuts, that this government has made to education. The dramatic cuts that we saw in the 2014 budget were the biggest ever cut to schools, leaving classrooms across the country $30 billion worse off over the next decade.


We all remember broken promises—there has been a lot of talk this week about one broken promise about the ABC. I remember, very clearly, several promises that were made before the election that gave us a Liberal government. I remember promises from our Prime Minister Abbott and from Minister Pyne—promises that there would be no cuts to schools and promises that there would be a unity ticket on education. These promises were made after enormous publicity about the Gonski review and the Gonski reforms that were being implemented by the previous Labor government. They promised a unity ticket. Prime Minister Abbott said clearly, 'Your school will get the same.' Well, it is a broken promise, because that is not what is happening on the ground across the states in this nation. They said they were committed to the Gonski funding for six years, and the first thing they did on getting into government was say, 'Oh, sorry; we meant four years.' You did not mean four years; you meant six years. It was a clear promise to every family in this country that you were as committed as the previous Labor government to making sure that every child in this country got the best education they could have. You made a clear promise that you believed in equity. You made a clear promise that you believed in fairness and would support fairness in our school system, and then we got to the budget and you ripped $30 billion out of education across this nation—$30 billion. And you did this by indexing education funding to the CPI from 2018—no mention of that prior to the election. This is a clear broken promise.


You cut the strings to the states. You cut Gonski in half. You clearly said to the states at that point that the Gonski plan was that we would make a contribution and the states would commit to increasing their funding model from their coffers, joined with the national coffers, and we would go forward to the best education system in the world. We would go forward to equity. But what did you do? The first thing you did when you came into government was cut those strings and let the states off the hook. So your actions say that you do not believe that education is important—that you do not understand how fundamentally important education is for the prosperity of this nation going forward. An educated population will give us the economic advantage going forward. You have shown that you are not committed to that, that you are not committed to needs-based funding and that you are not committed to ensuring disability funding in our schools. These are the things that we are very, very clear on.


I know, because in Victoria it is school awards season, and I am sure parliamentarians across the country are in their schools giving out awards and being invited to graduation nights for grade 6s and year 12s. I know that what I am hearing in Victoria and what I am seeing on the ground is that, under a Napthine Liberal government, there is no transparency. Principals do not know where their Gonski money is. It is their first question. 'Joanne, where is the Gonski money?' they ask in Victoria, because they cannot see it.


Then we go to Queensland, and we show that, a week after the budget, analysis in Queensland showed that, over the period 2014-15 to 2024-25, there will be approximately $6 billion less funding available for Queensland schools under the new arrangement with the Abbott government. Approximately $2.7 billion less funding will be available for the Queensland government school sector. (Time expired)

"Van Manen, Bert, MP",LP,2014-11-24,"



Mr VAN MANEN
 (Forde) (11:08):  It is always a pleasure to rise and speak in this House about school funding, because I can assure the member opposite that we firmly believe in funding our schools appropriately. It is interesting to note that, as the mover of this motion, she has not even stayed around to listen to this contribution, which may help educate those opposite somewhat on what is really happening in the school funding space.


Let us first of all clarify a few misconceptions. The money that the member opposite was talking about was never, ever anywhere budgeted for. It was never, ever budgeted for. Explain to your constituents that budgets operate on four-year cycles, and that is what the money is budgeted for. The reality of the fact is that this government has honoured the remaining three years of the funding commitments in the previous Labor government's budget, bringing it to a total of four years. So we have honoured our election commitments that we would match that funding commitment. What we have done is after that—and this shows the complete hypocrisy of those opposite, because they have never said where this extra money is going to come from; never, ever have they budgeted for that.


It is interesting to note that the ABC's Fact Check—not the greatest friend of the coalition government, I must admit—investigated these so-called cuts, and in their verdict they found that we have not cut $30 billion from schools in the May budget.



An honourable member interjecting—




Mr VAN MANEN:
  No, they don't. The previous Labor government, as I said before, never, ever budgeted for years 5 and 6 of the Gonski funding. It does not appear in their budget papers anywhere. We never saw an explanation of how they were going to fund those supposed increases. It is as good as waving around a bunch of Monopoly money, because they never agreed that they would fund it.


In contrast, we have exceeded the commitment to maintain Commonwealth school funding for the next four years, from 2013-14 to 2017-18, with the record amount of $64.5 billion. This represents a 37.4 per cent increase to all schools from 2013-14 to 2017-18. Within that increase, there is $1.2 billion more than the previous Labor government had, because we had to reinstate funding to Western Australia, the Northern Territory and my home state of Queensland. Queensland will now receive the largest share of this $1.2 billion extra funding—some $794 million of additional funding—and this has been acknowledged by the Queensland government. I know from talking to the state schools in my electorate that have received the benefits from this that they are in the order of more than $3 million that they would never have got if the previous Labor government had been re-elected.


In total, Commonwealth funding to all schools in Queensland will increase by some 46.8 per cent through 2013-14 to 2017-18. If Queensland were left with the funding that Labor gave them, they would be worse off to the tune of $795 million. Unlike the previous Labor government, we have a plan for years 5 and 6, but there will be no cuts. The funding will continue to grow from 2018 by CPI in addition to student enrolment growth in our schools.


Long-term Commonwealth past and projected spending on all schools shows a continued increase. I would make those opposite aware of this graph, which does not show any cuts anywhere. It continues to grow and continues to increase.


In addition to that, it is not only about funding for our education system. Despite the fact that funding has increased each and every year since 2008-09, our PISA results continue to fall behind. The government are focused on doing what we need to do to ensure that we have a quality education system by putting students first, improving teacher quality, increasing school autonomy, engaging parents in education and strengthening the curriculum. Let us not pretend that the coalition government is not providing growth in education or putting students first. We are committed to making a real difference to students.

"Conroy, Pat, MP",ALP,2014-11-24,"



Mr CONROY
 (Charlton) (11:13):  I am proud to participate in this debate about schools funding. I want to pick up something that the last speaker said before I go to my substantive contribution, and that is around this mythical $1.2 billion in new funding. I say 'mythical' because the Department of Education has confirmed that it is not new funding. It is existing funding reallocated. It is existing funding: $950 million cut from trade training centres and $450 million from a cut to outside-school-hours care. So all they have done is juggle figures within the Department of Education's budget to provide it. Yet again, it shows that the government are only interested in paying lip-service to fair funding for our schools.


The truth is that Gonski revolutionised the federal government's role in funding education. It provided fair funding for every school, equality for every student and targeted resources based on need, including loadings for small schools, remote schools, disadvantaged students, Indigenous students, students with limited English and students with disability. Schools in my electorate of Charlton would have massively benefited from this, partly because four of the six loadings are very common in Charlton and, might I say, very common in neighbouring electorates such as that of the member for Shortland. The truth is that, according to figures from expert sources, my electorate of Charlton would have received $73.5 million in additional funding between 2013 and 2019 because of the Gonski reforms. A few examples of that include: $4.3 million to Morisset High School, $4.8 million to Toronto High School, $2.4 million to Wallsend South Public School and $860,000 to Garden Suburb Public School. The local Catholic schools would also have massively benefited.


This is all gone because of this government's treachery and lies; all gone because this mean and tricky government said one thing before the election and has gone back on its word. You saw the then shadow minister for education say before the election:


… you can vote Liberal or Labor and you'll get exactly the same amount of funding for your school—


absolutely untrue. The media release also said:


… your funding is certain. The Coalition will match Labor dollar-for-dollar over the next four years.


All completely untrue; all mendacious; all a betrayal of the Australian people. Do not just take my word for it—that is, the impact on my region will be massive; even the New South Wales coalition education minister acknowledges that. Adrian Piccoli said on 14 May:


Schools in regional areas, as well as disadvantaged and Aboriginal students, will be the hardest hit.


When the coalition state governments are criticising the federal government's cuts, you know they must be deep and hard. What is even worse is untying the funding. The member for Lalor talked about how, by not making it a condition that states maintain and increase their funding, all federal funding does is give an excuse for state governments to pull money back, and we saw this with the WA government pulling money out of its system. What is even worse is the Department of Education acknowledge they did absolutely no analysis of the impact on Australia's education system of this $30 billion of budget cuts that are contained in the budget papers.


This is a massive tragedy. This is a tragedy of epic proportions. We should be investing more in education, giving every student in this country the best start in life and giving funding to students based on their need and not on their postcode. This government are not doing that. Governing is all about choices: you can cut $30 billion from education but provide $63 billion over the next decade for a ridiculous paid parental leave scheme—a scheme that would give $50,000 to women in the seats of North Sydney and Warringah who have babies, whereas women in my seat of Charlton would be lucky to receive $20,000. They have got $63 billion for their paid parental leave boondoggle, but they cannot stump up the $30 billion to maintain their real commitment to Gonski.


When we look back at this period of history we will see the coalition has done a reverse Menzies. One of the key reasons Labor were unable to win elections in the fifties and the sixties was because we were mired in a petty sectarian struggle over federal funding for Catholic schools. We were on the wrong side of history. Well, I would submit that the current government are well and truly on the wrong side of history now because not only are they saying no to needs-based funding for schools they are also saying that the federal government's role in education funding should be limited to supporting wealthy private schools and not state schools or systemic Catholic schools. I am confident that this will be condemned by the public when they get the next opportunity. I am confident that the coalition and their mean and tricky cuts that prevent Gonski will put them well and truly on the wrong side of history, and I well and truly condemn them. I will stand up for the $73 million of extra funding for Charlton schools that would have occurred through a true commitment to Gonski funding.

Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (11:18):  It is very disappointing to have to walk into this chamber and address this most appalling and misleading motion from the member for Lalor. All it does is perpetuate a complete hoax. It actually shows every reason why this Labor opposition are completely unfit to ever sit on the Treasury benches of this country again.


This motion refers to the 'biggest cuts'. Let us go through the facts and look at what is actually happening to school expenditure in this country: this year there is an 8.7 per cent increase; next year it is 8.9 per cent; the year after, it is another 8.9 per cent; and the year after that it is 6.6 per cent. If this government runs its three years, then in the last budget it will hand down it will be a 37.4 per cent increase—and this mob walk in here and claim that is a cut! We know that they have simply failed remedial maths at school: 37.4 per cent more money is going to spending on schools. And you know what? I come from a public school background in New South Wales; and for New South Wales public schools, it is even better. This year, the amount for New South Wales public schools is 10.2 per cent; the year after, 10.6 per cent; the year after that, another 14.4 per cent; and the year after that, 7.2 per cent. In fact, in the next four years, New South Wales non-government schools will get close to 50 per cent more in government funding. This government, in our last budget, will be giving 50 per cent more money to New South Wales public schools than this previous mob opposite did, and they come in here and have the hide to perpetuate this myth that there are somehow cuts to funding. It is simply an absolute hoax.


I had a discussion with someone from the teachers federation about this hoax. I said, 'Can you explain to me why this Gonski funding is back loaded in years 5 and 6? She scratched said and said she did not have a clue. But we know why it is. It is because our forward estimates period are in a four-year cycle. So if you put expenditures in years 5 and 6, you do not have to show where the money is coming from. And that is what this mob opposite have done—a complete hoax. They are perpetuating a hoax on the schools of Australia. They are perpetuating a hoax on the teachers and the parents and, worst of all, they are perpetuating a hoax on children of this country.


We know they believe in magic-pudding economics. But we have to ask: where will this so-called mythical $30 billion come from? I will tell you where it could have come from. If we had not have had the six years of reckless, wasteful and politically motivated spending from this mob opposite, we would not have that interest bill that we have to pay. If we go back six years, we never had to pay interest as a Commonwealth government. We were actually receiving $1 billion a year. But after six years of reckless and wasteful spending from this mob, we now have to find 13½ billion dollars every single year—that is, over $1 billion every month that we have to cut that could have otherwise gone to schools because of this mob's reckless spending, waste and the mismanagement of this country. And those opposite come back into this parliament and carry on about cuts to expenditure. What an absolute disgrace.


It is about time those opposite put our country first ahead of their own political interests and started talking about how we can do best with the limited funding we have. And remember, that limited funding for public schools in New South Wales will be 50 per cent more. We need to encourage our kids and tell them about the great future that they have in this country. We need to talking up those free-trade agreements that we have just signed with China and we have just signed with Korea and we have just signed with Japan. We should be talking to them about the opportunities they have from the growing economy of India. That is what we should talking about. We should be giving incentive to our kids. We should be having entrepreneurial studies as one of the most important things we do instead of this nonsense we have of sustainability—teaching them low growth. We can throw all of the money we want at schools but unless the kids have the motivation to study, that money is wasted. This is an appalling motion. It is an absolute hoax and it should be condemned.

"Claydon, Sharon, MP",ALP,2014-11-24,"



Ms CLAYDON
 (Newcastle) (11:23):  I rise to join with my colleagues, the member for Lalor and the member for Charlton today in calling on the Abbott Liberal government to do what they in fact promised to do before they were elected. In August last year the now Education Minister and Prime Minister has stood next to each other and pledged with hand on heart that you could vote for Liberal or Labor and you will get exactly the same amount of funding for your school. They declared they were on a unity ticket with Labor with education funding. On the eve of the election, we will remember well the Prime Minister again reassuring the Australian people that there would indeed be no cuts to education, to cuts health, no changes to pensions, no change to the GST and, the best of all, no cuts the ABC or SBS. That was the context. The statement was very clear: no cuts. There was no ambiguity then, but fast-forward 15 months and the reality could not be more different. The Prime Minister's word clearly counts for very little these days. So, contrary to the solemn commitments given prior to the election, the Abbott Liberal government has embarked on a series of savage cuts to education, health, pensions, the ABC and SBS, to name just a few, while also starving the states of funds to force changes to the GST. This is a government that says one thing to get elected and then does the exact opposite afterwards, crushing any faith the Australian people had in this government to keep its word.


This is a destructive path for any government—a path that has lasting consequences for democracy. This government's approach to education funding and to investing in our nation's future is especially destructive. Its $30 billion cut to school funding is the biggest ever cut to schools in our nation's history. In my electorate of Newcastle, it is estimated that the cuts will leave schools nearly $196 million worse off over the next decade. So much for the extra $4.4 million that Francis Greenway High School in Beresfield were counting on, or the extra $2.8 million that was going to help Thornton Public School. These schools, like all 65 schools in my local electorate, are now being asked to pay the price for this government's broken promises. No matter how the government attempts to dress it up, $30 billion is a massive cut to education, with lasting consequences for our children.


Make no mistake: all the evidence at hand highlights the need for governments to invest more, not less, in our schools. That is what Labor was doing in government and what the Abbott Liberal government said they were going to do before being elected. The Gonski review, conducted in 2011, was the most comprehensive review of our school funding system in 40 years. It identified the problems within the existing school funding model but also gave us the solutions. The Gonski findings were very clear: too many children were being denied the education they needed and deserved due to a lack of resources under the existing funding arrangements. Gonski recommended that an additional $5 billion a year was needed to ensure that every school had the resources it needed, with the vast majority of that funding going to public schools, where student need was highest. It recommended that the money be used to improve student learning through more individual attention in the classroom, specialised teachers, greater support for kids with disability or special needs, and additional training and classroom support for teachers.


A new national needs-based funding system for schools was created, and new six-year funding agreements with states and territories were negotiated. A key aspect of those agreements was that the states had to maintain and indeed increase their own funding above the rate of inflation. But, to the detriment of our education system, the Abbott government has torn up the Gonski model of needs-based funding, slashed funding to our schools by $30 million and let the states off scot-free. Our schools, school communities, teachers and students deserve better. Every child in Australia deserves the best start in life and access to high-quality education, not just those with big wallets.

Mr EWEN JONES
 (Herbert) (11:28):  I rise to speak on the motion moved by the member for Lalor, and I note that she is not even here anymore in the chamber. This is her commitment to her motion!


Can I just start with Gonski. We have this notion from across the chamber about Gonski and their commitment to Gonski. Gonski was the money we have in the budget at the moment plus an extra 17 per cent. So, whilst Labor want to talk about their commitment to Gonski, what they actually did when they were in government was give their version of what Gonski represented, which was about half of what Gonski was actually chasing. I think the Gonski report was a great document, but it seemed to me, from the bits and pieces I have read of the Gonski report, that the premise of the report was: if money were not an issue—if you did not have to worry about money—what would you do with education?


That is where Gonski came from. It was a great idea but it is one of those things where it would be different if money were not an issue, but money is an issue. No matter what you do, it comes back to money. 


The member for Forde summed up our position on education. It comes down to an argument between the two sides of politics. The opposition wants to argue about the quantum of funds, whereas we would always argue that it is the quality of the placement of those funds that is important—getting the decision making closer to where it is needed, getting the decisions made close to the school and empowering school principals to make sure they have the responsibility and the right to attract the right teachers. It is about the quality of teachers and getting parents involved in their school communities. That is how you drive value for dollars. 


We can continue to argue about where funds have gone, but, standing here with the member for Forde, in Queensland we are under no misapprehension about what happened to education funding at the last election. In the PEFO, just before the election, Labor took out $1.2 billion. There have been no cuts to education. What we said before the last election was that we were in lockstep with Labor over the forward estimates in relation to funding. Labor pulled that $1.2 billion but we have put it back into the system. In years five and six, Labor had no alternatives available to them because they could not afford to maintain funding. This comes down to the economy. According to Lisa Paul, the Secretary to the Commonwealth Department of Education, in the August 2013 Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Outlook, $1.2 billion was taken out not by us, not by Christopher Pyne or Tony Abbott, but by the previous government. That represented the money that those states had not signed up to in that time. 


We have to make sure that education funding is sustainable. We have to make sure that we give kids every opportunity to participate in education. I was reading on the weekend remarks by Peter Walsh, the former ALP senator and finance minister in the Hawke and Keating governments. In his valedictory speech in 1993 he predicted that we would never pay off the debt that Paul Keating had left Australia. He said that the danger we had was that first a country loses its economic sovereignty, and if you lose your economic sovereignty you lose your political sovereignty. That was the danger that Peter Walsh saw in 1993. He said we could not pay back the debt that we had then—the $96 billion that Paul Keating handed over to John Howard. Of course the Hawke-Keating governments' reforms during the eighties had a fair bit to do with this, but through hard work and diligence and making sure that we understood the issues, with Peter Costello and John Howard empowering their ministers to make sure they lived within their means, we paid off that debt. On one side of politics we are delivering for education; on the other side of politics we have these pie in the sky issues—the same is the NDIS—which will be funded so far out that we are no longer responsible for it.

 (Fraser) (16:00):  It was my pleasure yesterday to participate in the Lifeline Canberra half-marathon on the about-to-be-opened Majura Parkway. It was a great sporting event, and I pay tribute to the Lifeline team, including Carrie-Ann Leeson, Matt Heffernan and the volunteers who were there. Many of the Lifeline staff took part in the event itself, including phone counsellor Susana Silva and her dog, Obama.


Lifeline Canberra is a great charity which is committed to helping Canberrans and which has been arguing forcefully against the Abbott government's attempts to get rid of the Australian Charities and Not-For-Profits Commission. The ACNC has served Australian charities well, and four out of five Australian charities support its retention. So it continues to bewilder me that Minister Andrews wants to scrap the charities commission, in the face of the overwhelming view of the sector. The charities commission helps donors and charities, and helps protect Australians against scams.


Yesterday's fun run was also significant because it took place on the Majura Parkway. The Majura Parkway is a piece of public infrastructure that I fought for and was delighted to see the former Labor government fund. It never would have been funded by a coalition government; but a Labor government gave it $150 million. It will serve to take the traffic pressure off the streets of the north side and allow more trucks to avoid the Canberra CBD as they service the airport.

Ms MacTIERNAN
 (Perth) (16:45):  There is plenty to grieve about in Western Australia at the moment. I want to use this opportunity to talk about how this failed privatisation of the Grain Freight Network in Perth, which took place in 2002, is continuing to wreak havoc in Western Australia. On Saturday, I was driving back from Albany to Perth and the roads were absolutely crowded with grain vehicles—a level of grain vehicles that I have never seen before on Albany Highway. If we look at what has gone on with this privatisation, it really tells us that we have to beware of governments that are getting out there to fill budget holes and, in that process, creating a great economic disadvantage for their state.


As we predicted back in 2000, what has happened is that there have been very significant cuts in the Grain Freight Network. Indeed, last month we saw 500 kilometres of grain lines that were closed in the South West of the state. For a farmer in Kulin, that has added around $3.82 per tonne. And in the catchment of those tier 3 lines it is estimated that this year there will be an extra $2 million coming out of farming budgets to pay for the increased cost because of this rail closure.


What is really bizarre is that we know that CBH, Co-operative Bulk Handling, want to operate trains over these rail lines. They are prepared to take them over and operate trains. But, because of a deal done with the current state government, building on the inequity of the earlier Liberal coalition government, we have seen the change to the agreement. So Brookfield can simply refuse to enter into a commercial arrangement with CBH, or a reasonable commercial relationship with CBH, and nevertheless keep access and keep entire control of those lines. They no longer have to maintain them to any significant extent. It has been estimated they need to put a bit of weed spray around them, but their obligations have been totally reduced in a secret 2009 agreement that has been made by the Barnett government with Brookfield. This is not something that is simply impacting on farmers and rural economies; it is also having a major impact on road safety and on the sustainability of those local shires, who are estimating that their cost of road maintenance now is going to go up significantly, and they are looking at a 30 per cent increase on rates—again, a completely unsustainable situation.


It is not only in Western Australia that we are seeing the errors and the potential disruption of a failed and ill-considered privatisation. I am using this forum to raise what I believe is a very serious safety issue on the Melbourne metropolitan rail network. In the course of my role, I attend many rail functions around Australia, and people come to me and tell me things that are going on within the industry. A wide range of people have given me reports about what they consider to be the very parlous state of the track in the Melbourne metropolitan rail system—that there are an unprecedented number of faults on that line and that the private contractor, MTM, are simply not addressing these issues seriously. They are doing patch-up jobs; they are plating over these cracks rather than replacing the rail track because they are seeking the on-time bonus. They are seeking to reduce the amount of time the rail is out of action and seeking to reduce the amount of money spent on maintenance. It has been put to me—and certainly from the photographs I have seen it would appear to be so—that there is a prima facie case that the state of the rail we are seeing today is very similar to the state of the rail, in Hatfield in the United Kingdom, which in 2000 led to a derailment with the loss of four lives. Exactly the same problems were identified: there was a private operator leasing the railway tracks and simply sweating the asset. They were seeking to get the maximum out of that asset without any regard for the long-term viability of that network; indeed, it would appear, they did so with perilous disregard for the safety of the people travelling on that rail network.


I have raised this; I have been so deeply concerned about this that I have raised it in several forums. A couple of weeks ago at the Australian Railway Association, I raised this matter with the CEO of MTM, Andrew Lezala. He said there was no problem with their maintenance; their maintenance plans were all developed with Public Transport Victoria. But that does not give us any comfort. It does not show that any auditing of the work has been done, and that is what we need. We need someone to physically go and inspect these railway tracks and actually have a look at what has been done. Unfortunately, there is probably not the expertise in Public Transport Victoria these days to successfully do that.


For that reason, I have personally contacted the National Rail Safety Regulator and alerted them to this, because they are responsible for accrediting this rail line. I have alerted them to what I consider to be very serious breaches. I have also been working with the Public Transport Users Association which has gone out and done some inspections. They have launched a formal complaint with the Australian Transport Safety Bureau.


When one has been privy to the stories we are regularly hearing about the rail in Victoria, one has a moral obligation to ensure that some progress is made on this matter. Here, today, I call upon the National Rail Safety Regulator to go out there and inspect this rail line in Melbourne, and tell us whether or not the reports we are hearing from a wide range of people within the industry are true. If they are, we are putting the public transport users of Melbourne in peril. We are also presiding over a degradation of that rail network and, when these particular contractors are finished the period of their franchise, they can simply walk away and leave the state with a degraded asset. We have in Melbourne a classic example of a very poor privatisation exercise which has allowed an asset to be sweated and public safety to be compromised.


I will use my remaining time to go back to Western Australia and outline how atrocious this whole procedure has been. The sale was made in the year 2000. The sum for the sale of the entire network—the locomotives and the lease fee for some 49 years—was roughly $500 million. The company subsequently sold that on in 2009 for over $800 million—they took $300 million out of the system without there being any substantial upgrading. We were told at the time of the privatisation—the secret deals that were done—that there was going to be $400 million invested in upgrades. When we came into government we found that in fact there was absolutely no obligation to do so contained in the agreement. 


We see here the final iteration. Notwithstanding an injection by the federal Labor government of over $130 million into this network, the private operator and the state government actually walked away from their obligations, and now not only the farmers but anyone who uses our rural roads are being put in jeopardy.
