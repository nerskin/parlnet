"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2000-04-04,"—On Monday, 3 April, Senators Sherry and Conroy asked me some questions regarding the treatment of private binding rulings by the Commissioner of Taxation. I have here a response by the commissioner. I seek leave to have my answer incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The answer read as follows—
Yesterday, I said that I would check with the Commissioner of Taxation to see if there was anything further he was able to add in relation to this matter. The Commissioner advised caution in respect of comments touching on the Petroulias case; however, the Commissioner said that he has never stated that potentially thousands of private rulings are at risk of not being binding on the ATO. A number of rulings and advance opinions, which can be counted in the tens rather than hundreds or thousands, are under review by the joint AFP/ATO Taskforce. All of these rulings or opinions relate to Employee Benefit Schemes. None of these rulings relate to the GST.
The Commissioner has also advised that no question has been raised in respect of any other rulings or advance opinions.
Mr Carmody stated publicly, on 31 March 2000, that the ATO would be reviewing its procedures to ensure everything possible is being done to avoid misuse of advance opinions and private binding rulings.
The Commissioner also reaffirmed his view that private binding rulings perform an important and ongoing role in the administration of the tax system.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Private Binding Rulings</title>,Questions Without Notice,1,1
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-04-04,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) to questions without notice asked today, relating to Aboriginal reconciliation and the stolen generation.
In question time today we saw a minister who is clearly under pressure and should be sacked. In question time today we saw a minister who is not on top of his portfolio and should be sacked. We saw in question time today a minister who claimed that stolen generations were not mentioned in the Bringing them home report—a matter on which he is totally incorrect. In question time today we saw a minister who denies that his actions over the last few days have been a huge obstacle to getting reconciliation back on track, and if he cannot appreciate what he has done he should be sacked. The Adelaide Advertiser this morning got it right: `The issues simply will not go away by adopting a mean-spirited policy of blind denial.' They say: `It is offensive and mean spirited for the federal government to now effectively deny what was a widespread practice.'
I think the public is incredulous at this minister, this Prime Minister and this government's position on an issue which will continue to haunt us until we get it right. The country is essentially going through a crisis which we did not need to have. It is a crisis of policy which we do not need. It is in fact the last thing we need. It is a crisis which will do both economic and social damage to this country. It is the job of government to build a nation, to build a national spirit, to build a national cohesiveness. It is to build, not to wreck. It is to bind, not to divide. But this is to the contrary: the actions of Senator Herron and his puppeteer, the Prime Minister, have inflamed what was already a difficult situation. Be under no delusion: their actions over the last few days have exacerbated the divide in this nation. It is a nation that is poorer for this episode. As I say, most people I have spoken to are incredulous at the degree of obscenity in policy formulation and exposition over the last few days.  
Most people are saying, `Why have we got this? What is the motivation?' At best those people's rationale, their reasoning, is that it is incompetence. On that ground alone, on the best assessment you can make of the minister's performance, he should be sacked. But this is an action which was taken with intent, an action developed over some time, and it is an action which was designed to attract the hate vote. It is all about wedge politics. It is all about resurrecting some sort of constituency in regional Australia. It is about being down in the polls, and the only way this Prime Minister knows how to resurrect himself is to try to appeal to that hate vote. This document was done with intent. This document was leaked by the minister's office. It is a document which was produced at the highest level of government by the Office of Indigenous Policy in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, and it is in line with instructions from the Prime Minister's office—instructions which led this government's case in the Federal Court in the Northern Territory, which was completed just a few weeks ago.
The buck stops with this Prime Minister. On election night he promised reconciliation, but what he did not say was that he wanted reconciliation between himself and the stolen generation of voters, the One Nation voters that he had lost at the last election. It was not about nation building and reconciliation; it was about base politics. Peter Yu from the Kimberley Land Council put it quite rightly—it was yesterday or today—when he said that what is missing in this nation at the moment is the right spirit; we have a terra nullius of the spirit of the nation, and I think that is something that concerns all decent, thinking Australians. The real disappointment of many of them is you, Senator Hill, as well as Senator Vanstone, Mr Williams, Senator Payne and Senator Eggleston—the so-called wets of Liberal Party, those who have claimed that they stood for something bigger and better, those who have pretended to distance themselves from the policies of Senator Minchin and from the race related motivation of some of their colleagues. When will you draw the line in the sand?
—Address the chair, please, Senator Bolkus.
—Madam Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I would argue that it is an adverse reflection upon a senator to claim that the individual's policies have been determined on the basis of race, and I think that Senator Bolkus should be asked to withdraw that.
—Senator Bolkus, will you withdraw?
—I will not withdraw, Madam Deputy President. That is not a reflection which is unacceptable here. The motivation is very clear, and I will continue to make that point as I have made it over recent years.
—Would you please address the chair.
—Madam Deputy President, I have raised a point of order and I look forward to your ruling.
—I understand it was an accusation about policy, not about a particular aspect of policy.
—I do not want to debate it with you, Madam Deputy President, but it was not in relation to policy at all. It was an adverse reflection upon a senator because it said that the senator had formed a view on the basis of racial attitudes, which is not in relation to policy at all. If it were a debate about policy that did not make reference to any particular senator, then I would not have objected, but Senator Bolkus knows that he said it in relation to Senator Minchin. It is offensive and he ought to withdraw it.
—On the point of order, Madam Deputy President: Senator Hill knows full well that I have about 40 seconds to go and he is trying to take up time. The reflection was on the policy motivation and on the strategic motivation. It is not the first time that point has been made, and it is a point that I will continue to make. The point I would make is one that is reflected in the paper this morning when, for instance, Ton-That Quynh-Du from Lyneham said, of the difference between the Howard government and those who do not overtly fan racist sentiments, that the `other 50 per cent are too busy counting the votes milked by such tactics'. I put Senator Hill in that category. Senator Hill may not like that and he may raise points of order, but unless he puts his hand up against these tactics he will be smeared by them. 
—I do not consider that there was any unparliamentary reflection upon another senator.
—The real concern here is that this issue has been kicked off by this minister in this government at a quite sensitive time for this nation. We are not far away from the Olympics. This was an act of provocation. Over the next few months we will be getting team after team of foreign journalists in this country and what this government has done will ensure that those journos, apart from going to Homebush, will be going out to see the conditions of indigenous Australians and will be reporting not just negatively on those conditions but also on the sort of government that uses these people, the most underprivileged in our society, as political footballs and as the targets of their politics in Australia.

"Ferris, Sen Jeannie",LP,2000-04-04,"—Senator Bolkus has just claimed in his speech that we have been watching a minister under pressure. I would have to say, Madam Deputy President, that I have never seen a minister so in control of his portfolio. The reason is that this minister has been out around Australia: he has not sat in his office, he has visited more Aboriginal communities than Senator Bolkus would have had hot meals. If Senator Bolkus had gone over the Adelaide Hills and actually visited some of the communities that Senator Herron has visited, and that indeed I have visited, he would have found that people in those communities are not talking about this issue; they are actually talking about the issues of concern to them. I would like to report on what they raised with me two weeks ago when I met a large group of them up in the Riverland. They did not talk about this issue; they talked about family violence, drunkenness, alcohol abuse and sexual abuse. They talked about educational opportunities and homelessness. Those are the issues they are talking about on the ground and, if Senator Bolkus and his colleagues went out there and sat down and listened like I did and like Senator Herron does, you would not see people on this side of the parliament under pressure. We are not under pressure, and I am sorry that Senator Bolkus has left the chamber and is not able to hear me make my remarks.
This government and this minister do not deny that past practices led to the separation of many Aboriginal children from their families. I would have to say, whether they are children in the Barnado family resettlement program using children from Britain or whether they are indigenous children, they are all children and the result has been the same. These children need help and they need the recognition that this government has given to them. This minister acknowledges that this has been a blight on our history and has had profound and continuing effects on indigenous people and indigenous communities on a wider scale. We passed the motion of regret last year and we sincerely, each and every one of us, regret that past action. We responded to the Bringing them home report three years ago. We introduced a $63 million package to help separated families to get back together and to deal with the trauma of separation. We have actually taken some steps to introduce these measures. We gave that money to ATSIC to make those reparations and to begin the process of bringing those families back together and dealing with the trauma that individuals still feel. We are also determined to address the continuing legacy of disadvantage that many indigenous people suffer. 
There is no doubt that over a period of years these people have carried their secrets. They have grieved in private, and those mothers and fathers who lost their children, who never saw those children again, have also grieved in private. The Bringing them home report brought this out into the open in such a way that this government was able to recognise the problems and deal with the problems. That $63 million is a pretty good example of the sincerity with which this government, the coalition government, has dealt with this problem. This minister has visited communities where he has discussed this issue and I have visited communities where I have discussed this issue, and this is not a high priority issue in those communities. They are actually more worried about family violence. They are actually more worried about the age at which their children are getting involved in the drug scene and that they are leaving home, if they have got a home. Homelessness is a critical issue for Aboriginal communities. Bringing them home will begin to settle these people's secrets down in a more open way and in a more caring way than the opportunities those on the other side of this chamber were ever able to deliver to these people in 13 years. I know that the people that I have spoken to in South Australia, as I go around frequently meeting with indigenous women in particular, understand that this government has been putting its money where its mouth is and this minister's credibility can be measured by it. There is no doubt in my mind that when you get out on the ground it is well recognised.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-04-04,"—That latest contribution in defence of Senator Herron I think just summed up the problem. Senator Payne's view was that $63 million proved their sincerity. 
—I am Senator Ferris, not Senator Payne.
—I am sorry, Senator Ferris, and my apologies to Senator Payne. The $63 million of sincerity is not what the Aboriginal people wanted. That is not proof of sincerity. Most of the Aboriginal people whom I have spoken to who have told the stories of their experiences as part of the stolen generation have only asked for an apology. They have not asked for money. They have asked that the government recognise what occurred to them and that it apologise on behalf of the Commonwealth government. This government has not been able to bring itself to say sorry, and I think the Australian community are beginning to wonder why not. It is all right to say, `Oh, we have thrown money at the problem and that is the sign of our sincerity.' That does not wash when you cannot bring yourself to say sorry, and it is not washing with the people who have horrific stories to tell, who have had their lives ruined by their experiences and who continue to suffer pain, and whose family members continue to suffer pain, as a result of those experiences. For the government to maintain the position it has has been deeply hurtful to those people.
Senator Herron said today that he had heard that they wanted the government to say sorry, and I appreciate that he recognised that today, because yesterday he seemed to be denying it. But, despite all his sympathy, despite all his concern, he and the government cannot bring themselves to say sorry. What is worse, in the last couple of days the current imbroglio has come from their determination to adopt a David Irving approach and to try and deny the historical fact. They now refer to the term `stolen generation' as a rhetorical one in an attempt to demean, downplay the significance of and deny the very real experiences that occurred to thousands and thousands of Aboriginal people in this country. To say that it did not happen evenly across the nation and that sometimes only one in 10 children were stolen—though the point I made today is that almost half were stolen at certain periods in the Kimberley in Western Australia—does not go anywhere near dealing with the central point. The central point is that these people were stolen from their families and have suffered enormous pain, dislocation and suffering as a result. 
They asked the government to say sorry but the government could not bring itself to do that. But now they are tremendously upset and hurt by the fact that the government has moved to a new stage—a stage of denial of their experiences. Senator Herron says he has read the report and has listened to the stories. I do not know how anyone who has listened to even one of the stories can adopt the sort of position that he adopts. The stories are told with great dignity, without rancour and without a sense of vengeance, but they are told as heartfelt stories and stories that have ruined the lives of many Aboriginal people. Today the minister insulted the parliament and the whole Australian community by adopting the Bronwyn Bishop defence: it is all the Labor Party's fault. Apparently we somehow snuck into Prime Minister and Cabinet and wrote this submission on the stolen generation report. That is how desperate this government has become. It blames everybody. Now it is the Labor Party's fault that the government has sought to deny the experiences of these thousands of Aboriginal people.  
Minister, I know the Prime Minister has given reconciliation to another minister because he does not trust you to handle it. I know they have moved all of your policy officers out of your control and put them into the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet so that all the Aboriginal policy comes out of PM&C now and is not under the control of the Aboriginal affairs minister. I know the government do not take you seriously. What I really want to ask the minister is: don't you recognise the damage you are doing to race relations in this country? Don't you think you ought to take responsibility for the damage you are doing? Don't you think you ought to front up to your responsibilities and do better? Or, if you cannot do better, get someone who can do better, because you are doing enormous damage to race relations in this country, causing enormous hurt to the stolen generation and setting back reconciliation many years by the lack of sensitivity and the lack of understanding that have been shown in dealing with the real tragedy of these people's lives. I urge the minister, if he cannot do that, to go and see if there is somebody who can do a better job.

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2000-04-04,"—This, of course, is a very topical and controversial matter at the moment. Senator Evans said this afternoon in question time, and he said it again now, that the government is seeking to deny historical fact and to pretend that there was no policy of removing children from their families and that there were no sad consequences and hurt caused by that policy. In fact, the truth is quite the opposite. The government does not deny that these policies occurred. Senator Herron made it quite clear this afternoon that they did occur and that he understands fully the pain, trauma and hurt that resulted from those policies. He said to the Senate this afternoon that he, in a minor way, was in fact involved in a part of the operation of the policy of removing Aborigines from their families. As a young person, I saw Aboriginal children from the Moore River Mission in Perth—who were probably taken away from their families—brought down to Busselton, where I lived, in the summertime to go on holidays. There is no doubt that this policy occurred and nobody denies it.
However, it has to be understood that the policy of removing Aboriginal children from their homes was a policy of the time, and the policy was introduced in an attempt to improve the opportunities of young Aboriginal people by providing them with better health services and education and by generally giving them a background which would fit them into the Australian society of the time. It has to be said that there were a great number of success stories from that policy. One of them, which I would like to quote, is that of Cedric Wyatt, who was until recent years the head of the Aboriginal Affairs Department of the government of Western Australia, a member of the senior executive service of the state public service. Cedric Wyatt is somebody who I know reasonably well and with whom I have discussed this policy of the removal of children. Cedric said to me in 1996 when we were in the Kimberley that, if he had not been removed when he was a young man, sent to a Catholic school and given an education, he would be just another drunk on the streets of Meekatharra. Instead of that, he is a man with tertiary qualifications, who, as I said, was a member of the senior executive service of the West Australian state public service. Another example is Polly Farmer, a great footballer known throughout this country. He, too, is a man who benefited from that policy. 
I repeat the point that you cannot judge the past by the values of today. The past is the past, and values change. History is history. For example, the restrictive immigration policy which Australia had for many years, known as the White Australia Policy, was introduced by the Labor Party in the early 1900s. The Labor Party would never think of introducing a racist immigration policy like that in this day and age, but they did so in 1900 because that was consistent with the view which the white members of Australian society took of the world at that time. It was, of course, the Holt coalition government which abolished the White Australia Policy in 1966.
When I lived in the Pilbara—where I lived for some 22 years—I took a great interest in Aboriginal affairs. One of the things that I used to do was go to Aboriginal bush meetings. The Aborigines in the Pilbara used to get together every three months to discuss issues. About 300 of them would gather on the banks of a river somewhere in the Pilbara and talk about issues. The issues that were raised were housing, health services, education and social problems like domestic violence and alcoholism. Strangely, the removal of children and land rights were not raised by those ordinary Aboriginal people, obviously because they did not see them as important issues. I think there is a message in that, and the message is that Aborigines are more concerned with the practical issues of education, housing and social problems than with issues built up—and beat up—by people who have a vested interest in promoting somewhat trendy, controversial issues. Such people are promoting those issues rather than sitting down and tackling the boring issues which would actually bring some benefit to Aboriginal people—issues like housing, health services and education.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2000-04-04,"—Going on from what Senator Eggleston has contributed to the debate, I see we have more anecdotal stories about the past and more talk about how we then, at some point, have to cut off the past. Perhaps we could cut off our arms at the same time! It is not a case of saying, `We'll jump into a time warp, we'll be a Dr Who—we'll pretend that the past didn't exist.' I think it is very important to look at the past, take a valuable lesson from the past and learn from the past. What you can learn from the past is that policies that discriminated, policies that were wrong, can be rectified and you can say sorry—it is not a very difficult word. A government can say sorry; it can look at the past and move on. Unless it can recognise the past, it may have difficulty moving on.
In the future, I wonder how much you are going to support the policies that you have supported in the Senate today—the policies of reconciliation. Or are you going to say next week or next year, `That was a matter that we dealt with last year and the year before; it is a matter we no longer have to deal with'? Are you going to say that reconciliation is not important anymore? Do we have to second-guess you every time you say something now as to what is going to happen in the future? Do we have to then critically analyse all the government's statements today so as to know what might happen in the future, so that when the future does arrive, they do not reflect upon today negatively and say, `That's something we said in the past. We can cut it off, we can truncate it—it is no longer rationally relevant any longer'? It is just not good enough.
In answer to Senator McLucas's question, Senator Herron referred to the stolen generation and talked about the rhetoric that surrounded it, paraphrasing, and also threw up a new term. We now find that it is nothing more than `a construct'—no definition, just simply a construct. I think that is a very poor summation indeed of the issue of the stolen generation. In fact, three years ago when the HREOC report was put forward, some of the questions surrounding that report were answered in a press release put out by the department. The text of that press release says, `In developing these initiatives, our primary aim has been to address the fundamental concern that lies at the heart of this issue—family separation and its consequences.' As the report itself states, `Assisting family reunions is the most significant and urgent need of separated families.' It is not only about the people themselves; it is about their families.  
This government then says, `We should move on. We should concentrate on education, health, youth affairs and other matters.' Those issues do not go away. The government should continue to address them. It should not simply say that we should look at those rather than look at the holistic view. Until we can deal with the holistic issues, it is very difficult to then put them in little boxes and say, `These are the matters we are going to deal with. We will deal with them only because we want to deal with them. We will deal with education, if we can,' and I think the record there stands for you to demonstrate that you will deal with it. You have said you will. Now we will watch you try. You then say, `We will deal with health,' and the same thing goes. You then talk about youth affairs or about the problems of drugs and whatnot in those communities. We will see your record on that, but it does not mean that you will deal with only those issues. You have to deal holistically with all of the issues that need to be looked at. 
Also, in that press release some time ago you said, `We know that we must never forget the past, that we must learn from the past so that we never again allow such things to happen in our community.' It seems to me that you have made these statements but take no responsibility for them. You simply say, `That was the past. We certainly care about the past, but we won't take any responsibility for the future.' It is a poor reflection. In response to Senator Bolkus's question to Senator Herron about the reconciliation process, Senator Herron commented that the reconciliation process was not a matter that he needed to turn his mind to. As I understand his answer, he believes that it is still on track.

"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2000-04-04,"— I take note of the answer from Senator John Herron to my question in relation to the stolen generations. I am somewhat bemused and find it difficult to refrain from expressing anger about what I see as the conviction and commitment of the government as being nothing more than semantics. It seems very much divided on a human question. I agreed with the government last year and the government acknowledged that indigenous Australians suffered injustices under the practices of past generations, and there was also an acknowledgment about the mistreatment of many indigenous Australians over a significant period of time. It was described by the Prime Minister as the most blemished chapter in our national history. My question today was not so much about the past alone. It was very clearly about the question of the minister's comments no more than three days ago, not 35 years ago, not longer. All it required was a human response from the minister, perhaps from the government, perhaps from the Prime Minister to acknowledge that the comment that `there is no such thing as a stolen generation' is, in fact, the infliction of a new hurt and a new trauma upon members of the stolen generation.
It is one thing to talk about giving commitment and conviction to a motion passed in August last year, but there must be an ability for government to be able to draw a line from that commitment to present day circumstances some seven months on. It seems to me that the government response has been a numerical one and a political one, but it requires a human one. No-one asked for anything other than an acknowledgment and understanding that Senator Herron's comments in this submission and in the media in the past few days have opened old wounds. They have brought on new trauma and there must be an understanding that indigenous Australians, whether it is one in 10, one in two or every one of them, by one or two degrees of separation have all suffered the anxiety, the trauma and the hurts of the past as members of the stolen generations.
I do not believe that it is a big thing to ask for the government, the Prime Minister or Senator Herron to withdraw or to amend those comments and to understand that this requires a human response. We all acknowledge that indigenous people are the most disadvantaged and we talk well about the things that we are doing to try to remedy the effects of past colonisation. Yet I find it quite disturbing that all of our responses seem to hinge very much on the way that we deal with words and how they are interpreted. It matters not whether the stolen generations were recorded in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report, or in any other report. It is what is commonly known and commonly accepted by members of the stolen generation that defines their stories, their life experiences and their hurt about their past over a significant period of time. 
It is no different to the idea of `burn baby burn'. We are not literally talking about babies burning, we are talking about an era in our history when particular things happened, and we understand that. It is no different to an understanding of the Anzac spirit: that it means something to people in this nation and that it allows people to unite under a common understanding of our history in relation to war in the first sense and in the second. It should be no different as a response from this government to understand that we are talking about the lives of people who continue to live in this society and who, quite frankly, have had their stories delegitimised and discredited as being nothing more than a myth and a lie. I do not believe it is beyond this government to confront these issues and to give a human response. We ought to feel outraged that the governments are not providing the responses required. I want to finish by saying that, if we are serious about our conviction of last year to reconciliation and to the stolen generations, then we ought to be able to match that rhetoric with action here and now.
Question resolved in the affirmative. ",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Aboriginals: Stolen Generation</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1
"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2000-04-04,"—I move:
That in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:
The need for the Australian Government to acknowledge that there exists stolen generations of indigenous Australians, that generation after generation of indigenous children were stolen from their families, and that the Government must act on its expression of deep and sincere regret for the injustices suffered under the practices of past generations by moving to ease the hurt and trauma that many indigenous peoples continue to feel as a consequence of those practices.
I move this urgency motion because I believe that it is of vital importance and goes to the heart of national character and the heart of the nation. Earlier this year I attended the World Economic Forum in Davos in Switzerland. One of the things that struck me about that forum was that an author and a world renowned philosopher by the name of Umberto Eco spoke about what he regarded of vital importance to the idea of memory. He made this comment: 
If we lose our memory, we have no soul. 
What he had in mind when he spoke about that particular phrase was that history and tradition are the very things that define us as people, as part of the memory of the things that we tell about ourselves to each other and the things that hold value as part of life. 
Today I want to reassure the thousands of members of the stolen generations that their experience and their stories are not being dismissed as mythology by the government and that the government should not seek to deny their past and their stories. I am deeply saddened to be in this position only seven months after the Australian parliament acted in unison to express its deep and sincere regret to indigenous Australians, acknowledging the injustices they suffered as a result of the practices of past generations, and for the hurt and the trauma that many indigenous people continue to feel as a consequence of those practices. But when the language of the motion was negotiated with the Prime Minister in August last year, it was the most pointed reference that the government was prepared to make in terms of an apology to the stolen generations. The compromise that I and Senator Lees were prepared to make, after speaking with members of the indigenous leadership, such as Dr Lowitja O'Donoghue and Mr Charles Perkins, was something that I believe took an enormous amount of time and patience in agreeing to.
Although many indigenous people wanted a great deal more from the national parliament, it was but a small and significant step that the government was prepared to make to reopen the process of reconciliation between black and white Australia. It was a beginning that I believed at that time opened the way to further and more significant progress in the future. I think everyone in the Senate is conscious of the fact that reconciliation is a long and, at times, difficult process. But as I said in my first speech in this chamber, it is a process that perhaps in time becomes difficult by those that have false ideals and those that have an inability to forgive or to accept.
I seek to move this motion with the support of senators of all political persuasions because I think it is a matter that goes to the heart of this nation. It is a matter that cries out for a human response rather than political manoeuvring or mathematical formulas. There is no doubt in my mind that Australia has had several generations of stolen children. There are many indigenous people alive today whose pain is still fresh and whose hearts are still scarred by their experiences. To somehow diminish those stories by not acknowledging them as being part of the stolen generations is no different from trying to demystify or take away the idea that somehow the Anzac spirit unites all Australians. We all understand what that means as part of Australian history. We ought to be able to accept that stolen generations are also part of our history—that they can be accepted and given a human response. 
I have no doubt that the term `stolen generations' can be applied to all generations of indigenous Australians today. Primarily, it is about those that were taken away, but it is also about the mothers that were left behind, the families that were left behind, and the generations that were denied opportunities for family, culture and identity. This leads me to question why the minister for indigenous affairs considers it appropriate or helpful to deny the experiences and the stories of so many indigenous people and their families. How does the government's denial of the existence of the stolen generations advance the process of reconciliation when this fact of history is widely accepted by the Australian community?
I have been greatly heartened by the volume of messages of support from Australians from all walks of life and of all political leanings. Australians, both black and white, are morally outraged and disgusted by the suggestion that, as a nation, we would seek to deny the very identity and existence of the stolen generations. The level of passion and outrage conveyed in the messages to my office reassures me that any polls that suggest Australians do not want to apologise to the stolen generations are wrong. I gave the minister an opportunity this afternoon to deal with comments made in the past three days—not past history, not past actions of government, but recent comments that could easily have been repaired.
The fact is that no-one will ever know how many indigenous children were forcibly removed from their families. This was acknowledged by Minister Herron yesterday. This was acknowledged by others. Yet we continue to have a government that tells us that we ought to be relying upon a report written three years before the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report, that we are talking about one in 10. It does not matter what the numbers are. It is the fact that we are talking about the stories of people that are living as part of Australian national life. We ought to be decent enough to do the right thing. I think that Australian society demands and expects that we deal with these issues for what they are. It requires a human response to understand that these wounds have been opened again. If there is a festering sore we should be able to do the right thing and say sorry.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Aboriginals: Stolen Generation</title>,Matters of Urgency,17,1
"Herron, Sen John",LP,2000-04-04,"—I have a great deal of respect for Senator Ridgeway. I certainly respect the motion that he has put forward as a matter of urgency. I can understand his motivation in doing so because it is an issue that tugs at the heart. It crosses our whole 210 years of history in this country. One cannot deny—neither I nor the government have ever attempted to do so—our past. Our past was a bloody one. That is not a word I usually use, but there is no question that it was—right from the time of transportation until the present time and our attitude towards the indigenous people of this country. I recall that initially Governor Phillip's instructions were `be kind to the natives'. We introduced diseases which decimated people, particularly smallpox. Senator Ridgeway and many people who are interested in this field would be aware that Bennelong was a person who was affected by alcohol. We introduced a lot of dreadful things to this country unknowingly because we did not understand Aboriginal culture. One of the great events that have occurred in the last 50 years or so is a general understanding, particularly by academics, of the culture of Aboriginal people and its great strengths.
One can do no more than admire the Aboriginal people who have survived this period which started with killings and massacres over land in various places across the country, through to a protection era and then an era of assimilation, which was official government policy of the day. Nobody denies any of that. One of the worst things that we have done—both sides of politics—in recent years has been to introduce welfare dependency. For the last 30 years, we have done that. As I mentioned in question time this afternoon, I think that has probably caused an enormous amount of trouble. I love this portfolio, quite frankly; in fact, I am a volunteer in it. I asked for it after the last election to continue the work that I saw could be done, because I think we are producing a seachange in this country.  
Having said that, what we have done to our Aboriginal people, even today, is horrendous: the effects of alcohol, the effects of family violence, as I mentioned. I believe there is an enormous task within our community today to redress those wrongs of the past, as they are afflicting the people today. We see all those statistics—the lack of education, the incarceration that was mentioned previously today, and the other effects on the indigenous community of this country. It is a tribute to them that they have survived. I recall being told as an observer, perhaps 20 or 25 years ago, that the Aboriginal people would not survive because of disease and alcoholism that were rife in the community. It is a tribute that they have emerged as a people whom we do honour.
We have never tried to deny this. I see in the media that somehow or other we are denying children were forcibly removed from their families. All that I have done in the submission is to try to get those facts on the table. For example, the word `stolen' encompasses children who were removed from their families, often from one parent—because that is what occurred in that era—with consent. Since I was last in the chamber, and I have not had the opportunity to verify this categorically, I have been informed that, for example, between 1950 and 1957 in the Northern Territory 44 children were separated from their families, and in every case consent was given by the mother in that case because the father was absent. So over that eight-year period, the mothers of 44 children in the Northern Territory gave consent.
As I say, I have not been able to verify that. I have only just been told that by a patrol officer who was there at the time and who was responsible, so I accept his statement. All I am putting to you is that we need to verify all these things. It is a thing of the heart. I am not denying that. There is no question that there is an extraordinarily strong emotional element to it. I continually get asked by Aboriginal people who have succeeded in society and who are economically independent, `How can I help? What can I do as an individual to help the Aboriginal people?' I believe the overwhelming majority of Australians feel the same way. They want to help. They want to assist in one form or another. That was why the Australian parliament as a whole passed that motion of a sincere expression of regret on 26 August 1999. We represented the Australian public. We were all elected to represent them. We did that.
We responded to the Bringing them home report. The Bringing them home report was 535 oral and written submissions to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, which was commented on again today by Sir Ronald Wilson. I questioned Sir Ronald Wilson. I can verify this; I can find the date in my diaries. I said, `Sir Ronald, why is it that nobody who was an administrator at that time appeared before your committee? I would have thought that as a judge there should have been somebody who hopefully was still alive.' One of the difficulties for him, which I acknowledge, is that most of the administrators of that era are deceased. Children were removed but adults, of course, were the administrators at the time. I said, `Why did nobody come forward or why didn't you request that they come forward?' He said, `We advertised and nobody responded.' It is a reality, of course, that elderly people do not wish to have the glare of exposure, but I have actually met one who did respond to it. He was the deputy administrator of the Northern Territory. He asked to be heard, and he tried a number of times, but somehow or another his request was never accepted. I accept Sir Ronald Wilson's statement that nobody came forward, but somewhere along the line this particular person could have added to it. 
I have read Colin Macleod's book, which is mentioned in my submission as well. I think he is a magistrate in Victoria at the moment. He has written a book called Patrol in the dreamtime. I would recommend the book to anybody. He has in his book the criteria that were established when children were taken in the Northern Territory. Nobody is denying that that occurred. It is on the record. We responded to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report, of course. It was not a myth. I have seen that in a headline, which was just irresponsible. We responded to that. We responded honestly and truthfully to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report with a $63 million package to attempt to redress that. I do not think we will ever redress the emotional reaction of people or the descendants of those who were separated. Senator Ridgeway divulged today in the media about his own father. We are never going to cure that with money. I accept that. We are never going to redress those wrongs, the emotional hurt that that has caused and the ripple effect through the generations. That will always be on the record. 
It is difficult to respond on a piece of paper and put your emotions into that piece of paper, but what I certainly did in relation to the submission to the legal and constitutional affairs committee was to put the facts on the table. I was not present, nor I suspect was anybody else. Senator Ridgeway has a unique experience. I respect him for that and for what he has achieved in his own life. But the facts have to be put on the table; they have to be acknowledged. It is all very well to pass an urgency motion in this chamber but it does not address the facts with respect to Senator Ridgeway.
—We are addressing the legacy that has been left us from the past. We are tackling the fundamentals of health, housing, education and employment. I believe there is a sea change occurring in Aboriginal affairs in this country in relation to welfare dependency. Leaders are coming out. They are coming out not because we came to government but they have been saying that for so long and they were not listened to—
—Madam Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. I have been sitting listening to Senator Herron, who is speaking calmly and quietly, and Senator Faulkner has interjected over and over again in a most unacceptable way. I ask you to call him to order.
—On the point of order: I would make the point that of course it is disorderly to interject and any senator who does interject can be called to order. I did interject. I was just asking Senator Herron: is the government supporting the question before the chair? I just thought before the end of his contribution he could make it clear.
—As I think you said, Senator Faulkner, all interjections are disorderly.
—We are addressing the legacy of the past, the legacy of disadvantage particularly in relation to health—there is no question. You would be aware, Madam Acting Deputy President, of the significant advances that have occurred just through immunisation programs alone. We are addressing the health aspects. We are addressing the education aspects. The Prime Minister announced the new education policy only last week. We are addressing the fundamentals. While recognising that there are matters of an emotional and significant nature that do affect the community, I have made my personal expressions of regret, as has the Prime Minister. The whole of the parliament has expressed its regret. I believe this motion of urgency is unnecessary.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2000-04-04,"—I think most Australians understand what the government fails to comprehend and that is, of course, because most Australians do have a heart and they do want to be honest with our history. That is, that generations of Australians—generations of Aboriginal children—were forcibly removed from their families and placed in care for the sole purpose of assimilation. This was done to Europeanise the indigenous people of this nation. I say that the government fails to comprehend the ramifications of these policies. If Mr Howard and Senator Herron comprehended the hurt, the suffering and the anguish of these people, they would never have produced such an inflammatory document for the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee inquiry into the stolen generation. They would not have submitted that particular document to the committee. I cannot fathom the government's intentions in producing the document. In two question times, today and yesterday, and throughout two days of media interviews, the minister still has not produced one good reason why in one fell swoop the Commonwealth of Australia has insulted the stolen generations and undermined the process of healing that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission began, which led to the Bringing them home report. The government has questioned the very existence of the stolen generation and that is why this particular urgency motion is so critical. 
The previous Labor government commissioned the Bringing them home report. The Labor Party prided itself in being at the forefront of the reconciliation process and promoting policies that would go some way to making amends for past wrongs. The failure of the government to accept its responsibilities in this matter now threatens the whole reconciliation process. Worse still, it reflects attitudes that suggest that past lessons have not been learned. As a consequence, both the integrity and the likely success of contemporary policies are called into question. It is true that moving forward together as a nation requires an honest and open approach to our shared history. Any honest and accurate history of relations between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians reveals facts of events, of attitudes, of actions and of policies that should be the cause of shared regret. It should be the cause of shared sorrow in our community. It should see a common purpose that such things are not perpetuated and are not repeated. That same history, with its consistent thread of dispossession, destruction of indigenous culture and heritage and the deliberate fracture of indigenous families should inform and illuminate our understanding of present-day despair and present-day social dysfunction in indigenous communities.
You cannot frame better policies if you fail to address the underlying problems—the underlying failures and prejudices—of past policies. It is an abrogation of principle to say that we cannot or should not evaluate past policies or actions according to contemporary values and contemporary attitudes. The fact is that virtually every evil of public policy and administrative action directed towards indigenous Australians was the subject of informed and widespread contemporary criticism. There was the Roth commission in Western Australia. In 1905 that provided one of the first systematic critiques. That was followed by, amongst others, the Finnerty report of 1908 and the Moseley report in 1935. The cautionary point for every member of the Australian parliament today—every legislator here—is that all the aspects of past policies for which we now express regret were framed in the context of the contemporary debate that did show it was criticised at the time. Perhaps those legislators were content to march forward safely with majority public opinion rather than to accept informed but perhaps less popular advice.
It is broadly accepted that the practice of removing indigenous children from their families continued into recent times. You cannot say we judge past practices by contemporary standards, as Senator Herron has, because contemporary Australians are still suffering from quite recent policies. We are having to frame policies today to assist those people. For many people this issue can be dealt with only by consigning mistakes to some ill-defined past. Those people try to forget it or to rationalise it, and that is what Senator Herron's very ill-judged submission attempts to do.
In 1949, Australia ratified the United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. Article II of that convention sets out to define genocide when it says in part: 
In the present Convention, Genocide means any of the following acts ...
It goes on to specify
(d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;
(e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.
Public policy across this nation proceeded in either ignorance or defiance of that convention for the best part of a generation after its ratification. It is equally dangerous for policy makers to comfort themselves with the myth that, even when a policy was not done for the good of separated children, the net effect itself was good.
If we go beyond anecdotes to scientific research on this question, the myth is quickly disposed of. Recent studies show that a comparison of educational attainment, income level and employment status between indigenous Australians separated from their families and those who were not demonstrates consistently better outcomes for those who stayed with their families. Sadly, the statistics go in the other direction when we look at negative outcomes. One of the findings of the inquiry into Aboriginal deaths in custody—a finding that was a key motivation for the stolen generation report—was that those who had been separated from their families were overrepresented amongst the deaths in custody.
It is not surprising that individuals who have been denied parental and family love and support and education in their first language, and who have been separated from their own culture, would suffer social and psychological problems in later life. In fact, many of them also suffered systematic physical, mental and sexual abuse. That fact was a dominant influence in their personal development and had a massive effect on their ability to form relationships and their capacity to function in a society that was at best indifferent to them and so often actually hostile to them. Those who cannot bring themselves to apologise for past wrongs should at least be able to express sorrow for and empathy with such a widely documented personal and family tragedy and should not embark on just a demolition job of the stolen generation, which is what Senator Herron and his ilk have done.
Policy makers who fear history, Senator Herron—who are unable to honestly evaluate what went wrong and why it went wrong—are the sorts that are doomed to repeat history. I have heard some say that expenditure measures that the current government has made are better and more useful than any apology, but I beg to differ. Whilst any clawback of the massive cuts that this particular government—the Howard government—has made to programs to indigenous Australians is welcome, it is a mistake to identify the problems of indigenous communities as being primarily or exclusively caused by poverty.
Policies that fail to appreciate and address the personal and social dysfunction that has flowed from past and present injustices are policies that will not succeed. Just as policymakers of other generations were wrong in their paternalistic conviction that things needed to be done to or for indigenous Australians for their own good, so we will fail today if our policies are ill informed and enacted for, rather than with, indigenous Australians. It is in the interests of reconciliation, of a mature national identity and sound public policy that members of the government open their eyes and their ears—and, if they can, even their hearts—on this particular issue. The Prime Minister must act for all Australians, from the office of Prime Minister, and apologise as Australia's Prime Minister.
The Prime Minister has of late offered all of us his personal opinions and views. It is clear he is trying to distinguish his personal views from his views as Prime Minister, as the elected leader of this country. In making that distinction, he is making the point that the office of Prime Minister is not his as an individual, but to a certain extent it is his in trust. He holds that office of Prime Minister in trust as the nation's leader. It is in his capacity as Prime Minister, and not in his capacity as an individual, that he must apologise. It is the office of Prime Minister that must apologise for the grievous wrongs that previous Australian governments have wrought on the indigenous people of Australia, and he has proven time and time again as Prime Minister that he simply cannot say `sorry' to indigenous Australians on behalf of the government.  
We have Senator Herron's recent submission, and that has just attacked relentlessly the whole concept of a stolen generation. According to that submission, the stolen generation is, on page 2, `a simplistic concept'; on page 4 it is `simplistic terminology'; on page 4 again, it is `so-called'; on page 5 it is `a falsely constructed past'; and on page 18 it is `rhetorical'—among many other attempts at semantic diminishment or elimination. The submission canvasses past practices of assimilation as `benign in intent' but, at the same time, points the finger squarely at state governments and churches, all of whom have taken the Bringing them home report on board, and all of whom have apologised to Aborigines for these allegedly benign past practices. Senator Herron's own submission is not benign; it is poisonous. And it sets out to justify why the Howard government will not properly address this massive past wrong, the effects of which thousands of our fellow Australians are suffering to this day, as we speak in this chamber. And of course it sets out to attack the critics of the government. It squarely attacks the methodology of the Human Rights Commission. I heard Sir Ronald Wilson talking on Radio National today. He said:
It staggers the mind that they can make these assertions when we spent a year travelling around the country, not only listening to members of the stolen generation, but listening to researchers, the people, the academics and professionals, in mental health and the law, and churches and governments. Every state Government plus the two territory Governments gave the inquiry every possible assistance - something that cannot be said of the Commonwealth government.
In other words, the only fly in the ointment in the stolen generation inquiry's thoroughness was Mr Howard's government. For no good reason, out of the blue, these words are presented by Senator Herron to a Senate committee, and they have reopened old wounds. They have greatly distressed members of the stolen generation. There is no sympathy in Senator Herron's words. There is no empathy in Senator Herron's words; there is a void filled with semantics and statistics. It is an attempt to define the concept of a generation in some sort of Herronesque, amateur legalese—and it doesn't wash. The report tries to spread the legal blame to the states and the churches. It is in itself an apology for the policies of assimilation. 
The submission has become a rallying cry for the racist cheer squad, including the racist cheer squad within government, like the member for Leichhardt, Mr Entsch, whom I quoted in question time today. He was at his worst on ABC Radio today when he was asked whether some of his constituents in the electorate of Leichhardt—an electorate with thousands of Aboriginal people—would have been stolen. Do you know what he said? `No'. 
—Madam Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I would ask Senator Faulkner to retract his statement where he called Mr Entsch a racist. I think that is unacceptable for a member of another chamber, and it is not acceptable in this parliament. I ask him to withdraw it.
 (Senator Crowley)—Senator Faulkner, I suggest that the association of your words do seem to suggest and imply that about Mr Entsch and I would ask you to withdraw it.
—If I have said something that is unparliamentary, I withdraw it. But the point is: the apologists for these past practices are out there drumming up support on radio. So you have to ask: why does Australia's minister for Aboriginal affairs do this? Why do you do it, Senator Herron? Don't you care just a little about your own legacy and the legacy of this government? You do not understand why there is such outrage, do you? Can you understand why someone who understands as much about government process as Bill Jonas does says that reconciliation is dead? I have no doubt, Senator Herron, that you did not write this report. We know that you did not write this report. I know that you claim ownership of the report, but I have absolutely no doubt that you had very little, if anything, to do with it. I doubt very much whether you even bothered to read it.  
—You know so little. How many Aboriginal people do you know?
—Anyone who claims to have spoken to as many Aboriginal people as you do would know how divisive, upsetting and outrageous the document is that you have provided to the Senate committee. A competent minister for Aboriginal affairs would not have signed off on the report. In fact, a competent minister for Aboriginal affairs would have put the submission right through the shredder and would have asked for more empathy from the Office of Indigenous Policy in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and a more appropriate response. You stand condemned because you did not. You have been exposed. You are a fraud and a disgrace as the Aboriginal affairs minister. You ought to get out and resign. (Time expired)
—Madam Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I would ask Senator Faulkner to withdraw the statement that I am a fraud. I do not mind any other comments he makes, but I am not a fraud and I would ask him to withdraw it.
—Senator Faulkner, I would ask you to withdraw the statement that Senator Herron is a fraud.

"Ferris, Sen Jeannie",LP,2000-04-04,"—I think it is a tragedy that we are having this debate in here today. I do not believe there is a person in Australia who does not believe that what happened in our past is tragic. It is regrettable and a vast number of people—who knows how many—have been affected by this. I have met some of them. I do not know how many there are, but I do not think there would be a person in Australia who would not regret that we are having this debate in this chamber today. And I do not think there would be a person in Australia who would not regret that this issue has been so politically manipulated and so disgracefully twisted and turned by the opposition, as we have heard in here today and yesterday. In my view, with the number of indigenous people I have met in South Australia, this is not an issue that indigenous people talk about readily. It is an issue that is very deep within their souls. When they have raised it with me at meetings that I have attended, it is with a great deal of regret and sorrow, and there is a lot of emotion around the table that this issue has been raised. I know that it is a regrettable part of our history. It is a part of our history that we on this side of the chamber have been working very hard to address since 1996.
When the Bringing them home report on the separated children was released in May 1997, the government went to great lengths to ensure that the response that we made would be both practical and realistic. Far from downplaying or dismissing the report in any way, the federal government responded to the 54 recommendations that were made within the report with a very comprehensive package of initiatives worth, as we now know, $63 million over four years. The package provided to ATSIC specifically addressed the issues raised in the Bringing them home report—that is, family separation and its consequences—and focused on family reunions and, of course, the very important provision of individual one-on-one counselling. That is in direct response to the essential recommendation that came out of the report, and that was that indigenous family separation and its consequences needed to be addressed as a matter of urgency.
This afternoon we have heard a lot of accusations against a very credible minister, about his commitment to his portfolio and, indeed, about the wider commitment of the coalition to improve the lives of our indigenous people and their communities. I believe that we can demonstrate that, on this side of the chamber, the coalition, since the 1967 referendum, have had policies which have tried to improve the lives of these people. In fact, in 1972 Prime Minister William McMahon made a very comprehensive statement of achievements in this area, and he outlined a five-point statement of policy objectives, the first of which is as relevant today to the coalition's focus, priorities and objectives as it was almost 30 years ago. For the Hansard record, I will read the very first of those recommendations because I am very proud to have my name associated with them so many years later. Prime Minister McMahon said: 
The fundamental objectives of government policy in relation to Aboriginal Australians are that they should be assisted as individuals and, if they wish, as groups at the local community level to hold effective and respected places within one Australian society with equal access to the rights and opportunities it provides and acceptance of responsibilities towards it. At the same time, they should be encouraged and assisted to preserve and develop their own culture, languages, traditions and arts so that these can become living elements in the diverse culture of our Australian society.
I believe that this minister has had in the front of his mind, without perhaps even knowing about that report from Sir William McMahon, exactly those objectives, and they are the objectives of the coalition today. In fact, they were very much the objectives when this government responded to the Bringing them home report with its $63 million package of measures to help these people. Let us have a look at the details of what has been offered within that package. There is $17 million to expand the network of regional centres currently offering indigenous people emotional support. This funding initiative also enables counsellors to be given further professional support and assistance and it is a direct response to recommendation 30 contained within the report. I am very sorry to say that in my own state of South Australia, both in the Riverland and in Port Augusta, indigenous women are unaware that the availability of counselling has been instituted within that package. I hope that very soon ATSIC is going to be able to ensure that this opportunity is well understood by people in the more remote parts of Australia.
Other aspects of recommendation 30 are addressed through the provision of $16 million for an extra 50 new counsellors to assist the indigenous people who were affected and those who are currently going through the reunion process, another very important leg of the Bringing them home report and our response to it. There is $11.25 million to establish a national network of family Link Up services to assist individuals who have been separated. Again, that is very important for enabling the parents, the other children and the separated men and women themselves to gain the very important sense of belonging that comes from knowing who your family is and where you come from. We have responded to recommendations 1 and 12 of the report by allocating a further $9 million to boost the various cultural and language maintenance programs, $6 million for the further development of family support and another $16 million to help the National Library develop an oral history. In response to recommendation 22 of the report, the Archives have been given $2 million to index, copy and preserve thousands of files relating to these children. This response is very clear evidence that we not only regret—as we have said many times—what was done in the past to these children but, very clearly, are also attempting to respond to the recommendations of Bringing them home in a way that enables these men and women, their families and the elderly parents that they left behind, mothers in particular, to be reunited in a sensitive way.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-04-04,"—I am appalled at the nouveau paternalism which I hear seeping out of the government benches. It reminds me of the letter written to the `black men' of South Australia, Senator Ferris's home state, by the first Governor there, saying, `If you want to get ahead, be like the white people. Obey our laws, worship our god and, above all, learn English.' We have come very little distance from that philosophy. It is wrapped up differently but that is what we are hearing here today, 150 years later. Moreover, it is compounded by policies not even being able to advance on the progress made by past federal governments but taking us back into the fifties, taking us back—worse still—into a new round of disgraceful behaviour in terms of allowing the growth of what can only be called imprisonment practices in Australia, leading to a jailed generation. This time we do it with our eyes open. Whatever the excuses—and I have heard them come thick and fast from the minister—about stolen generations, there is no excuse for this round. When I hear that the Prime Minister is going cap in hand to barter with the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory over jailed children in that territory, I am appalled. He has the legislative power, he ought to be using it, but of course he cannot even apologise. 
Let me tell you what I think is the measure of how this country is to succeed. It is not just by answering the questions that the minister puts up of how we can help and how we can assist, redolent with paternalism that they are; it is how close we move towards the model of Canada's self-government for the new indigenous state of Nunavut. Across northern Australia in particular we have thousands of indigenous people, the majority of whom are still in a relationship with their lands. The terrible land clearances that have swept the south have not quite swept the indigenous people into the northern ocean. We have a chance as a nation to give self-determination to people in places like Cape York, in the north-east; the Northern Territory; the broadacre lands of Central Australia; and the Kimberley. It will be a measure of how much we have learnt from the past as to how fast we move towards giving indigenous people a complete right over their own affairs in self-governing states in territories like those. That is not even in the debate now. It is all a measure of what we can do to put solutions forward to the indigenous people. It is time we said to the indigenous people, `The best thing we can do is withdraw and allow you to make your own decisions.'

"Boswell, Sen Ron",NP,2000-04-04,"—Senator Ridgeway brings before us an urgency motion today and he brings up, I believe, the twin concerns of acknowledgment and action in relation to past policies of forcibly removing Aboriginal children from their families. I believe that the government has responded in both acknowledging and bringing forward an action package in response to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report Bringing them home. This report said that assisting family reunion is the most significant and urgent need of the separated families. The government response to that was to provide $63 million to assist those affected, especially to help them find their families and to provide counselling. There is a focus on helping people re-establish family links, supporting individuals and families through counselling and parenting programs and providing an avenue for those affected to record their experiences.
I do not believe the Commonwealth was responsible at the time that these things happened. It was mainly the states that took part in these policies. But it is the federal government under the coalition that has put its money where its mouth is and put up $63 million to assist the Aboriginal people who have had their families separated. I think everyone in Australia acknowledges that there were grievous wrongs done. Many people did it because they thought they were doing the right thing at the time, though some probably did not. The legacy of those injustices filters through the Aboriginal communities now. That is why today's government is morally obliged to address these issues. Whether it is 10, 30, 50 or 100 per cent, we are obliged to act, and we are in many ways. But governments do not act in a vacuum. They need research and they need figures and facts to put on the table. Perhaps if the human rights commission report had been able to identify the extent of the separated children then we would not be arguing this today. But the human rights commission was unable to get the exact numbers. Senator Herron has said that the records were hard to get and no-one knows, including the human rights commission, whether it was 10 per cent or 30 per cent. The question was discussed in only one page of the 600-page report. 
The human rights commission brought down a harrowing report, and there was case after case of injustice and families torn apart by policies we view today as reprehensible and totally unacceptable. That is undeniable, and everyone concedes that. The government have acted, and that is undeniable. We have supported a resolution that sincerely regretted the fact that indigenous children were separated from their families. I believe that Senator Ridgeway had a great input into that resolution, which was passed unanimously by this Senate. I want to say that I was very privileged to be able to vote for that resolution.  
The National Party know far more about this issue than we are given credit for. It is the small communities in rural and regional Australia that are witness to the effect of children being separated from parents in the past. These small towns are eyewitness to the hardships and tragedies of indigenous Australians trying to pull their family lives back together without having had parental role models themselves. It is in the rural areas that reconciliation has to occur if it is to work, and arguing over whether it is a generation or generations, or five or 10 per cent, does not really help reconciliation. The government says that the cost of compensation as proposed by the human rights commission report would be in the order of $3.9 billion—and that is if only five per cent of children were wrongly removed. I think to raise those expectations does bring a false picture to the indigenous people.
Some of the more extreme indigenous views simply act in a detrimental way. Calling for burning of cars or banning the Olympics—I could not think of any worse way to support the Aboriginal community. It just drives people away. Today, as the conflict is being reawakened, it must be terrible to bear some of the memories this debate is going to raise. Some leaders in the indigenous community—I must include Charlie Perkins here—are using this debate to predict car burnings. Those sorts of comments just do not help the cause at all.
The government has worked hard at Aboriginal issues and taxpayers have worked hard too. This year $2.2 billion is targeted at indigenous specific programs. Progress is being made, including improvements in housing, with 33 per cent of indigenous families owning or buying their own homes, up from 24 per cent in the 1970s. There is also evidence of significant improvements in education, with more staying at school. Health is certainly unsatisfactory, but the government is doing what it can. The government is doing its best to look after indigenous people. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Aboriginals: Stolen Generation</title>,Matters of Urgency,17,1
"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2000-04-04,"—I have heard what Senator Herron and others have said in this place. Of course it is tragic that we are having this debate, but the reason that we are having this debate seems to be lost upon most people. Not longer than four days ago Senator Herron made the comment that there is no such thing as the stolen generation. Unless there is a conspiracy amongst Aboriginal people to feel offended or angered by that, it seems to me to be a very natural human emotional response to insensitive comments. 
For anyone to suggest that they have definitive figures is simply misleading. The government chooses, as part of its `argument of fact', the figure from the ABS report of 1994 of about one in 10 people. If we are to deal with fact, then surely it is also legitimate for the government to deal with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report, which spoke about one in two people and one in three people. But, beyond that, surely the detailed response must also take account of the members of the stolen generations. They should be allowed to speak for themselves, and their words should be treated as true accounts of history. Their stories are not mythical but factual—they are first-hand accounts of the trauma and the pain of separation, loss of identity and loss of family.
We as senators here today must feel compelled to set the record straight and to have the courage to stand up and face the reality of the past. The stolen generations deserve, as a bare minimum, our recognition, our acknowledgment of their pain and distress and our apology, as defined by the use of the term `stolen generations'. And if there ever was a time to say sorry, this is it. We are having this debate because Senator Herron created this climate and the unnecessary impasse to black and white reconciliation in this country. The motion that I have put before the Senate today is critical to the future of reconciliation in Australia. We are the generation that must take this step responsibly, and our positive intervention must begin today. We cannot make statements to forget the stories of the memories of the stolen generations, and we cannot give a new definition to the term to mean that the stolen generations never existed—they simply did. I commend this motion to the Senate. (Time expired)

"Hogg, Senator John",ALP,2000-04-04,"—Last night when I was discussing this particular issue I was focusing very clearly on the issue of the bakery and the problem which Mr Morgan had with Tracey Grimshaw on the Today Show. Last night, it was clearly recognised that Mr Morgan—according to the transcript of that show on that particular day—had developed a few grey hairs out of the initiative of the government by introducing the GST. That now seems to be beyond a shadow of a doubt.
—No, there was no hair colour, Senator. If one goes to the very good second reading amendment which was moved by Senator Quirke, Senator Quirke focused on a number of things about the GST and, in particular, he focused on the fundamental unfairness of a goods and services tax. Anyone who had listened to the story last night would clearly know that Mr Morgan would not think that there was any fairness in a goods and services tax.  
I also mentioned in passing—and I am not going to speak at length on this today—the situation of the Packaged Ice Association of Australia and the problem confronted by them. My colleague from Tasmania Senator Sherry—and this is where the particular information emanated from—will be addressing this later on in this debate. I do mention it because it does create another dilemma, and that is whether ice is a food and should incur or should not incur a goods and services tax. The Packaged Ice Association of Australia canvassed, as I understand, a number of members of this Senate. I note one of those on the list of people canvassed was Senator Heffernan, so I would be interested in Senator Heffernan's—
—A contribution from Senator Heffernan? We would welcome that.
—Yes, a contribution from Senator Heffernan in this particular part of the debate would be most welcome indeed in terms of hearing his view as to whether ice is a food or a beverage and whether it should attract or should not attract a GST. Undoubtedly, if that wisdom can be passed on to this Senate, we would relish it indeed. That is another group significantly affected by the GST.
Senator Murray, in his contribution last night, welcomed all of the changes to the GST that have taken place. But this was supposed to be a package that was signed, sealed and delivered. That was understood by the Australian people in terms of what they were taking on at the time of the election, when we supposedly voted in favour of a GST. That is the furthest thing from the truth. The fact of the matter is that there was a majority of Australians percentage-wise who voted against the introduction of a GST. If it had been fully understood at that time, I think one can reasonably conclude that the GST would not have got a look in, because people did not understand then the fundamental unfairness of a goods and services tax, and that has been very well picked up by Senator Quirke in his second reading amendment. 
There is a fundamental unfairness which was not understood at that time and which people are only now coming to grips with. The bakery case that I quoted last night is a clear instance of that. Senator Sherry, as I have foreshadowed, will deal with the case of the ice makers. Again, it is quite a difficult situation for the people from Tasmania involved in packaged ice. But I am sure that same situation is being faced by others in similar situations right throughout Australia. Here we have a tax which was not understood by the public, in spite—
—Madam Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. We have been very indulgent in the Senate about the nature of these second reading debate speeches. I have to say that 90 per cent of them have had nothing to do with this bill that is before us. What I would urge senators to do is to focus on the bill so that we can progress this debate. If people want the bill delayed, they can delay it, but all I am saying is that this has nothing to do with the bill.
 (Senator Knowles)—Minister, I do not uphold your point of order on this occasion purely and simply because this bill is a very wide-ranging bill. Unfortunately, from your point of view, I think that Senator Hogg is quite in order.
—On the point of order, this is not a wide-ranging bill at all—
—I am sorry, Minister, I have actually ruled on your point of order.
—I am speaking to the second reading amendment moved by Senator Quirke. For the sake of the Assistant Treasurer—
—He is here to listen to it, actually.
—Yes, he is here to listen to it. I will just remind the chamber of the second reading amendment moved by Senator Quirke. It reads:
	“but the Senate expresses its concern with the fundamental unfairness of the Government's approach to taxation reform generally, including: 
	(a) the fundamental unfairness of a goods and services tax;
	(b) the enormous compliance burden faced by small business from the GST; and
	(c) the further increase in the compliance burden arising from the new Pay As You Go measures and other tax related changes such as those under the business tax reform process which will inevitably fall disproportionately heavily on small business”.
It seems to me that what was said by Senator Quirke and Senator Conroy—and I am sure what some of my other colleagues will speak about it in this debate—and what I spoke about last night falls quite clearly into the aegis of that second reading amendment. It goes to the very heart of the issue that has concerned us, and that is the issue of the fundamental unfairness of a goods and services tax. The case that I spent so much time on last night, whilst it had its amusing moments, unfortunately—
—It is very serious.
—As my colleague interjects, it is a very serious issue because there are substantial compliance costs—as seen in the latter part of the interview which I documented on the Hansard record last night—which are causing concern to large and small businesses alike, but more pointedly to small businesses. They are the people who are suffering as a result of the implementation of the GST. I am quite sure that if they had understood the full ramifications of the implementation of the GST we would not be debating this here today. It would have got the true thumbs down it should have got and would not be an issue before this parliament at all. It is because of the constant badgering that I, people in my office and other colleagues receive on the GST that it is an issue—an issue that the government have failed to address. Amendment after amendment in this place has done nothing but breed cynicism in the real world. People have no doubt that the GST is not for them.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (TAX ADMINISTRATION) BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-04-04,"—I want to follow on from the comments made by Senator Quirke, Senator Hogg and Senator Conroy last night. The Labor opposition has moved an amendment that has three points to it: firstly, the fundamental unfairness of the goods and services tax; secondly, the compliance burden faced by small business; and, thirdly, the compliance burden arising from the new pay-as-you-go and other tax related measures such as those under the business tax reform. That summarises the points that we have encompassed in our second reading amendment.
We are dealing with yet another piece of legislation on the so-called new tax system and on the GST in particular—yet another piece of legislation. An extraordinary amount of time has been spent in this chamber debating the GST, as it should be. It is a big new tax. What concerns me in terms of simplicity is that the tax code of this country—the various acts that are passed through the parliament—seems to be getting bigger and bigger. We have dealt with thousands of pages of tax legislation in respect of the government's tax package. One of the arguments of the Liberal Party in the lead-up to the last election was that the system would be made simpler and that we have too much tax legislation in this country. Yet we keep getting bill after bill to deal with the introduction of the government's allegedly new simplified tax system.
I have touched on the first point of our second reading amendment: the fundamental unfairness of the GST. Many aspects of this issue have been debated, but today I want to go to two specific matters that I would like a response to from the Assistant Treasurer. It is good to see him in the Senate listening to this debate. And I would like a response to the two particular examples that I outlined to the chamber. I have received representations from a Mr Bush, who comes from my home state of Tasmania. Mr Bush is a national office bearer of the Packaged Ice Association of Australasia, and he is located in Tasmania. He came to see me some weeks ago to outline what the association justifiably regard as the unfairness of the application of the GST to ice. He made the point that ice does not attract the wholesale sales tax—it was not included in the previous wholesale sales tax regime—and that the Australian Taxation Office had issued a ruling in respect of ice. That ruling is contained in a letter dated 21 December 1999. It was pointed out to me by Mr Bush and a number of other people who have contacted me about this issue that the government, in its gazetting of the schedules and the definition of food, did not include ice. Ice is therefore not exempt from the GST because, in the government's opinion, ice is not a food. 
It is interesting to note in passing that water is exempt from a GST. There are some interesting issues to do with water that I will get to a little later. There is certainly good evidence that ice is a food. A code currently being reviewed by the Australia New Zealand Food Authority recommends that it is reasonable to assume that a packaged ice product is made by the freezing of water that is fit for human consumption. It may not be made—I will get to that point later. The labelling and appearance of a packaged ice product would indicate the value of a product. On page 17, the Review of the Food Standards Code1999 reads:
This code will outline standards for packaged water and water based beverages. Ice will be manufactured from water governed by the standards.
The ice association has worked extensively over a number of years to develop a nationally recognised code of practice.
Even though most people do not eat ice, it is added to other foods and also to beverages to keep them cool. It is very common that foods such as salads, fish products and many other dishes have ice added to them to keep them chilled—to keep their temperature down—and to keep them safe from bacteria. The ice comes into contact with these sorts of food; it becomes part of the food; it becomes an ingredient of the food. It therefore becomes a food in its own right.
What is interesting is that every food code in the states of Australia, I believe, defines ice as a food. In the code drafted by the National Food Authority, ice is specifically included in the definition of food. If the health authorities of this country accept, for very good reasons, that ice is a food, it stands to reason, I believe, that the government should have included ice within the regulations for the purposes of food. There are good reasons for including ice as a food in food standards in this country. It has to be handled and served with some care. There has to be some precaution in the way in which ice is used in foods. Apparently ice, like other foods, can go bad. Ice that is bad can make people sick. It can become contaminated if it is not kept clean and free of harmful bacteria. Scientific studies show that germs can grow on ice. Apparently ice is not a food substance that can be kept free of bacteria if it is not handled in the correct way. Bad water, which is the base product of ice, and improper handling in the serving of ice, such as with dirty hands or contaminated utensils, can have serious consequences for people's health. Fortunately in this country very few cases involving ice have led to food poisoning, but it has happened in some other countries with a quite serious impact on the health of people.
Turning to the fishing industry, fresh fish is packed in ice for transport to markets so it is kept in a safe and healthy condition. Another example that I have been given is that of broccoli, a well-known vegetable that has ice added to it when it is transported to market to maintain its colour and quality. That product is then onsold. The sellers of that product—in this case broccoli—cannot separate the ice from the broccoli. A significant proportion, if not all of it, will have melted by the time they sell the broccoli. There is a very compelling argument for ice to be treated in the same way as food. There is an interesting argument—it is not a semantic one—which is: at what point does water become ice? I would be interested to know from the minister whether there is a clear definition of what constitutes ice.
—More importantly, at what point does ice become water?
—Exactly, Senator Campbell; I was going to get to that point. At what point does ice become water? I would be interested to know whether there is a tax office definition of what constitutes ice and what constitutes water. 
—Hello, a roll-back!
—In this case we have a melt-back. If the ice becomes water it is not GSTable but, if it is ice, it is GSTable. Let me give you another example, Senator Kemp.
 (Senator Knowles)—Order! This is not a football match.
—Order! Senator Conroy, I have called the Senate to order.
—I would point out to you, Madam Acting Deputy President, and the chamber, that this is a very serious issue for the Packaged Ice Association of Australasia. Senator Kemp should not treat this it lightly. They have made submissions to me through their national representative who lives in Tasmania. They consider this is a very serious issue. Ice does not have a wholesale sales tax applied to it. That is another compelling example of the unfairness of the GST.
Coming back to ice as a product, what do you do if you have a mixed product which contains water and ice? What proportion of that product is GSTable? We know that water is not GSTable, but what about the ice content in the water? How would you determine what you pay the GST on? Would you take a container of water and ice, separate it and attempt to determine the proportion, presumably by volume? It is interesting because ice changes in volume once it melts: it is smaller than the volume of ice. But that is another serious problem you have. Putting aside the physics of ice, how do you determine what proportion of a water drink with ice is GSTable or not? How do you measure that? Even if you bother to measure it, by the time you get the water into the container and the ice out of the container, part of the ice has already melted. It has now turned to water, which is not GSTable, so you would have to transfer it to the other container. We have literally got a melting GST. This is an important issue for the Packaged Ice Association of Australasia and it highlights an absurd approach by the government towards this product.
There was a ruling given by the Australian Taxation Office. I do not blame the tax office because, when you look at the communication from the tax office, they are obviously basing their view on the regulations that the government drew up on what constitutes a food. As it turned out, I think it was a mistaken schedule. I do not know what the Australian Democrats were doing, why they did not give any consideration to ice and the complexity and the problems that ice causes if it is not included as a food. Most ice in this country is manufactured, but there are areas of Australia where water is ice naturally. It is not converted to ice in a manufactured process.
—Particularly on the west coast of Tasmania.
—I will take that interjection and I will rebut it because Tasmania has a very cool temperate climate. We do not find too much ice occurring naturally in Tasmania. I am thinking more of the practical example of the snowfields: in the middle of winter, someone up there has a glass of water; they come back to it and it has turned to ice, and they have to pay a GST. It might sound a far-fetched example but it does highlight the absurdity.
—We had the thermometers in the chickens; we are going to have to have thermometers in the water to determine whether or not it is ice and whether it has to attract GST. So it is an important issue for the Packaged Ice Association of Australasia. I would like to hear Senator Kemp's response on the rationale of why ice is not a food, despite the fact that the food codes in this country determine that ice is a food product. As I have mentioned, it is also important for the safety of food. You cannot in a practical way separate out the ice from the food that it is mixed with. So you have to pay GST on the ice but no GST on many of the food products that it is mixed with. 
There is one other point about ice that is interesting. In some parts of Australia, for safety reasons groups of workers in hot climates are provided with ice. This is actually a provision of their industrial awards and agreements when working in a hot climate. Again, it seems to me that reinforces the arguments that I put earlier about the nature of ice and the fact that it should not attract a GST. 
Having dealt with ice for a few minutes, I would now like to melt away to water, because I have had some issues that highlight the difficulties for water carriers. I would like Senator Kemp to respond to this as well. My understanding is that water is exempt from a GST. So for those of us who live in mainly an urban environment where we have water on tap, there is no GST payable. But I would like to put to Senator Kemp: what will happen with water carriers in rural and regional areas who purchase water and then on-sell it to people who are unfortunate enough not to have or be connected to water systems? Will water carriers who retail water to customers in rural and regional areas who put that water into tanks for consumption have to pay a GST on the water? I think that is a very important issue for people who live in rural and regional Australia. 
It seems to me that, if you have to pay a GST on water cartage where people are not connected to a water main system, that is discrimination against those people who live in rural and regional areas. To anticipate one possible argument the minister might put—that is, the water delivered by water carriers is not necessarily for human consumption—I think a person living in a rural and regional area that is very dry or in drought would find it a very expensive proposition to buy enormous quantities of water delivered by a carrier for anything other than personal use. This is an important issue. There must be hundreds of thousands of people in this country whose properties are not attached to water mains. As I say, if you are attached to a water main, you do not pay GST on water; but what is the situation in respect to carriage of water in tankers for human consumption? I also think there would be a significant problem in how you define wastage in those circumstances—a significant amount of the water would evaporate; a significant amount of it would be spilt—and how that would be treated in terms of GST that is payable by water carriers. They are two issues that I have touched on in the debate today. My time has almost ended.
—Yes, my time has almost evaporated. I think the two examples that I have touched on serve to highlight one of the points we made in our second reading amendment—the fundamental unfairness of a goods and service tax. We were supposed to get a simpler system, and yet the Labor opposition has been highlighting not just the two matters I raised today but many other examples of the particular practical problems in the introduction of a goods and services tax in this country. We believe the GST is bad for Australia and that it will not do anything to make the system fairer; it will make it more complicated. We are going to have over two million mainly small businesses collecting a tax. They are becoming tax collectors for the first time.

"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2000-04-04,"—I can understand the minister jumping to his feet and wanting to curtail this debate when one of my colleagues was speaking.
—We won't stop you, George.
—You certainly won't stop me. It will take much better than you, Rod, to stop me. Others have tried. I can understand you wanting to curtail the debate because every time we get a tax bill into this chamber—and we have a continuous stream of them now on a regular basis coming into this chamber—it provides an opportunity to the opposition to raise serious anomalies in this tax system.
This government started off by putting out a document saying that they would deliver a simpler tax system for Australia and for Australians. It would be understandable. We would get rid of the complexities of the complex tax system we currently have. It would be a simple, straightforward, understandable tax. At last count, the documentation weighed something like 5.1 kilos. We are now continually confronted with a stream of taxation bills coming through the parliament to be dealt with, and I am sure there will be many, many more of them before this sorry saga in our taxation history comes to a conclusion. 
—Which you now support, George.
—I actually support the Western Bulldogs and I hope that we do not have to pay GST on every goal that we beat Carlton by on a regular basis. After watching the game on Saturday, I am sure there would be no GST payable on the food that was being fed to the Western Bulldogs, because it was raw meat! Fed on raw meat as opposed to that highly processed food that you must be feeding the Blues on, which probably is GSTable! Obviously you have the wrong diet for your footballers and you have the wrong tax system for Australians.
The introduction of the A New Tax System (Tax Administration) Bill (No. 1) 2000 provides us with an opportunity to look at some of the issues that are raised in the context of the bill and some of the wider issues that are raised in the context of the taxation system overall. As you rightly said, Madam Acting Deputy President, this bill is fairly wide in its application and therefore allows for a fairly wide discussion of all the issues related to it. That also includes the business tax reform which is in part taken up by this bill relating to the PAYG payments. Yet we have not seen anything of substance on the table in respect of the bills relating to the business tax reform package. They will presumably dribble out into this chamber over time and we will get a look at them bit by bit.
—Do you support those, George?
—Yes, of course. We said we support it. We said we supported it on the basis that you honour all the commitments you gave back in November in relation to a series of issues, not the least of which was the issue dealing with contractors. This taxation debate is a bit like a penny arcade. Remember the old penny arcades? If you go to Echuca, Senator Kemp, they have still got one. You can go and have a look at it. You put a penny in—
—Senator Campbell, it would be helpful if you addressed your comments to the chair and not directly across the chamber to the minister.
—Through you, Madam Acting Deputy President—
—Not through me; to me.
—If ministers in this government who are responsible for the tax system and its implementation went and had a look at the penny arcade that is in Echuca, they would get a reflection of the way in which they are handling this debate. You put a penny in the machine, you crank the handle and you get the movie frame by frame. You do not get a continuous message, you get it frame by frame—and that is the way in which this government has chosen to deal with the tax package. This tax system is about to come into effect on 1 July. This bill ought have been titled the `tax maladministration system' for the way this government has handled it. It is due to come into effect on 1 July. I got a package of material last week in which there was a video, a CD card, posters and a range of other material. I had a look at them and I must admit that I had difficulty understanding the material that was in it. But I gave them to my father-in-law who is an accountant, and he had trouble understanding the substance of the material that was in it. He said it would take some time for him to comprehend all of the issues that were raised in that material.
We have only got three to four months before this tax system comes into effect. The ATO have put out a number of press releases advertising that they are holding tax seminars on Sky Channel for the small business community, to be screened on 20 March, 18
April, 9 May and 30 May. Isn't that a bit late? Isn't it a bit late for a tax system that is due to commence its effect on 1 July, in terms of business having the opportunity to comprehend and come to grips with the complexities of the issues they are going to have to deal with? In New South Wales, all the broadcasts are due to take place between 7 a.m. and 10 a.m., when most small businesses—and they are the ones that are going to be affected by this tax system more substantially than the big businesses—are trying to get their work force to work, trying to get their businesses up and operating, trying to actually earn a quid. Why has the ATO not programmed some of these screenings to occur in the evening, when some of these small business people may have the opportunity to actually watch and find out first hand from the ATO how the tax system will apply? 
—Out of touch.
—Totally out of touch with what the small business community are going to go through. But the small business community are not out of touch. The small business community know what they are confronting in terms of this tax system. They know the additional compliance that is going to be put on their shoulders. They know they are going to become the tax collectors for the government from 1 July and, more importantly, they do not like it. They do not like it at all. This is a tax that is universally despised out there in the small business community. The more information that is being put out—and maybe that is the reason why it has been delayed until the last minute—the more information that dribbles out about this tax system, how it will be administered and their involvement in the administration of it, the more they realise that they have been sold the biggest pup in a long, long time in respect of the role that they are going to have to play within it.
The same goes for the ABN. You would think it would be a simple process to apply for a business number. The ATO, again, have put out a press release heralding the fact that there have been one million applications received. But they have not heralded the fact that they have processed only about 75 per cent of them. I have one constituent from the south coast of New South Wales, who got in contact with my office last week, who wrote to the ATO four months ago for an ABN but who still has not received a reply. He has upgraded his accounting software and he has his $200 voucher, but it is useless to him because the supplier has not received his ABN yet. So in fact they cannot, at this stage, utilise the voucher.
I again say to you: my father-in-law has made four applications. He has written to the tax office on four occasions, he tells me, and they have not had the courtesy to even acknowledge receipt of his correspondence. Now I do not know if they have acknowledged receipt of any of the correspondence they have received, but he has not received any acknowledgment that he has written to them. I recall—and I think you may have been there, Senator Conroy—when we questioned staff from the tax office at estimates hearings. They said that they had got the problems all fixed and that there were no more problems. They said that there was a five-day turnaround, that it was all under control and not to worry, the system was working perfectly.
—Yes, I was there.
—The only place I think the system is working perfectly is in their minds, because it is not working perfectly anywhere else. There is a whole series of examples that one can go to that demonstrate the difficulties that people are confronted with in terms of the GST. My colleague Senator Hogg raised one last night, which was the example of the bakery. He read from a transcript of the Today program of 30 March, where Tracey Grimshaw, the presenter of that program, interviewed a Mr Morgan, who I presume owns a bakery, about the implications for that bakery. I do not want to go through all of the transcript, because Senator Hogg has already put most of it on the record. But there were silly little things, like two buns, one iced—not the ice that Senator Sherry was talking about; I presume this is ice made with caster sugar—
—Like an Iced Vo Vo.
—That is a very good description, Senator Conroy: like an Iced Vo Vo. But we are talking about icing on the top of the bun. If he puts icing on top of the bun, he has to pay GST. If he provides the bun with raisins in it, he does not have to pay the GST. But, if he puts a glazing on the top of the raisins, he does have to pay GST. That is one example. The transcript then goes on to give the example of a Turkish loaf. Mr Morgan says he was told that, if he put cracked pepper on the Turkish loaf, it was GSTable because it was food and production, and that if he did not put cracked pepper on the Turkish loaf, it was GST free. Then, Tracey Grimshaw asked: 
So do you pay GST on the cracked pepper that you buy, or is it food for human consumption by the time you've bought it?
MORGAN: Well I'm at the moment, I'm getting it tax free.
GRIMSHAW: Yes. After July the 1st?
MORGAN: That's right. I don't know. I'm not that good.
Mr Morgan then went on to say, which I think is a pretty telling point for most small businesses:
It gives me something to do at night—
and he is talking about working out the accounts and working out what is GSTable and what is not GSTable—
the late nights to work all the little sums out.
GRIMSHAW: You've invested $15,000 on infrastructure to cope with the GST. Is that going to sort out some of these accountancy problems for you?
MORGAN: It sorts out the retail accountancy problems...we employ a lot of staff, we have a café here as well. It sorts out, to a degree, what's going through...
GRIMSHAW: Well good luck to you. It sounds like a headache but thanks for joining us this morning.
That is just one example of the sort of confusion and complexity this tax system is creating within the community generally in terms of how individuals will interface, particularly people who are running small businesses, with the tax system—what will be their role, how will they manage it, what do they have to pay tax on and what do they not have to pay tax on? I think that, in a lot of situations, it is really going to be `suck it and see' on the way through.
There is a range of other issues that we can go to that only reinforce this complexity issue. Take the example of the caravan parks. The caravan parks are the classic confusion. Not only were the people who live in caravan parks confused and not only were the proprietors of caravan parks confused; members of the government were confused as to how the tax will apply to caravan parks. The Minister for Trade, Mark Vaile, prior to the 1998 election promised residents of caravan parks that they would be GST free. He made that promise to them. He was obviously wrong. He must have consulted everybody under the Treasurer. But he got it wrong, and he got it wrong in a big way.
What about the federal member for Richmond, Larry Anthony—isn't he in trouble at the next election? That is one of the reasons why I was up at Richmond a few weeks ago, when Senator Coonan also happened to be there. I do not know why Senator Coonan was there—probably trying to rescue Larry Anthony. But it was a wasted trip and a waste of time because he has gone. There are 6,649 permanent caravan park residents in the electorate of Richmond. There is not one of them who is going to vote for this government at the next election. I spoke to several of them on that weekend. One of them, I might add, who led the delegation and who was a long-standing National Party supporter of some 30 years said to me, pleaded with me, `Get us some material. Get us some leaflets up and I will personally distribute them to the 6,649 Labor voters who live in caravan parks in the electorate of Richmond, come the next election.'
The Minister for Community Services, the member for Richmond, will not go near the place. Every time they ring his office, he is missing. He is in Canberra. They ring Canberra and he is in Richmond. They ring Richmond and they are told, `He is out doing his job; he is not available.' He cannot be found. He is getting a reputation a bit like Senator Heffernan, the ghost that walks.
—The ghost that stalks.
—I am not so sure he does that. 
—He is young enough; you never know these days. Certainly he is becoming known as the grey ghost in the electorate, because he cannot be found, he is never available, and he certainly does not know what he is talking about in terms of the subject. But there was some honesty in the government on this issue, and it came from the member for Gilmore, Joanna Gash. She would be struggling to hold her seat, too, come the next election, but at least she is more honest. She realises the difficulty she is in, and she was distancing herself from this government. She said it was a discriminatory tax on where you live. She said it was a stuff-up. There is no other explanation. She put it plainly on the table.
The most humiliating thing of all was when the Deputy Prime Minister, John Anderson, said the tax would be reviewed and reconsidered, and, within a matter of hours, he had to back down—humiliated by the Treasurer, who said there would be no reconsideration at all. There is a range of other examples—the auto industry, for example. The Prime Minister said during the 1998 election campaign that the price of cars would drop by 8.8 per cent. Two months ago, at Senate estimates, the minister responsible for the industry actually admitted that the price of cars may fall but that they would be dearer after 1 July. We are still trying to work out the mathematics of that little gem, but what he said is true. He was actually honest about the position. Then, within a matter of days, Senator Kemp, in response to a question in this chamber, reverted to what the Prime Minister said prior to the election—that cars, after 1 July, would be 8.8 per cent cheaper. We are used to the sorts of answers we get from Senator Kemp in this chamber, so we did not put too much store in what he said—in the same way we did not put too much store in what the Prime Minister said prior to the election. After all, if you look at the Prime Minister's statements from 1995 on, there is a litany of broken promises all the way through—promises that became non-core promises that became broken promises that suddenly just fell off the end of the table. The greatest one of all was the `never, ever' statement: `We will never, ever introduce a goods and services tax.' That is what the Prime Minister said prior to the 1996 election: `never, ever'.
Let me tell you, Senator Kemp, that the Australian public at the next election will say to the Prime Minister: `You will never, ever do it to us again'. That is, if his own front bench does not get him first. That is if the Treasurer, with the plotting and the planning that is going on behind the scenes, does not get him first. That is if the coup is not in place before the next election.(Time expired)",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (TAX ADMINISTRATION) BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,2000-04-04,"—I rise to speak on the A New Tax System (Tax Administration) Bill (No. 1) 2000. It is important that we address the issue of fairness in respect of the GST. Given that this tax administration bill has a lot of application to business within the country, I probably could not start anywhere other than the Yellow Pages Small Business Index of February 2000. I think it is relevant for Senator Kemp, the minister responsible for the implementation of the GST and the minister for no answers. It states:
Small business support for the GST—
and the minister should take note of this—
has deteriorated sharply over the past three months. While more than half of small business proprietors are still in favour of the GST—
—Ah!
—We heard you singing praises about how you had them all in your pocket, so listen to this:
almost 40% are now against the new tax. Of those opposed to the new tax, the overwhelming majority are strongly opposed.
Nearly three-quarters of small business proprietors are concerned about the GST complexity.
Which goes to the very heart of this legislation. This is how you are applying the complexity. This is what the minister is responsible for. It says:
The majority of small businesses agreed that the GST will adversely affect their bottom line with almost 40% strongly agreeing with this statement.
I have to say: if that is not a condemnation of the minister responsible for— 
—Failure.
—Indeed. I take Senator Conroy's interjection: the failed minister for the implementation of the GST. It is true, and, as I said before, the minister for no answers. In terms of fairness, this new tax system was supposed to have benefits for all. It was supposed to have compensation built into it to cover every aspect of whether or not there was a price increase or whether or not there was an inflation increase—which the government told us was going to be only 1.9 per cent. It is now freely acknowledged by everybody except the government, and it is even acknowledged by some people in the government, that inflation is now more likely to be well in excess of 5½ per cent.
Then there is the issue of petrol. When you are out there talking to the punters during the course of an election campaign, what do you say? You look at things that are likely to affect them most—and petrol is one of them. What did the government say during the course of their submission to the Australian public about why we should have a new tax system? They said, `Petrol will be cheaper, cars will be cheaper, just about everything will be cheaper.' But the chickens will come home to roost for Senator Kemp—the failed minister for the implementation of the GST; the minister with no answers about the implementation of the GST. In August 1998, prior to the federal election, the Prime Minister said, `The ordinary motorist will not pay any more for petrol. But, of course, they will not get that reduction. They will not pay any more. It won't go up. The price at the pump will be the same.' That was a very interesting statement. The very strident Treasurer, Mr Peter Costello, even went one further, I think. He promised just one month later that no petrol price anywhere would rise as a result of the GST. Mr Mark Vaile—I think he was then the primary industries minister—said the same when appealing to the punters out there in rural Australia. Indeed, the government even said that the gap between country and city petrol prices would not increase. We have asked many questions about how they are going to manage that, and we are yet to receive an answer as to how that is going to be the case. In reality, it cannot be the case. If the minister thinks—by his puzzled look when I made that statement—that somehow his rebate system is the solution, I suggest he think again. But I will come to that a bit later.  
It is important to deal with what has been almost a fraud on the Australian public with regard to what they were told, what is now happening and what will happen after 1 July 2000. Joe Hockey, the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, went on 2UE and said that the price of petrol would actually fall. And that was not prior to the federal election; indeed, it was on 14 January this year. Of course, we did not hear too much from the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation after that because I think he got a severe belt around the ear. But on 8 February 2000 the minister responsible for the implementation of the GST, Senator Kemp, informed the Senate Economics Legislation Committee during estimates that petrol prices need not rise. I suspect that they will rise, and I think most Australians now believe that petrol prices will rise.
—We'll wait and see.
—I take that interjection from the minister. He says, `Wait and see.' I will come back to the rebate system that the minister proposed—you know: `Line up for your coupon. Get your coupons here.' Nobody believes that will work—not one person. Despite the fact that the Commonwealth government have tried to say that the states have some rebate process in place, it has been stated by the Australian Automobile Association that, whilst the rebate system is paid to the petrol wholesaler, none of the money—not one cent of it—finds its way to the consumer. These are the people whom the government told that petrol prices—depending on whose version you take—would either be cheaper or not go up. Even before an estimates committee the minister said that petrol prices need not rise. But they have not come into this chamber nor the other chamber and explained how they are going to make that work. Frankly, they cannot explain it. 
The Treasurer, prior to the election and even after the election—indeed, right up until early this year—when he was confronted by the very clear difficulty of delivering this promise to the Australian public suddenly thought, `Oops, we need a back-out clause,' and said on the Sunday program, `Obviously there are limits on this.' There are going to be limits on it all right. It will just be interesting to see what limit they can put on how much petrol rises. Then, of course, a few days later the Prime Minister—I don't know; there must be some internal struggle going on over there—restated his `unqualified guarantee'. He said: `I can only repeat what patently is our case; that is, we are going to honour our commitment.' I assume the commitment is that petrol prices will not rise and that the gap between city and country petrol prices will not increase. We will wait and see just how the government contort themselves to manage this in a way that will actually deliver their promise to the consumers. In his closing remarks, Senator George Campbell mentioned the `never ever' statement: `We will never ever have a GST.' It is an interesting statement, coming from a Prime Minister who once described himself as Lazarus. But it will be very interesting to see how we proceed with the implementation of the GST. 
Insofar as there is compensation for this package, businesses can get $200 if they register for the ABN. That is supposed to somehow compensate them. The poor old businesses that have been responding to the questionnaire for the Yellow Pages Small Business Index do not seem to think that that is of too much use. On 11 November 1998, the Treasurer said that the government have more compensation in their package than is required to make sure that low income earners are protected in relation to tax change. Senator Kemp—the minister responsible for the implementation of the GST—has come in here and said time and time again that there are tax cuts. It has been acknowledged and, frankly, just about everybody now accepts that your tax cuts are not going to compensate for the price increases across the board. 
In terms of price increases, it was very interesting, in respect of beer, to note how you actually dealt with that issue, given what you had promised, what actually happened and what has been proven to have happened. It is just amazing that the compensation package that you say you had, based on a 1.9 per cent increase in inflation, has been blown out the door, as has every other aspect of the claims that you have made. Take things such as cheaper motor vehicles: you were rushing around prior to the last federal election saying that cars would be cheaper; you were going to take off the 32 per cent, 36 per cent or whatever tax that may have been applicable to vehicles and replace it with a 10 per cent GST and therefore vehicles would be cheaper. The Australian public know that is not going to be the case. They know they have been hoodwinked about that issue.
Look at the complexity that you are going to wreak upon the businesses of this country and even non-profit organisations. I will give you, Minister—through you, Mr Acting Deputy President—the example of a non-profit organisation that runs a raffle. I really think the minister responsible for the implementation of the GST ought to listen to this. It runs a raffle, it sells tickets in the raffle and it has a cash prize. As I understand the application of the GST to be on that example, you take the funds raised by the sale of tickets, you take out the value of the cash prize and the GST is applicable to the remainder. But, if you run a raffle and you have, for instance, a meat tray or a television or a radio or some tangible object as a prize other than a cash prize, the GST is applicable to all of the funds raised by the sale of tickets for the raffle. It is then up to the non-profit organisation to make a claim for a credit on the input tax part of their revenue raising, so they do actually have to make a claim for the cost of the prize. In the case of some prizes—say, meat trays—some non-profit organisations that may be raising money to contribute to a playground in the local community et cetera will probably get a lot of those prizes donated. I would ask the minister to verify whether that is not the case, because it is my understanding that the tax office may have issued a ruling in this respect. I would be interested in what the minister has to say about that. 
Of course, we know that most businesses, as has been identified by the Yellow Pages Small Business Index, expect that the GST will affect their bottom line. What I have found interesting with the introduction of the GST is the maintenance of the dollar value in terms of the profit on a particular item. If it had a sales tax applicable to it, you take off the sales tax and it has a new GST applicable to it. But if there were a dollar value profit in that particular item, the business could actually maintain it. That is, if they got $1.50 in profit for something that had a wholesale sales tax on it, they could maintain that under the GST. If the wholesale sales tax were, say, 32 per cent and then you applied a new 10 per cent GST, obviously your profit would not be as great. But they would be allowed to actually increase the price, and that seems to be a contradiction given the claims by the ACCC and the government that no price could rise by more than 10 per cent. This is a whole area of discrepancy with regard to the application of this. It was put to me some time ago by some small business people that they would actually have to increase their margin, by the order of about eight per cent, just to stand still under the GST.
All of these things that are now happening out there were denied by the government, both prior to and shortly after the last federal election, and now the chickens are coming home to roost. The closer we get to 1 July, the more problems there are unfolding for this government in respect of the introduction of the GST. It is clearly the case that businesses, in terms of information seeking and registering for an ABN, are having great difficulty. The forms that they are required to fill out are convoluted and there are problems, to the extent that the government is spending millions of dollars on an education campaign because, frankly, all of this—even if it had been nationally agreed—is being rushed no end. This is creating a lot of angst for business people. There is total confusion for business people and, more importantly, as I said at the outset, we have a government that set itself up as an honest government and said it would have a budget honesty program in place but, if you take account of all of its claims, not one of them stands up.
—The Charter of Budget Honesty is one of the most recognised of documents.
—The Charter of Budget Honesty—thank you, Senator McGauran.
—It is recognised around the world.
—Yes, for its failure. Of course it is recognised but it is for its failure, because the government have just not followed it. They have tried to paint themselves as the vision of honesty and integrity but they have not delivered on all these things. Honesty was clearly not a core promise, because you have not kept any of the promises you spoke about in respect of the GST—not one. If it were about motor vehicles being cheaper or whatever, one would have thought that you could have at least maintained one promise, but you have not—not one.
—Are you telling me that they will not be cheaper?
—Senator McGauran obviously has a view that motor vehicles are going to be cheaper. Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, I invite him to stand up and tell us how this is going to be so and to give a guarantee on behalf of the government to the Australian people that motor vehicles will definitely be cheaper. It would be very interesting to have a member of the National Party stand up on behalf of the Australian government and give a guarantee to the Australian people that motor vehicle prices will go down, a guarantee that if people line up after 1 July to buy a motor vehicle it will be cheaper.
—They are now.
—The guarantee that they will be cheaper after the implementation of the GST—that is, that the GST will make motor vehicles cheaper—is a guarantee that you can give, Senator McGauran, to the Australian public on behalf of Prime Minister John Howard and this government. The Australian public would receive it well.
As has been said by others, there is a whole plethora of issues, whether you are buying iced cakes, lollies or whatever the case might be. This is a government in total disarray. The circumstances it now finds itself in, in trying to introduce a GST, are just unbelievable. The business community is saying, `Hang on, this is not what we were told when the ANTS package was first put out into the ether.' This government has got to come clean. It owes an explanation to the public and it should give it. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (TAX ADMINISTRATION) BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2000-04-04,"—I rise to speak to the amendment moved by Senator Quirke yesterday to the A New Tax System (Tax Administration) Bill (No. 1) 2000. I was talking before about the troubles that the tax office were having, but I just want to divert from that because I think it is important, when talking to this amendment, that many views are canvassed. I think the most interesting contribution on the unfairness of this GST was in Saturday's paper by that well-known National Party member, Mr Katter. I know that Senator McGauran, who is in the chamber, will rise to the defence of Mr Katter if I misrepresent Mr Katter in any way whatsoever. National Party loyalty will come to the fore and, if I misrepresent one word that Mr Katter has had to say, Senator McGauran will be on his feet instantly.
—Take note, Julian.
—Senator McGauran should take note, Senator Murphy. Mr Katter is quoted in an article in the Age on Saturday, 1 April under the heading `Katter blasts at GST “horror”'. The article goes on to say:
There was a `horrific' fear of the GST in the community and the tax would cost the Howard government the next election, according to the maverick Federal National Party MP, Mr Bob Katter ...
Mr Katter said that as he travelled around his electorate he was meeting widespread hostility to the GST. `It will utterly destroy the Government throughout regional Australia, that's the general opinion universally,' Mr Katter said. `You've only got to look at Canada, the worst defeat in 500 years of democracy anywhere, after they introduced a GST.' 
Mr Katter said he was getting `horrific' feedback from constituents, especially those in small business, who were fearful about the GST. `It's the confusion, the extra bookwork, having to do their tax returns four times a year, things like that,' he said. `The only people who are not worried about the GST are in Canberra, and they are the ones who should be most worried.
I invite Senator McGauran, if I have misrepresented Mr Katter, to jump to his feet right now—
—Mr Acting Deputy President—
 (Senator Sherry)—Order! Senator McGauran, it was a rhetorical statement. Under the standing orders it is not allowed. Please resume your seat.
—You will note, Mr Acting Deputy President—
—Is this a point of order?
—A clarification. I cannot stand on a clarification?
—No, you must sit down.
—I think you have been uncharitable to Senator McGauran there, Mr Acting Deputy President. I think the chamber deserved to hear the clarification. It was a hard ruling, but I guess you have to uphold some standards.
As I said, Mr Katter has rung the bell on this government and rung the bell on the National Party and where it has gone.
—Is that the bloke that Senator Alston likes so much?
—What did Senator Alston call him? A national disgrace. Again, I am waiting for Senator McGauran to jump to his feet to defend Mr Katter. It was disappointing that National Party members did not take the opportunity to defend their colleague, but I guess loyalty does not run as thick as it used to in the National Party.
—The National Country Party.
—No, someone else has registered that name now, Senator McGauran. I do not think you even own it. The message that Mr Katter is sending to this government is being joked about. It is nervous giggles at first, but it is being ridiculed just in the way that yesterday, when we were trying to discuss the problems of a bakery, or today, when we were trying to discuss the problems faced by the packaged ice industry, we got laughter and ridicule. That is the view of this government towards the problems small business are facing: laughter and ridicule. But I am willing to bet that Senator McGauran and Peter McGauran, colleagues of Mr Katter, were not laughing after the local council elections in Victoria recently when the GST rose up again and claimed their entire support base. Every councillor associated, affiliated or friends with the National Party in Gippsland was wiped out; every single councillor. It was just like the councillors in Mansfield; Mr McNamara's friends were wiped out. Every councillor associated with the GST who was a National Party supporter was wiped out in Mansfield.  
It was a terrible thumping right across Victoria, right across Melbourne. For the first time in Victoria, you saw the Labor Party claim control, and the mayoralty, in Frankston. That is the marginal seat of Dunkley, in case you were wondering, Senator Murphy. You saw the Labor Party claim control of the city of Hume. McEwen is another marginal seat claimed. What happened in the eastern suburbs seats of Deakin, Aston and La Trobe? The Labor Party cleaned out Liberals everywhere. The response to the GST is out there if you are willing to listen. Mr Katter is telling it as it is in regional Australia, and all we get from the government is ridicule of the problems.
—No answers.
—No answers and ridicule—the government is ridiculing small business. I want to return to one of the themes I was talking about yesterday: the problems that the ATO were having in recruiting people for their 100 specialist staff positions. There was an interview with a woman from Canada who responded to an advertisement. She is considering moving to Australia and making use of her expertise in combating GST fraud, in which there was an upsurge in Canada after the introduction of the GST in 1993. She talks about a number of scams that were engaged in over there. One of them is that some people indeed collected the GST but did not report it to Revenue Canada. Another is that people avoided the GST net by suppressing their sales figures and the like.
I always enjoy highlighting Canada's experience with the GST, noting that the governing party in Canada which introduced the GST had more members than the Howard government before their GST election but came back following the election with only two members. That is the message. That is what happened in Canada. That is what happened in Mansfield to the Liberals and the Nationals. That is what happened in Gippsland. That is the message for this government, which does not want to heed the GST impact. And while I do not expect the coalition to be left with just two seats after the next election, if I were a coalition marginal seat holder, I would be very nervous. If I were the member for McEwen, Dunkley, Aston, Deakin or La Trobe, I would be very nervous. But it goes beyond that, as was shown in Mansfield and will be shown in Gippsland. Senator McGauran's brother, Minister McGauran, is the member there, and I would be very nervous if I were him. Those Ingram supporters are after their next scalp at the next election, Senator McGauran, and you know it. In your bones you know you have got a problem down there.
Just ask Mr Larry Anthony or Ms Joanna Gash what they think their chances are of surviving the next election. We have seen Mr Anthony deliberately give his constituents false hope over the issue of the GST on long-term caravan park residents—Senator Campbell has already referred to it. Mr Anthony has now had to resort to untruths and, if it were not unparliamentary to do so, one could say he has lied to try to save his political skin. I do not think the electorate will fall for it, and we on this side have no doubt that Mr Anthony will be one of the first casualties of the GST, which this government is too afraid to even mention in its taxpayer funded propaganda campaign. If there are any doubts as to what a nightmare on main street this tax is, no one needs to look any further than the bumblings of the Acting Assistant Treasurer at the time, Mr Hockey, and the number of times he put his foot in his mouth—the smartest politician! You went up in my estimate, Senator Kemp. You were away over Christmas and you left Mr Hockey to it. You did not come rushing back from your holidays like the Prime Minister. You stayed on holidays. You knew when it was a good time to be away, Senator Kemp. You went up in my estimation during that month because you left Mr Hockey to put his foot in his mouth over the GST in January of this year. If this were Minister Hockey's attempt to instil small business with confidence about how easy the GST will be, then I would hate to see his attempts to explain to them how supposedly simple and easy the PAYG system will be. But let us look at some of Minister Hockey's foot-in-mouth efforts— 
—I thought you were in favour of Mr Hockey.
—Mr Hockey is a very good minister, I have to say. There is bipartisan support for his initiatives in the global finance area. There is no question of that, and Mr Hockey deserves some of the credit that he has been getting. I am quite prepared to say that on the public record. But, as Mr Hockey mused when we were overseas, he did have a tough time in January. Let us revisit that time to emphasise again the complexity of the GST for small business. Firstly, he said:
Tollway operators in Sydney who round up to minimise the number of coins would be prosecuted ...
He went on:
I'll use all the power available to me to go after these toll companies if they try to take advantage of the introduction of the GST.
On 14 January, Mr Hockey said:
Rounding up is allowed. What the ACCC have said is that, if there is an odd number within a $1 range, then a company can round it up to $1 or down to zero, but they are not allowed to make any money out of it.
On 15 January, a day later, Minister Hockey said:
Rounding up has limits. No prices will increase by more than 10 per cent as a result of the GST.
On 17 January, Minister Hockey had his fourth go at it, effectively saying that rounding up has `flexible' limits. He said:
No prices should rise by more than 10 per cent as a result of the GST.
The bottom line is that, if Minister Hockey could not understand how the GST worked, how are the million-plus small businesses who were listening to this convoluted, inconsistent, flip-flopping explanation from the then Acting Assistant Treasurer going to understand it? To highlight this, my colleague in the other place Mr Thomson gave the case of Clubs Victoria, which had contacted him with their GST nightmare. This is what he told the House:
Recently I was contacted by Clubs Victoria, which has received verbal advice from the ACCC that they could increase their membership subscription by 10 per cent. They advised their member clubs of this only to subsequently receive a letter from the ACCC indicating that they had no such authorisation and that clubs which set membership fees would be obliged to calculate whatever savings they might be able to achieve as a result of the GST and pass them on to their members, even if this meant subsequent partial refunds of membership fees. That sort of arrangement involves ordinary clubs in an astonishing degree of paperwork and administrative red tape over relatively small amounts of money. It takes ordinary clubs into an area of price and fee setting that they certainly have not been in before, and I think it imposes on them undue hardship. 
This is a perfect illustration of the degree of complexity and uncertainty that this government has created, aided and abetted by the incompetence of the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, and his protégé, Mr Hockey. To add to the concerns, it was reported in the Financial Review that, after the re-release of the ACCC guidelines, four key industry groups—the Business Council of Australia, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Australian Retail Association and the Food and Grocery Council—all had reservations about what they described as the draconian nature of the ACCC pricing laws, and these are the final guidelines.
I mentioned before the 7,000-plus rulings which so far have been given by the ATO because one of the difficulties which business has is in getting advice from the tax office. There have been complaints about inconsistent advice from the tax office help lines. The office of the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Meg Lees, has been receiving calls from people who say that the tax office or coalition members of parliament have referred them to the Democrats—talk about passing the buck. I do not know whether or not Senator Lees considers it appropriate to have the ATO and coalition members referring queries to her office, but I would actively encourage members of the public and in particular small business to contact Senator Lees's office and have her office explain the GST to them. After all, it is the Democrats' GST.  
It was the Democrats who gave us the distinction between GST-free bread and GSTable bread if it has icing on it. Under the Democrats, GSTable bread is `bread, including buns, with a sweet filling or coating'. What happens if the filling or coating is not sweet? What happens if the filling or coating is bitter? Does that mean it is no longer GSTable? I do not know, but I am sure, if we ask the Democrats, that they will be able to tell us as it is their tax. The GST is a Democrat tax, and anybody who has a query about the Democrats' GST should ring the office of the Leader of the Democrats, Senator Lees, or the office of their tax spokesman, Senator Murray. While they are at it, they might also want to ask Senator Lees why casino high rollers are a higher priority for the Democrats than small business, charities, education or women.
Lastly, I would ask the Senate to support the second reading amendment moved by the opposition. The three issues covered in the second reading amendment go to the important issues of the inherent unfairness of the GST, the enormous compliance burden faced by small business and the further compliance burden that small businesses will face from the introduction of the PAYG system. I have not spoken in depth in regard to the second reading amendment, as I am sure some of my colleagues may follow me.
There is one final issue which I want to draw to your attention and it is of such a serious nature. Yesterday, I read that Mr Carmody has cancelled his overseas trip because the tax office are facing an unprecedented crisis in confidence in the broader community, as well as low morale in their own organisation, and that is not trying to buy into the so-called Petroulias affair. This is a more fundamental problem which has the Australian public leaving the seminars being organised by the tax office shaking their heads saying, `They could not answer my questions.' I wish I had a dollar for every small business person who has contacted me to say, `I've been to one of the ATO seminars and they could not answer my questions.' I am hoping that Senator Kemp can answer a couple of very simple questions.
Mr John Raymond, who heads up the Independent Liquor Group Cooperative, would like to know what is going on in this industry. I hope Senator Kemp is listening because this is one of the issues I hope he will address when he responds. An article by George Megalogenis in the Weekend Australian of 1-2 April states:
John Raymond says the Government assured him that the new tax rates for alcohol to go with the GST would be released last September. `Then it was October, then not November or December because people would be on holidays, then February, then early March, now they tell us the end of this month,' says Raymond.
We have a lot of work to do data processing, changing our systems, but we can't advise our members of the new prices. My printer is looking at a blank sheet. My members would be pulling their hair out.
That is the impact. That is what this government is putting small business through. They are pulling their hair out, on their own admission. The article continues:
The Government has also been slow in releasing the so-called maps of which country towns qualify for cheaper diesel fuel. ...
It seems the ATO has a leave-it-to-last-minute approach. Mr George Megalogenis is somebody who, in the past, has expressed support—he is well known to the Treasurer's office—in print for the GST. He says:
Matthews and his boss, taxation commissioner Michael Carmody, have boasted that the GST will turn out to be a non-event like the millennium bug. However, there are clear signs the ATO no longer buys its own line. It has relaxed the deadlines for regular tax payments made by business to clear the path for small firms to apply for their Australian Business Numbers. 
The Orwellian ID—that is what you are putting small business through. Mr Megalogenis describes this as `the Orwellian ID they need to be part of the new tax system'. He continues:
The ATO has already received evidence that small business people are choosing to take early retirement or return to the paid work force rather than face the GST.
A regular ATO study has found this. I will be very interested in getting access to that study, Senator Kemp. I am hoping you may even be willing to provide it to the Senate because it has some very interesting information, according to Megalogenis. The article continues:
Kennards is one of the first businesses prepared to admit it has completed its GST preparations. Managing director Peter Lancken ... expects his prices will increase by 8 per cent ... but cannot be sure until all his suppliers have first told him what they are doing ... 
What will annoy the Government is that 8 per cent is a pretty big number for a business whose bread and butter is machinery, which carries the 22 per cent sales tax. The theory of the tax package is that these companies will save millions in sales tax, which will help keep price rises well below the 10 per cent rate of the GST.
But Lancken says ... for the Government's plan to work, he would need to replace his entire stock on July 1.
`What makes all the money is the equipment that's in our fleets,' he says. `The replacement value is $60 million to $70 million ...'
So what is the answer? What cost is Mr Lancken going to face? What price rise will you allow him to have?",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (TAX ADMINISTRATION) BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2000-04-04,"—Mr Acting Deputy President, I have listened to this debate, as I always do. I think I am regarded as a very attentive minister, and certainly for my patience it was difficult on this. During the second reading debate speeches it was a particular problem for me because of the quality of the speeches, by and large. There were some exceptions. Senator Murray, I thought, made a very interesting contribution. Senator Murray is a man whom I do not always agree with but he brings great credit to himself and great credit to the Senate with the way he conducts himself.
—You are shameless.
—I might say that if I have a criticism of Senator Murray it is for his amazing good humour in dealing with you, Senator Conroy. He shows an admirable restraint which I am not sure that I can match in every respect. I have noticed that minister after minister stands up here after second reading debate speeches, thanks senators for their contributions and says how interesting it all was. I shall vary this slightly. I said there were a couple of exceptions and there were some aspects of some people's contributions which were worth listening to but, by and large, this was the worst series of second reading debate speeches that I have heard for a very long time.
—That is what you said last week.
—I was distressed, actually, because there was an attempt by certain people, Senator Conroy—although I will not name them because I am not that sort of person—to blame a very worthy Labor Party adviser for the low quality of the speeches, Jody Fassina. There was an argument that Jody had written these speeches. From a person who has listened to speeches and long admired Mr Fassina's work, that is clearly untrue. I just wish to go on record that I do not accept that. There was an attempt in the lobbies to blame Jody Fassina for the low quality of certain speeches. My first bit of advice to Senator Conroy—and you know that I am slightly older than you, Senator Conroy, so I can give you some advice with the experience of years—is: do not write your own speeches. That is the advice I give you. You should ask Mr Fassina to make sure that he prepares some of these speeches for you. It would assist us all and would make sure that the debate remained more on course.
There was a range of issues raised, virtually none of which had anything to do with the bill before the chamber, except that I must say that when Senator Conroy read out aspects of the EM he basically got it right. He can read and he could read the EM, and we of course listened with interest as he went through it and told us what was in the bill. But that had no effect on Senator Conroy, nor on any of the other speakers, regardless of what was in the bill and regardless of what this bill deals with. I might say that the Labor Party, if I take it correctly, supports all aspects of this bill. There will not be any amendments; there will not be any divisions, hopefully, in the committee stage. 
—There is a second reading amendment.
—What about my amendment?
—There is a second reading amendment which has been created by Senator Conroy and moved by Senator Quirke. Of course, we will be opposing that particular amendment, which is particularly unworthy.
—Why?
—I have been provoked and, as I said, I am not normally easily provoked.
—Hopefully, Carlton will win next week.
—What on earth Carlton's recent performance has got to do with this bill obscures me, but it was referred to by virtually every speaker. Mr Acting Deputy President, because you are a man who is renowned for his balance—quite apart from his skill with fly-fishing—his fairness and his judgment, let me tell you what is wrong with this second reading amendment. Let me just take part (a) of the amendment, `the fundamental unfairness of a goods and services tax'. 
—Seconded!
—That is very interesting, because as we all know the Labor Party has now incorporated support for a GST into its platform. As I said, I would not have debated this except for the second reading debate speeches and for Senator Quirke's interesting contribution. Senator Quirke got one thing right, and I have raised this virtually every time I have got up to speak, Senator Quirke—
—I am the president of your fan club. I am the secretary of your club and the only member.
—I have a few silent admirers over there. Senator Quirke got this right: I have raised the issue of the Labor Party's attitude to the GST on quite a number of occasions, and I have asked my staff to check with the `taking note of answers' to see whether anyone has queried my arguments about the Labor Party and the GST. Speaker after Labor speaker has failed to tackle this issue head on. I will give you this, Senator Quirke: you attempted to tackle this issue head on and you inadvertently revealed the absurdity of the Labor Party position. You have adopted this formulation, `Bring back all these bills'—as if, after 72 hours, Senator Quirke, I would bring back all those bills. It is a very bold statement. `Bring back all these bills,' says Senator Quirke, `and then you will see where we stand.' I am not going to bring back those bills. 
The issue, when we go to the next election, will be: where does the Labor Party stand on the GST? Is the GST going to form part of the Labor Party platform? The answer is: yes, it is. That is the answer, despite all this nonsense that went on in the second reading debate speeches and concerns about this issue and concerns about that issue. We have all noted one issue with the Labor Party's GST policy: there is a roll-back. But the question is: where is the roll-back? The other question is: how much does the roll-back cost?
—How much are your tax cuts going to cost at the next election? 
—It is not up to me to advise the Labor Party, although I notice that, in the spirit of goodwill, Senator Conroy did advise us what to do and how to improve our electoral fortune. So let me just return the compliment, Senator Conroy. We have listened very carefully to the concerns that Labor Party senators have on aspects of the GST. We know they have adopted the philosophy of a GST, as they should. That is no surprise. The issue is the roll-back. A lot of Labor Party senators have gone on record in this debate—and, I might say, in other debates—to say, and have raised expectations amongst a variety of people in the wider community, that somehow the issues they have raised— 
—How big are the tax cuts?
—Don't get sensitive, Senator Conroy. It took great control, but I listened to you in absolute silence.
—That's an absolute fib! That is a blatant misleading of this chamber.
—Well, with one or two very minor exceptions, I listened to you in absolute silence. This is the dilemma that I think you now have. Senator after senator stands up and draws attention to issues that they think the government should address. As we run towards the next election it will be very interesting to see whether they form part of the roll-back. If you say that the GST is a major electoral problem, let me say that you said that before the last election.
—And you lost 19 seats.
—Senator, we happen to be over here, and you happen to be over there. It was not that big a problem. I happen to be standing here and you happen to be sitting there, as you will be for a long time. The next election will be different. Let me tell you why it will be different. The Labor Party will have a GST policy in its election platform. The question then will be: in what areas will the Labor Party alter the GST? And all these groups will look very carefully at what people like Senator Sherry, Senator Hogg and Senator George Campbell have said. I would just caution you, Senators, that in a recent shadow cabinet discussion, Lindsay Tanner, who is your shadow finance minister, warned the frontbench about committing an ALP government to further roll-backs of the GST `for fear the party would be left short of funds to fund its social programs'.
When the public wake up to the fact that, despite all the nonsense that has been going on in this chamber for an interminable period of time that the Labor Party actually support a GST in their program, I would hate to think what the electoral consequences will be for the Labor Party. The electorate will quite rightly believe that this is one of the most hypocritical parties in Australian history. `We are so opposed to the GST, but we are actually adopting the GST.' We are talking about what they see as the potential problems of the GST, but the question is: are these part of the roll-back? It is a valid question on our side and I would urge the press, every time a Labor senator gets up and complains about the GST, to say, `Excuse me, Senator Hogg, is this part of the roll-back?'
—How big is the tax cut?
—Senator, I know you are sensitive on this, and I know this is not quite the Labor Party message, but let me tell you that I will be talking about the Labor Party GST policy from here until the next election and I will probably start preparing a list—thanks to Senator Hogg, Senator Murphy and Senator Conroy—of the sorts of issues that the Labor Party think may be part of their roll-back. I think you are raising hopes and expectations that you will not be able to deliver. The Labor Party have avoided policy for a pretty long time and probably rightly so, given the quality of the frontbench. I mean, you wouldn't ask John Faulkner to develop forest policy, would you? The truth of the matter is that the Labor Party, as they go to the next election, are going to have to have a few policies. We know that your major tax policy is that the Labor Party will keep the GST. That is what we know the Labor Party will do. Then we know that the Labor Party have promised certain roll-backs. Best of luck, but let us keep the list going. The Labor Party are not going to promise to keep the tax cuts. I wonder why that is. I wonder why the Labor Party will not give any guarantee to keep the massive tax cuts that we are delivering. Could it be that you need to fund the roll-back? I will be drawing attention to that day after weary day. I think we are probably about to sound the siren. A number of questions were put to me, and I will seek to respond to those tomorrow—because I always try to help the Labor Party—on an agreement that we will speed the journey tomorrow.
Debate interrupted. ",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (TAX ADMINISTRATION) BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-04-04,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
This document is the government's response to the Department of Family and Community Affair's report entitled Review of the measure to extend carer payment eligibility to carers of children with a profound disability—final report. This is the government's response to the review which reviewed the new assessment tool for payments to the carers of children with a profound disability, which was introduced in July 1998. The review occurred because of a concern that many families were failing to qualify for the payment because of the strict guidelines imposed. A number of community groups and families believe the current criteria are far too rigid and do not recognise the care needs of some of the most common genetic disorders, syndromes and neurological afflictions. The disability community as a whole were hoping that the coalition government, through this review, would come to realise that often an individual's disability cannot be defined to fit into prepared statements or tick-box approaches to assessment and neither can their care needs.
The response of the government to that review is, quite frankly, very disappointing. It was an opportunity for the government to come to terms with the very serious concerns about the families who are being excluded from eligibility for the payment—families with children with very severe disabilities and very high care needs, families who are under a great deal of stress and who would greatly benefit from being eligible for the carer payment. I know you have to draw the line somewhere, but I think it has been widely accepted that the current guidelines were proving to be very harsh and unreasonable in many circumstances. There was hope that by the process of this review many families would have their eligibility reassessed and that many who had been excluded would be allowed to access those payments.
As I have said, the government has missed that opportunity and has failed to pick up some of the key recommendations that came from its own review. The review made a number of recommendations. I do not think it could be described as radical in any terms, but it did pick up most of the key issues that were raised and made a fairly balanced response to the concerns of the community about how we might improve the carer payment eligibility criteria. Submissions to the reference group from both individuals and disability organisations identified many aspects of the current assessment procedures that are deficient in identifying and acknowledging that a child with a profound disability may require constant supervision for either medical or behavioural reasons. All the main disability groups stated that the assessment criteria were too rigid and needed to be broadened.
Despite the reference group also recognising the merits of the measure, the coalition government have ignored that recommendation. The government claim to have picked up the majority of the recommendations—I would dispute that—but they have certainly missed the core recommendations. They have picked up a couple of the functional concerns, and I appreciate that, but they have ignored the major recommendations that deal with the discretionary provision to be included in the system. Their response to the tube feeding criterion is disappointing, with a commitment to again review and look into the problem. I think that will not give any great satisfaction to the families affected.
A key finding of the review was about building some discretion into the system, and it was a matter that was argued strongly in a submission from the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. It advocated the inclusion of a discretionary clause on the basis that, no matter how long or exhaustive the list of criteria, there will always be deserving children who are not recognised. The Social Security Appeals Tribunal, which in some ways is the umpire in this area and deals with this sort of thing all the time, said that the discretionary clause would be a useful addition. The reference group supported that recommendation, but the government has failed to do so. I think we will be left with a very rigid system, a system that does not recognise a range of conditions, demands, on carers. I think there will be many disappointed people in the community as a result of the government's very disappointing, short-sighted and, I think, bordering on mean response. The key line to understand the government's response is found in this document where it states: 
Given that the review identified that customer numbers have substantially exceeded the number originally anticipated, the Government has decided not to adopt the recommendation.
In other words, it is not prepared to spend any more money. (Time expired)
Question resolved in the affirmative.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Department of Family and Community Affairs</title>,Documents,25,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2000-04-04,"—This evening I rise to speak to report No. 30 of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. The Treaties Committee, in my view, does valuable work. An adjournment debate is one of those occasions when it is worth recounting some of the work that the committee does. It promotes an open and accountable model of parliament and ensures that the public has scrutiny of the treaties that are made. The committee's work centres on its role of inquiring into and reporting on matters arising from treaties and the related national interest analyses that underpin the treaty making process.
All treaties find their way to the Treaties Committee. The Treaties Committee, on each and every treaty, actively accepts submissions from the public and will convene a public hearing on such treaties. This is to ensure not only that the executive government, through public servants, puts treaties information to the committee but also that public hearings are provided for the public so they can come along, make submissions and see the process in action. It is open to all interested persons to make submissions in respect of those treaties that are put before the Treaties Committee. In addition, the Treaties Committee undertakes, and has undertaken, a number of seminars to promote its work and the treaty making process. All of this work is directed at ensuring that the treaties Australia signs are open to both public and parliamentary scrutiny. The reason for much of this is to assist with the recognition that the signing of international treaties brings with it obligations and responsibilities that should not be ignored, but discussed and debated, and that treaties are an important and integral part of our place within the international community.
In my view, it is incumbent on members of the Treaties Committee to continue their work not only diligently within the committee process itself but also in the promotion of its work outside the parliament. The national interest analyses are an important accompaniment to proposed treaties. The NIAs include information about the economic, environmental, social and cultural effects of the proposed treaty, the obligations imposed by the treaty, how the treaty will be implemented domestically, the financial costs associated with implementing and complying with the terms of the treaty, and the consultation that has occurred with state and territory governments, industry and community groups.
Clearly, if the public are predisposed to inquire into a particular treaty, one of the first ports of call is to obtain the NIA to ensure that it has met those obligations and to dissect the NIA according to those five principles. The inquiry process of course may vary. It may vary depending on the circumstances and on the demand that is placed on the committee itself, but usually it consists of these steps: (1) a reference is received by the committee; (2) advertisements are placed in relevant major newspapers and submissions are invited from individuals and organisations—you can also go to the web site to see which treaties are coming up for public scrutiny; (3) submissions are received and authorised for publication; (4) the committee conducts on-site inspections or obtains background briefings or holds seminars, depending on what is appropriate for the circumstances of the particular treaty before the committee; (5) the committee conducts public hearings with selected individuals, and organisations can be requested to give oral evidence; (6) the committee considers the evidence and prepares an appropriate report; (7) the report is then tabled in parliament and may be debated; (8) copies of the report are sent to witnesses and persons who made submissions, distributed through the Ausinfo bookshop, or obtained online at the government Internet site on committees; and (9) the government then follows the process of considering the report and responds in kind to it and the recommendations made. 
Turning now to report No. 30, which I spoke about earlier and which started the adjournment debate tonight, it contains, amongst other treaties, the UN convention to combat desertification, scientific and technological cooperation with Korea, the International Development Law Institute, and the denunciation of the Convention on Damage Caused by Foreign Aircraft to Third Parties on the Surface. As you can see, report No. 30 contains quite a diverse group and mix of different treaties that Australia is proposing to become party to.
I want to take the opportunity to use the UN convention to combat desertification as a focal point for this evening. The background on the UN desertification convention was that it was finalised in June 1994. The final text of the desertification convention was adopted by the international negotiating committee on 17 June 1994 at the conclusion of meetings in June 1994 in Paris. There is usually a long lead time before these matters actually come to Australia for signature. In fact, this particular convention had a false start. In 1994 it came into parliament and did not make it through. It has now returned and it appears that it will, at least from the committee's perspective, be one that is recommended for signing. The preamble to the convention says that the rationale for the convention is to encourage countries to develop strategies for dealing with and preventing desertification. The impetus for the convention was largely to combat desertification in Africa; and, as noted, it arose out of the United Nations conference on desertification as early as 1977. It has been recognised as a significant issue globally—and it should be dealt with not only by Australia but also by other nations.
Perhaps we could go to the definitions to provide some framework on what desertification refers to. The issue of desertification, however, is contentious. There are differing opinions on what constitutes desertification and the extent of desertification. It is important to note, however, that desertification is more than the encroachment of deserts, which appears to be less of a problem than previously thought; it also includes land degradation, which is occurring over large areas of Australia and the rest of the world. Article 1 contains a broad definition of land degradation, which includes loss of biological diversity. You can see from the direction that desertification stretches far more broadly than deserts.
The obligations of the developed countries who sign the treaty are to undertake to actively support the efforts of developing countries, particularly in Africa, to provide substantial financial resources and other forms of support, to encourage funding from the private sector and to promote and to facilitate access of developing countries to the appropriate knowledge, know-how and technology to combat desertification. The financial obligations in respect of this treaty are not onerous and are quite within a reasonable budget allocation for the laudable goal that is being sought. Article 9 also talks about the preparation of national action programs, which in short refer to the development of a national program that is voluntary for both developed and developing nations that seek to receive funding under the convention. It appears that developing countries should be prepared to develop national action programs to be proactive in combating the desertification of their particular region.
The practical effects for Australia are that it does not have to prepare a national action program if it signs and ratifies the convention; and that even if it prepares a national action program, it is likely that existing plans and programs already in place can be combined to form such a national action program. A short run of those programs include: landcare, national drought policies, national ecological sustainable development strategies, draft national range land management strategies, and national biodiversity strategies. In other words, these are matters to combat desertification in its many forms. 
Turning to chapter 2 in the report, which deals specifically with the convention, to date 162 countries have ratified. In recommendation 1, the committee recommends binding treaty action be taken in addition to, at the time of ratification, the Commonwealth government providing the United Nations and the Australian state and territory governments a statement on land management responsibilities within the Australian federal system to promote a broader discussion in respect of the matter. That is a recommendation worth considering. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Treaties Committee</title>,Adjournment,26,1
