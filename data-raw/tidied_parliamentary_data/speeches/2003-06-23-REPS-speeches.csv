"SPEAKER, The",N/A,2003-06-23,"—I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Canada, 31 March to 3 April 2003, and the 108th Inter-Parliamentary Union conference, held in Santiago, Chile from 5 April to 12 April 2003. From 31 March to 12 April this year, I led a delegation comprising the permanent delegates to the IPU on a visit to Canada and, subsequently, to the IPU conference in Chile.
Honourable members will know that this was the same time that events in Iraq were unfolding, with significant developments on an almost daily basis. Not surprisingly, this meant that the delegation attracted considerable interest and attention, and on several occasions members of the delegation were questioned about their views on this major international issue. The delegation worked very well together and, as the report I have just tabled attests, all the delegates made valuable contributions to meetings in Canada and at the IPU conference in Chile. I pay particular tribute to the member for Calwell, who assumed the role of deputy leader of the delegation at very short notice and who acquitted herself admirably on this, her very first parliamentary delegation.
The bilateral visit to Canada was highly successful, and I am particularly pleased to report that the visit renewed and strengthened parliamentary relations between the two countries. House of Commons Speaker Peter Milliken and Senate Speaker Dan Hays are very good friends of Australia and of this parliament, and this was clearly demonstrated in the warmth of their welcome, the informative program put in place and the generous hospitality extended to the delegation.
The delegation had excellent access to all levels of government. In Ottawa the delegation had meetings or contact with six federal ministers, two parliamentary secretaries and a wide cross-section of Canadian parliamentarians. I was honoured to have a 20-minute meeting with Prime Minister Chrétien and a one-hour meeting with Governor General Adrienne Clarkson. The delegation also met with and attended functions hosted by the Speaker of the House of Commons and the Speaker of the Senate.
In Toronto, Ontario, the delegation met the Speaker of the Ontario Legislative Assembly, had discussions with a number of provincial ministers and attended a meeting of representatives of Australian business interests in Canada. The Australian High Commission provided excellent assistance during the visit, and I should record our thanks to High Commissioner Tony Hely, Ms Stacy Morgan and Ms Mary Gleeson for all the work they did to ensure the success of the visit.
Turning to the IPU in Santiago, I can report to the House that the Australian delegation, in keeping with past practice, took a leading role in the work of the conference, with every member of the delegation participating in debates, meetings and discussions. Both Senator Chapman and the member for Calwell were elected to drafting committees established to finalise resolutions to be adopted by the IPU. I also was elected to the committee to draft a resolution on an emergency item included on the agenda—namely, `The need to put an urgent end to the war in Iraq and to re-establish peace: the role of the United Nations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union'. These resolutions and the other work undertaken during the conference are set out in detail in the delegation's report, and I commend them to the House. 
Although the Australian delegation is a relatively small one, its contribution to the work of the IPU is significant, as is shown in this report. I sincerely thank the delegates for their efforts during the conference. I also acknowledge Senator Chapman, who during the IPU was awarded the Gran Cruz, Order of Bernado O'Higgins, by the Chilean government in recognition of his work with Chile, the IPU and the UN committee on desertification. I also recognise the work of all the other members of the delegation, including Senator Jeannie Ferris, who was very supportive of all delegation initiatives, and Senator Julian McGauran, who attended the conference as an observer. I should also point out that the conference was sorry that permanent delegate Mr Sciacca, the member for Bowman, was unable to be with us as part of the delegation as a result of an accident that happened while he was travelling overseas.
I must also commend the work of Mr Phillip Allars of DFAT, Mr Neil Bessell of the Department of the Senate and Dr Dennis Gifford from my staff. While I have the opportunity, I also acknowledge and place on the record that at the Santiago conference the Clerk of the House of Representatives in Australia, Ian Harris, was elected President of the Association of Secretaries-General of Parliaments, the international organisation of parliamentary clerks. This is an honour for Mr Harris and for this House. As in Canada, the assistance provided by the Australian Embassy in Chile was excellent, and I record our special thanks to Ambassador Libby Schick and First Secretary Mr Todd Mercer for their invaluable contribution. I commend the report to the House.",REPS,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,"<title>Parliamentary Delegation to Canada, 31 March to 3 April 2003, and the 108th Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference held in Chile from 5 to 12 April 2003</title>",Delegation Reports,0,1,speech
"Vamvakinou, Maria, MP",ALP,2003-06-23,"—Mr Speaker, as you have already informed the House, this was my very first overseas delegation. I must say it was an informative and rewarding experience but one that was far more intense than I had anticipated. Just before we embarked on this visit to Canada and to the IPU conference in Chile, my colleague the member for Bowman, the senior ALP member on this delegation, assured me that this would be a relatively easy task as he, as the deputy leader of the delegation, would take `a lot of the running' during bilateral meetings and the conference in Chile. Well, things did not turn out that way. I was somewhat taken aback when, at our first briefing in Ottawa, you, Mr Speaker, advised me that I was now deputy leader of the delegation, as the member for Bowman was incapacitated and therefore unable to join us.
Before going on this delegation, I was told that overseas delegations work hard. I can assure the House that overseas delegations led by Mr Speaker work very hard, but they also work with goodwill and cooperation because of the inclusive leadership provided by the Speaker. So my first and important task is to thank you, Mr Speaker, and also the other members of the delegation who were very generous and supportive of me—the `first-timer', as I came to be known during that period. 
It is important to recall that this delegation undertook its visits as the events in Iraq were unfolding. Given the position adopted by the Australian government on Iraq, the delegation operated, as Mr Speaker has suggested, on a higher plane and at a greater level of intensity than other delegations. Every day and almost at every meeting, it is true to say that Australia's position on Iraq was raised.
Australia and Canada have had parallel paths of development but this visit confirmed to me just how much the two countries have in common and how much we should learn from each other. The delegation's report rightly records that about 20 similarities exist between the two countries. The one that interests me the most and that should challenge all of us is that both Canada and Australia are huge, sparsely populated countries inhabited for thousands of years by indigenous people, were colonised by Europeans, obtained independence by evolution and not revolution and, most significantly, have recently added vibrant multicultural communities to their indigenous heritage and cousin European immigrants' frontier spirit—which today sees 18 per cent of Canada's population born overseas compared to Australia's 21 per cent.  
The delegation visited Canada during the SARS outbreak and was in Toronto on those critical days when procedures were being put in place to contain the outbreak. Despite these happenings, the delegation was able to receive an excellent briefing on the situation from the Ontario health minister. During this briefing the minister also referred the delegation to the Ontario Hospital Report Centre, which gauges patient satisfaction with the services offered by the 172 hospitals in the province. I recommend this part of the delegation's report to honourable members with an interest in the efficient and effective provision of health services.
I would also like to make some observations in relation to the IPU in Chile. As you have said, Mr Speaker, the Australian delegation worked very hard at the IPU conference, and I was privileged to be a part of that team effort. I was pleased to attend the meeting of women parliamentarians, together with Senator Jeannie Ferris. I was very impressed to meet other female colleagues from the various world parliaments, in particular my very dynamic female counterparts from the African countries. 
These women are fighting very hard to improve the lives of their people—the people of Africa—who have suffered greatly over the years through the effects of natural catastrophes, famine, poverty and the horrors of dictatorial regimes that have led to massacres on a large scale. Of particular interest to me was the fight against the practice of female genital mutilation. This barbaric practice continues in countries today, and efforts to bring sanctions on the practice must be supported by all of us here in this parliament. I also recall my colleague from Kenya who was very vocal against what he and many of his colleagues from the developing countries see as the unacceptable practices of the Western powers to attach `strings' and make conditional the aid that is given to Third World countries through the IMF. This is a problem that is affecting trade development in the Third World as well as having the potential to affect the development of democracy in these countries.
Mr Speaker, as you mentioned in your presentation, I was also elected to a 12-member committee to draft a final resolution for the IPU on `Parliament's role in strengthening democratic institutions and human development in a fragmented world'. This was a formidable task in itself and, after five hours of deliberations in at least three languages, you realise how linguistically imprecise and confusing the English language can be. However, with much patience and goodwill, the committee drafted a resolution that was unanimously adopted by the IPU. Australia was instrumental in initiating the sucessful inclusion of a special clause on the importance of volunteers in strengthening and developing democracy. I can tell the House that the UN representative for volunteers was deeply grateful to us for that contribution.
I was also privileged to be elected as a substitute member of the IPU Committee on Middle East Questions—an issue in which I have a deep interest. So much of the world's attention is dominated by the conflict in the Middle East at the moment that I consider my involvement in this committee a timely one. The world community has a responsibility to deal with this crisis as a matter of urgency, and I was particularly pleased to meet the Palestinian representative to the IPU, Mr Abdullah Abdullah, and members of the Israeli delegation.  
I also met with representatives from the Burmese opposition, who expressed their deep concern for the wellbeing of Aung San Suu Kyi and who were keen to impress upon the international community the need for us to pressure the generals in Burma to make good on their promises to implement some sort of democratic process. They were concerned that the world, in particular the Australian government, was perhaps being hoodwinked by the generals, who in actual fact had no real commitment to complying with the expectations we have of them. Of course, as we watch events unfold in Burma, what I was told two months ago has now been happening.
In conclusion, I take the opportunity to again thank all the delegates for the kindness and support they gave to me. I enjoyed the challenge and am pleased to have been able to participate in what was a very successful delegation. I too would very quickly like to make special mention of the wonderful support given to us by Neil Bessell, Phillip Allars and Chris Paterson. I would also like to thank Dennis Gifford from your office, Mr Speaker, in particular for his dry sense of humour. May I also thank Mr Speaker's better half, Caroline, and Senator Chapman's better half, Sally, for their support. We discovered that we had a number of shared interests and ideas about how we could best contribute to the Chilean economy. Finally, at another time I will be happy to report to the parliament about the night the Canadian Secretary of State for the Asia-Pacific region whisked—I will not say kidnapped—Mr Speaker, Caroline and me away from the delegation to show us the ugliest house in Ottawa.",REPS,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,"<title>Parliamentary Delegation to Canada, 31 March to 3 April 2003, and the 108th Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference held in Chile from 5 to 12 April 2003</title>",Delegation Reports,0,1,speech
"Scott, Bruce, MP",NP,2003-06-23,"—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I present the committee's Report of the 2003 New Zealand Parliamentary Committee Exchange, 6 to 11 April 2003. 
Ordered that the report be printed.
—Australia and New Zealand have a long and valued history and, as a result, a mutual desire to strengthen wherever possible our social, trade, defence and security interests. The parliaments of both countries recognise the merit in building on our already strong relationship by having an annual exchange of parliamentary committees.
During the period 6 to 11 April 2003, the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade visited New Zealand as part of the 2003 parliamentary committee exchange program. The first objective of the visit was to meet with New Zealand parliamentarians to share ideas and build and enhance relationships between the two parliaments. This objective was fulfilled through a series of high-level meetings with the Speaker of the New Zealand Parliament, the Hon. Jonathan Hunt, MP; the Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. Bill English, MP; the Minister of Defence, the Hon. Mark Burton, MP; and members of the New Zealand Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Select Committee.
The second objective of the visit ties in with the subcommittee's current inquiry into Australia's maritime strategy. The majority of meetings during the four-day visit were with New Zealand defence personnel, who provided briefings on key developments and initiatives in New Zealand defence policy and capability. These meetings were constructive and provided an alternative perspective to some of the issues that are currently being examined by the subcommittee as part of its inquiry into Australia's maritime strategy. 
In addition to receiving briefings on current developments in New Zealand defence policy, a range of general defence briefings and meetings were arranged. These briefings, while not directly related to maritime strategy, were beneficial because they provided a wider appreciation of the New Zealand Defence Force and specific initiatives. For example, while visiting the Burnham army base, a briefing was provided on the Youth Life Skills program and the Limited Service Volunteers program. Through these schemes, New Zealand Army personnel provide training to unemployed persons to help develop skills and responsibilities and to enhance confidence and attitudes in participants. Programs like these, which utilise defence personnel and defence property, do not currently operate in Australia; however, the review of the New Zealand YLS and LSV make it timely to consider and evaluate the role of the Australian Defence Force in contributing implicitly and explicitly to broader community goals. While the ADF's prime focus is defence of Australia, there is a range of community support roles which it performs. The recent airlift and evacuation following the Bali bombings and engineering support teams to assist the Canberra community following the January 2003 bushfires are two recent examples.
In view of the wider contribution that the ADF makes to community outcomes, the committee will scrutinise this aspect of ADF operations as part of its review of the 2002-03 Defence annual report. The committee will consider the current community roles performed by Defence and whether there is capacity for further contributions in this area. In particular, the committee will pursue with Defence the opportunity to implement similar programs to the New Zealand YLS and LSV programs. In relation to general defence issues, an alternative perspective was provided through a meeting with academics from the Institute of Policy Studies and the Centre for Strategic Studies, Victoria University of Wellington. 
The prospect of enhanced academic and research relations between New Zealand and Australia which focus on various elements of the relationship has merit. Therefore, the committee recommends that the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, ASPI, and the Strategic and Defence Studies Centre at ANU be encouraged to examine with their New Zealand counterparts opportunities for joint research projects. The Minister for Defence and the Minister for Foreign Affairs should consider whether any additional resources are needed for this activity. During the meeting with the IPS and the CSS, the work of the Council for Security Cooperation in the Asia Pacific was noted. The CSCAP is a non-government organisation providing a process for dialogue on security issues in the Asia-Pacific.
In view of the CSCAP's objectives and the ongoing interest of the committee in security issues, the committee recommends that the presiding officers give consideration to the proposal that some members of the committee attend, as observers, general conferences of the Council for Security Cooperation in the Asia Pacific. I commend the report to the House. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee</title>",Committees,1,1,speech
"Price, Roger, MP",ALP,2003-06-23,"—I too would like to speak on the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade's Report of the 2003 New Zealand Parliamentary Committee Exchange. I think it is very good that the two parliaments have this exchange program. I need to put on record that, for some years now, I have sought to have a similar program instituted with Indonesia, and I hope that one day I can stand up in the parliament and say that we have that program instituted. 
The New Zealanders were exceptionally generous with their time. In particular, the secretary of the department, the CDF, the service chiefs and the head of joint forces devoted an exceptionally generous amount of time to our visit and patiently took us through all the changes that had been made.
I think it is fair to say that New Zealand has faced up to some very tough decisions and it is in the process of implementing those. I think that Australia is, in a sense, yet to face up to the difficult decisions that New Zealand has made. The most important thing, given that New Zealand has made these decisions, is that we ought to explore the opportunity to maximise cooperation between the defence forces of our two countries—hence the recommendation. It really is an appropriate role for the defence theologians from both countries to sit down and work our way through what may or may not be appropriate to consider. I certainly think it would be most inappropriate if Australia were to outline what we might or might not want in terms of closer cooperation. I think we really need a mechanism as proposed in the report or, alternatively, one that comes from the New Zealand side.
There were a couple of things that really appealed to me over in New Zealand. One related to acquisitions. New Zealand now tries not to have a 10-year program but to break acquisitions down into a committed five-year program and then a 10-year program. Given that defence requirements change so rapidly, I think it is very brave for a government now to outline a 10-year program, and we could borrow from the New Zealanders in trying to get it down to a smaller period. Defence have always been good long-term planners—and I do not want them to stop doing that—but I think to try to get beyond a five-year horizon with any degree of certainty is a little beyond them.
As the chairman of the committee has already reported, it came as a surprise to the delegation to see the way in which the New Zealand defence forces—in this case, Army—are involved in assisting the unemployed. For years all of us on both sides of the parliament have resisted the idea of conscription, but we came away totally impressed with what Army are doing, both through the Youth Life Skills program, which runs for about five days, and the Limited Service Volunteers program, which runs for about six weeks. The participants are subjected to military law during that six-week period. The outcomes have been quite good—indeed, quite outstanding—and I would certainly say, without wishing to take away from my colleagues in any way, that we were very impressed and will be very keen to see what opportunities there are within the ADF to pick up on this initiative.
Last but not least, I commend our chair, the honourable member for Maranoa, for his leadership of the delegation, and the secretary of the committee, Stephen Boyd. The protocol officer, Max Simmons, was sorely tested in a whole variety of ways during the delegation's visit, but he more than adequately retaliated, or got square, on the limited occasions he chose to do so. It was a memorable visit for us and certainly a worthwhile one. I commend the report to all honourable members.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee</title>",Committees,1,1,speech
"Baldwin, Robert, MP",LP,2003-06-23,"—I rise to speak to the Report of the 2003 New Zealand Parliamentary Committee Exchange undertaken by the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. I would like to start by recording my appreciation of the New Zealand government, members of the New Zealand defence forces and, in particular, Mr Max Simmons of the New Zealand Department of Internal Affairs, who was an outstanding host. I would also like to thank our own staff, including the High Commissioner to New Zealand, Bob Cotton, defence attache, Colonel Brian Hall, and, last but by no means least, our secretary, Stephen Boyd, for putting together a program that was not only informative but thought provoking. 
Australia and New Zealand are at times the fiercest of enemies when it comes to things like football or other sporting events but are very close when it comes to times of military need. That is why the Anzac spirit was born. The Australia and New Zealand Army Corps was born of a united spirit for the defence of our people and defence of our nations. But it is a mistake to believe that Australia should dictate to New Zealand its military operations. What Australia does—and needs to do—is cooperate with New Zealand. Each is a separate sovereign state and each therefore has different needs to be satisfied.
Our visit encompassed Wellington, Christchurch and Auckland. I found absolutely fascinating the discussions by Air Marshal Bruce Ferguson, who is Chief of the New Zealand Defence Force, on the structural changes to the New Zealand Defence Force which were embraced out of the Defence Beyond 2000  report. Graham Fortune also went through that briefing from the bureaucratic side of defence. Quite often the bureaucracy does not meet up with the expectations of the military, but at this time they seem to be in unison.
The briefing by Major General Martyn Dunne, the Commander of Joint Forces, at the joint forces headquarters in Trentham was also fascinating. The key message that came out of that was to embrace change rather than fear it. By placing the military structure underneath Major General Dunne, there is a clear line of singular command down, which is operationally efficient. I believe that once Australia finalises arrangements for our new Australian theatre of command, we will be able to implement command much more clearly and efficiently than is the case now.
The time that was provided to us by Mark Burton, the Minister of Defence, by Jonathan Hunt, the Speaker of the House, and by other leading politicians of the New Zealand parliament was appreciated because it gave us a broad spectrum of political opinion on military requirements within New Zealand. From a local perspective, the announcement on the protector fleet acquisitions—that is, the purchase of one multirole vessel, two offshore vessels and five inshore patrol vessels—has particular relevance to my electorate, because one of the companies in Paterson, ADI, is a tenderer for that bid. I wish them well.
The single most thought-provoking point was New Zealand's attitude to its young people. While it does not relate directly to military strategy, it does address community concerns. We visited the Burnham Military Camp, where we had briefings about 3rd Land Force Group and the 3rd Regional Training Unit. I found their attitude to youth particularly impressive. 
The New Zealand defence forces have two programs in place to assist the unemployed: the Youth Life Skills program and the Limited Service Volunteers program. The mission statement for the Youth Life Skills program is `to provide training opportunities for youth to develop life skills in order that they may be better prepared to take their place within and contribute to New Zealand'. This program grabs young people who are a bit at risk—those with truancy problems, those with prison problems, those with problems who are on the Iwi youth program or  hose with police problems—and provides support, direction and training. It redirects and focuses them by leading rather than punishing. 
The Limited Service Volunteers program for 18- to 25-year-olds was particularly impressive. It has a similar mission statement to that of the Youth Life Skills program. Trainees are subject to military law and requirements while undertaking training and development. The key message from that is that it not only restores self-esteem and provides opportunities but also addresses New Zealand's problem with recruiting for their defence force. I commend the report to the House. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee</title>",Committees,1,1,speech
"Bevis, Arch, MP",ALP,2003-06-23,"—I join with colleagues on both sides of the chamber in commending the report undertaken by the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade entitled Report of the 2003 New Zealand Parliamentary Committee Exchange and by thanking those involved with the arrangements for the Defence Subcommittee's recent visit to New Zealand.
There is no country on earth that Australia shares a closer historical link with than New Zealand, nor is there a nation on the planet with which we share a more closely aligned strategic analysis and future. It was, therefore, very appropriate and timely that the Defence Subcommittee went to New Zealand, given the changes that are happening in the world around us.
At the outset, I thank our New Zealand hosts for the way in which they assisted us. Their most senior people—the Chief of the Defence Force and the secretary of their defence department—were willing to give significant amounts of their time, the best part of half to three-quarters of a day, to ensure that we were fully and properly briefed on all of the issues that were of interest to us. It is an indication of not just the closeness of the ties between our two nations and our two defence establishments but the importance which we and the New Zealanders place on the relationship.
At the outset, I place on record my thanks to Stephen Boyd from the secretariat; to Max Simmons, who was an excellent emissary of the New Zealand government and looked after us remarkably well; to their defence minister, Mark Burton, along with other senior officials who gave of their time; and to my colleagues. It was a good delegation to participate in.
The New Zealand government in recent years have been forced to make some difficult decisions about the broad structure of their three services. We have seen in recent times their decision to end what amounts to their attack air wing and to maintain, effectively, aircraft only for transport and reconnaissance purposes. As you can imagine, that was a very difficult decision for any government to take. But we learnt of the benefits that decision provided, particularly in the rejuvenation of Army and in the planning for new acquisitions for a naval fleet that by New Zealand assessments will better suit their future needs and, I am sure, enable us to work closely with them in the years ahead.
It was interesting to see the way in which they have committed to an entire new structure in Army, to an entire new mobilised brigade with brand new LAVs, similar to the ASLAVs that we use in our cavalry in the Northern Territory. The New Zealand acquisitions, being more recent, will be a new generation and improved, although there will be significant compatibility between the two. That will provide our New Zealand colleagues with a capacity to integrate both with us and with a range of European and NATO forces should the occasion arise. 
The fairly experimental work that the New Zealanders have undertaken with unemployed people has been commented on by my colleagues. It certainly has provided positive outcomes for many of the young people who have been through it. As a person most interested in defence matters, I should say that, were we to look at those sorts of activities, I would want to be assured that defence dollars were not being siphoned off for the purpose. I have a fairly dogmatic view that defence dollars are hard to come by at the best of times and they need to be allocated with some strict adherence to the security interests of the nation.
That said, if defence has an ability to provide this service and others cannot—and it was an impressive display we saw in New Zealand—it may well be that, from a whole of government perspective, there is a need for defence to be supplemented to undertake that sort of activity. I commend the recommendations in the report.

Given that defence requirements change so rapidly, I think it is very brave for a government now to outline a 10-year program, and we could borrow from the New Zealanders in trying to get it down to a smaller period. Defence have always been good long-term planners—and I do not want them to stop doing that—but I think to try to get beyond a five-year horizon with any degree of certainty is a little beyond them.
As the chairman of the committee has already reported, it came as a surprise to the delegation to see the way in which the New Zealand defence forces—in this case, Army—are involved in assisting the unemployed. For years all of us on both sides of the parliament have resisted the idea of conscription, but we came away totally impressed with what Army are doing, both through the Youth Life Skills program, which runs for about five days, and the Limited Service Volunteers program, which runs for about six weeks. The participants are subjected to military law during that six-week period. The outcomes have been quite good—indeed, quite outstanding—and I would certainly say, without wishing to take away from my colleagues in any way, that we were very impressed and will be very keen to see what opportunities there are within the ADF to pick up on this initiative.
Last but not least, I commend our chair, the honourable member for Maranoa, for his leadership of the delegation, and the secretary of the committee, Stephen Boyd. The protocol officer, Max Simmons, was sorely tested in a whole variety of ways during the delegation's visit, but he more than adequately retaliated, or got square, on the limited occasions he chose to do so. It was a memorable visit for us and certainly a worthwhile one. I commend the report to all honourable members.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,1,2,speech
"Baldwin, Robert, MP",LP,2003-06-23,"—I rise to speak to the Report of the 2003 New Zealand Parliamentary Committee Exchange undertaken by the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. I would like to start by recording my appreciation of the New Zealand government, members of the New Zealand defence forces and, in particular, Mr Max Simmons of the New Zealand Department of Internal Affairs, who was an outstanding host. I would also like to thank our own staff, including the High Commissioner to New Zealand, Bob Cotton, defence attache, Colonel Brian Hall, and, last but by no means least, our secretary, Stephen Boyd, for putting together a program that was not only informative but thought provoking. 
Australia and New Zealand are at times the fiercest of enemies when it comes to things like football or other sporting events but are very close when it comes to times of military need. That is why the Anzac spirit was born. The Australia and New Zealand Army Corps was born of a united spirit for the defence of our people and defence of our nations. But it is a mistake to believe that Australia should dictate to New Zealand its military operations. What Australia does—and needs to do—is cooperate with New Zealand. Each is a separate sovereign state and each therefore has different needs to be satisfied.
Our visit encompassed Wellington, Christchurch and Auckland. I found absolutely fascinating the discussions by Air Marshal Bruce Ferguson, who is Chief of the New Zealand Defence Force, on the structural changes to the New Zealand Defence Force which were embraced out of the Defence Beyond 2000  report. Graham Fortune also went through that briefing from the bureaucratic side of defence. Quite often the bureaucracy does not meet up with the expectations of the military, but at this time they seem to be in unison.
The briefing by Major General Martyn Dunne, the Commander of Joint Forces, at the joint forces headquarters in Trentham was also fascinating. The key message that came out of that was to embrace change rather than fear it. By placing the military structure underneath Major General Dunne, there is a clear line of singular command down, which is operationally efficient. I believe that once Australia finalises arrangements for our new Australian theatre of command, we will be able to implement command much more clearly and efficiently than is the case now.
The time that was provided to us by Mark Burton, the Minister of Defence, by Jonathan Hunt, the Speaker of the House, and by other leading politicians of the New Zealand parliament was appreciated because it gave us a broad spectrum of political opinion on military requirements within New Zealand. From a local perspective, the announcement on the protector fleet acquisitions—that is, the purchase of one multirole vessel, two offshore vessels and five inshore patrol vessels—has particular relevance to my electorate, because one of the companies in Paterson, ADI, is a tenderer for that bid. I wish them well.
The single most thought-provoking point was New Zealand's attitude to its young people. While it does not relate directly to military strategy, it does address community concerns. We visited the Burnham Military Camp, where we had briefings about 3rd Land Force Group and the 3rd Regional Training Unit. I found their attitude to youth particularly impressive. 
The New Zealand defence forces have two programs in place to assist the unemployed: the Youth Life Skills program and the Limited Service Volunteers program. The mission statement for the Youth Life Skills program is `to provide training opportunities for youth to develop life skills in order that they may be better prepared to take their place within and contribute to New Zealand'. This program grabs young people who are a bit at risk—those with truancy problems, those with prison problems, those with problems who are on the Iwi youth program or  hose with police problems—and provides support, direction and training. It redirects and focuses them by leading rather than punishing. 
The Limited Service Volunteers program for 18- to 25-year-olds was particularly impressive. It has a similar mission statement to that of the Youth Life Skills program. Trainees are subject to military law and requirements while undertaking training and development. The key message from that is that it not only restores self-esteem and provides opportunities but also addresses New Zealand's problem with recruiting for their defence force. I commend the report to the House. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,1,2,speech
"Bevis, Arch, MP",ALP,2003-06-23,"—I join with colleagues on both sides of the chamber in commending the report undertaken by the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade entitled Report of the 2003 New Zealand Parliamentary Committee Exchange and by thanking those involved with the arrangements for the Defence Subcommittee's recent visit to New Zealand.
There is no country on earth that Australia shares a closer historical link with than New Zealand, nor is there a nation on the planet with which we share a more closely aligned strategic analysis and future. It was, therefore, very appropriate and timely that the Defence Subcommittee went to New Zealand, given the changes that are happening in the world around us.
At the outset, I thank our New Zealand hosts for the way in which they assisted us. Their most senior people—the Chief of the Defence Force and the secretary of their defence department—were willing to give significant amounts of their time, the best part of half to three-quarters of a day, to ensure that we were fully and properly briefed on all of the issues that were of interest to us. It is an indication of not just the closeness of the ties between our two nations and our two defence establishments but the importance which we and the New Zealanders place on the relationship.
At the outset, I place on record my thanks to Stephen Boyd from the secretariat; to Max Simmons, who was an excellent emissary of the New Zealand government and looked after us remarkably well; to their defence minister, Mark Burton, along with other senior officials who gave of their time; and to my colleagues. It was a good delegation to participate in.
The New Zealand government in recent years have been forced to make some difficult decisions about the broad structure of their three services. We have seen in recent times their decision to end what amounts to their attack air wing and to maintain, effectively, aircraft only for transport and reconnaissance purposes. As you can imagine, that was a very difficult decision for any government to take. But we learnt of the benefits that decision provided, particularly in the rejuvenation of Army and in the planning for new acquisitions for a naval fleet that by New Zealand assessments will better suit their future needs and, I am sure, enable us to work closely with them in the years ahead.
It was interesting to see the way in which they have committed to an entire new structure in Army, to an entire new mobilised brigade with brand new LAVs, similar to the ASLAVs that we use in our cavalry in the Northern Territory. The New Zealand acquisitions, being more recent, will be a new generation and improved, although there will be significant compatibility between the two. That will provide our New Zealand colleagues with a capacity to integrate both with us and with a range of European and NATO forces should the occasion arise. 
The fairly experimental work that the New Zealanders have undertaken with unemployed people has been commented on by my colleagues. It certainly has provided positive outcomes for many of the young people who have been through it. As a person most interested in defence matters, I should say that, were we to look at those sorts of activities, I would want to be assured that defence dollars were not being siphoned off for the purpose. I have a fairly dogmatic view that defence dollars are hard to come by at the best of times and they need to be allocated with some strict adherence to the security interests of the nation.
That said, if defence has an ability to provide this service and others cannot—and it was an impressive display we saw in New Zealand—it may well be that, from a whole of government perspective, there is a need for defence to be supplemented to undertake that sort of activity. I commend the recommendations in the report.

"Jenkins, Harry, MP",ALP,2003-06-23,"—To enable the petitions I have to be presented before the winter recess, under standing order 117(b) I present three petitions—the first from 56 citizens, the second from 15 citizens and the third from 366 citizens. Whilst each of these petitions is different, inter alia they all request that the House takes urgent steps to restore bulk-billing by general practitioners. The last of those petitions was collected on a very wintry Saturday morning—last Saturday—in my electorate. It reflects the growing disquiet within the community about the plans that the present government has, the distrust the community has of those plans and the understanding that the community has that Labor values Medicare. 
Whilst the bulk-billing rates in my electorate are above the national average, since the election of the Howard government, they have been continuously on the decline and are still declining. The other aspect of the present situation is that the local accident emergency centres at local hospitals are put under greater pressure because people feel the need to attend those centres when they could be better served by attending general practitioner services. They are the types of services that really need addressing. Labor has a plan to address this. Labor built Medicare. Labor believes in Medicare. Labor will save Medicare.
The petitions read as follows—
To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled:
The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that:
Under the Howard Government the rate of bulk billing-has dropped and the cost of visiting a doctor has risen.
The Howard Government's proposed changes to Medicare will do nothing to improve this situation. Under the changes more families will not be able to access bulk billing and doctors will increase their fees.
We request that the House takes urgent steps to restore bulk billing by General Practitioners and reject John Howard's plan to end universal bulk billing.
from 366 citizens
To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament:
The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House:
That under proposed changes to Medicare, families earning more than $32,300 a year will miss out on bulk billing, and doctors will increase their fees for visits that are no longer bulk billed;
That the rate of bulk billing by GPs has plummeted by 11% under John Howard;
That's more than 10 million fewer GP visits were bulk billed this year compared to when John Howard came to office;
That the average out-of-pocket cost to see a GP who does not bulk bill has gone up by 55% since 1996 to $12.78 today;
That public hospitals are now under greater pressure because people are finding it harder to see bulk billing doctors.
We therefore pray that the House takes urgent steps to restore bulk billing by general practitioners and reject John Howard's plan to end universal bulk billing so all Australians have access to the health care they need and deserve.
from 15 citizens
To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament:
The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House:
That the rate of bulk billing by GPs has fallen by almost 10% since 1996 and is now in serious decline;
That this year, 7.7 million fewer GP visits were bulk billed than in 1996;
That the average out-of-pocket cost to see a GP who does not bulk bill has gone up by 51 % since 1996 to $12.57 today;
That public hospitals are now under greater pressure because people are finding it harder to see bulk billing doctors.
We therefore pray that the House takes urgent steps to restore bulk billing by general practitioners so that all Australians have access to the health care they need.

"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,2003-06-23,"—My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. I ask: is he aware of the study reported in the Courier Mail which predicts that, as a result of the government's changes to Medicare, there will be half a million more presentations to public hospital emergency wards each year because Queenslanders cannot find a bulk-billing doctor? Can the Prime Minister confirm the study's conclusion that treating these patients in public hospital emergency departments is five times more costly than if the patients were bulk-billed by a GP? Why will the government not adopt Labor's policy, which would take pressure off public hospital emergency departments by increasing the availability of bulk-billing for all Australians?",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Howard Government: Health Policy</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,question
"Howard, John, MP",LP,2003-06-23,"—I have seen reference made to that study. It does not accord with the advice coming to the government. We do not believe that it will have that effect. If people are concerned about the capacity of pub-lic hospitals and if the Leader of the Opposi-tion is concerned about the capacity of public hospitals to treat people who present themselves, he will encourage his Labor colleagues at a state level to match the massive increase in federal government funding for public hospitals. The story about public hospitals in Australia is that we are offering to increase our funding by 17 per cent in real terms. So far, the states have not agreed to match that increase. Instead of criticising our policies, I suggest that the Leader of the Opposition get on the telephone, ring up his mates in the state governments—all of which are in Labor hands—and tell them to be as generous with public hospitals as the federal govern-ment is.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Howard Government: Health Policy</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,answer

"Abbott, Tony, MP",LP,2003-06-23,"—I thank the member for Maranoa for his question. I am aware of an ACTU report on the future of work, and I have to say that almost every assertion in the report is either false or deeply misleading. For instance, the report says that 60 per cent of overtime worked in Australia is unpaid. In fact, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, only 14 per cent of full-time employees work unpaid overtime, and the percentage working unpaid overtime is actually going down rather than up. The report said that 28 per cent of Australian workers were casuals. That is true, but it neglected to point out that 52 per cent of casuals have been with their current employer for more than 12 months and that 54 per cent of casuals have regular work patterns. In fact, only nine per cent of all part-time workers are actively seeking more hours. But the biggest porky of them all in the ACTU report was the claim that only seven per cent of workers are now working traditional hours. They really had to torture the data to come up with this figure. They restricted it to people who were working precisely 35 to 40 hours a week strictly between 9 and 5, when in fact the ABS says that 73 per cent of full-time workers usually work between Monday and Friday. The truth, as Ross Gittins pointed out in the Sydney Morning Herald last week, is: 
... that the great epidemic of overwork is subsiding.
Ross Gittins said:
Of late, we're working less, not more.
Frankly, the ACTU has cooked the statistics.

"Latham, Mark, MP",ALP,2003-06-23,"—Mr Speaker, I draw your attention to the notice of motion provided by the Leader of the House, Mr Abbott, where he is seeking to amend standing order 45 to severely limit the number of quorums that can be called in the House on any given day. It is another decline in democratic standards and rights in the House of Representatives. Mr Speaker, I draw your attention to page 305 of the House of Representatives Practice second edition, which records as follows: 
The quorum of the House was determined by the Constitution to be one-third of Members `until the Parliament otherwise provides'. In 1929 the Attorney-General's Department advised the Stand-ing Orders Committee that a proposal to pre-vent a quorum being called for within a half an hour of the House or committee being constituted would be in conflict with section 39 of the Constitution.
I ask you, Mr Speaker, if the notice of motion provided by the Leader of the House is outside the Australian Constitution which, in other circumstances, he purports to defend and uphold. Can you report back to the House whether this is in fact a constitutional provision?",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER</title>,<title>Quorums</title>,Questions to the Speaker,7,1,question
"SPEAKER, The",N/A,2003-06-23,"—I do not think it is necessary for me to reassure the Manager of Opposition Business that I was unaware of the notice of motion until I read it on the Notice Paper this morning. My reaction to it is not unlike my reaction to his question last week: in common with my predecessors, I am a servant of the House. I did, however, note the notice of motion calls for a good deal of discretion on the part of the occupier of the chair and I intend to raise it at the next meeting of the Speaker's Panel and discuss with them as to how it could most satisfactorily be implemented should it be passed through the House.
—Mr Speaker, I am asking you, as a servant of the House, to serve the chamber by asking the Attorney-General's Department to update the advice they provided in 1929 when they very clearly set an important and impressive precedent that preventing quorums being called in the House is outside the provisions of section 39 of the Constitution. Given that this would negate the work of the House on any given day, it is very important for the House to be within the Constitution in the exercise of our powers and it is very important to update the advice and find out if the Leader of the House is acting within the Australian Constitution.
—As the member for Werriwa would have noted, the Clerk has reassured me that the edition of the House of Representatives Practice from which the member for Werriwa is quoting is not the current edition.

"Moylan, Judi, MP",LP,2003-06-23,"—I move:
That this House:
(1)	acknowledges the suffering and hardship experienced by the Iraqi people from years of neglect of essential services and the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein;
(2)	notes the grave consequences of this neglect to human health, contributing to the second highest infant and child mortality rates in a list of some of the poorest countries in the world;
(3)	notes the consequent poor state of essential services in Baghdad and other areas of Iraq and commends the efforts of the coalition, the United Nations and non-government organisations to provide emergency services to the people of Iraq;
(4)	notes the major ongoing challenges facing the people of Iraq including the need for continued rehabilitation of essential services such as sewerage and sanitation and notes that a major effort is underway to improve these services;
(5)	commends the Australian Government for the substantial contribution to humanitarian aid and recon-struction in Iraq, notably in relation to agriculture, where Australia is taking the lead with the United States;
(6)	notes that Australia's contribution of $100 million is the 5th highest of the 15 main contributing countries; and
(7)	acknowledges the contribution of AusAid and Australian non-government organisations in the delivery of health services, water and sanitation work, co-ordination and logistics, food distribution, refugee preparedness and mine action and agriculture.
The reason for this motion is that I had the opportunity to travel with the Minister for Foreign Affairs through the Middle East; specifically, to Amman and into Baghdad. That provided me an opportunity to meet with aid workers in both areas. They included mostly Australian aid workers, UNICEF, the Save the Children fund, CARE International, World Vision Australia, World Vision International, Operation Mercy, AusAID officials and the UNOHCI. It gave me an opportunity to look at some of the pressing aid issues in Iraq post war. We also had the opportunity, along with the minister, to meet with the Australian defence forces, Major General William Webster and the new United States administrator, L. Paul Bremer. I was able to take with me a list of missing Iraqi relatives of Australian-Iraqi families, which was provided to me by the member for Murray. This was passed on to AusAID Deputy Director-General Charles Tapp, and handed on to the Red Cross for tracing. 
This motion addresses a number of points. First of all, it acknowledges the suffering and hardship experienced by Iraqi people from years of neglect of essential services, part of which was due to the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein. It notes the grave consequences of this neglect for human health; it has, sadly, contributed to one of the highest infant and child mortality rates in a list of some of the poorest countries in the world, second only to those of children in sub-Saharan Africa. It notes the poor state of essential services in Baghdad and other areas of Iraq. It commends the efforts of the coalition, the United Nations and non-government organisations, who are providing emergency services to the people of Iraq. It notes the major ongoing challenges facing the people of Iraq, including the need for continued rehabilitation of essen-tial services such as sewerage and san-ita-tion, and notes that a major effort is under way to improve these services. In fact, I had the privilege of meeting with Percy Stanley, our AusAID officer in Iraq, who is responsible for restoring these services. I must say that the work he is doing is very impressive.
The motion commends the Australian government for its substantial contribution to humanitarian aid and reconstruction; notably, in relation to agriculture, where Australia is taking the lead with the United States. It notes that Australia's contribution of $100 million is the fifth highest of the 15 main contributing countries to Iraq. It acknowledges the contribution of AusAID and Australian non-government organisations in the delivery of health services, water and sanitation work, coordination and logistics, food distribution, refugee preparedness, mine action and agriculture. I was greatly moved by the work of Australian aid agencies, both government and non-government—whose staff are working under the most dangerous conditions and are also very much deprived of any creature comforts—and the amount of effort and deep concern they have for their work, particularly those working with children. I would like also to acknowledge my colleagues who have agreed to take part in this debate today to support this motion.
I have prepared a detailed report, which I cannot present in the short time available to me. That report highlights the issues raised by the number of aid agencies that I spoke with and also makes a list of recommendations. I will try to touch on a few of those. I must say that our Minister for Foreign Affairs was at the forefront in urging the United Nations to purchase the local crops. As we flew into Baghdad—we flew in very low, in a military aircraft—you could see people out in the field working to bring in the harvest. Our minister was very concerned that part of the food aid incorporate the Iraqi crop to try to help get the economy flowing again.
There is no doubt that, since the Gulf War in 1991, Iraq has become, increasingly, a very difficult place to live. The Iraqi people have suffered the most terrible deprivations. It is deeply saddening to see and hear of the plight of children in a country that had such a high living standard and has such a high level of education. For Iraq to have one of the worst infant and child mortality rates in the world, even when measured against some of the most difficult and poorest countries, is not something any of us can feel proud of. Two wars, sanctions under the oil for food program and maladministration have contributed to the terrible state of Iraq and the hardship experienced by the Iraqi people. It is really terrible to see the amount of expenditure on the construction of the 82 palace complexes in Iraq and many large elaborate monuments; the extraordinary stockpiling of weapons, arms and ammunition; and the stockpiling of medicines. These expenditures seemed to take priority over decent standards of living for Iraqi people. 
As I said, the UNDP Human Development Report 2002 listed the mortality rate of infants and children, and it is certainly very shocking. Children have been particularly vulnerable due to poor nutrition. The lack of medicines, appropriate health care, clean water and sanitation has been a major problem. Essential services in Iraq have been deteriorating for over a decade, and they were in a parlous state prior to the war. In fact, only about 70 per cent of the population of Baghdad—a city of something like six million people—has access to sewerage. The monitoring of 177 water and sanitation treatment plants across the country by UNICEF and CARE found that 19 per cent were functioning, 55 per cent were unacceptable and 26 per cent were in poor condition. The lack of electricity supplies was also of great concern.
Because of the shortness of time, I will go to some of the recommendations that came from the meeting with government and non-government aid agencies. One was that priority must be given to restoring civil order because at the moment lack of order is seriously hampering the humanitarian aid and reconstruction work; it just cannot take place in a safe environment. It is stopping children from going to school and stopping hospitals and health services from operating.
Other priorities are to secure route 10 from Amman to Baghdad to allow for a free flow of supplies and manpower. It has been difficult getting in help by air, and aid workers and materials need to come by road. We need to ensure clean water being trucked in is not being sold at prices that are exorbitant and unaffordable for average families. We need to move as quickly as possible to restore communications and establish a security line similar to that in East Timor and, I believe, in Afghanistan so that NGO staff can register, warn others of dangerous situations and get timely help in emergencies. We need to work quickly to clear unexploded ordnance because many children are suffering from coming into contact with unexploded devices and losing their lives or their limbs or having other serious injuries. We need to ensure a smooth transition for schooling by either replacing textbooks or allowing current texts to be used no matter how inadequate they are. We also need to ensure that major hospitals can continue to provide health services. 
There are many other issues that need to be raised in relation to Iraq, but I know our government will continue to keep a close watch on the aid and recommendations. I think tomorrow there is a meeting in New York, which I know Australia will be participating in. The situation is grave indeed, and it will take a lot of work now and in the future to restore Iraq to a standard where people can expect a decent standard of living and where we can be assured that children will be well and adequately cared for.

"Quick, Harry, MP",ALP,2003-06-23,"—At the outset, I would like to thank the honourable member for Pearce for raising the issue of aid to Iraq in the House today. I readily acknowledge her deep and long-held commitment to the overseas aid issue. As members would know, I was vehemently against the war in Iraq and fought passionately, not only in my party but also in the wider community, to ensure that those who opposed the war had their point of view heard. 
This motion notes the suffering and hardship experienced by the Iraqi people during the decades under Saddam Hussein. Recent discoveries of mass graves that contained thousands of Iraqis have highlighted the brutality of his regime. I have always been appalled by those countries who dedicate a large proportion of their GDP to armaments at the cost of social, health and education programs for their general population. We can all readily bring to mind the names of such countries. This almost total neglect of families in the provision of human services—basic prenatal and postnatal care, immunisation, primary school education and family support programs—is appalling and should be condemned by developed and developing countries alike.
Unfortunately, countries like Australia, the United States, Britain and many European countries are only too willing to trade with such despotic nations. As a nation, we are happy to turn a blind eye to those countries who openly or underhandedly supply such regimes with armaments. Daily we see on our TV screens or read in the many world newspapers the continued plight of the Iraqi people. Basic services that we take for granted are not in place: we, the coalition of the willing, bombed most of them out of existence. It is almost impossible to imagine a city the size of Sydney where there is no real sewerage, little sanitation and power, and no education, where lawlessness is rife and where most Iraqis wonder where their next real meals are coming from.
It is somewhat ironic that our government is providing $100 million to assist with the rebuilding of the infrastructure it helped to destroy. Still, that is what war is all about, isn't it? You help to wipe out the tyrant and then companies that are connected to the administration, particularly in America, move in and benefit from the government's largesse. Thank God that does not happen in Australia: our money goes to deserving NGOs.
It is one thing to stand here debating what the Australian and other governments are doing in the wake of the destruction caused by the war and the decades of neglect by Saddam Hussein's regime; it is another thing to know the real picture and be confident that our aid is getting through to the people who so richly deserve and require it. Before we pat ourselves on the back, this House should resolve that our aid agencies report back to this parliament on what is happening on the ground throughout Iraq to ensure that our $100 million is wisely spent. 
I congratulate the member for Pearce. I think there would be lots of members in this House who would love to visit Iraq to see just how well our aid agencies are operating—but I would like to think that she is probably one out of 148 members. Now is not the time to engage in self-serving, self-congratulatory behaviour. Iraq has been pulverised, and we should take no solace from the fact that Australia's aid agencies are continuing to provide excellent assistance.
We must be honest in this House and acknowledge that our behaviour here today is somewhat akin to assaulting a known thug, burning down his house and then claiming to be great citizens by offering to rebuild his house and pay for his medical expenses. One act, in my mind, does not justify the other. We are honour bound to help rebuild Iraq because we helped to destroy it. I will be interested to note what other honourable members have to say in this debate. I know that they will be sincere and that their views will be honest and frank on an issue that has divided this country.

Sadly, this is too often exacerbated by brutal, uncaring dictatorships which siphon off resources to go towards military expenditure and extravagances for the elites; in doing so, the provision of essential services to the majority of the people is neglected. This was clearly the case in Iraq under the regime of Saddam Hussein. Even more appalling has been the discovery of mass graves—evidence of the persecution, oppression and brutality of this regime.
For too long, the people of Iraq suffered. In the area of health, for instance, one million children under the age of five suffered from chronic malnutrition and four per cent of children suffered from acute malnutrition. There were infant mortality rates of 107 deaths per 1,000 live births—the second highest rate in the world. Maternal mortality rates were 122 per 100,000 births in the north and up to 294 per 100,000 births in southern and central Iraq. There were widespread health problems, including malnutrition, anaemia, vitamin A deficiency, goitre, malaria, poliomyelitis, tetanus, meningitis and tuberculosis. Health was not the only area where there were long-term problems over the last couple of decades particularly. Inadequacy in water and sanitation were big problems. Only 46 per cent of the rural population of Iraq, for instance, had access to safe water. High levels of salinity and pollution clearly had effects on health.
For far too long, the people have suffered these unacceptable conditions. Clearly, Iraqi people continue to suffer from the shortage of essential services. The short-term damage caused by the war, civil unrest and looting has temporarily added to these problems. However, that will be rectified and there is no doubt that, in the medium to longer term, people will be better off as resources are shared more equitably under a new government. Resources need to go into these essential services rather than being diverted by a corrupt, indulgent regime. This is in addition, of course, to the freedom from oppression and fear that people in Iraq are now experiencing.
There are many challenges. There are challenges relating to the ongoing health problems in Iraq. Health facilities have been targeted by large-scale looting, decimating the stocks of necessary medicines and equipment in Iraq. Medical supplies entering the country have not been able to get adequately to the areas of need because of a breakdown in the distribution and transportation systems. These areas do need to be addressed. In the area of power generation and fuel, something like only 20 per cent of the power needs of Iraq are currently being generated. This is being improved but there is a lot more work to be done. A lot needs to be done in terms of providing clean water by addressing the appalling pollution and sanitation problems. There is a great need in the area of education. Even before the recent war in Iraq, school attendance levels were very low. Over the past decade, one-quarter of primary school aged children did not attend school for economic reasons. Education is currently being disrupted further, and there is a great need to place attention on getting children back into school. 
Australian NGOs, AusAID and the Australian government are making a big effort to assist Iraq in addressing these very important needs. The Australian government has committed over $100 million—the fifth highest of over 30 countries contributing to the efforts in Iraq—and is determined to assist with agriculture, food and health. UNICEF and Care International, assisted by AusAID, are doing a lot in tackling emergency water, sanitation, health, opening schools and so on. I want to commend UNICEF, Care, other NGOs and aid workers for their outstanding efforts. I want to acknowledge as well the efforts of the Australian government to assist in a very substantial way. There are real concerns. The people of Iraq have been freed from the grip of a brutal regime; the challenge now is to ensure a return of essential services, adding substantial material improvements to their standard of living. I am pleased that the Australian government is able to make a very substantial contribution to that end.

"Danby, Michael, MP",ALP,2003-06-23,"—I congratulate the member for Pearce for moving this motion. There are many genuine people in this House who have a disparity of views about recent events in Iraq. I think that all of us who have a concern for the wellbeing of the people of Iraq should focus on the issues that are raised in this motion so that—despite all of the disagreements all around the world and in our country—aid can be put into place, electricity can be put back online and humanitarian assistance that is promised can be delivered. Whatever one's views of the conflict with Iraq and the destruction of the Saddam Hussein regime, it is incumbent upon all of us to see that the promises to the people of Iraq are kept. I am not entirely confident, given events in Afghanistan where similar undertakings were made and are not necessarily being fulfilled, that the people of Iraq will be supported with the speed and the wherewithal that they ought to be.
In the context of the situation in Iraq at the moment, I think it is important to look at what happened during the 30 years of the fascist Baath regime. The Iran-Iraq war 1980-88 resulted in one million Muslim casualties, dead and wounded. Iranian casualties were estimated between 450,000 and 730,000. Iraqi casualties were estimated between 150,000 and 340,000. During the genocidal Anfal campaign in Iraqi Kurdistan—about which so many Kurdish Australians have spoken very movingly to me and to opposition foreign affairs committees that I am on—Saddam's Baathist SS were responsible for the death and disappearance of 100,000 Muslim Kurds. On 16 March 1988 there was an infamous incident, which we now remember, in which Saddam's butchers gassed up to 5,000 people in one incident in an attack on the town of Halabja in northern Iraq. In the 1990 invasion of Kuwait, there were more than 1,000 Kuwaiti Muslims killed by Iraqi Baath forces. There are 605 prisoners of war, and I know people in Kuwait and surrounding countries remain extremely anxious about them. 
Among the most infamous things done during the Hussein regime were the faked baby-killing parades. An article in the Herald Sun recounted that Dr Amer Abdul a-Jalil, the deputy resident of Baghdad's Ibn al-Baladi Hospital, said:
Over the past 10 years, the government in Iraq poured money into the military and the construction of palaces for Saddam to the detriment of the health sector ... Those babies or small children who died because they could not access the right drugs, died because Saddam's government failed to distribute the drugs.
The article continues:
As the hospital's chief resident, Dr Hussein Shihab, confirmed to Newsday: “We had the ability to get all the drugs we needed. Instead of that, Saddam Hussein spent all the money on his military force and put all the fault on the USA. I am one of the doctors who was forced to tell something wrong—that these children died from the fault of the UN.”
Dr Azhar Abdul Khadem, a resident at Baghdad's Al-Alwiya maternity hospital agreed: “Saddam Hussein, he's the murderer, not the UN.” 
In fact, Dr Oasem al-Taye, who now runs the Baghdad Children's Hospital, said ... after Saddam's fall he'd found plenty of ... equipment and medicine at a hospital once reserved for the leaders of Saddam's regime.
Isn't that a disgrace, Mr Deputy Speaker? The article continues:
“They were willing to sacrifice the children for the sake of propaganda,” Dr al-Taye said bitterly.
The parades of dead children were part of that same propaganda.
Doctors say hospitals were forced to keep the bodies of babies who had died prematurely or of natural causes for up to two months until Saddam had enough to stage a parade of the little corpses, with women bussed in to act as “mourners”, screaming insults ... in front of television cameras.
“All 10 hospitals in Baghdad were involved in this and the quota for the parade was between 25 and 30 babies a month, which they would say had died in one day,” Dr Hussein al-Douri, deputy director of the Ibn al-Baladi hospital, told the Telegraph.
To conclude, I echo the eloquence of that humanitarian, that advocate of refugees, the assistant editor of the Age, Pamela Bone, who said:
It is time the idea that dictators can use the shield of national sovereignty in order to commit atrocities against their own people was overturned ... You don't have to be a particularly good person to think that war is bad. Nearly everyone would agree that it is. But as the founder of Medicins Sans Frontieres, Bernard Kouchner (a socialist), said of the action in Iraq, what is worse than war is for the international community to leave in place a dictator who massacres his people.
Whatever our views are, we have to determine that aid is delivered to the people of Iraq. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Private Members' Business,9,1,speech
"Johnson, Michael, MP",LP,2003-06-23,"—I am pleased to speak on the motion on Iraq moved by the member for Pearce, and I take this opportunity in the parliament to acknowledge her very genuine and significant commitment to Iraq's postwar rebuilding and reconstruction. Her dedication is reflected in many ways, from visiting Iraq with the foreign minister earlier in the year to see for herself the terrible plight of the people and the conditions in which they live to bringing this motion on Australia's aid reconstruction contribution before the parliament.
As the people of Australia and the parliament are aware, Australian troops played a critically important role in the war in Iraq several months ago. This was a war directed against the brutal and monstrous dictatorship of Saddam Hussein. It was never a war against the people of Iraq. It was a war against a regime that did not care for its people or its country. It was a war against a regime that knew no boundaries when it came to a capacity for inflicting terror and torture on hundreds of thousands of innocent people. It is only now that we have been given a snapshot of the sheer excesses and outrageous acts committed by Saddam Hussein's regime. In light of all we know now about the monstrous regime in Iraq, surely no-one amongst us today, on any side of politics, would wish that the old regime remained in power.
The outcome of the conflict was one for which we are all grateful and relieved. In this country, we are particularly grateful and relieved that no Australian life was lost. Due to the overwhelming presence and professionalism of the coalition forces, the people of Iraq are now free of the shackles of a dictatorship. They are free of a regime that prevented them from reaching their full potential, that monitored their daily movements and lives, and that stifled political debate and discussion worthy of a people steeped in political and intellectual exchange. 
Against this background, we all know that the time for the rebuilding and reconstruction of Iraq has arrived. We all know that following conflict there comes a time for the expensive reconstruction of a physically smashed country. We all know that not only international goodwill and good wishes but also massive financial aid from the countries that are in a position to help are needed in the rebuilding of towns and cities across the nation battered in bombing raids. The Australian government are making a significant and very crucial humanitarian contribution to the reconstruction of Iraq. This nation's commitment to Iraq stands at more than $100 million—the fifth highest of the 15 primary contributing nations.
The Australian government are working very closely with the Iraqi people, United Nations agencies, NGOs and, of course, their British and American counterparts on humanitarian and reconstruction activities for Iraq. Australia has provided $55 million to meet immediate humanitarian needs, which includes a $38 million commitment to the UN flash appeal requirements for Iraq. Our funding allocations to the UN agencies, the International Committee of the Red Cross and Australian NGOs under the UN flash appeal have focused on meeting critical needs in water, in sanitation and in health. We have also provided support to the coordination, logistics and food distribution systems. Australia's further commitment of $45 million to priority reconstruction activities will focus on areas where we have a particular expertise to offer. We are playing a central role in the rehabilitation of Iraq's agricultural sector, and the bulk of the $45 million in reconstruction assistance will fund these efforts.
Australian personnel are undertaking key humanitarian planning and coordination roles with international agencies and the Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Affairs. The Australian government have also placed Australian experts in Iraq to assist with policy and planning in the important agricultural, water, sanitation and economic policy sectors. In fact, Australia is taking a leading role in re-establishing food security in Iraq and revitalising Iraq's agricultural sector. We are well placed to provide expert advice and support the rehabilitation of the agricultural sector, particularly in areas such as dryland agriculture, grain distribution, irrigation, salinity and water management.
Over 100,000 tonnes of Australian wheat, purchased by the World Food Program, has been delivered. This wheat is sufficient to feed about 1.7 million of Iraq's most vulnerable people for six months. With this kind of worthy and significant contribution by this country, it is important that members of this parliament speak loudly about the role that Australia is playing in the postwar reconstruction of Iraq. We have a wealth of experience and expertise. We should be making a contribution, and we are making that contribution. I take this opportunity to again commend the member for Pearce for her motion and to warmly congratulate all those in this parliament who have taken the opportunity to stand up and speak about Australia's contribution to Iraq's postwar reconstruction.

"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2003-06-23,"—If Eric Blair were still alive, he would be celebrating his 100th birthday on Wednesday this week. Known to millions as George Orwell, this great writer and thinker was, if anything, a constant seeker of truth. His disregard for conventional attitudes and resistance to orthodox belief systems led him to mark his own course and arrive at his own views on the big sociopolitical changes happening throughout most of last century. Attacked by the Right for his democratic socialist views, and by some on the Left for his withering criticism of and assault on totalitarian regimes, Orwell showed a courage and an independence few other social commentators could match. He also understood the power of language: its ability to break through the closed ideological positions but also its ability to be used as an instrument of deception. What he might have thought of the recent behaviour of some of our world leaders is anyone's guess, but with respect to the Iraq invasion he may have thought the policy came under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Truth, the department found in his seminal novel 1984.
Truth was not in fact the first casualty of this war, because it was a casualty before the war began. As Senator Robert Byrd, speaking on Iraq on the Senate floor in the United States, said in May this year:
Truth has a way of asserting itself despite all attempts to obscure it. Distortion only serves to derail it for a time. No matter to what lengths we humans may go to obfuscate facts or delude our fellows, truth has a way of squeezing out through the cracks, eventually.
It would appear that the Australian government, in particular our Prime Minister, have not been entirely candid with the citizens of this nation with respect to the reasons we went to war in Iraq. In March this year at the National Press Club the Prime Minister said:
I would have to accept that if Iraq had genuinely disarmed, I couldn't justify on its own a military invasion of Iraq to change the regime.
That is what the Prime Minister said three months ago. Last week, after the war was over, the Prime Minister tried to revise history by alleging that the opposition was calling for the restoration of Saddam Hussein as a ruler of Iraq, because he was asked what had happened to the evidence of weapons of mass destruction. Nobody in this place would argue that Saddam Hussein's administration was anything other than a violent, repressive and dictatorial regime. But the Prime Minister based his reasons for us to defy the United Nations conventions and go to war, with very few other nation states, primarily on the assertion: 
The Australian government knows that Iraq still has chemical and biological weapons and that Iraq wants to develop nuclear weapons.
The fact is that the so-called coalition of the willing has not discovered the chemical and biological weapons used as the basis for the attack upon Iraq. In order to establish the truth, these issues must be resolved—questions must be answered. For that reason, Labor's call for an inquiry is a fitting response to what must be a worrying time for the Prime Minister. Not surprisingly, the Prime Minister opposes an inquiry even though it is clearly evident that such inquiries are now taking place in London and Washington. The community might be less ready to question the veracity of this government if it were not for the revelations of last year on the `kids overboard' fabrications and questions being raised as to whether appropriate advisories were issued prior to the Bali tragedy. There also appears on the face of it to be little transparency on the apparent nexus between political donations to the Liberal Party and the use of ministerial discretion on the granting of visas.
These issues are of concern to the nation. Whilst it is fair to say this Prime Minister has had some success in distracting the public and some parts of the media, the fact remains that these issues are outstanding and they are yet to be resolved. The media, and more importantly the public, are starting to become more aware of the efforts by this government to avoid proper scrutiny and to evade questions. This government has already borrowed from Orwell's 1984 lexicon when it comes to conjuring up titles of proposed legislation. A number of bills I have spoken on or referred to in the last 18 months spookily remind listeners today and readers of Orwell's works how you can invert a language to try to suggest an objective that is not in fact apparent from the instrument that is being referred to. The Workplace Relations Amendment (Protecting the Low Paid) Bill 2003 comes to mind.
The Workplace Relations Amendment (Protecting the Low Paid) Bill 2003 was a great use of terminology to invert the objectives of the act. Its efforts and intentions were to prevent low-paid workers being paid a national wage increase by providing for the Industrial Relations Commission to have regard to all other matters so as not to forward on a wage increase to the lowest paid in this community. The Workplace Relations Amendment (Genuine Bargaining) Bill 2002 is another bill that refers to genuine bargaining but means the opposite. Indeed, the provisions of that bill were to prevent the capacity for the parties to a dispute or workers in a particular workplace to genuinely bargain. It was intended to do the opposite: it was to place things in the way of parties seeking genuine and proper negotiations, to ensure that the work force were not in a position to properly negotiate decent outcomes for themselves so they could ensure a decent quality of life for their families.
These bills say one thing but mean another. Again, what would George Orwell think of the way the language is being used? Even the terminology within the Workplace Relations Act is a rather spooky reminder of the novel 1984. An Australian workplace agreement is not Australian historically, never relates to a workplace and is rarely consensual. The no disadvantage test, used to compare current and prospective conditions of employment, in fact allows a disadvantage, as it compares not conditions contained in the current agreement but a minimum award that underpins that agreement. Again it uses language to invert its meaning.
As Senator Byrd said, the truth will eventually prevail, whether it be the way this government likes to invert the description of a bill to hide its true intent, the way it prevents inquiries from occuring or the way it avoids proper questioning. Whether there exists a deliberate evasion of the facts, a distortion of the truth or a deliberate misuse of terminology, the Australian public will, sooner or later, recognise it. The Australian public expects and wants honest, transparent and accountable government. The Australian public expects and deserves a government that will actually front up to its responsibilities and answer questions that are being asked of it by the opposition. If facts have been omitted, if questions need to be asked and if answers need to be found then the Australian public expects the government to have the honesty and the integrity to ensure that those questions are properly asked in this chamber and in the other chamber to ensure that the truth ultimately prevails. 
We have seen now many months—indeed, years—of this government evading the truth on occasions and avoiding proper questioning, but I do not think in the end that its efforts will ensure the truth will be hidden. The fact is that the truth will prevail. This government has to come clean on some of the things that it knows and does not want to reveal. George Orwell, as I said, would have been 100 years old if he had been still alive on Wednesday. What an apt time to make reference to a great writer, a great social commentator, a person who always sought the truth and someone who should be raised in this chamber. Clearly it serves as a reminder of how little this government considers the truth an important element of our society.",REPS,<title>GRIEVANCE DEBATE</title>,"<title>Orwell, Mr George</title>",Grievance Debate,10,1,speech
"McMullan, Bob, MP",ALP,2003-06-23,"—This is one of those bills that explain how, unnoticed by most Australians behind the reports of controversy and confrontation, the parliament can work quickly and effectively to solve problems in the national interest. The opposition will be supporting this bill, the purpose of which is to allow certain records of the HIH Royal Commission to be delivered directly to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, overriding the usual requirement to allow time for objections from the owner of the records. The reason we are doing it is that, whether or not we are critical about the manner in which the administration of the government preceded the collapse of HIH and whatever our views about some of the findings of the royal commission as they relate to agencies of the government—some of which we discussed in a recent bill relating to the restructuring of APRA—we all share the view that prosecutions arising from the royal commission should be facilitated in accordance with the normal legal requirements of due process.
The HIH Royal Commission (Transfer of Records) Bill 2003 has three key elements: transferring custody of certain royal commission records to ASIC; clarifying that the transferred records may be used by ASIC for the purposes of its functions and powers but that they will be afforded appropriate protection while in ASIC's custody; and ensuring that the key legal protections that would otherwise apply to the records of a royal commission continue to attach to the records while in ASIC's custody. These protections include legal professional privilege.
The government has argued that the changes made in this bill are necessary to allow prompt investigation by ASIC of possible breaches of the law reported by the royal commission. By way of background, let me remind the House about the report of the HIH Royal Commission published on 16 April. That report identified a number of possible breaches of the Corporations Law and of the New South Wales Crimes Act. The government accepted the commissioner's recommendations that potential legal breaches involving the Corporations Law should be referred to ASIC for investigation and the preparation of possible civil prosecutions.
The need for the legislation that we are dealing with today was raised with the government by ASIC Chairman David Knott, who was concerned that procedural requirements and legal uncertainties might frustrate ASIC's ability to gain access to and to use records of the royal commission. This uncertainty arises as a result of the decision of the High Court in the case of Johns v. the ASC—the then Australian Securities Commission—by which the Commonwealth is required to give notice to the owner of records that it is proposed be transferred to ASIC or to any other Commonwealth body. The owner of the records would then have the opportunity to object to the records being transferred. 
In his letter to the opposition, the Treasurer was seeking our support and more particularly our agreement to expeditiously pass this bill not just through the House but through the Senate by 30 June. Anyone who has been associated with this process will agree it is a remarkable process. We have done it twice: we have done it for the legislation to restructure APRA, and we are doing it here. We constantly get speeches in this place and public comments about opposition obstruction. Here are matters where, in terms of the normal procedures, we are perfectly within our rights and have the capacity to embarrass the government and frustrate its intentions, but the national interest requires us to act cooperatively and promptly, so we are doing so. However, I do not imagine it will soften the hard edge of the campaign about Senate obstruction. 
In the Treasurer's letter, he argued that this requirement:
 ... would likely result in a lengthy and expensive process of settling any objections to ASIC accessing the records. The notification process could be used to frustrate the prompt investigation and prosecution of potential offences by ASIC.
Before I go to the provisions of this bill, I want to discuss the existing law as set out in the Johns case. Ian Johns was the managing director of 22 companies that comprised the Tricontinental Group—an offshoot of the State Bank of Victoria—at the time of the group's collapse. A royal commission was appointed by the Victorian government to inquire into the group's affairs. The Australian Securities Commission, as it then was, was also investigating Tricontinental. The ASC made an officer available to the royal commission, and that officer in fact became its director of investigations. The ASC delegated to the officer its powers and functions of investigation under the then ASC Act. 
Johns, the Tricontinental managing director, was required to appear before the investigating officer on a number of occasions to answer questions concerning Tricontinental. The examinations were held in private and transcripts were made. The transcripts were subject to a provision of the ASC Act which required the ASC to take all reasonable measures to protect information given to it in confidence, or in connection with its duties, from unauthorised use or disclosure. The ASC Act also enabled the chairperson of the ASC to disclose the information to an agency or government if he was satisfied that the information would assist that agency or government to perform its functions. The officer concerned gave the transcripts of Johns' examinations to the Tricontinental Royal Commission and gave the royal commission written permission to use the transcripts in the public hearing.
When the transcripts were tendered at the public hearings, the royal commission made copies available to journalists from the ABC, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Weekly Times. Details of the examinations were subsequently published. Johns sought orders in the Federal Court restraining further publication of the transcripts and attacked the validity of the ASC officer's decision to release the transcripts. The High Court held in that case that, while the ASC did have the power to disclose the transcripts, the rules of natural justice required that the exercise of the authority to disclose the transcripts should only have been made after Johns was given a formal opportunity to object to such disclosure. 
At issue in the case of the HIH Royal Commission are the documents provided to that royal commission under section 2 of the Royal Commissions Act. The act imposes limitations on the use of the documents by the royal commission. Once a royal commission has ended, the Commonwealth is entitled to possession of the documents and the responsible minister is empowered by section 22, subsection 3 of the Archives Act to make directions on the custody of the documents. The discretionary power exercised by the responsible minister under the Archives Act is similar to that exercised by the ASC under its legislation in the Johns case. Accordingly, the requirements of natural justice arguably apply—that is, the minister responsible for administering the Archives Act may well have an obligation under the requirements of natural justice pursuant to the Johns case to give the owner of the documents an opportunity to object to their transfer. 
The bill before the House at the moment operates as if a direction under subsection 22(3) of the Archives Act was in force—that is, it assumes a direction has been made to transfer the documents without actually requiring a direction from the minister responsible. Thus, the transfer of the documents from the Commonwealth to ASIC does not involve the exercise of a discretionary power by the executive which would attract the requirements of procedural fairness set out in the Johns case. We have been advised by the Treasurer's office that the government has received legal advice that this mechanism will be effective in overcoming the requirements identified by the High Court in the Johns case.
There is a trade-off in this bill. There is the requirement for procedural fairness set out in the Johns case. Normally the Labor Party would be defending procedural fairness and natural justice. On balance, we have to acknowledge the need for speedy and effective investigation of the possible breaches of the law outlined by the HIH Royal Commission. Commissioner Justice Neville Owen identified 56 potential civil and criminal breaches. His report said most of the possible offences were the result `of a misconceived desire to paper over the ever widening cracks that were appearing in the edifice that was HIH'.
The Labor Party in opposition have been campaigning around corporate governance issues for more than three years—before Enron, before WorldCom, before HIH and before One.Tel. We have argued that the government must intensify its efforts to improve corporate governance—that is, the practices and processes which ensure the accountability of management to shareholders, creditors and employees. The purpose of improved corporate governance is to impose checks and balances on corporate behaviour and to rein in corporate greed. We have pointed out that the self-regulation approach—the so-called `light touch' approach taken by the Howard government—has failed. 
On balance, therefore, having made that advocacy and given that these documents are being released only for use in investigation leading to matters that will go before courts, where all those affected will have the normal protections of the judicial system, we are going to support this bill. We will support it as an effort to ensure that possible breaches of the law identified by the HIH Royal Commission are investigated and prosecuted effectively and energetically. We will therefore not only support the bill here; we will cooperate in ensuring that the bill is passed through both houses of the parliament expeditiously.",REPS,<title>HIH ROYAL COMMISSION (TRANSFER OF RECORDS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,2003-06-23,"—in reply—I thank my friend the member for Fraser for his contribution. The HIH Royal Commission (Transfer of Records) Bill 2003 will transfer the custody of certain records of the HIH Royal Commission to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. This will ensure that ASIC is able to pursue efficiently and expeditiously the referrals of possible breaches of the law made to it following the HIH Royal Commission. The government established the HIH Royal Commission following the financial collapse of the HIH Insurance Group in March 2001. The collapse affected individuals, community groups and the public generally. A key task of the HIH Royal Commission was to inquire into the possibility of breaches of law and whether possible criminal or other legal proceedings should be referred to the relevant agency. This was reflected in the terms of reference of the commission.  
On 16 April this year, the government released the report from the HIH royal commissioner, the Hon. Justice Neville Owen. The report identified a number of possible breaches of the Corporations Law, and the commissioner indicated that these breaches should be referred to ASIC. The government acted immediately to refer these matters to ASIC. The government is determined to ensure that possible breaches of the law associated with the collapse of HIH are investigated and prosecuted in a timely manner. The government demonstrated its resolve in the 2003-04 budget. It provided additional funding of over $28 million to ASIC over the next two years to undertake investigations and prepare briefs for civil prosecutions. This bill is a further demonstration of the resolve of the government. The transfer of records of the HIH Royal Commission to ASIC achieved by this bill will ensure that ASIC has access to, and subsequent use of, royal commission records. This will avoid potentially lengthy procedural requirements and legal uncertainties that could hamper the effective investigation of those matters identified by the HIH Royal Commission.
The bill also ensures that ASIC is able to use the records for the purposes of performing its functions and powers. Importantly, this will also allow ASIC to share information with other Commonwealth institutions, such as the Director of Public Prosecutions, in support of their functions and powers. In addition, the bill maintains the key protections that currently attach to the royal commission records transferred to ASIC. In particular, the protections for individuals against self-incrimination that would usually apply to the records of a royal commission are maintained. In addition, any right to claim legal professional privilege over the transferred records is preserved. As a further safeguard, the transferred records are afforded the same confidentiality as information collected by ASIC in the course of its operations.
When the shadow minister commenced his speech, he referred to statements made by members of the government from time to time in relation to Senate obstructionism and the fact that the opposition often obstructs the government's mandates and the government's agendas in the Senate. There is no doubt that the government have had a mandate to bring about a number of changes, particularly as we seek to implement the policies we took to the last election. There is no doubt, in our view, that there has been Senate obstruction and there is ongoing Senate obstruction. I do, however, want to thank the shadow minister and the opposition for their cooperation in relation to this bill. There is no doubt that there has been a high level of cooperation, and the government appreciate this. As the member for Fraser said, this is a very important bill. It is in the national interest for it to proceed and be implemented as expeditiously as possible, and it is particularly important that the bill proceeds through both chambers of the parliament. I do thank the member for Fraser for facilitating its passage through the other place. I commend the bill to the House.

"McMullan, Bob, MP",ALP,2003-06-23,"—The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2003 and the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2003, which we are considering together, are just the latest chapter in what has become a very sorry saga of the government's clumsy and ill-considered efforts to prop up the ethanol industry. This is a story of the government bending over backwards to support an industry in the face of every piece of impartial advice both from within the bureaucracy and from outside. It is a story that mainly revolves around the activities and lobbying of the one major player in the ethanol industry, the Manildra Group—headed by Mr Dick Honan, who has become very well known for his lobbying around this issue, his generous support of the Liberal Party and his relationships with the Prime Minister and the former head of the Prime Minister's department, Mr Max Moore-Wilton.
The other source of pressure on the government to support the ethanol industry has been from elements of the National Party and the sugar industry lobby who hope that, in the process, this will provide assistance to the sugar industry. My concern with that particular argument is that it is a fraud on the legitimate concerns of sugar growers. They are being offered an illusion of support from which they will gain no benefit. The simple fact is that virtually all the ethanol produced in Australia is not made from sugar; it is made from wheat. The prospects of any substantial continuing benefit to the sugar industry from the emergence of an ethanol industry in Australia, even with all the subsidies, would be remote at best.
There was previously a third element to the argument which related to the environment. There was a view that, because ethanol is not generated from carbon based fossil fuels, it would be environmentally beneficial. But the CSIRO, amongst others, has most authoritatively and effectively debunked that myth and said that, when you look at the life cycle utilisation of all the resources going to produce ethanol and at its relative fuel efficiency, there is no environmental benefit to be gained. 
I would like to deal with those issues a little more in a moment, but first let us look at the recent history of this issue. Ethanol is an alcohol, and it has a variety of purposes. For the purpose of this debate, we are talking about fuel ethanol—that is, ethanol blended with petrol for use as a transport fuel. The latest controversy over the use of ethanol goes back to 1999 when, as part of its so-called Measures for a Better Environment package, the government promised to harmonise Australian vehicle emissions with European standards. To support this, the government promised to introduce fuel quality standards. Historically, there has been no limit domestically on the amount of ethanol which suppliers can include in petrol blends in individual sales at the bowser. However, during consultations for the development of the national fuel quality standards in late 2000, Environment Australia proposed that a maximum cap of 10 per cent ethanol be set. That was consistent with international standards. Vehicle manufacturers argued then and argue now that ethanol blends greater than 10 per cent will affect engine operability and components such as fuel lines. They have provided advice to the government that many manufacturer warranties only extend cover for up to 10 per cent blends and that beyond that some warranties are removed completely while others are removed for fuel line systems. Engines such as lawnmowers, chainsaws and outboard motors with plastic fuel systems cannot safely use fuel with high levels of ethanol.
In March 2001 the government referred this issue to the ACCC through the then Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, the member for North Sydney, who said:
Consumers have a right to know the extent their petrol is being mixed with ethanol, and they also have a right to know if their engines are at risk of being ruined.
This issue should have been dealt with under the comprehensive fuel standards announced in May 2001. However, the decision on setting a standard for the ethanol limit in petrol was deferred for 12 months until May 2002. The only beneficiaries of that decision were the petrol retailers who blend ethanol in excess of 10 per cent and, of course, the companies—principally the one company, Manildra—who supply that ethanol. The excuse given was to allow for completion of studies to provide a scientific basis for setting the appropriate level of a cap. Everybody knows that if you were really doing it for safety reasons you would set the international standard limit and then do tests to see whether you could increase it, rather than allowing blending above the international safe standards to continue while the tests were being done. It was clearly a facade behind which effective assistance to the ethanol industry—and, through it, to Manildra—continued to operate.
The studies were to include examination of issues such as vehicle operability, environmental performance, effects on engines and any health or safety implications. An ethanol task force was formed to coordinate this task. It considered submissions from all stakeholders, and other technical and relevant information available. The task force was unable to achieve consensus because of the insistence by producer interests—the Australian Biofuels Association and Manildra Park Petroleum—that no caps should be set pending scientifically based trials of a 20 per cent ethanol-petrol blend in vehicles representative of the Australian vehicle fleet. It should be noted that all other members of the task force took the view that there was sufficient documentation to set a 10 per cent limit without the need for vehicle trials. Therefore, all independent advice was for a 10 per cent limit, but the government said no on the basis of the representation of the one vested interest—the one non-neutral participant, Manildra. 
The ACCC formally advised the government in December 2001 that they had several fair-trading concerns relating to potential misleading conduct by particular distributors and retailers. These concerns related to lack of disclosure to consumers, effect on vehicles and warranties, and reduction in fuel economy. Fuel economy is affected because the energy content of a litre of ethanol is about 30 per cent less than a litre of petrol.
In May 2002, rather than setting the proposed limit, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry announced a $5 million, two-year study on market barriers to biofuels, which included funding for vehicle testing and technical assessment of use of 20 per cent ethanol blend vehicles. Completion of the trials was expected to take two years and it is still not clear whether cabinet has given the final go-ahead. Fuel industry representatives confirm that it was simply a delaying tactic to allow higher than 10 per cent petrol blending to continue.
On 22 August 2002 the Australian Automobile Association, the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries and the Australian Institute of Petroleum jointly called on the government to institute a 10 per cent limit. They also opposed mandating ethanol at any level. But it was not until April this year, eight months after that warning and years after the first concerns were raised, that the environment minister finally bowed to the inevitable and introduced a 10 per cent limit on ethanol levels in petrol—a measure that he had been urged to take by the Labor opposition more than six months earlier.
In the meantime, consumer confidence in the ethanol industry has been shot to pieces. The blame for this loss of confidence is clear: it is due to the failure of the government to respond to legitimate and widespread concerns about the dangers of ethanol. There have been some ridiculous claims made by the industry about this issue; absurd claims that these concerns did not have a legitimate foundation. It is disturbing but perhaps not surprising that these claims have been echoed by government members reaching as high as the Deputy Prime Minister.
But it is those legitimate concerns that have led the government to set the 10 per cent limit. If the concerns are not real, why have the government set the limit? It is because they now accept that there are real and serious concerns and that the failure to act is in fact undermining the capacity of the users. Users who wish to experiment with 10 per cent ethanol blends, the so-called E10 fuels—and there have been some interested in doing that and some trials—have been discouraged from doing so by the controversy.
I was amused to hear the Deputy Prime Minister say in the House on 15 May that I had apparently apologised to Mr Honan, the Chairman of the Manildra Group, for my stand on this issue. I say absolutely, without equivocation at all, that I have not apologised to him. I have no reason to apologise to Mr Honan and I have not, I will not and—I reiterate here—I do not. The Deputy Prime Minister was misinformed; I can imagine by whom but I do not have any evidence.
Equally nonsensical was the argument peddled by the Deputy Prime Minister that the claims about the dangers of ethanol were sensational and inaccurate. If that is the case, why has the government imposed the limit? It has imposed the limit because it accepts that the arguments are in fact neither sensational nor inaccurate. The Deputy Prime Minister should have a word to his colleague the environment minister, who said two months ago: 
Latest results provide evidence that ethanol blends higher than 20 per cent would cause problems for a proportion of older vehicles in the fleet.
These include:
... hesitation and problems with starting in very cold conditions, and could cause deterioration of metal, plastic and rubber components in some older vehicles.
That was the view of the environment minister. It is similar to views expressed by every major motor vehicle manufacturer and by the nation's main motoring organisations.
In spite of widespread concerns about excessive levels of ethanol use, the government on 12 September last year announced a series of changes to excise and subsidy arrangements that aim to support the ethanol industry. The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2003 and the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2003 implement the legislative aspects of that announcement. Under this decision, the 38.143c per litre excise exemption for fuel ethanol was abolished. For locally produced ethanol, the benefit was replaced with an equivalent subsidy for producers. However, this subsidy is not available for imported fuel ethanol, which would thereby be placed at a significant price disadvantage. The government claimed the decision was intended to promote the local ethanol industry in the interests of promoting the use of sustainable energy resources. The agriculture minister encouraged the idea that the decision would help the sugar industry, notwithstanding that almost all fuel ethanol produced in Australia is sourced from wheat, not sugar.
The decision followed two weeks of industry representations to the government about a move by independent fuel wholesaler Trafigura Fuels Australia Pty Ltd to import a tanker load of ethanol from Brazil. As a result of the decision, the tanker was diverted to another country. I do not have time to deal with it now. It was an extraordinary set of circumstances, in which high-level representations were made to the Australian Embassy in Brazil, and while negotiations were under way a tax with retrospective effect on Trafigura and its partners was imposed to prevent them carrying out a contract into which they had entered. They entered into the contract without the tax. The tax was implemented in the dead of night while the ship was halfway here and suddenly a legitimate contract was made uneconomic by a decision of the government in a desperate attempt to protect and preserve the interests of an industry and a company which it favours.
The decision to impose these prohibitive charges clearly favoured the Manildra Group, which produce more than 90 per cent of domestically produced fuel ethanol and which had declined to supply Trafigura with ethanol. I will not go to the merits of their decision not to supply; both sides have put their case and I do not know who is right. They may or may not have had a case for doing it. Trafigura argue they did not; Manildra argue they did. I am not in a position to judge, nor is it relevant to the current circumstances.
This legislation also comes forward in the context of some important changes to long-term fuel excise arrangements. In the 2003 budget the government announced it would change excise arrangements for fuel including ethanol. Effective excise rates for currently untaxed fuels are to be increased in a series of five even annual steps starting on 1 July 2008. Existing subsidy arrangements for ethanol are to be continued until the new arrangements begin in 2008. This decision extended for another five years the ethanol subsidy that would otherwise have ended in September 2003. The principle behind the ethanol excise decision and the proposed new fuel excise arrangements are inconsistent. The purpose of the proposed fuel excise arrangements is to tax fuels on an equal basis according to their energy content, whereas the ethanol subsidy promotes a low energy efficiency fuel. 
The first of these bills we are dealing with today amends the Excise Tariff Act 1921 to implement the government's decision to remove the excise exemption for fuel ethanol and impose an excise duty rate equivalent to that applying to petroleum. The second bill amends the Customs Tariff Act 1995 to impose a customs duty on imports of fuel ethanol. These two measures treat locally produced and imported ethanol equally. Locally produced ethanol becomes subject to fuel excise, and imported ethanol becomes subject to an equivalent customs tariff. Both measures became effective on 18 September 2002—the date of commencement of a tariff proposal introduced on 16 September 2002.
However, a third key aspect of the government's 12 September 2002 package is the introduction of a subsidy for domestically produced ethanol. The subsidy confers a substantial cost advantage to locally produced ethanol compared with imported ethanol. The subsidy is not the subject of this legislation, nor could it be. We are in a difficult position here. The Labor Party does not have any objection to these two bills in isolation. On their own, they subject ethanol to the same excise arrangements as other fuels. For that reason, we will not oppose the bills. But we do have very serious concerns with the third leg of the government's 12 September package—the ethanol subsidy.
Let me list some of the concerns. Firstly, it is very hard to argue that this subsidy is a priority use of taxpayers' money, whether you look at it for long-term industry, environmental policy or agricultural support reasons, let alone when you compare it with other priority uses of taxpayers' money, such as Medicare. It is a strange set of priorities that this government has.
Secondly, the excise subsidy creates a protection regime that is directly contrary to our advocacy of the benefits of free trade. I and many others have spent years of effort bringing countries like Brazil along with Australia as part of the Cairns Group to be a very effective voice for free trade and agriculture. The relationship with those countries is dependent upon Australia continuing to be a powerful and effective voice for free trade and particularly for free trade in agriculture and agriculture related products. Yet here we are acting entirely contrary to that decision, attacking the interests of our fellow Cairns Group member, Brazil, in a manner that they have speculated might breach our WTO commitments and might give them grounds for a WTO case. My understanding is that Brazil will not pursue that matter before the WTO. I have been advised by the government—I do not have any independent information—that the technicalities of this matter do not breach the letter of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the World Trade Organisation articles. For the moment, let me accept that that is true, because I do not have any evidence to challenge it. It is unquestionably in breach of the spirit of the WTO, and it is certainly a breach of the spirit of the Cairns Group, of which we have been such a powerful advocate and from which we have been such a major beneficiary.
Thirdly, I am concerned that the advantages of such a massive subsidy to the local fuel ethanol industry have not been demonstrated. Fourthly, I reiterate my earlier concern that there is likely to be little or no benefit to the sugar industry. The sugar industry have a very serious problem. I do not minimise that for one second. We are all paying a sugar tax to attempt to fund the package to assist the sugar industry, and I do not minimise the seriousness of their concerns, some of which are caused by unfair international trading conditions. But it is a fraud on the legitimate concerns of decent sugar growers to pretend that a subsidy to the ethanol industry is part of a solution to their problem. It is not. 
This ethanol subsidy does not come cheaply. Over the next four years it is predicted to cost $195 million, and so far, and for the foreseeable future, the lion's share has gone and will go to one company—Manildra Energy Australia. In Senate estimates hearings earlier this month, Senator Minchin, representing the industry minister, confirmed that Manildra received ethanol subsidy payments of more than $17 million between 17 October and the end of May. Over 10 months, that is nearly $2 million a month.
Let us consider some of the supposed explanations for the subsidy. Is the subsidy for environmental reasons? Despite it being presented as a green fuel, the environmental qualities of ethanol are mixed and its use in Australia purely on environmental grounds cannot be substantiated. Recent Australian life cycle analysis work by CSIRO and RMIT has shown that ethanol blends are considered greenhouse neutral. This means that, compared to normal petrol, there is no greenhouse benefit from using ethanol. Although alcohol fuels in some instances can lead to urban air quality benefits, it is difficult to generalise as some emissions increase and others decrease. The government is misrepresenting the environmental qualities of the fuel to try to position ethanol as a clean, green fuel. A case for the environmental benefits and support for cane growers has not been established, so there is no clear case for promoting ethanol on environmental grounds.
Is ethanol support needed under a new-found zeal for interventionist industry policy? This would be a radical policy shift from a government that used to claim it supported market based economic policies. There is no question that the ethanol producers benefit from the subsidy and that this will assist in promoting ethanol production. If you give any industry a big subsidy, it will help that industry. Everybody knows that. The question is whether it helps the economy overall—whether it is an efficient way of using taxpayers' money to maximise our economic and social objectives. The question in this case is whether the benefits that flow match, let alone exceed, the costs of providing the subsidy.
The report of the government's own fuel taxation inquiry, the Trebeck report, makes it clear that there is no evidence of any such benefit. The report refers to the excise concessions, but the effect is the same for the subsidy which has replaced the excise exemption since the report came down. The report says:
... no analysis has been undertaken to establish the benefits to rural and regional areas of the tax concessions and whether they could be achieved at lower cost by other means.
So there is no clear case for promoting ethanol on industry policy or regional policy grounds.
What about the sugar industry? They have a very legitimate concern, but I repeat that most ethanol produced in Australia comes from wheat, although a small proportion is produced from the sugar by-product C molasses—a waste low-value end product also used as cattle feed. A `Current Issues Brief' prepared by the Parliamentary Library points out that sugar producers would gain nothing from ethanol industry subsidies. It argues that, although sugar prices are low, redirecting the primary sugarcane product to ethanol production would greatly increase the price of feedstock used to produce ethanol, and so would greatly increase the cost of producing it. Although low, current sugar prices are higher than sugar producers would receive if they produced sugar for ethanol. 
As the Treasury has pointed out, ethanol producers would be unwilling—`at best', as the Treasury tactfully puts it—to pay more than the world price if they were to buy sugar as an ethanol stockfeed. The only effect on sugar producers would be that product diverted to ethanol would not be available for export. The price received for sugar would remain the same and, overall, sugar farmers would be no better off. 
So the argument that the subsidy will help the sugar industry does not stand up either. This proposal has been a cruel hoax on Australian sugar producers. The claims that the sugar industry will benefit are simply not supported by any dispassionate, disinterested analysis, including that from the government's own economic advisers.
The principle behind the ethanol subsidy is also at odds with the principles of the government's proposals for energy tax reform spelt out in the budget last month. The Trebeck report, which formed the basis of the energy reform statement, argues that the best basis for promoting energy efficiency is to set excise rates for all fuels according to energy content. Under this proposal, ethanol would have a lower excise rate than petrol, because it is less energy efficient. Petrol has 89 per cent of the energy content of diesel, the most energy efficient liquid fuel, whereas ethanol has only 61 per cent of the energy content of diesel. But that is a far cry from the current arrangement, by which the subsidy completely offsets the excise paid by ethanol producers, and has the same effect as leaving locally produced ethanol completely excise free.
The redeeming feature of these bills is that they take the first step towards a rational taxation regime more broadly, and for ethanol in particular, by subjecting ethanol to a normal rate of excise. As I explained earlier, the offensive parts of the government's 12 September announcement, the massive subsidy and its extent, are not included in these bills. For that reason the opposition will support the bills. But the government still has a long way to go to develop a sensible, effective fuel tax regime.",REPS,<title>CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,2003-06-23,"—in reply—I thank the member for Fraser for his support of the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2003 and the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2003, although not for all of the comments he made when articulating that support. An efficient and competitive energy sector is a key priority for the government's strategic policy agenda. With advances in technology producing cleaner vehicle engines and with the continued emergence of alternative fuels, it is clear that Australia must have a more consistent and sustainable fuel tax regime. The existing arrangements have created taxation distortions in the fuel market, leading to inefficient investments in fuel production and equipment and uncertainty for users of fuels.
Accordingly, the government has announced important long-term reforms to the excise treatment of fuels. The reforms establish a broad, sustainable taxation framework for fuels, by addressing a number of anomalies in the current fuel tax system and providing increased long-term certainty for investors, while meeting government commitments and providing time for industry to adjust. The government will reform the existing fuel tax arrangements to bring all currently untaxed fuels used in internal combustion engines into the excise and customs duty system by 1 July 2008. 
The introduction of excise for currently untaxed fuels will be accompanied by the use of subsidies that will reduce the effective excise for those fuels for a transitional period. These subsidies will be progressively reduced from 1 July 2008 to 1 July 2012. The broad reform framework will be fully implemented by 1 July 2012, when all fuels used in internal combustion engines will be subject to excise and customs duty based on factors including energy content, providing tax neutrality between fuels.
Consistent with these broader announcements, the legislation amends the Excise Tariff Act to validate Excise Tariff Proposal No. 4 (2002), which removed the excise exemption for domestically produced ethanol for use as fuel and imposed an excise rate equivalent to that of petroleum from 18 September 2002. Ethanol producers now receive a production subsidy, which was due to end on 18 September 2003, to offset the excise of 38.143c per litre applying to ethanol. This rate of duty is the same as the rate currently applying to petrol. The government will continue this existing excise and grant arrangement for ethanol producers until 30 June 2008. From 1 July 2008, both domestically produced and imported ethanol will receive a grant which will be reduced in five even annual instalments from 1 July 2008 to 1 July 2012. To complement these excise changes, Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2003 contains amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 which impose additional customs duty of 38.143c per litre on ethanol imported for use as fuel in an internal combustion engine.
The member for Fraser sought in his speech to suggest that the arrangements which are encompassed in these bills are simply designed to benefit Manildra. We reject any allegations of inappropriate conduct by the government with respect to these matters. I point out to the member for Fraser that the policy aim of the government is exactly that set out by the Prime Minister in his statement on 12 September last year. In his press release the Prime Minister said:
There is a strong view in the community that Australia should move towards increased biofuels use to encourage sustainable energy sources for fuel for the future.
Further on in the Prime Minister's statement appear these words:
The biofuels industry depends on Australian agricultural production for its feedstock and builds on expertise in Australia's agricultural industries.
That is why I am quite perplexed by some of the remarks made by the member for Fraser. One would have thought that the opposition would have supported these very important sentiments expressed by the Prime Minister in September last year. The government's strategy is to encourage over time the use of biofuels in transport. We have an ongoing commitment to a commercially viable renewable fuels industry for Australia. The biofuels industry depends on Australian agricultural production for its feedstock and builds on expertise in Australia's agricultural industries.
The member for Fraser mentioned that most of Australia's domestically produced ethanol currently comes from wheat, but it ought to be recognised that potential feedstocks for fuel ethanol production also include sugar, molasses and certain waste products. I am fortunate to represent in this place perhaps one of the most beautiful parts of Australia, the Sunshine Coast, which has over many years had a sugar industry which is now facing challenges. There have been discussions locally on the possibility of the production of ethanol from sugar on the Sunshine Coast. I am not certain whether or not that is going to happen but, given the very many challenges facing the sugar industry more generally, the policy as articulated by the Prime Minister certainly has to be a very important step in the right direction. 
The member for Fraser also invested a considerable portion of the time allocated for his speech in referring to consumer affairs issues such as labelling and capping. Members and those listening might not be aware that these matters are not canvassed in the bills currently before the chamber. The government has announced that on 1 July ethanol-petrol blends will be capped at 10 per cent and such fuels will be labelled at the pump. This follows testing which the Minister for the Environment and Heritage has made public. While the member for Fraser may well have his own views on the process—and in a democracy he is perfectly entitled to those—is he disagreeing with the government's decision? That is a question which the member for Fraser has yet to answer.
Looking at the bills together, and with the broader fuel excise package, the reforms will establish a fairer and more transparent fuel excise system with improved competitive neutrality between fuels. They will provide the opportunity for currently untaxed fuels to establish their commercial credentials in the marketplace. The reforms fulfil the government's existing commitments concerning the tax treatment of fuels and deliver on the Measures for a Better Environment commitment to encourage the production of alternative and renewable fuels. The matters contained in these bills are very important initiatives of the government. We thank the opposition for their backing of them and we seek the support of the chamber.
Question agreed to.
Bill read a second time.",REPS,<title>CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Cox, David, MP",ALP,2003-06-23,"—The New Business Tax System (Taxation of Financial Arrangements) Bill (No. 1) 2003 provides for the removal of the taxing point when traditional securities are converted into, or exchanged for, ordinary shares. It provides a new taxation regime for dealing with the taxation of foreign currency gains and losses and a regime for the translation of amounts into Australian or functional currencies. The Howard government has brought this bill on at extremely short notice, as it did last week with Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6) 2003. These tax bills contain some complex provisions that require an appropriate level of scrutiny. If that scrutiny cannot be provided in this place—and it cannot, in such a short space of time—then it will have to be done in the Senate. Labor will be referring this bill and Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6) 2003 to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee so that they can be properly examined during the parliamentary break. If we did not do that, I have little doubt that the government would attempt to obtain passage of both bills through both houses this week. 
—Why not?
—You would. The Howard government treats the parliament with contempt in the manner in which it deals with taxation legislation. In February the government introduced Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 2003, which, amongst other things, provides an FBT exemption for certain legitimate payments to employee entitlement funds to meet a 1 April deadline set by a tax ruling issued in 1999. The government had four years to act on that matter and left it to less than two months before the exemption was required. That bill poses significant problems for all the affected parties because of the short notice. Nobody in the building industry can actually comply with it. I am still in negotiation with the Treasurer, trying to resolve that with some transitional and other amendments.
Now we have two more attempts to get complex tax legislation through the parliament at short notice. The difference with these pieces of legislation is that they may not reduce the amount of tax avoidance; some aspects of them may facilitate it. That is why Labor will take its time and look at them closely. As to the specifics, under the current law there is a taxation point when securities are exchanged for, or converted into, shares. The cost of the security is compared with the value of the shares to determine whether there is any assessable income. Where there is a tax liability, that creates a cash flow problem, because the gain is not realised in cash. Removing the tax event at that point will make instruments that have this conversion or exchange feature more attractive. Convertible instruments convert into shares in the issuer; exchangeable instruments exchange into shares in a company other than the issuer. Convertible instruments are useful for companies raising capital, as they typically have lower initial servicing costs than other debt instruments because of the conversion feature. The taxpayer is investing in that entity when the security is purchased, and the removal of the taxing point on conversion has obvious merit. The case for removing the taxing point for exchangeable instruments is not as strong, since the shares are not those of the issuer of the security. This is an issue that needs some closer examination because of the precedent it may set for similar treatment of other types of instruments that do not represent a continuous investment in a particular entity.
The other issue I want to take up this evening is the revenue implications of this measure. The explanatory memorandum says:
This measure is estimated to have no impact on the revenue over the forward estimates period. This is because convertible/exchangeable interests typically have a minimum term of 4 years and the proposed amendments apply only to traditional securities that are convertible interests or exchangeable interests issued after 7.30 pm, by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory, on 14 May 2002. After this period, the measure may have a negative impact on revenue due to more concessional taxation of gains on conversion or exchange under the capital gains tax provisions and due to the deferral of the taxing point.
What we have got is a measure that the government is conveniently able to say is going to have no implication in the forward estimates period, but it cannot give us even an indicative indication of what its financial implications are going to be thereafter. It makes one of the simpler and more profound statements for any document coming out of the Treasury in relation to tax; that is:  
 ... tax is deferred until the ultimate sale of the shares (possibly many years in the future), which imposes a cost on the Commonwealth due to the time value of money.
—Didn't you work in Treasury once?
—I did not work in Treasury once; I worked for a couple of Treasurers and I worked for a couple of finance ministers. The simple expression we always used to use was `tax deferred is tax avoided'. The explanatory memorandum confirms that. We owe it to the parliament and we particularly owe it to all taxpayers and all people who rely on tax revenues for various things in this country to go into the revenue implications of this measure in some considerable detail, and we will do that at length in the parliamentary break.",REPS,<title>NEW BUSINESS TAX SYSTEM (TAXATION OF FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS) BILL (NO. 1) 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Ley, Sussan, MP",LP,2003-06-23,"—I rise in support of the New Business Tax System (Taxation of Financial Arrangements) Bill (No. 1) 2003. This bill contains two key measures: the first removes the taxing point on conversion or exchange of traditional securities and the second concerns the taxation of foreign currency exchange gains and losses. The bill was issued as exposure draft legislation on 17 December 2002 to allow public comment and consultation. The measures in the bill represent the second stage of reforms to the taxation of financial arrangements recommended by the Ralph Review of Business Taxation. The first stage, dealing with the borderline between debt and equity, was implemented in July 2001. As the chairman, John Ralph, observed in his introduction to the final report, Review of business taxation—a tax system redesigned:
We are living in a time of unparalleled change. Australia must have a tax system which equips it for the coming decades, not for those that have passed. If we do not achieve this, Australians will not enjoy the standard of living that this nation has the potential to deliver.
Ralph goes on to say that the main objective of the review is to design a tax system that will best contribute to economic growth. 
As this country becomes more globalised, we find ourselves becoming more competitive. Far from being a force that we should somehow brace ourselves against, this is an opportunity for us to engage with energy and a positive outlook. We cannot build a modern intelligent nation without a well functioning tax system. Our tax system—far from being a passive collection mechanism that siphons a few dollars off the top here and there, trying to be equitable and trying to be simple—must in fact be a central feature of our economic base that contributes to our international competitiveness and gives this country the best opportunities for growth.
A tax system redesigned sets out to accomplish a number of outcomes: a tax system that is fair, efficient, transparent and certain; a framework, a foundation, that can be built upon and, at the same time, can be flexible as laws and circumstances change; continued external involvement with the Board of Taxation; a tax system that is easy to understand and comply with; and a competitive capital gains tax regime—and this is very important in the context of business taxation. Without this, we will not be in a position to attract capital to Australia and to encourage entrepreneurs in Australia to start businesses here. I am proud to say that this government is developing a framework which balances revenue protection, certainty, flexibility, compliance costs, and profit and loss implications. 
In the area of taxation of financial arrangements, it is particularly important that the tax treatment for the issuer and the holder be symmetrical and that foreign exchange gains and losses be taxed on a realisation basis. The approach this government has taken has clearly contributed to the economic miracle we have in this country. The words `economic miracle' are not mine; they come from an article in the Economist, which in part, says:
The country—
Australia—
is now in its 12th year of uninterrupted economic expansion, having shrugged off both the East Asian crisis of 1997-98 and the global downturn in 2001.
	...	...	...
Not surprisingly, the OECD declared the Australian economy to be one of the rich world's best performers.
That is the context in which this bill is set. The bill will remove the taxation point on traditional securities when converting into or being exchanged for ordinary shares, introduce new foreign exchange gains and losses realisation points, and introduce new foreign currency conversion rules.
Currently, it is possible for investors to be taxed when, for instance, they choose to convert a convertible note into shares, even though they have not, in effect, realised their investment. From 14 May 2002 such conversions will not crystallise into a taxation liability. This implements one of the recommendations of the review of business tax, recommendation 9.7(b)(i). Recommendation 9.7 talks about a general disposal principle that `as a general rule a disposal occurs when a taxpayer ceases to hold a financial asset or to be subject to a financial liability, whether in part or whole, by sale, transfer, exchange, maturity or other alienation, extinguishment or synthetic disposal' and that `a disposal not occur on conversion of a convertible or converting instrument'.
With respect to the taxation of foreign currency exchange gains and losses, the amendments introduce a general translation rule into income tax law that converts foreign currency denominated accounts into Australian dollars so that Australian income tax liability is calculated with reference to a common unit of account. The amendments introduce functional currency rules, under which the net income or loss of an entity that functions mainly in a particular foreign currency can, under certain circumstances, be determined in that currency, with the net amount at the end of the process being converted into Australian dollars.
The core realisation principle and the translation rule mean that foreign currency gains and losses are brought to account when realised, whether or not there is a conversion of foreign currency amounts into Australian dollars. Uncertainties and anomalies are addressed. This ensures that foreign exchange gains and losses have a revenue character. The bill will also change the time when foreign exchange gains and losses are realised. The divisions will treat foreign exchange gains and losses as assessable and deductible upon the occurrence of three new realisation events: when an entity disposes of foreign currency or of a right it has to receive foreign currency; when an entity's right to foreign currency is satisfied; and when an entity stops having a liability to pay foreign currency.
A new universal set of provisions will be introduced that dovetail the foreign exchange gain and loss provisions. The core conversion rule requires conversion of foreign currency denominated amounts into Australian currency at the following times. The cost of depreciating assets is to be converted at the exchange rate prevailing when the taxpayer begins to hold the depreciating asset or on satisfying the liability to pay for it, whichever occurs first. An amount relevant to the CGT provisions is to be converted at the exchange rate prevailing at the time of the CGT event or transaction as determined under the CGT law. Ordinary income is to be converted at the exchange rate prevailing at the time that the income is derived or received, whichever occurs first. Non-CGT statutory income is to be converted at the exchange rate prevailing at the time the amount must be first returned as income or on receipt, whichever comes first. Deductible amounts not falling within the depreciating asset provisions must be converted at the exchange rate prevailing at the time the amount becomes deductible or at the time of payment, whichever occurs first. Other receipts or payments not referred to above must be converted at the exchange rate prevailing at the time of the receipt or payment. Also, a liability in foreign currency must be converted to Australian currency at the tax recognition time, as this defines the point in time when exchange gains or losses are measured. 
Despite the core conversion rule, in certain circumstances a taxpayer may treat a foreign currency as their functional currency, converting all other currencies into that currency as if it were Australian currency, for the purposes of the core conversion rule and otherwise keeping their tax records and doing their tax calculations. To be able to choose a foreign currency as the functional currency, that currency must be the sole or predominant currency in which the relevant taxpayer conducts their business activities and keeps their accounts at that time.
In conclusion, I urge this place and the other place to support the New Business Tax System (Taxation of Financial Arrangements) Bill (No. 1) 2003. I emphasise the way in which this does contribute to a modern, fairer, more competitive financial and economic system for Australia. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>NEW BUSINESS TAX SYSTEM (TAXATION OF FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS) BILL (NO. 1) 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,2003-06-23,"—in reply—I would like the opportunity to sum up the New Business Tax System (Taxation of Financial Arrangements) Bill (No. 1) 2003. As always, the member for Farrer has made a very significant contribution, and it is rather good to see the member for Kingston here making a contribution, although it is a pity that he has not been more fulsome in the support of the measures contained in this bill. Those measures form part of this government's commitment to business tax reforms which are designed to deliver a modern, competitive and fair tax system, and that was one of the matters pointed out by the member for Farrer in her contribution.
In particular, the provisions of this bill reflect the ongoing implementation of the initiatives of the government to reform the taxation of financial arrangements. The measures will amend taxation legislation to remove tax barriers to traditional securities. They will also resolve tensions and uncertainties within the existing law governing the taxation of foreign currency gains and losses by removing anomalies, distortions and gaps in the current laws. These reforms will also reduce ongoing compliance costs for business and will serve to enhance the efficient operation and competitiveness of Australia's business sector—and I am sure that is a laudable aim that all honourable members would agree with.
I am pleased to note that this bill has been the subject of extensive public consultation and is welcomed by both business and investors. That is one of the reasons that I was disturbed at the member for Kingston saying in his speech that he wanted this bill referred to a Senate committee. The government have consulted widely in the community. We have received very strong support. This bill is recognised and welcomed by both business and investors. Given the procedures that the government have followed, it is eminently regrettable that the opposition is wanting to sidetrack this bill and to hold it up so that it is not able to proceed in the expeditious way that is needed for the benefit of the Australian economy. 
Referring in particular to provisions of the bill, schedule 1 removes the taxing point on conversion or exchange of certain traditional securities, such as interest bearing bonds and debentures. This addresses the cash flow disadvantage that may arise where the holder of traditional securities that convert or exchange into ordinary shares does not have the cash from the conversion or exchange to pay the tax on any ensuing gains. The amendments address this cash flow disadvantage by removing the taxing point at the time of conversion or exchange. This means that an investor who acquires an ordinary share on the conversion or exchange of a traditional security will not be subject to tax until that ordinary share is ultimately sold. This will improve the ability of business to raise new capital using convertible and exchangeable traditional securities by making them more attractive to investors. Schedules 2 and 3 contain technical corrections to the capital gains tax provisions to ensure that they operate as intended for convertible interests and rights respectively.
Schedule 4 addresses a number of uncertainties and anomalies arising under the current law's taxation treatment of foreign currency gains and losses. These reforms represent the second stage of the government's reforms to the taxation of financial arrangements recommended by the Ralph Review of Business Taxation. They will promote greater certainty and consistency in the taxation of foreign currency gains and losses, by removing uncertainties and anomalies in the current law. The amendments introduce a general translation rule into the income tax law which will translate foreign currency denominated amounts into Australian dollars. This ensures that the Australian income tax liability is calculated by reference to a common unit of account. Schedule 4 also introduces a core realisation principle into the income tax law which, together with the translation rule, ensures that foreign currency gains and losses are brought to account when realised, regardless of whether there is an actual conversion of foreign currency accounts into Australian dollars. It ensures that foreign currency gains and losses have a revenue character, subject to limited exceptions.
In designing this legislation the government was mindful of the sometimes significant compliance costs associated with the taxation of foreign currency denominated transactions and has provided a number of options designed to reduce these costs without compromising the integrity of the measures. Functional currency laws are introduced, under which the net income or loss of an entity or a specified part of an entity that functions predominantly in a particular foreign currency can, under certain circumstances, be determined in that currency, with the net amount being converted into Australian dollars. These rules are directed at reducing the compliance costs of businesses with large international operations. A simplified treatment for certain foreign currency denominated bank accounts is also introduced, as is optional roll over relief for the issuer of certain securities under finance arrangements. These two measures were developed in consultation with the industry and professional bodies to reduce the costs of compliance for small and large business and to reflect commercial finance arrangements. 
Before I conclude, I would like to comment on a number of the remarks made by the member for Kingston. Firstly, he sought to criticise the government for the late introduction of the bill. The member for Kingston has suggested that the government has not given appropriate notice to this and other bills. The reality is quite to the contrary, and that is that the member for Kingston was given briefings on taxation laws amendment bills (No. 4) and (No. 6) and the present bill was introduced almost a month ago. So the member for Kingston has had almost a whole month to do his homework. It is truly regrettable that the member for Kingston has not taken the time to look at and support the obvious measures of this bill. Perhaps this indicates—just as an aside—the ALP's preoccupation with its leadership woes. The member for Kingston, I suspect, regrets that he has not had the opportunity to spend the time he would like on this bill, but apparently the price that we have to pay as a parliament is that this bill is to be shunted off to a Senate committee.
The member for Farrer noted that measures in this bill were recommended by John Ralph in A tax system redesigned. The member for Kingston again claimed lack of time to examine the taxation of financial arrangements measures. The bill was introduced on 29 May, and he ought to have looked at the matter in very close detail prior to getting up in the parliament tonight to berate the government for in some way, shape or form providing inadequate notice. The member for Kingston claimed nil revenue cost for convertible and exchangeable instruments. This measure reduces the cost of capital and enhances the ability to raise capital, particularly for start-up companies. This will assist companies to grow and be able to contribute to future revenue. This measure is consistent with measures in a number of tax jurisdictions, such as in the United States of America. It will make Australia a more competitive place and will enhance it as a financial centre.
The New Business Tax System (Taxation of Financial Arrangements) Bill (No. 1) 2003 is a very important bill. It is a bill which we in the government are very proud of. I strongly urge that it be passed not only by this place but also by the Senate.

"O'Connor, Gavan, MP",ALP,2003-06-23,"—I rise to speak on the Product Stewardship (Oil) Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2003 now before the House. I will preface my comments on the bill with the statement that the government just simply lacks an energy policy. I was in the Main Committee last week when certain appropriation bills were being debated in this area of energy policy. The shadow minister for resources, the member for Hunter, commented that the government does not have an energy policy. I had risen to speak in the debate on the appropriation bills related to allocations in the regional services portfolio—I note the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, Mr Tuckey, is at the desk today—and I made the point that the Transport and Regional Services portfolio did not have a policy either. Of course we had a rather animated discussion at the time on the lack of the bushfire policy that the government had promised. It did not end there, because I also made the point that the government did not have a tourism policy either. The government, regrettably, is a bit of a policy free zone when it comes to these matters. The member for Hunter, who preceded me in those debates, quite cleverly pointed out to the House that the government certainly had not developed a national energy policy and that that is quite regrettable. 
The legislation we are debating here tonight imposes a levy on certain petroleum based oils and greases and their synthetic equivalents to fund the development of a recycling program for waste oil—the product stewardship arrangements for waste oil, which is termed the PSO. The intention of the stewardship arrangements is to reduce the environmental impacts of waste oil by imposing a levy on virgin oils and lubricants. The levy is used to fund a benefit scheme designed to encourage the recycling of waste oils. Benefits are paid on a six-tier differential scale with differing benefit rates for various waste oil recycling activities.
I am not an old petrolhead by any stretch of the imagination though I do claim, in my younger days, to have changed the motor over on a Ford Anglia. In my youth Ford cars were something that we all aspired to own. Now I am the member for Corio I have a Ford plant in my electorate. But as I recall, in those days—and I must plead guilty before the House and before you, Madam Deputy Speaker—when I was changing that motor over, we simply poured the waste oil out onto the ground. I think that was the way in the 1960s and 1970s; there was no real thought given to the recycling of this product, nor was there to other waste products or other materials from the automotive sector. For example, batteries were basically thrown into the tip and oil was either thrown into the tip or poured onto the ground. Not only was it a waste of a precious resource but it also caused some environmental damage. We have come a long way since those days and are now more conscious of our environment; we certainly seek to recycle waste products, and oils are a very important part of that recycling effort.
The purpose of this bill is to amend the Product Stewardship (Oil) Act 2000 to provide an effective exemption for certain multiuse oils and uses of multiuse oils from the product stewardship oil levy. The bill is also designed to introduce a mechanism which will allow the Minister for the Environment and Heritage to approve the use of certain oils as eligible for the category 8 benefit. The third purpose of the bill is to implement consequential amendments to the Product Grants and Benefits Administration Act to enable those category 8 claimants to register for the PSO benefits. We regard this legislation as non-controversial. We believe that it is a measure that can be supported by the opposition.
—Hear, hear!
—I am glad that the honourable member for—I have quite forgotten what seat you are representing there—
—We will leave that as a silent vote of support.
 (Ms Gambaro)—He is the member for Dunkley.
—I recall the member for Dunkley starring in a football match where the press and the Victorian MPs played the Allies. He only played one game and he never bothered to come back. We look forward to your next appearance, honourable member for Dunkley. I think this is a measure that you could support, even though you are in the government and you are proposing the bill. Even you could support this measure because they tell me that you are on the small `l' liberal side of the fence in the government, vying for a spot in the reshuffle. So we look forward to the speech you are going to make on this legislation. Indeed, this could establish your credentials as an up-and-comer on the wet side of the conservative ranks. We wish you well in that. We will be supporting this bill. It is an interesting piece of legislation that I think is deserving of support on all sides of the House.

"Billson, Bruce, MP",LP,2003-06-23,"—It is tough to follow the member for Corio; he is obviously thoroughly prepared for this debate this evening. But I welcome his support of the measure. In essence, the Howard government has introduced some internationally leading reforms with this product stewardship oil framework. We are amending it tonight in recognition of two key areas that need to be considered: consumers of oil, but not oil that needs to be recovered. That is the essence of this amending bill tonight.
I think I caught the member for Corio talking about changing the oil in your car; as all members of the parliament would be aware—and I am sure you are, Madam Deputy Speaker—we have in place a levy regime that recovers a contribution from the consumers of oil to provide a pool of funds to act as an incentive for those who are in the business of recovering that oil and putting it to sensible reuse. That is the broad framework; it is an internationally leading framework that has been recognised overseas as an excellent model for making sure that oil is taken out of the waste stream and does not end up in our ecosystems.
Tonight, though, we are looking at providing some relief from that arrangement so as to take account of two particular areas where oil is a part of production. The intent of the Product Stewardship (Oil) Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2003 is to grant relief from the product stewardship oil levy for specific uses of multipurpose oil. In this case the oil we are talking about is the oil that is used to bind inks together—those that end up on newsprint and the like—and also the oil that is part of the mould release agent of a metalworking lubricant. That is where the viscosity of the oil is part of metalworking and is consumed in the process, so you do not end up with a whole lot of oil; the oil does not find its way into the waste stream. Therefore, this measure—a sensible measure—is saying, `Let's not impose the levy where there isn't a waste oil to speak of from those two production processes.'
The Product Stewardship (Oil) Act was introduced as part of the Howard government's Measures for a Better Environment, which provided nearly $900 million for initiatives to protect our precious environment. That is $900 million on top of the Natural Heritage Trust, the salinity strategy, the world-leading oceans policy and the formation of the Australian Greenhouse Office. It is little wonder that the Howard government is rightly recognised as the greenest government this nation has ever seen. Senator Lyn Allison from the Democrats has acknowledged that point, and she is right. It is not about chasing the sexiest environmental issue in town and trying to build a constituency based on that. This is about doing the serious work on difficult and, at times, complex environmental issues that may not be the sexiest issues in town.
We know that oil can be very damaging to our ecosystems, particularly to our riparian and marine environments. We know that, if it is not properly cared for, recovered and processed, oil represents a threat. Here we have put in place a measure with an economic instrument—a pricing signal that says to oil users, `You will contribute to the cost of making sure that we recover the oil that you produce, consume and seek to dispose of so that there is a pool of funds to encourage its reuse.' 
The government, out of that Measures for a Better Environment package, provided $34.48 million in transitional assistance to provide funding to overcome the market barriers to waste oil recycling, to create and encourage innovative recycling technology, and to build and develop waste oil disposal centres. So it is a sensible, sober, thoughtful and, at the end of the day, very innovative approach to a very real environmental problem. It involves a per litre levy of 5.449c. As I mentioned earlier, this levy is used to fund benefit payments to waste oil recyclers. The benefits are paid in accordance with a six-tier scale that reflects the environmental effects of the various recycling and re-option uses that they are pursuing.
To date, the success of the product stewardship arrangement has been such that $25.5 million of the original $60-odd million transition assistance funds have been freed for reallocation to other urban initiatives, such as Sustainable Cities, where we can look at targeting urban air quality, ozone protection and waste management issues. So there is a positive environmental outcome with good economic consequences that this bill is extending further this evening.
Waste oil recycling has increased by 18 per cent under the product stewardship arrangements. So, for the calendar year 2002-03, a total of over 200 million litres of oil should be collected. Let us think about that: that is 200 million litres of oil that might otherwise find their way into our riparian and marine systems and damage the ecology. Before the commencement of these arrangements about 160 million litres were collected annually, so there is an improvement there. It has also caused the states to work cooperatively with local government and the federal government to proactively recover some of the oils that people might have just stuck down in the backyard. I know that, at the regional waste disposal and recycling centre that I attend, there is a capacity for you to deposit your oil. The people who recover that oil are able to apply for the financial assistance made possible by the product stewardship oil levy.
Since the commencement of the product stewardship arrangements for waste oil in January 2001, it has become evident that some oils included in the oil levy do not create waste oil that can be recycled. So, in keeping with the concept, these single-use oils that are not recyclable are being defined as exempt from the product stewardship oil levy in 2002. That is what this measure is about. Those multiuse oils used in a specific way—either in manufacturing or in another product—that can be recovered are being recovered. But, in this case, we are talking about specific single-use oils that cannot be recovered from the waste oil stream and recycled. They also have the feature of being very low-risk oils to the environment. Therefore, they are outside the original intent of the policy.
It makes sense to exempt these categories of oils from the levy. They have two key features: single use—that is, not able to be recycled—and not posing a risk to the environment. Tonight's amending bill will remove the levy from those oils and create a new category of benefit. The new benefit category is available for specific use and multiuse oils as approved by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, which is another provision discussed in this bill. It will create a new category, known as category 8, payable at the same rate as the waste oil levy of 5.449c per litre. In essence, there is industry support for this measure. It is taking an impost off some production processes that deliver no environmental gain because, as I mentioned earlier, they are single-use oils—they do not lend themselves to be recycled—and they do not pose a threat to the environment.  
The relief from the levy will also be a direct benefit to those who would otherwise be paying it had it not been exempted. I am just looking through some of the notes. It is probably quite evident, Madam Deputy Speaker, that we were not anticipating debating this bill this evening. In essence, this bill has the support of industry and government. It maintains the integrity of the product stewardship oil framework that the government has put in place. It seeks to protect the environment while not needlessly imposing the levy impost on ink manufacturers, publishers and even some people in the explosives industry. I understand they would be beneficiaries from the exemption. 
I commend the bill to the House. It is a refinement of an internationally recognised measure that is positive for our environment and that takes oil seriously. It tries to take, wherever possible, oil out of the waste stream so that it does not pose a threat to the environment, and it puts in place funds to provide incentives to those people wishing to recover and recycle the oil, in keeping with the objectives of the government's policy.",REPS,<title>PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP (OIL) LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,2003-06-23,"—Like the member for Dunkley, I was not anticipating that we would be debating the Product Stewardship (Oil) Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2003 just yet. I thank the member for Corio for filling in in my absence. 
—His gripping contribution.
—I am told it was a fine contribution. This legislation is non-controversial and will be supported by the opposition. The product stewardship arrangements for waste oil are part of the Measures for a Better Environment package that formed a key part of the Democrats' GST deal. That package has been consistently underspent. I want to make a few observations about that in due course. In terms of the legislation before us, the Customs Tariff Amendment (Product Stewardship for Waste Oil) Act 2000 and the Excise Tariff Amendment (Product Stewardship for Waste Oil) Act 2000 impose a levy on certain petroleum based oils and greases and their synthetic equivalents to fund the development of a recycling program for waste oil, known as the product stewardship arrangements for waste oil or PSO. 
The intention of the product stewardship arrangements for waste oil is to reduce the environmental impact of waste oil by imposing a levy on virgin oils and lubricants. The levy is then used to fund a benefit scheme designed to encourage the recycling of waste oils. Benefits are paid on a six-tier differentiated scale with differing benefit rates for various waste oil recycling activities. Multiuse oils that are used in a specific way, either in the manufacture of another product or in a process that does not create a recyclable waste oil stream, and are considered to present a low level of risk to the environment are outside the original policy intent of the product stewardship arrangements for waste oil. 
Given that these sorts of multiuse oils were not envisaged as being part of the scheme originally and are outside that policy intent, this bill provides a mechanism for exempting such oils from the levy. In order to effect this exemption, a new category of benefit, which is to be known as category 8 benefit, under the Product Stewardship (Oil) Act 2000 will be paid at the same time as the levy for uses of oil as approved by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage by Gazette notices.  
The purpose of this bill is to amend the Product Stewardship (Oil) Act 2000, firstly, to provide an effective exemption for certain multiuse oils and uses of multiuse oils from the product stewardship oil levy; secondly, to introduce a mechanism which will allow the Minister for the Environment and Heritage to approve the uses of certain oils as eligible for the category 8 benefit; and, thirdly, to implement consequential amendments to the Product Grants and Benefits Administration Act to enable category 8 claimants to register for these PSO benefits.
The parliamentary secretary—who is here this evening—in her press release of 11 June in outlining the scope of the problem said:
More than 500 million litres of lubricating oil is sold each year in Australia, over half of which is collected and recycled after use. Still, a large percentage of this used oil remains unaccounted for, and it could be hurting our environment.
Indeed it could. The press release went on to say:
Waste oil contains hazardous materials that are toxic and carcinogenic, and is harmful to the environment when irresponsibly discarded. These materials include benzene, toluene, dioxins, and other light hydrocarbons.
...	...	...
Recent figures suggest that more than 100 million litres of waste oil goes missing each year, which can be harmful to humans and the environment. It takes only one litre of oil to contaminate a million litres of drinking water.
The Howard government indicated that it had allocated $60 million to the product stewardship arrangements for waste oil. They commenced back in January 2001. We agree that this is a substantial problem and that it is a significant issue. That is why we support the bill. However, we did find that before too long the commitment to allocate $60 million to the product stewardship arrangements became exposed as hollow rhetoric and promises of funding were broken. 
In this year's budget, the government cut $40 million of the $60 million that was originally allocated for the transitional assistance component and said that this funding was no longer considered necessary for program implementation. The member for Dunkley, in his remarks, described this as money which had been freed for reallocation. The rhetoric of liberation is wonderful indeed, but it means that that money has not been spent in the way that the government said it was going to be. The journal Environmental Manager of May 20 this year reported:
A `reprioritisation' will see some funds originally intended for the $60m transitional assistance component of the Federal Government's used oil recycling scheme now go to other environment protection initiatives, the Budget papers show. An EM source said the oil stewardship advisory council had been assured funds would not be redirected. However, the minister's office said no such undertaking was given and the council has been informed the scheme may be amended.
Indeed it has been amended, and the money is now to be used in other ways. This latest cut by the Howard government to environment spending is, sadly, but one of many examples—and we have this over and over again—of this government's record of cuts and underspending. I indicated that the scheme we are debating tonight is part of the Measures for a Better Environment package that formed a key part of the Democrats' GST deal. The Measures for a Better Environment package included the Greenhouse Gas Abatement Program, the Renewable Remote Power Generation program, CNG and LPG vehicle conversion, the development and commercialisation of renewable energy, and diesel and oil recycling measures.  
The Measures for a Better Environment package has been consistently and massively underspent. The original Measures for a Better Environment commitment was $896 million over four years, from 2000-01 to 2003-04. Estimates questioning in May this year revealed, however, that actual spending will be $297.6 million over this period—a cut of 67 per cent. The Australian Greenhouse Office revealed that funding has now been pushed out until 2014—an extra 10 years—with no new money. That is extraordinary. This program is being pushed out over 10 years with no extra allocation of funds. It suggests that the level of commitment which this government claims to have to environmental protection and repair is not matched by what it provides by way of resources and that its professed commitment is not real. Funding over the life of the program will also be cut from a promised $896 million to $812 million—a cut of $84 million. 
When the government is not cutting the environment budget, it is in the business of allocating it to Liberal and National Party electorates, as we found recently with the Envirofund. More than 76 per cent of the $20 million Envirofund has been spent in Liberal and National Party electorates; indeed, in South Australia and in Western Australia more than 96 per cent of the grants went to Liberal electorates. This allocation cannot be defended on the grounds that the grants were allocated evenly around the country and that the Liberal and National parties represent a larger land mass. In fact, the distribution of Envirofund grants was not area based. Queensland projects received less than half the funding that New South Wales projects received, yet Queensland has a much larger area; and Western Australia got even less funding, despite having a larger area than both Queensland and New South Wales. The minister's response to these revelations was to claim that an Australian National Audit Office report of late 2001 found no bias, that they are assessed in an apolitical process on their merits. In fact, Envirofund was announced on 4 April 2002—which is more than a year after the Audit Office audit—so the minister has been misleading the public and the media about auditing of the Natural Heritage Trust's Envirofund by the National Audit Office. Natural Heritage Trust funding has never been about achieving the right outcomes. Under this government, the primary objective has been to buy votes, and the Minister for the Environment and Heritage should have the Audit Office conduct an audit into what has all the hallmarks of a $20 million pork-barrelling exercise.
The government's failure in this area is nothing compared with its irresponsible and illogical position on the Kyoto protocol on climate change. Australia cannot solve climate change—which is caused by accelerating greenhouse gas emissions—on its own. A collective, international effort is required. More than 100 countries have now ratified the treaty, and ratification by the Russian Federation, expected later this year, will ensure that the protocol will come into international force this year. On 29 April this year we saw the fifth anniversary of Australia's signing of the Kyoto protocol. I believe we have deliberated long enough. With the protocol on the verge of coming into force, even Australia's peak business lobby, the Business Council of Australia, has reconsidered its opposition to the ratification of the protocol, and many of its members now publicly support ratification. Early action would allow Australian industry to take advantage of growing global markets for environmental goods and services and to prepare for the reality of a carbon constrained future.
In May this year I introduced to federal parliament a private member's bill to ratify the Kyoto protocol on climate change. I believe the government should support this important legislation, which would give legal effect to Australia's Kyoto target and ensure that Australian industry can take advantage of emerging new markets when the treaty comes into international force. So far, the minister's response to the challenge of climate change has been about a government-business climate change dialogue and getting on-side with the United States through what is euphemistically referred to as a climate action partnership. What we need to do, however, is to aim to stabilise and, in the longer term, work to reverse, the impact of human induced climate change.  
Labor are serious about tackling climate change. We would ratify the Kyoto protocol on climate change, and we are also committed to domestic action on greenhouse gases. On World Environment Day we pledged to increase Australia's use of renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power, by an additional five per cent by 2010. Indeed, a Newspoll survey released soon after, on 11 June, showed that 83 per cent of Australians would be willing to pay extra if they got their power from renewable sources—an interesting commentary on public interest in these issues and on the level of public support for renewable energy sources. Such a commitment would enable Australia to meet its Kyoto target, create thousands of jobs and attract investment, and it is estimated that it would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by some 17 million tonnes.
An additional five per cent mandatory renewable energy target has been supported by the Business Council for Sustainable Energy and represents a significant increase to the Howard government's existing target. The Prime Minister originally committed to a two per cent increase but, since the government announced that target in 1997, the contribution of renewable energy has actually fallen by two per cent. That target is presently under review. This provides a perfect opportunity for the government to respond to the overwhelming community support to increase it.
Labor's commitment to an additional five per cent of renewable energy in Australia's electricity supply mix will help Australia meet its Kyoto target, create many jobs, attract investments and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We believe that the sustainable energy sector is a growth industry of the future and, by supporting Labor's five per cent target, the government can ensure that this is the case. Let me conclude by saying that I think the government needs to get serious about environment protection and repair and to spend less time on self-congratulatory backslapping and more time on seeing that money allocated for the environment is actually spent on the environment.

"Haase, Barry, MP",LP,2003-06-23,"—I rise in support of the Product Stewardship (Oil) Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2003, a bill that highlights the federal government's ongoing commitment to progressive environmental policies. The product stewardship scheme was initiated by the Howard government's Measures for a Better Environment package in 2000 and was designed to ensure the environmentally sustainable management and refining of waste oil. The product stewardship program has seen the oil companies progressively assume a greater share of the costs incurred in recycling waste oil. These costs are therefore borne not by the public but by the markets which gain most benefit from the production and use of that oil. Furthermore, the program actively encourages oil recyclers to undertake advanced recycling of waste oil, with a view to minimising the environmental impact of industries which produce these potentially damaging by-products. 
The intent of this amendment bill is to recognise that, in fact, oils ain't oils. It has become apparent that certain oils and certain uses of oils fall outside the original intent of the policy and should receive a rebate for the full amount of the levy. These are single-use oils which cannot be recycled into a usable product. The Product Stewardship (Oil) Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2003, introduced into parliament by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage on 27 March this year, creates a new category benefit, to be known as category 8 benefit, which will be paid under the act at the same rate as the levy. In other words, those industries which produce recyclable waste oil will be encouraged to refine and reuse it, while those which produce inherently non-recyclable waste oil that is deemed of minimal risk to the environment will not be penalised.
These amendments preserve the original intent of the product stewardship arrangements for waste oil by continuing to advocate the federal government's vision for responsible and efficient recycling options. The Commonwealth government's dedication to recycling in this and other bills is further evidence of its commitment to the environment—a commitment that extends across all regions of Australia. We have heard the member for Wills wax lyrical about the pork-barrelling nature of what is being done by this government in order to address environmental issues. I can assure the member for Wills that no such pork-barrelling has gone on in my electorate. I have an electorate where my constituents—thank goodness—are definitely involved in and concerned about the nature of their environment, and therefore they seek out every opportunity to obtain funds, primarily Commonwealth funds, in an endeavour to address environmental deficiencies and apparent degradation. I suggest to the member for Wills that, rather than denigrating this very forward thinking and environmentally conscious coalition government, he ought to spend his time in his electorate promoting the federal government packages that will put money on the ground to assist environmentalists in his electorate to do good works for the future.
Industrial waste management and the environment are inextricably intertwined issues within my electorate of Kalgoorlie, which encompasses 2.3 million square kilometres and balances mining and industry with spectacular ecotourism. I remind the House that, at a recent mineral industry dinner, the centrepiece on the table was Mondo grass in a miner's helmet. I thought that perfectly reflected the mining industry's concern these days with things environmental. At that dinner I heard the simple fact that all of the minerals mined in this great nation of ours today are mined from a footprint of area approximately equal to the collective parking lots of this nation's hotels. It is worth reflecting that the impact created by the mining industry is minimal while its concerns for the environment are major. When it comes to compiling the list of environmental heroes in this country today, some of our leading mining industries must be among that list.
As the member for Kalgoorlie, I work hard to promote a viable business and industry focus for my constituents, while simultaneously striving to preserve the astonishing beauty and biodiversity of our land. We do not want to see our streams and waterways polluted with unrefined waste oil, which is why I commend the Commonwealth government's enterprising recycling efforts. In keeping with the Howard government's dedication to the protection of the environment, it has instigated numerous long-term programs designed to manage our regional and urban areas so that we may enjoy them for generations to come. One such program is the National Action Plan on Salinity and Water Quality, which offers some $700 million of Commonwealth funds to fight the nationwide salinity problem in Australia. We have the federal commitment. Now we must take action to address an environmental concern which will only grow worse if we drag our heels and fail to act. Salinity is one environmental issue that we have created, especially in the rural and broadacre farming areas, but it is one that we can solve together if we act quickly enough. 
In relation to the timeliness and the speed of that action, I bring the attention of the House to the fact that the government of Western Australia are still recalcitrant when it comes to addressing this issue. They are yet to come to the table with equal funding on a dollar for dollar basis with the Commonwealth; they are yet to act in the protection of our environment, the reduction of the effects of salinity and the improvement of our broadacre farming areas for the future.
As has been agreed by other state premiers and chief ministers, we do not want recycled old programs brought forward by people trying to dud the Commonwealth and other states out of their deserved dollars. In order to attract some of this federal $700 million, the Western Australian government must bring to the table programs which are approved by local environmentalists as being necessary in their particular environment, which are clearly new and which get down to tintacks and really do something on the ground about promoting the reduction of saline affected land.
The federal government is certainly acting to fund important environmental projects in regional Australia. For example, the Natural Heritage Trust, together with the National Action Plan on Salinity and Water Quality, represents the largest commitment to the environment by any Australian government. The program includes $12.7 million allocated for ecologically vital schemes in Western Australia. The federal funding not only embraces and recognises the environmental needs of many regions within my Kalgoorlie electorate but also provides $600,000 to promote ecologically sustainable pastoral management that complements work undertaken in the Gascoyne-Murchison region, expanding the program into the Southern Rangelands district; $295,000 for the Kimberley Regional Fire Management Project to encourage improved fire control skills, strategies and regimes and to identify biodiversity at risk from fires; $175,000 for integrating marine water quality objectives into regional planning and encouraging ecologically sustainable development on the North West Shelf; and $124,690 to improve environmental management of ecology and industry in the Ord region, targeting issues such as the loss of biodiversity, land misuse and water quality degradation. This is a significant program, aimed at implementing the Ord Land and Water Management Plan and minimising the threat to the riverine environment through better pesticide controls. The funding also provides $270,000 for the Pilbara bioregion biological survey to fund the inchoative stages of a comprehensive biological survey in the area.
I am pleased to commend a bill that encourages more ecologically and economically sustainable management of the environment by Australian industry in rural and urban communities. I am equally pleased to commend a bill that advocates sensible management of waste oil but does not disadvantage industries which are environmentally responsible but are otherwise unable to produce a reusable oil product. It gives me great satisfaction to support the Product Stewardship (Oil) Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2003 in the House.",REPS,<title>PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP (OIL) LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Stone, Dr Sharman, MP",LP,2003-06-23,"—In summing up the debate on the Product Stewardship (Oil) Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2003, let me say that since the commencement of the product stewardship arrangements, which began in January 2001, it has become apparent that some oils and some particular uses of oil captured by the waste oil levy are not available as waste product to be recycled. They do not create a recyclable waste stream and they represent only low levels of risk to the environment. These oils are outside the original policy intent of the product stewardship arrangements and so we do not believe they should be subject to the waste oil levy. The member for Dunkley, the first speaker in this debate, identified these products and spoke at length about this situation. 
This bill provides a mechanism to enable specific uses of multipurpose oils to be exempted from the waste oil levy. These changes complement exemptions for certain single purpose oils that were enabled by amendment of the Excise Tariff Amendment Act (No. 1) 2002 and Customs Tariff Amendment Act (No. 2) 2002, passed by parliament in November 2002. The exemptions for single purpose oils took effect from 14 April that year.
I am very pleased to hear that the opposition are supporting this bill. It is just plain commonsense. I am also very pleased that the purpose of this bill has been achieved so significantly by oil users right across the economy—and particularly in rural and regional areas, where distance has often made it uneconomic to collect waste oils and transport them to places where they could be recycled for reuse.
The amendments will provide relief from the levy for users of multipurpose oils which are outside the original policy intent of the product steward arrangements. We are very pleased to say that the amendments will make this a much more closely targeted piece of legislation. Beneficiaries of the exemption will be companies that have been bearing the cost of the waste oil levy in respect of these multipurpose oils since 2001. These may include ink manufacturers, publishers and explosives manufacturers.
The amendments will provide levy relief from the earliest possible date—the date of the introduction of the bill into parliament, 27 March 2003. The cost to the government of providing an effective exemption for certain oils and uses of oils from the PSO levy will be small. Based on Treasury estimates, the cost of this relief for uses of the oil likely to qualify for the exemptions would be less than five per cent of total PSO levy revenues, or $1 million per annum, rising to $2 million in 2006-07. The amendments will implement a mechanism in the act to allow the Minister for the Environment and Heritage to approve exemptions by way of a declaration published in the Gazette. I think it is a very sensible set of amendments, and I appreciate the opposition noting that.
However, the member for Wills, the shadow spokesman for the environment and heritage in this place, was critical when he referred to cut funding for this program. As per usual, the member for Wills got it very wrong. The government has provided a total of $34.48 million in transitional assistance funding to overcome market barriers to waste oil recycling, to help build much needed waste oil disposal centres and to create innovative recycling technology. Since the inception of the product stewardship arrangements, a total of $5.5 million has been spent through 270 local councils to build 458 waste oil collection facilities throughout Australia. Transitional assistance funds have also been used for a number of larger projects. For example, Alice Springs Town Council has received a grant of $105,050 for the region's first waste oil collection facility and for research into a waste oil collection network for surrounding Aboriginal, tourism and mining communities—some of those remote communities I referred to before which could never hope to have their waste oils collected and recycled. 
The great success of the product stewardship arrangements for waste oil to date has been such that $25.52 million of the original $60 million of transitional assistance funds has been freed for reallocation—in this case, to a new urban environment initiative, Sustainable Cities. This targets urban air quality, ozone protection and waste management issues. Funds were only redistributed after we had considered the positive change in the collection and reuse of waste oil. After only 2½ years of the product stewardship arrangements for waste oil, it was clear that we were really meeting our targets. There has also been remarkable success in the establishment and operation of rural and remote waste oil collection facilities. The product stewardship arrangements for waste oil have increased waste oil recycling by approximately 18 per cent. Prior to the commencement of the arrangements, industry estimated that 165 million litres was collected annually and, of course, was sitting in various places in the landscape. For 2002-03, we are heading for a final volume of just over 200 million litres collected.
Interestingly, whenever the member for Wills runs out of things to say about the environment, natural resource management, sustainability, government policy or indeed any alternative policy, he tends to get back on his high horse trying to flog the idea that this government pork-barrels or only gives dollars that can be spent on the environment in coalition electorates. He quoted in his remarks that 96 per cent of all stewardship payments seem to have gone to Liberal electorates. The most ignorant amongst us would very quickly understand that the vast majority of mainland Australia is represented in this place by Liberal or National Party members. Indeed, the most recent speaker in this debate, the member for Kalgoorlie, has one of the largest electorates in the world. It constitutes over 70 per cent of the state of Western Australia. So is it any surprise that much of the stewardship oil dollars have gone to an enormous part of Western Australia that also happens to be sensible enough to vote for a Liberal member?
Opposition members interjecting—
 (Hon. L.R.S. Price)—I remind honourable members on my left of standing order 58.
—Let me add that when the shadow spokesman, in years gone by, tried to mount the same story about Natural Heritage Trust funding, he never commented on the ANAO findings that there was no evidence whatsoever of a selective application of those funds to coalition seats. In fact, the funds were distributed according to the landscape needs. It just so happens that rural and regional Australia is, to a very substantial degree, represented by coalition members in this place.
The member for Wills, after saying that he was very supportive of the bill, went on to say that Australia's stance on the Kyoto protocol was a problem for Australia, and he put on the record that the Labor Party would ratify the Kyoto protocol. I remind the member for Wills that Australia is on target to reach its Kyoto emissions reduction standards. We are doing that despite a growth period in the Australian economy, and we are doing it in such a way that we are not seeing vast sectors of the Australian industrial work force put out of work—for example, in the Latrobe Valley. So I find it rather interesting that, whenever the shadow spokesman runs out of things to say, he reaches back into the old, hoary chestnut bag and says, `Of course all these dollars go to coalition seats,' and that he is now talking about Australia not being one of the world leaders in addressing the problems of greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, Australia, as the leader of the umbrella group, put vegetation into the debate. I want to say how proud I am as parliamentary secretary to be able to put this bill before us tonight. It is another example of how we have addressed one of the problems associated with Australia's population diversity and the very low population densities in some parts, where we do need extra assistance to help the people deal with waste materials. I commend this bill to the House.

Message from the Governor-General recommending appropriation announced.",REPS,<title>PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP (OIL) LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Hatton, Michael, MP",ALP,2003-06-23,"—I second the second reading amendment to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 2003 moved by my colleague the member for Kingston. What we are dealing with here is a range of what are, to most people in Australian society, quite arcane matters. These tax matters are not the normal bread and butter of the Australian population. They are quite particular, they are detailed and they are difficult for most people to come to terms with. I commend the shadow minister for the way in which he has dealt with the material in the bill in his attempt to make some commonsense out of them, explain them to us within caucus and, in his speech in the second reading debate, explain them to people at large. 
Later I will go to some of the matters contained in the bill, but the amendments need to be understood in the broader context of the bill, because the matters that are dealt with—questions of thin capitalisation, offshore tax havens and a series of other matters—are encompassed in the amendments.
Schedules 1, 2 and 3 deal with thin capitalisation. This is a favourite of treasurers or assistant treasurers. Usually the assistant treasurer gets the job of carrying through the legislation in this area. The issue is quite complex and detailed; it demands a fairly comprehensive control and understanding of various aspects of the tax act. Schedule 4 of the bill deals with foreign dividend accounts, schedule 5 with FBT exemption for public hospitals, schedule 6 with reducing tax on ETPs, and schedule 7 with the application of the same business test. Schedule 8 deals with tax losses.
If we look at those globally, trying to seek a context, when we go to the amendment put forward by the shadow minister, we can see that he is trying to put a broad case that the various matters dealt with in this bill should have a broader context. The amendment says:
(1)	condemns the Howard Government for its lack of fiscal control, having increased both outlays and tax substantially ...
From a Labor point of view, looking at the past seven years and the difference between rhetoric and what has actually been done in this area, Labor has consistently said that this government has taxed highly compared to all previous governments. At question time and when he deigns to debate particular bills, the Treasurer has argued the opposite—that his government is not high taxing. The shadow minister makes the argument that the reason that tax has increased substantially is that the government has chosen to increase it. What is not mentioned in the amendment is that that has been done by a series of different measures undertaken by this government.
Today in question time we again saw interjections when the opposition argued that the series of levies brought in by this Treasurer are in fact taxes. One set of levies was going to be imposed, but, the member for Kooyong tells me, and it is quite true, the Timor war tax levy was withdrawn. In its place, we have a series of industry specific levies, the most important being the levy in relation to the dairy industry. We also have a levy because of the problems people have had in the sugar industry. For every major industry specific problem that has been brought to the attention of the government, it seems that the easiest course has been not to look to the general revenue or measures to be taken from within that general revenue but to strike yet another separate source of income which will have a life of its own.
As I have argued before, you can go to other jurisdictions in Australia for easy parallels. For instance, there is the New South Wales state government and what was supposed to be a short-term levy, the 3x3 levy on petrol—3c by three years—introduced by the Greiner government. That is still in play. I think it was introduced in 1988. From then until now, it has run for about 14 years. It is hardly 3c by three years. It is in fact three cents by about 14 years, and there is no end of the levy in sight. Governments that have come in after the levy was introduced have argued that it served a social purpose and that, because that social purpose was there, it was important to interact in a different way from the way one might expect. However, given the nature of levies themselves—
—Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. If the member for Blaxland is moving a specific amendment to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 2003, why is he not talking about that bill? 
 (Mr Lindsay)—The member for Blaxland is not moving the amendment; he has seconded the amendment and I believe he is talking to it. I am listening carefully.
—I am dealing with this more pertinently than the Treasurer deals with questions that he is asked. What I am arguing here has contextual relevance. As you will see when you look at examples elsewhere and in state jurisdictions, when a government determines to lay on a series of levies those levies may not be short term but may be imposed for a long period of time so that the amount of taxation thereby levied is increased not only over the short term but also over the long term. We have seen that already with the dairy levy, the sugar levy and the levies relating to ethanol. With the ethanol bounty we are looking at hundreds of millions of dollars a year. What has been argued by the shadow minister and what I am quite properly arguing in seconding and speaking to the amendment is that, if you add together the levies, taxes, charges and bounties, you will find that taxation has increased substantially under this government. The government have attempted to worm their way out of that by saying, `We are not really taking account of what is has happened with levies and charges.'
The shadow minister has argued that there has been an increase in outflows as well. If we look at particular outlays over particular periods of time, we can see that a series of measures was brought in prior to the Novem-ber 2001 election, in the six months after February 2001. An amount of the order of $20,000 million was outlayed in different areas. The government attempted to use that out-lay to garner support within the community, particularly among retirees and various other groups. That helped to lay the foundation for their winning the last election. So, on the first point of the amendment, the shadow minister has argued that not only increased taxes—and I would say charges and levies as well—but also increased outlays have created a particular set of problems for the budget which we have been debating for some time now and on which I have spoken previously. The budget was enormously constrained and the level of surplus was extremely low because of that set of circumstances.
The second point the shadow minister makes in his amendment is that the House:
... notes that the Government has also allowed the budget position to materially deteriorate by failing to deliver its own stated objective of a revenue neutral outcome on the Review of Business Taxation and its failure to confront major threats to the revenue through a growing tax avoidance industry including through the use of offshore tax havens ...
I will not go to the first part of that, but the second part is extremely important. I had the experience of working both in this House and in the old House for the former member for Blaxland, who was Treasurer and then Prime Minister. The whole question of dealing with offshore tax havens and the threat to the revenue that they pose was enormously instructive. What was done during the Hawke-Keating period with Mr Keating as Treasurer demonstrates just how enormously difficult it is to deal appropriately with offshore tax havens to try to lock down the leakage of Australian tax revenue and stop the haemorrhaging or sieving of income out of the tax system and overseas, thereby protecting that revenue for use by the government—then our Labor government and eventually the coalition government which took over. 
It took a number of years to put forward the initial legislation because, although the government was entirely aware of the fact that so much was being lost to Australia's tax revenue, its key problem was that it needed to gain the support and cooperation of a number of international jurisdictions in order to take effective action. It first had to deal with the question of gaining assistance from New Zealand and the United States and then had to seek to put legislation together that would not just be adequate but would ensure that ready access to a series of tax havens was not available to people in Australia. That legislation took, I think, two to three years to put together and then get through the parliament. The problem you then face is that, once you have a set of legislation in place, the tax avoidance industry is such that it arises in another place with another set of modes, circumstances and ways in which it can attempt to suborn the collection of tax.
We have seen over a number of years a series of attempts by people in the tax industry to work their way through not only onshore but also, latterly in particular, offshore tax havens. In this regard I commend Mr Carmody, the Commissioner of Taxation, and the people from the Australian Taxation Office who have sought to do their fundamental duty of trying to secure Australia's tax revenue and ensure that not only it but also the purposes to which it will eventually be put are safeguarded. Whoever is in government, this parliament cannot pass budget bills, tax laws and associated laws to substantially change the way things are done in Australia unless the revenue is there in the first place. The shadow minister points to this in particular because it is in the charge of the Treasurer and the Assistant Treasurer to ensure that every resource possible is given to the Australian Taxation Office to make sure that internal and external haemorrhaging is staunched.
Paragraph (3) of this amendment states that the House:
... notes that, as a result of these failures, the Government lacks the capacity to enhance the international competitiveness of Australia's taxation system, return the full value of bracket creep either through tax cuts or services, provide the health and education services needed by low and middle income Australians, and support the provision of retirement incomes for all Australians.
The latter part of that goes to questions that I have just been dealing with—the fundamental functions of the federal government: providing health and education services needed by low- and middle-income earners directly through the TAFE system and tertiary education and indirectly through the revenue passed on to the states to provide for those services; and, most importantly, the provision of retirement incomes for all Australians either directly through the social security system or through supplementation for people on superannuation payments. The core of the argument that the shadow Assistant Treasurer has put is encapsulated in the first part:
 ... the Government lacks the capacity to enhance the international competitiveness of Australia's taxation system ... 
If we cannot compete effectively with other countries in the market we cannot ensure that we attract international businesses to Australia—that they will decide to set up regional headquarters, which we have been encouraging now for more than a decade and a half, or a substantial part of their business—or that those businesses will feel that they have been fairly treated in terms of an international tax regime. They need to have the absolute certainty that we (1) are competitive, (2) are in this game for the long term and (3) will ensure that they will continue to be properly treated. While in government we did everything in our power to ensure that we opened Australia's economy to the world. We opened Australia's doors to companies that were willing to relocate their regional headquarters and/or create a more vibrant, efficient, effective and creative Australia by bringing their expertise, skills and investment moneys to provide jobs for Australians and build their industries in combination with Australia. The fundamental platform that one can provide is to have an internationally competitive Australian taxation system. 
The other key point that is pertinent now relates to the Treasurer's announcement that there were to be tax cuts and the partial hand-back of bracket creep. Today in question time the Treasurer again referred to it, announcing that those tax cuts were due to start from 1 July. He then went on to say that someone on about $25,000 a year could expect $300 or so in tax cuts. The shadow Assistant Treasurer, however, has argued that the return of the full value of bracket creep through either tax cuts or services is what the game should be about. We have seen the Treasurer argue on budget night and shortly thereafter that, in the future, the government may have a mind, after it has ensured that there is an adequate surplus, to return some of the bracket creep to people as tax cuts or, indeed, as other services. This is a fairly large change in the approach of this government. Even with $10 billion worth of tax cuts, even with tax cuts which are minor, mean and meagre on any scale and run to the smallest we have seen being given, it is extremely novel for the Treasurer to say that in the future he might even look at services or other things that might need to be done. 
In arguing that, he has said that it may be appropriate in the future to look to other means of paying Australians back for the extra amount of tax they have paid as a result of bracket creep. Traditionally, governments have given that back. Labor gave it back four or five times during the 13 years it was in government. Tranches of bracket creep were given back and we combined that with the changes we made in superannuation. The Treasurer has erroneously in the past argued that we did not pay the l-a-w tax cuts. The first tranche of that was paid nine months early and the second tranche was legislated to be commuted into superannuation and to be paid one year later as compensation. Maybe the Treasurer has taken the leaf from Labor's book here. He has said that people were not paid, but it was a coalition government that did not pay the second part of that into superannuation. A re-elected Labor govern-ment in 1996 would have done so, and we would be looking at 12 per cent and then 15 per cent superannuation input rather than nine per cent, which is where it has been capped.
I commend the amendment put by the shadow Assistant Treasurer to this omnibus bill of a range of measures dealing with thin capitalisation, offshore accounts, FBT payments through hospitals and others. The tax revenue needs to be protected by measures such as these, but it also needs to be protected against the depredations of those who, either onshore or offshore, would seek to destroy it.
 (Mr Lindsay)—I indicate to the member for Farrer that the previous occupant of the chair apologises that the order of speakers became out of synchronisation.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 5) 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1,speech
"Ley, Sussan, MP",LP,2003-06-23,"—I quite happily accept the apology, because it has given the opportunity to listen in detail to the member for Blaxland's explanation—although I am not sure that it was an explana-tion—of why the opposition has moved a second reading amendment to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 2003. This bill concerns five main measures, none of them particularly remarkable. I would hesitate to say that all of them do not protect the revenue. The member for Blaxland has talk-ed about our failure to confront threats through offshore tax havens and the need for our tax system to be internationally competitive in the context of these amendments. Again, I am not sure what links are made but, as I go through the five main measures in this bill, it will be clear that we are making our tax system internationally competitive, we are confronting threats through offshore tax havens, we are continuing with the good work we have done with the review of business taxation and the Ralph review of tax reform and we are building on a sensible, workable, fair and efficient tax system. 
The thin capitalisation measures commenced on 1 July 2001. They limit the amount of debt that can be used to finance the Australian operations of certain investors by reducing the debt deductions—essentially the interest expenses—when an entity's debt to equity ratio exceeds certain limits. These measures are preventing offshore entities using us as a way of getting taxation deductions—an activity which the previous speaker spoke of as being necessary. The policy underlying the so-called thin capitalisation regime is to ensure that multinational entities do not allocate an excessive amount of debt to their Australian operations. The amendments will ensure that the policy objectives of the thin capitalisation regime are achieved, that equity between taxpayers is promoted, that generally compliance costs are reduced and that the application of the law is clarified.
The amendments to the regime will extend the range of entities that qualify as securitisation vehicles, and so are excluded from the thin capitalisation rules. They will allow certain financial entities to use the same gearing methodology as used by the banks, and they will relax the requirements for revaluation of assets and ease record-keeping requirements for permanent establishments. The amendments will reduce compliance costs for taxpayers and will ensure that taxpayers undertaking similar financial activities are able to apply comparable thin capitalisation rules.
The next measure is the FBT exemption for public hospitals. Currently, public hospitals of the Commonwealth, a state or a territory must be public benevolent institutions in order for FBT exemptions to apply. However, public hospitals that are not hospitals of the Commonwealth, a state or a territory do not have to be a public benevolent institution. Certain public hospitals are currently provided with an FBT exemption of up to $17,000 grossed up taxable value per employee. As part of the government's response to the report of the inquiry into the definition of charities and related organisations, changes will be made to the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986. These amendments will ensure that, whether or not a public hospital is a public benevolent institution, public hospitals of the Commonwealth, a state or a territory will continue to have access to the $17,000 capped FBT exemption and, for the purposes of the remote area housing FBT exemption, a `remote area' for a public hospital will be one that is at least 100 kilometres from a population centre of 130,000 or more.
This amendment is designed to allay the suspicions of state governments that a change in the structure of their public hospitals in the future may result in their no longer meeting the public benevolent institution requirements and losing access to the FBT con-cessions—and that is not something this gov-ernment would willingly do or try to do with any backhanded measure. In referring to the member for Blaxland's comments about some dire need to protect the revenue, this is again an unremarkable administrative measure. 
The third measure concerns reducing the tax on excessive ETPs, and I understand the opposition is opposing this measure quite vigorously. This measure has two components. It delivers one of the government's 2001 superannuation election commitments and will be beneficial to taxpayers. Through a reduction in the rate of tax, the measure will benefit those who take lump sums—otherwise called eligible termination payments—from superannuation funds on retirement, where the lump sum is above the person's reasonable benefit limit. The impact on taxpayers will vary, depending on taxpayers' individual circumstances. The first component of the measure reduces the tax payable by a person who gets a lump sum payment from a super fund that is above the reasonable benefit limit of $562,195—now called an excessive lump sum—from 48.5 per cent to 39.5 per cent. The second component will reduce the super surcharge that the person has to pay. The amount of the surcharge reduction will depend on the contributions made to the super fund in the year that the excessive lump sum payment is paid.
Industry has been consulted widely in developing both the policy detail and the legislation for this measure. Industry believes that the measure implements the government's election commitment and supports the fact that superannuation funds do not bear any new compliance costs. This measure is necessary because sometimes the overall tax paid on excessive lump sums from superannuation funds is greater than the top marginal tax rate. Total tax might include contributions tax and the superannuation surcharge in addition to the ETP tax rate for excessive components of 47 per cent, plus the Medicare levy. The government is trying to avoid a situation where the effective marginal tax rate on the excessive component of an ETP from a superannuation fund exceeds the top marginal tax rate. The tax rate which applies to earnings and the surcharge varies from year to year and does not affect all taxpayers in the same way. We would have to introduce some administrative mechanism that explains how, for each taxpayer, these amounts contributed to the excessive ETP. What sort of an administrative and compliance burden would that be? We have perfectly sensibly chosen a model that relieves excessive tax rates with a minimum administrative burden.
If some taxpayers are being subjected to tax rates higher than the top marginal tax rate, should we not be doing something about it, particularly when we are talking about eligible termination payments, superannuation and retirement? Should we be giving people who have worked hard and saved hard a kick in the teeth by taxing their eligible termination payments at higher than any other tax rate? Remember that these ETPs are generally not golden handshakes or complimentary buckets of money. They usually represent the accumulated savings of a lifetime of hard work. Again, the opposition seems terrified of anything that removes what we often see as a penalty tax rate.
There are two more measures: one is the application of the `same business test'. In the context of these amendments, currently under the income tax law taxpayers are entitled to deduct in an income year losses incurred in previous years. Special rules apply to companies. Companies are allowed to deduct a prior year loss if they pass what is called a `continuity of ownership test'. Broadly, more than 50 per cent ownership of the company must be maintained from the beginning of the year of the loss until the end of the year in which the deduction is claimed. If the company does not pass this test, it can still claim the deduction if it passes the `same business test'. Broadly, a company must carry on the same business both immediately before the disqualifying change of ownership and during the year it claims deduction for the loss. Similarly, a company cannot deduct a debt that it writes off as bad in the current year, unless it satisfies either the continuity of ownership test or the same business test. 
Problems inherent in the current law have become apparent in circumstances where a com-pany is unable to positively satisfy the con-tinuity of ownership test but is also unable to demonstrate a specific date on which it failed the continuity of ownership test—that is, the company is unable to establish a test time for which the same business test can be applied. These amendments provide for what is called a `default test time' at which that same business test can be applied if the company cannot properly determine exactly when it failed the continuity of ownership test.
The final measure concerns tax losses for corporate entities. This measure will ensure companies do not have to use up tax losses against franked dividend income which is already tax free because of the availability of the franking tax offset. Corporate groups have in the past been able to avoid the wastage of losses by separating the franked dividend income and losses between different members of the group. For example, dividend income could be received by the head company of the group while various trading activities and any losses associated with those activities could be contained within subsidiaries. With the advent of the consolidation regime, this ability to quarantine losses from franked dividend income has been removed.
These changes will allow companies to choose the amount of prior year tax losses they want to deduct. Also, any excess franking tax offsets will be allowed to be carried forward as an equivalent amount of tax loss for deduction in a later income year. This was a Ralph recommendation and it was a budget announcement. I commend the measures in this bill to the House. I urge the opposition to get on the same train that we have been on since we introduced a modern, more equitable tax system, with courage and not without pain—a tax system for today, not yesterday. I conclude by heartily agreeing with the member for Blaxland that we do need a tax system that competes in an international market in a globalised world economy. Thank goodness this government is introducing just such a tax system.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 5) 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1,speech
"Zahra, Christian, MP",ALP,2003-06-23,"—I rise to speak on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 2003. It is important that we in this chamber never lose sight of the basic fact that, when we talk about taxation, we are talking about people's salaries and how much they contribute to the services that they get in return for paying that tax. It seems to me that this is a fact that is often lost on people on the other side. But we on this side of the House have never lost sight of the fact that, when people pay tax, they expect to get good services. People in my electorate expect good services. There might not be too many millionaires in my electorate and we might not be rich people, but we pay our fair share and we pay the taxes that the Commonwealth requires us to pay. We do that cheerfully and we do it with the expectation that we are going to get decent services, but under the Howard government we have been bitterly disappointed. 
I will take you back a few years—not that long ago but a long time ago in terms of the people in my electorate—to 1996 when this government got elected. We in my electorate all remember that horrible first budget of the Howard government, when so many of the basic services that people in my electorate had come to expect from government—ser-vices they had contributed to in terms of the taxation revenue of this country and which they expected would continue—were taken away from them. In my electorate, one of those services included funding for the Family Research Centre of Morwell. Around 80 or 100 jobs were lost from Monash University's Gippsland campus at Churchill, there were a lot of jobs lost from TAFE, and Telstra reduced its regional work force in Gippsland by about 80—and so it goes on. We lost a lot of jobs and we lost a lot of services, but we continue to pay the same amount of tax—and with the introduction of the goods and services tax we pay even more tax. 
The reasonable expectation that you might have is if you pay more tax you get more service. That is not an unreasonable thing for people in the community to imagine. But that has not proved to be the case in the electorate of McMillan or in the Gippsland region more generally. I will make an important point about some of the key services that people expect to receive when they pay tax. There is probably nothing more basic, nothing more immediate and nothing more important to people in my electorate—and I think to people in the country more generally—than having access to decent health services. Unfortunately, we have seen a reduction in the Commonwealth contribution to health services in the electorate of McMillan and the Gippsland region more generally, and bulk-billing in the Gippsland region continues to decline.
I noticed some statistics released late last week show that the Gippsland region now has a GP bulk-billing rate of 46.7 per cent—less than half. Less than half of the medical consultations in the Gippsland region are bulk-billed. If you drive around the electorate of McMillan and the Gippsland region more generally, you will be very hard-pressed to come across a bulk-billing clinic or a bulk-billing medical centre. There are not many of those medical centres in the Gippsland region or the electorate of McMillan.
This stands in sharp contrast to the range of services that people get in and around Melbourne, in and around Sydney and in and around some of the other big cities in this country. Those people pay about the same amount of tax as those in the electorate of McMillan pay but they have access to a greater range of services. They are able to enjoy access to bulk-billing, which people in the Gippsland region are not able to enjoy. That is not a fair situation and does not reflect the ordinary rules of fairness, decency and proportionality that you would expect to apply in relation to things like taxation and service delivery. We in the Gippsland region pay the same amount of tax as other people in the country and we should be able to enjoy the same level of service as other people get in the towns and cities in which they live.
We in the Gippsland region also expect to have critical infrastructure issues addressed by the Commonwealth government. It is not an unreasonable expectation to want to have these critical infrastructure projects funded in the same way as critical infrastructure projects are funded in other places in Australia. We in the Gippsland region think that those projects which are important to us and which require a substantial amount of Commonwealth funding should also be committed to.
I know that as a Victorian, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, you would be well aware of the issues relating to the Princes Highway East and the Pakenham district. It is recognised in the Commonwealth government's budget papers that the Princes Highway through the Pakenham district is Victoria's worst crash zone. Yet, when it comes to making a contribution to this important project, the Commonwealth falls short of honouring its commitment to fund half of the cost of the Pakenham bypass. Instead of funding half, which is $121 million, the Commonwealth—through a bit of trickery; a bit of carry on with words—says that it only meant to commit to $100 million, which leaves the $242 million cost of the Pakenham bypass $21 million short. As people in Pakenham have said to me, `What is the good of holding up a $242 million project for the sake of the last 10 per cent? This is crazy talk.' 
The reason that this project is getting held up lies with the Commonwealth government. It is responsible for spiking this project, for making the people in the Pakenham district and the Gippsland region put up with the full force of the Princes Highway going right through the guts of Pakenham. It creates an absolutely outrageous road safety risk to the people in the Gippsland region and in the Pakenham district. So what we say in the Gippsland region and in Pakenham to the Howard government is simply this: honour your promise; honour the promise you made us, do what you said, stop your carry-on and get on with the project.
One of the other issues important to us in the Gippsland region is a smaller one that relates to the beautiful township of Korumburra. As a Victorian, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, I know that you would be very familiar with Korumburra. It is a historically im-portant town and has a population of around 5,000 people. They are very industrious people in Korumburra; they are hard-working people who do not make a big song and dance about things. They do not ask for more than what they are entitled to and all they are asking for from the Commonwealth gov-ernment is to have the Korumburra drill hall for community use. This drill hall is now surplus to Department of Defence's requirements.
You might say to me, Mr Deputy Speaker, that maybe this is a piece of infrastructure that could cost some millions of dollars, which would then have to be forgone by the Commonwealth government. But the Korumburra drill hall would probably be worth between $50,000 and $100,000 to the Commonwealth if it sold it. Now $50,000 or $100,000 is not much to a big Commonwealth government which receives billions of dollars in revenue every year, but to the people of Korumburra it is a lot of money and to the people who live in the south Gippsland shire that is more money than they should be expected to pay. What we are asking for in Korumburra is not unreasonable. We are just asking for that surplus defence department drill hall to be handed over for community use so that the people of Korumburra can use it as part of their recreational precinct.
I know that the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence is at the table and I know that she has an interest in community matters. I ask Minister Vale if she would be good enough to investigate whether or not there was any way that the drill hall could be handed over to the people of Korumburra through the South Gippsland Shire Council for community and recreational purposes. Minister, this is no more than what has happened in Adelaide where the Torrens parade ground—probably worth around $5 million—has been handed over to the community. This is no more than what has happened at Fremantle where the Fremantle army barracks—probably worth $10 million—has been handed over to the Fremantle community. I do not think this is too different, either, from what the Prime Minister did in his own electorate where he handed over some ex-Department of Defence land to the Sydney Harbour Foreshore Trust for community use. If it is good enough for Sydney, Adelaide and beautiful Fremantle, it should be good enough for the people of South Gippsland and in particular for the people of Korumburra.
When the federal government shut down Defence Force recruiting out of that drill hall, the people in Korumburra did not kick up a big stink. They did not engage in a lot of carry on or a lot of moaning and complaining about that. They just took it in their stride and sought to try and turn an unfortunate circumstance into an opportunity for their community. They have shown a fair bit of decency in the way that they have approached this and all I ask is that the federal government shows a bit of decency back to them. So Minister Vale if you could please have a look into that matter and get back to me, I would be happy to pass on your response to the South Gippsland shire and the people of Korumburra. It is not much we are asking for—I know it is only a small amount of money to the Commonwealth government—but it is an important issue to the people of Korumburra, and the Howard government should do the right thing by them. 
I know that you are a Victorian member, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, and that you represent a constituency not too dissimilar from mine in many respects. I know that your constituency from time to time has had to grapple with the issue of unemployment and, in particular, long-term unemployment. Certainly parts of my electorate have struggled with those same issues and, unfortunately, some parts of my electorate still are. There is an article—which I am sure you have read, Mr Deputy Speaker—in the Age today which deals with some of the issues to do with hot spots of unemployment in the Victorian community.
I think at least some of the areas in your electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker, are mentioned. I am pleased to report that, in general terms, they are mentioned fairly favourably. I am not sure exactly where the boundary of your electorate is—whether you have Eltham or whether it is in the member for Jagajaga's electorate—but certainly Eltham is mentioned favourably as having a very low unemployment rate of 1.7 per cent. To the people in Eltham we say congratulations on your low unemployment; well done. We congratulate you on being able to achieve that low rate of unemployment. It is certainly not a rate of unemployment that Eltham has always enjoyed.
From my viewpoint as the member for McMillan, more alarming is the fact that the townships of Morwell and Moe still have among the state's highest levels of unemployment. Morwell has an unemployment rate of around 12 per cent and Moe has an unemployment rate of 11.4 per cent. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, I am very proud to be a Latrobe Valley boy. I am very proud of my background in the Latrobe Valley and I am very proud to represent those people in this place. But the fact is that unemployment is too high in the Latrobe Valley region. I copped criticism, when I started off as the member for McMillan, for talking about unemployment in our district. People said to me, `Christian, you're talking the area down. You've got to not talk about these things, because it puts people off.' I took a different view: that you had to talk about the problems that you faced, and talk about them honestly, if something was to be done.
I think that a fair bit of that talking about the serious problems that we had in the Latrobe Valley led to the establishment—as you as a Victorian would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker—of the Latrobe Valley Ministerial Task Force. It was established by the Bracks Labor government and it led to a package of around $106 million to rejuvenate the Latrobe Valley and help reduce unemployment. Those measures are working; they are reducing unemployment in the Latrobe Valley region. To my good friend Steve Bracks and to other friends in the state government, on behalf of the people of the Latrobe Valley, thank you for believing in us, supporting us and contributing substantially to the recovery of our region. 
But more needs to be done, and it must not fall just to the state government to assist in this effort. By comparison to the $106 million package that was in the Latrobe Valley Ministerial Task Force's package for the Latrobe Valley district, the federal government put in a weak program called Sustainable Regions, which consisted of a miserly $12 million over three years—$4 million per year for three years. On the one hand there is the great big Commonwealth government, which put in $4 million per year for three years; on the other hand there is a state government, which put in $106 million. The difference could not be more stark. It really underscores the level of commitment that the state government has, compared to the commitment—or, rather, lack of commitment—the Commonwealth government has to the people of the Latrobe Valley.
The one undeniable thing about the Sustainable Regions program is that it is a one-size-fits-all program. There is pretty much the same amount of money for every region in which one of these programs has been established. There is not much money to start with, and the program does not allocate resources to those areas that are most in need in terms of employment. So, in the Gippsland region, for example, from that miserable $4 million per year over three years there was no emphasis on those areas with the greatest levels of unemployment, like Morwell and Moe.
That is why a substantial opportunity has gone begging here in terms of breaking the back of unemployment in those big towns. It would have been great if the federal government had said, `We're going to put the money for the Sustainable Regions program that was set for the Gippsland region into those areas of highest unemployment.' That would have meant that all of that money would have gone to the Latrobe Valley. Small though that amount of money was, I think that if you added $4 million per year to the money going to the Latrobe Valley, particularly Morwell and Moe, you might have seen a substantial reduction in the level of unemployment.
But the government did not do that; they allowed the Sustainable Regions program to be applied right across the Gippsland region, in that time-honoured National Party way of using it as a pork barrel. So it was a little bit here, a little bit there, wheel it out into some of these communities, $100,000 here, $20,000 there for a study, $150,000 somewhere else, and so it goes. The impact of that small program was almost worth nothing in the areas where it mattered most; namely, the towns of Morwell and Moe.
I say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the contribution of the Commonwealth government—that $4 million per year for three years—pales into insignificance when you consider what federal Labor's commitment was to the electorate of McMillan at the last federal election. We committed $30 million to the Latrobe Valley to create jobs and employment opportunities. We undertook to declare the Latrobe Valley an education priority zone, which would have meant an extra $4 million per year for three years. We also made a genuine commitment to the building of the Pakenham bypass, a project worth more than $100 million.
Federal Labor has always been committed to the people who live in the electorate of McMillan and state Labor has always been committed to the people who live in the electorate of McMillan. We only wish that the Howard government would not muck around with us; would not promise us things and then fail to deliver, as it has done in the Pakenham bypass instance; and would actually commit to helping our local community to break the back of unemployment in our district.

"Emerson, Craig, MP",ALP,2003-06-23,"—I would like to draw the attention of the House to the high farce that is Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 2003. I have here the full copy of the second reading speech. It runs one page and struggles to creep over the back to a second page. I will refer to the contents, such as they are, of this second reading speech in a moment. I point out that the second reading speech on this bill, which no doubt is important because the government is trying to get it through before the end of this sitting period, was delivered by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration. Where is old jellyback? Where is the Treasurer? I do not think the Treasurer would have any idea what is contained in the one-and-a-little-bit pages of this second reading speech, just as he would have no idea what is contained in the bill, which runs to 79 pages, and the explanatory memorandum, which runs to 91 pages. I wonder aloud how much time the Treasurer of this country has spent even contemplating the policy choices contained in this bill. I would say that the amount of time he has spent is precisely zero. 
That goes to the question of whether this bloke has got his heart in the job. He got bowled over by the Prime Minister's fairly recent statement that he will bat on past the age of 64—you know: `When I get old and losing my hair, many years from now.' Well, it is happening right now. Old jellyback could not stomach it but he could not do anything about it, and he just let it go through to the keeper, just as he has let this bill go through to the keeper—one-and-a-little-bit pages of a speech, 79 pages of a bill and 91 pages of an explanatory memorandum. This reminds me very much of a government in decline. You have got a Treasurer who has run out of speed, run out of petrol and run out of enthusiasm, who has now left it to his Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, Senator Helen Coonan, and to a parliamentary secretary to bring forward this legislation.
You have to ask in the end: who is behind the legislation? Who drafted the 79 pages of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 2003 and the 91 pages of the explanatory memorandum? You also have to ask: who on the government's side has any idea what is contained in this legislation? I think the answer to that question is that no-one does. Someone drafted a speech for the previous government speaker to rattle off a few statistics and say that this is all very good and what a marvellous job the government is doing. But the truth is that the government does not even know what is contained in this legislation; certainly, the Treasurer does not. The parliamentary secretary does not. He comes in here, treats the parliament with contempt and reads out a one-and-a-little-bit pages of a second reading speech. 
I will now refer to that speech, because the substantive provisions in this bill, such as they are, relate to the thin capitalisation provisions. The reason we have these provisions in the taxation law is that multinational companies otherwise—in effectively engaging in transfer pricing—could say in relation to their affiliates operating in Australia that, instead of providing equity, those companies could engage in the provision of debt. The taxation feature that distinguishes debt from equity is that interest payments are tax deductible whereas dividends are not. So it would be open to a multinational company effectively to engage in transfer pricing by contriving to have very high levels of debt in its relationship with its affiliate here in Australia. 
This is not a realisation that has occurred to the present coalition government but one that occurred many years ago to the previous Labor government. This bill includes amendments that implement changes to the thin capitalisation regime to ensure that multinational companies do not inappropriately allocate an excessive amount of debt to their Australian operations. Effectively, the bill is a bit of finetuning. It is finetuning that we welcome, because it was the previous Labor government that cracked down on this abuse through what was effectively transfer pricing through the vehicle of utilising thin capitalisation rules. To that extent, we support this legislation.  
I now move on to a second provision in this bill, which is in respect of fringe benefits tax applied to employees whose duties are performed in, or in connection with, a public hospital. They will qualify for a $17,000 capped fringe benefits tax exemption regardless of whether or not the hospital is a public benevolent institution. There would be no cause at all for this legislation if there were no fringe benefits tax. This legislation provides reasonable relief from fringe benefits tax. The fringe benefits tax was introduced by the previous Labor government on 19 September 1985, if my memory serves me correctly. The reason that the previous Labor government introduced the fringe benefits tax was that high-income taxpayers were converting their salaries into fringe benefits. For example, if your children went to a private school and you had a company which employed you—which was probably yourself, because high-income earners establish themselves as companies—you could then provide a tax deduction for sending your children off to a very wealthy, well-to-do school.
—Many of those schools are even more well-to-do as a result of the government's schools policy. If this government had had their way, there would be no fringe benefits tax and there would be, therefore, no need to amend the fringe benefits tax legislation. This government, then in opposition—the same characters returning to the scene of the crime—opposed Labor's fringe benefits tax lock, stock and barrel. That phrase is not mine; it is the phrase of the current Prime Minister of Australia. He said, `We will oppose the Labor government's tax reforms in relation to capital gains tax and fringe benefits tax, lock, stock and barrel'—and they did. This Prime Minister is fond of saying how enthusiastically he and his cohorts in opposition supported Labor's tax reforms and microeconomic reform agenda. I was around at the time, and they opposed option A—that is, the cleaning up of the income tax system—lock, stock and barrel.

"Wilkie, Kim, MP",ALP,2003-06-23,"—I would like the opportunity tonight to talk about totally and permanently incapacitated ex-service men and women—TPIs. Last week, I am sure that many in this place would have noticed that there was a large number of frustrated and angry veterans from previous wars and conflicts outside this parliament. They were disabled veterans from all over the country. They were here from early on 16 June until 4 p.m. on 19 June. I took the opportunity to meet the veterans, and I noticed that there was a very strong contingent of people from the west—some of whom I have had the pleasure of working with in my previous careers.  
The people from the west had travelled a long way, and we should remember that many of them are ill and are among those who are least able to afford the trip to Canberra. However, they felt compelled to support their colleagues, and many were here not for themselves but to ensure that younger veterans get a better deal. They made the point that they are angry that this government would be taking all the media opportunities later in the week when we as a nation were honouring our service men and women who were returning from their recent deployment to Iraq. 
This government has made great political mileage from the outstanding performance of our defence personnel in East Timor, during the Tampacrisis, in Afghanistan and in Iraq. The Prime Minister, the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs have grabbed every photo opportunity to be seen with the troops and to bask in the glow of their superb accomplishments. However, the government has sold them out. This government has ignored the plight of the TPI veterans in the 2003 budget.
—Didn't you want to welcome them home?
—I hear the drivel opposite. If I had been invited to attend a ceremony in Perth I would have been there; but I was not invited. TPIs were protesting because of government inaction on the following: the protection of the special rate of compensation payment by appropriate indexation, the special rate benchmarked to 75 per cent of average weekly earnings, the honouring of a 1996 election promise to remove an anomaly whereby the special rate of compensation is included as income when calculating income support for TPIs without qualifying service, and the fact that some 26,500 ex-service personnel receive TPI payment as compensation for disabilities which prevent them from undertaking paid employment for more than eight hours per week. Once granted, this payment is paid for life and is indexed against the CPI.
There is general acceptance that payments made to people as compensation for the effects a disabling injury has on their lives, whether from a road accident or from a workplace injury, are not income. Such payments are strictly compensation for pain and suffering and loss of lifestyle. At present, the Veterans' Entitlements Act exempts all disability pensions in its means test for the service pension, including all the special rate. For those without qualifying service, who therefore must go to Centrelink for income support—through the age pension, Newstart or the disability support pension—their entire disability pension is treated as income. This is completely unfair; but the government has refused, on a number of occasions in recent years, to amend the law to remove the discrimination—despite the efforts of the ALP and the Democrats, who have seen Senate amendments rejected by the government in this House.
I am particularly concerned that, for TPIs, the gold card is counted as income, even though this card is issued to many veterans who enjoy good health and gainful employment. If the value of a Medicare card is never counted as an income component for others in society, why then should the provision of a gold card be seen as income? The same applies for the pharmaceutical allowance. This allowance is paid to all pensioners and to many clients of Centrelink. To count it as income means that TPIs are not compensated for treatment of their war-caused ill health. They are paying from their own pockets for the treatment of their disabilities. The telephone allowance of $74.40 per year tax free is another benefit counted as income, but this once again is not a benefit peculiar to disabled veterans, as it is paid to many healthy Centrelink pensioners.  
I would like to remind people that the original intention of this country's repatriation legislation was to ensure that citizens who became disabled defending our nation would be provided with free medical treatment for those disabilities and would be compensated for their inability to earn an income equal to the average wage. TPIs should never have to rely on welfare.
Before I close, I would like to bring some figures to the attention of the House. The maximum disposable income a partnered TPI can receive from the Department of Veterans' Affairs is $1,126.09 a fortnight. The maximum income a single TPI can receive from the DVA is $1,198.86 a fortnight. Only 32 per cent of TPI recipients under the age of 65 are in receipt of the maximum welfare income supplement per fortnight. Therefore, 68 per cent of TPI recipients under the age of 65 receive either less than the maximum income supplement or no income supplement at all. Only 959 TPIs without qualifying service receive any income support. Only Labor will ensure that veterans get a fair go.
