"Jackson, Sharryn, MP",ALP,2002-10-14," asked the Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services, upon notice, on 15 May 2002:
(1)	How many families and individuals in the electoral division of Hasluck have received a (a) Family Tax Benefit debt notice and (b) Child Care Benefit debt notice.
(2)	How many child care centres in the electoral division of Hasluck have received a debt notice arising from the old Child Care Assistance Scheme.
(3)	What steps is the Government taking to guarantee that families will not be penalised by the current income self assessment regime where their incomes fluctuate through no fault of their own, because they carry out varying amounts of overtime in their employment, or their employment is commission based, or where one of the partners returns to the workforce after raising children.
(4)	Is the Minister aware that on pages 3 and 4 of the Estimating your Income booklet produced by the Family Assistance Office, the suggestions for estimating income for the year ahead include (a) knowing whether the recipient or his or her partner will receive termination or insurance payments or (b) predicting whether a partner will recommence work; if so, should individuals be expected to know whether they will lose their jobs, have to make an insurance claim or take up new employment in the forthcoming year.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Taxation: Family Payments</title>,Answers to Questions in Writing,4,1,question
"Anthony, Larry, MP",NP,2002-10-14,"—The Minister for Family and Community Services has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:
(1)	(a)	As at 24 May 2002, 4,688 customers in the electoral division of Hasluck have received notification that they incurred a Family Tax Benefit debt as a result of the income reconciliation process.
(b)	As at 24 May 2002, 931 customers in the electoral division of Hasluck have received notification that they incurred a Child Care Benefit debt as a result of the income reconciliation process. 
Note: only customers who incurred a debt over $1,000 would have a recoverable debt. 
(2)	The number of child care centres in the electoral division of Hasluck that have received a debt notice arising from the old Child Care Assistance Scheme is 23.
(3)	The Family Assistance Office actively helps families to avoid or minimise family assistance overpayments resulting from underestimates of income through a range of communications with customers explaining the income estimation process and encouraging customers to keep their estimates up-to-date. Families are encouraged to estimate at the top of the range of their possible income for the year and can change their estimate as often as they wish during the year. The reconciliation process ensures that families receive their correct entitlement based on their actual taxable income. 
Families also have the option of claiming their family assistance as a lump sum after the end of the financial year when their taxable income has been assessed and thereby avoid any chance of overpayment.
(4)	The Estimating your Income booklet is provided to assist customers in providing an accurate estimate of their income for the coming financial year. This minimises the possibility of families incurring an FTB debt.
Pages 3-4 of the booklet list “some questions you might have to think about when working out your estimated family income”. This list includes: commencing work, termination payments, child support and compensation or insurance payments. Customers can use this checklist when providing their initial income estimate and/or when updating their estimate. The provision of the checklist does not imply that families must be able to anticipate all changes to their income in advance. On the contrary, the booklet emphasises (on page 8) that if customers think the estimate they gave is wrong or might have changed, they should tell the Family Assistance Office as soon as possible, and that they can change their estimate as often as they need to.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Taxation: Family Payments</title>,Answers to Questions in Writing,4,1,answer
