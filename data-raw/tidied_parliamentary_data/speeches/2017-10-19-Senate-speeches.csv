Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (09:31):  Thank you, Mr President. I'm very proud to bring my Medicinal Cannabis Legislation Amendment (Securing Patient Access) Bill 2017 to the Senate. On behalf of those many thousands of Australians who are suffering as a result of this government's failure to secure timely access to a medication that we know relieves people of suffering. 


I'm introducing this bill in the name of Australian patients who are sick and tired of the obstacles that are put in front of them and of the regulatory nightmare that this government's medicinal cannabis framework has become. Doctors who desperately want to give treatments that relieve people of distressing symptoms are facing hurdle after hurdle after hurdle when they try to access medicinal cannabis. I have to say that it is remarkable that we have a government of this nation that would make life for terminally-ill patients so difficult, and I am proud that the Senate, based on the preliminary discussions we've had with members of the chamber, looks like it will support this move to secure timely access to medicinal cannabis. 


We worked very constructively during the early days of the government's legislation on medicinal cannabis. The history of this legislation is one that we Greens are very, very proud of. We established a cross-party working group—members of the government, members of the opposition, members of the crossbench—to work constructively to try and bring the stories of people who are suffering here to Canberra and put them in front of politicians so that they could understand just how important it was that individuals who are suffering needlessly and have potentially a remedy that could relieve them of symptoms like intractable nausea, pain, muscle spasms and so on. 


We worked very constructively through that cross-party working group, and the pressure came to bear on the government, who ultimately said, 'We will move. Please don't introduce your legislation, because we are prepared to act.' The Greens had legislation ready to go. In good faith, we accepted the government's word that they would introduce legislation that would make sure that individuals who were suffering got timely access to medicinal cannabis. I'll be very frank: it was a mistake. It was a mistake to trust this government. It was a mistake to hand over the legislative response to medicinal cannabis to a government who has shown itself to be more interested in giving the appearance of doing something when, in substance, it is making life so difficult for suffering people. Instead of having a pathway to access, what we do have is this disaster of regulation and red tape, which I can only assume is because they have some ideological objection to providing life-saving medicines to people simply because there's stigma associated with cannabis.


When it comes to the patients who we know will benefit from this bill, let's remember who they are. We are only talking about patients who are suffering and who, by definition, have a terminal illness. What the government are doing by opposing this legislation is saying, 'We want to make your life more difficult in your final months when you're suffering from terminal cancer which might produce symptoms like intractable nausea.' That is, you're having chemotherapy and you can't keep your food down because of the nausea that's not responding to the traditional agents that we give you. If you have a response to medicinal cannabis that allows you to tolerate food, that helps you maintain your condition and that can give you, in your final months of life, a higher quality of life, the government are saying, 'We don't want that. We're going to stop that.'


The Australian Greens are standing up for those patients. We're standing up for those patients because we don't believe any government should get in the way of access to medicines that make their final few months a little easier with a little less suffering. This bill makes two small changes—they're only small—to give dying patients rapid access to medicinal cannabis when a doctor has prescribed it. Let's be clear about this: this is only after medicinal cannabis has been prescribed by a doctor.


The first amendment is to ensure that the government follows what the Senate has already ordered this government to do, and that is to allow the importation of medicinal cannabis for terminally ill patients through what's known as category A of the Special Access Scheme. Only a few short weeks ago in this chamber we saw a Greens motion supported by the Labor Party and members of the crossbench—I see Senator Hinch is behind me; he's also been a strong advocate for medicinal cannabis. We saw members of the crossbench and the Labor Party introduce a motion that should have made access to medicinal cannabis through category A of the Special Access Scheme much easier and, instead, the government refused to accept the will of the Senate. The government has ignored the Senate, has threatened importers and has gone so far as to say that they would have their permits revoked if they followed the law. This bill ensures that the government can no longer block that importation of medicinal cannabis for category A—that is, those people who have a terminal illness.


The second amendment to this legislation just levels the playing field so that, when they become available, Australian medicinal cannabis products, not just those from overseas, can be provided through category A. The problem we have at the moment is we don't have a mature medicinal cannabis industry in this country, and that is why we needed, through our previous motion, to allow the importation of medicinal cannabis for people with a terminal illness. But we think that the moment Australian product comes online that should also be made available through the Special Access Scheme. We want a vibrant, mature, effective medicinal cannabis scheme in Australia. We know it's good for patients, but it's also good for Australian farmers. We want to make sure that that industry thrives, and we want to make sure that they have the best incentives to supply medicinal cannabis to terminal patients who need it most.


I know that this bill won't fix everything. One of the problems we have is that we have different layers of regulation. Once people get through the first hurdle—that is, federal red tape—there are also the layers of regulation at a state level which need to be addressed. We can't do much about that right now, except continue to put pressure to bear on those states who are also dragging their heels. What we can do is make sure that that first barrier—that is, the restrictions that are put in place by the federal government—is addressed.


I have spoken with many patients and their families; I know how much this change means to them. We all know the story of Lucy Haslam's son, Dan, who was a young man with terminal bowel cancer. This is a man in his 20s who developed bowel cancer, was having chemotherapy and wasn't getting any relief from his nausea from those traditional agents that we use to treat chemotherapy induced nausea. He got instant relief from medicinal cannabis after it was suggested to his family by a friend, and as a result he was able to tolerate food and his quality of life improved immeasurably. I have spoken to patients who have had brain tumours and, again, have found that the relief that medicinal cannabis provides them is significant. While it might not save their lives, it improves their quality of life in those final few months. We Greens stand here today with those many thousands of Australians who are suffering, or indeed are caring for someone who is suffering, and who know that as a result of the lack of access to these treatments they are being denied treatment that could make such a difference to their quality of life. We are going to keep fighting until patients can safely and quickly access these medicines.


I'm so proud to bring this bill to the Senate. I'm absolutely delighted that we're achieving a rare victory here today, and that is that the majority of the Senate looks like it will stand with us in opposition to this government's cruel intransigence. We will also pursue this in the lower house. I know there are members of the LNP who say they support medicinal cannabis, who want medicinal cannabis to be made available from doctors through a regulated framework and who want to make sure that patients who live in their own constituencies get access to these medicines. I know they're out there because I've spoken to them. I say this to them right now: this legislation looks like it will pass the Senate. Have the guts and the decency to stand up when this legislation makes it through to the lower house. Cross the floor if you have to. We only need one or two of you to stand up and have a bit of courage to say you stand with patients and their needs, not your own political self-interest, and we can get this through both houses of parliament. In the meantime, I'll be pursuing a meeting with Minister Hunt. I'll be doing what I can to ensure that he understands just how critical it is that this bill gets through the Senate.


When we are elected to this place, we make a commitment to those people who elect us that we will act in their interests—that we will come to this place and represent them. We have an opportunity to help people who are now suffering, whose lives will be cut short because of the tragedy of a terminal illness. We have an obligation to them to make sure we do everything we can to make their final days on this earth as tolerable as possible and to relieve them of the pain and suffering that they're experiencing. I can think of no greater obligation given to us in this place, and today's an opportunity for members to stand up and indicate that they stand with those patients.

"Brockman, Sen Slade",LP,2017-10-19,"



Senator BROCKMAN
 (Western Australia) (09:44):  With indulgence, I want to thank all the members of the Senate for their warm words of support and encouragement following my first speech a couple of days ago.


The government will not be supporting this bill. The issue of medical cannabis is a recurring one that the government has resolved in a way that provides access to those Australians who need it, makes the use of medical marijuana a medical decision and keeps adequate safeguards in place to ensure access is not misused. It has been made clear that medical cannabis is potentially valuable in some cases, particularly in a palliative care setting, but the media surrounding this bill has, unfortunately, been extremely misleading. Central to this false campaign is the allegation that the Office of Drug Control is breaching legislation by not permitting the import of medical cannabis products for use in Special Access Scheme category A. There is no truth to this. It is based on a misinterpretation of a letter sent to existing importers under the bulk import policy reinforcing the standards of their import permissions and how they are conditioned for supply under the Special Access Scheme category B and Authorised Prescriber Scheme. This letter was a necessary measure to ensure the regulations were being followed, due to the fact that at least one importer interpreted the disallowance motion as meaning that they could supply under the Special Access Scheme category A, which was not allowed. Doing so would breach the conditions of their licence and potentially be subject to regulatory action under the Customs Act 1901. The letter contained no language that stated or implied in any way that they could not import product for the purpose of supplying under category A. The Office of Drug Control has always been very clear about this and has always given Special Access Scheme category A swift application processing times—I understand it's a one-day priority processing time.


There have been five notifications to the TGA since the disallowance motion, but the Office of Drug Control has only received and processed one import permission application for category A. In accordance with the regulation, namely regulation 5 of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956, the office must thoroughly and necessarily make an assessment of each Special Access Scheme category A importation.


I feel it's important to note at this point that this scheme was established by the government in October 2016, with bipartisan support, in order to ensure access to medicinal cannabis for terminally ill patients. This issue has been looked at extensively by the parliament—and often with a bipartisan approach. The Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee report in 2015 was one such example. This report covered extensively the safety and efficacy of medicinal marijuana and the regulatory framework around its use. One thing that was very clear from this report was that, at best, medical benefits of marijuana are equivocal, untested and in need of further research. The report said:


For example, Professor Wayne Hall, Director of the Centre for Youth Substance Abuse Research at the University of Queensland, expressed the view that the current research indicated medicinal cannabis is 'at best, modestly effective for some purposes (for example vomiting and nausea) and probably for others (for example chronic pain, depression, muscle spasm)'. Professor Hall stated:


'An informed policy towards the medical use of cannabinoids requires much better evidence than we currently have...we need clinical trials of the safety and efficacy of CBD and other cannabinoids in treating intractable epilepsy and chronic pain. Evidence from these trials is essential for rational decisions to be made about the medical use of cannabinoids.'


The Royal Australasian College of Physicians considered that 'while medicinal marijuana shows some potential for certain patients, further research is required to determine its efficacy and it should be subject to the same scrutiny as any other medicine'.


Painaustralia expressed the view that, for individuals with chronic non-cancer pain, there is little proven evidence for the effectiveness of cannabinoids in helping patients, and that it did not endorse the use of cannabinoids for this group of patients 'until such time as a clear therapeutic role for [cannabinoids] is identified in the scientific literature'.


On a point of clarification, medicinal cannabis can be administered in a variety of ways that do not include smoking, which very obviously carries heavy known risks. These include oral administration by a pill, oromucosal spray, tinctures, ointments, the ingestion of oil derived from cannabis plants and vaporisation of a herbal product. As a side note, the Turnbull government also does not support changing the current legal status of vaping for a number of reasons, but, first and foremost, that there is limited scientific and medical understanding of the effects. Evidence, when making these kinds of regulatory decisions, is vital.


The science and evidence behind medical cannabis is complex and incomplete. The Australian government is taking advice on the matter from the Therapeutic Goods Administration and medical professionals, including the Australian and New Zealand Society of Palliative Medicine and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. These professionals agree with the current arrangements and do not support the changes as set out. It is potentially dangerous to patient safety to allow access to medicinal cannabis products through the Special Access Scheme category A, due to the fact that unlike other unregistered medicines under this scheme, with the single exception of Sativex, which is a formulated extract of the Cannabis sativa plant, no medicinal cannabis products have been subject to a full safety, quality and efficacy assessment by a competent medicines regulator anywhere in the world.


If government allowed medical products onto the market that have not been properly tested, we would be rightly criticised and all those opposite would be the first ones to stand up and criticise us. There is no easily accessible evidence of safety available that can be used to guide prescribing decisions that work in conjunction with the various medico-legal obligations that doctors have to their patients. Despite all this, I want to make it quite clear that terminally ill patients already have access to medicinal cannabis products and are gaining access to them. In consultation with their clinicians, patients are able to gain timely approvals from the Therapeutic Goods Administration to prescribe the medicine under Special Access Scheme category B, and that can happen in as little as one day. Any rhetoric about excessive delays or wait periods is false. The delays are occurring where the prescribing doctor has insufficient knowledge of the product, along with the risks and benefits associated with the medicine, and, therefore, cannot justify their decision in prescribing it, or cannot describe the product which they wish to prescribe.


For any condition, it is never in the best interests of the patient to have an ill-informed medical practitioner prescribing their care. However, this is a delicate matter and an area where having an informed doctor at the heart of these decisions is crucial. The government's policy on medicinal cannabis is central to a medical decision. It puts the medical professional at the centre of the decision to prescribe. In this way, the government adheres to the advice of the medical profession. If the medical professional does not support the use of a particular pathway, then the government will listen to that advice. Naturally, there are those who are strong supporters of medicinal cannabis being extremely accessible and seek to increase the availability of the drug. However, this is not necessarily a choice that the medical profession endorses. For example, on 13 June this year, AMA president Michael Gannon said:


… doctors are reluctant to prescribe medicinal cannabis. This is no different to any other new drug, new technology, new operation; we want to be assured of the safety, assured of the effectiveness. 


Again, if governments weren't able to be very sure of the safety and effectiveness, and if doctors are not sure of the safety and effectiveness, then I think criticising the current regulatory regime is a mistake. 


The Australian government has a responsibility to the Australian people to ensure the changes we make in this space are not done recklessly or without adequate forethought and research. Michael Gannon later said in the same interview:


… let's not forget, we're talking about cannabis, we're talking about a substance that, used in the form it's used by most people, is a major source of mental illness in our community. It's absolutely essential that we're assured that whatever's being brought into the country, whatever's being brought in for prescription is safe …


Beyond our own legislation, Australia is subject to a number of different international obligations that exist under various treaties, including the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1961, which specifies the obligations of signatory states for narcotic drugs listed in various schedules to the UN convention. The Department of Health in its submission to an earlier inquiry into this issue noted that the Commonwealth is responsible for the implementation of Australia's treaty obligations, stating: 


The Commonwealth is responsible for the implementation of international agreements that it enters into and generally has the power to make legislation to implement Australia's treaty obligations. Accordingly, the Commonwealth is responsible for ensuring that any Commonwealth, State or Territory medicinal cannabis scheme is consistent with Australia's treaty obligations under the three drug control conventions …


Further to this, obviously, we do have an additional layer of complexity in our federation, which is that states and territories have their own initiatives in this space.


While the government will use many different sources to make decisions about the use of medicinal cannabis, we listen to the medical profession, and I think we need to continue to do that into the future. There is a demand for medicinal cannabis, and the path we currently have in place allows a safe, legal and effective way for terminally ill patients to gain access to medicinal cannabis. As of 17 October, there have been 287 individual patients who've been given access to medicinal cannabis either via the Special Access Scheme or an authorised prescriber. Additionally, there have been 21 licences granted for domestic cultivation: nine for medicinal cannabis cultivation, six for further research and six for manufacturing. So, we can see that the scheme is working. It is allowing patients who feel that they need this drug, with the support of their medical practitioner, to gain access. On that basis, the government will not support this bill and will not be looking at making changes to this regulatory environment.

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2017-10-19,"



Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (09:56):  In June, the Senate voted to improve access to medicinal cannabis for dying Australians. In particular, Labor and most of the crossbench voted to disallow the government's restrictions on access to medicinal cannabis under category A of the Special Access Scheme. I want to emphasise two things about category A from the outset of this debate. Firstly, this is a pathway for accessing therapeutic goods for people who are terminally ill. According to the Therapeutic Goods Administration—the TGA—category A is strictly limited to:


… patients who are seriously ill with a condition from which death is reasonably likely to occur within a matter of months, or from which premature death is reasonably likely to occur in the absence of early treatment.


We should be very clear in this debate that we are talking about dying Australians. Secondly, under category A of the Special Access Scheme, medicinal cannabis can only be accessed with a prescription from a doctor. We're not talking about illegal recreational use or inappropriate medicinal use; we're talking about dying patients who have a legitimate clinical need for medicinal cannabis as prescribed by their doctor.


In the debate in June, Labor did acknowledge the complexities of this issue. We acknowledged that some groups have raised concerns about the possible abuse of category A. We also acknowledged the need to strike a balance between access for dying patients and protection of the broader community. But, on balance, Labor was proud to stand up for the rights of terminally ill Australians who have been prescribed medicinal cannabis by their doctors. The Senate overwhelmingly agreed with Labor, voting 40 to 30 to disallow the government's restrictions. There ain't many votes in this place that unite Labor, the Greens, One Nation, Senator Lambie, Senator Hinch, Senator Gichuhi and Senator Leyonhjelm, but this one did exactly that. Among the crossbench, only the Nick Xenophon Team and Senator Bernardi supported the government. I would urge them to explain that vote and to reconsider their position today.


The Senate vote in June should have resolved this issue. Terminally ill patients should have had easier access to a prescribed therapy that can ease their suffering. But what we've seen from this government in the months since June is an attempt to block the parliament's will and to continue denying relief to dying Australians. Straight after the vote, we saw the health minister equate dying Australians and their families with drug smugglers. In the sort of temper tantrum that we saw from the Prime Minister on election night, the health minister said the disallowance was—and I quote from Fairfax—'Reckless and irresponsible,' saying it would put lives at risk and, potentially, make it easier for criminals to get drugs. It was a disgraceful slur for which the health minister still hasn't apologised. Mr Turnbull should be ashamed of the way his government has tried to scaremonger on this issue, stigmatising the dying people who are trying to access medicinal cannabis. Even worse, the government has put in place a new barrier to prevent people from accessing medicinal cannabis. In June, soon after the disallowance vote, the government wrote to medicinal cannabis importers, instructing them not to supply products to anyone holding a prescription under category A of the Special Access Scheme. This was despite the fact that the Senate had just voted to reopen that pathway. It says everything about Mr Turnbull. Instead of helping Australians with terminal illnesses and their families, his priority is to find a way to get around the Senate's decision to give dying Australians access to the pain relief they need.


That brings me to the bill before us today: the Medicinal Cannabis Legislation Amendment (Securing Patient Access) Bill 2017. Labor will support this bill which simply enshrines the intent of our disallowance vote in legislation. The bill would make two legislative changes to improve access to medicinal cannabis for terminally ill patients under category A of the Special Access Scheme. First, the bill would ensure that terminally ill patients can access imported medicinal cannabis products under category A. Again, this was the intent of the disallowance motion in June, but, because the government hasn't respected the parliament's will, this bill would amend the Customs Act 1901 to clarify that a licence, permission, consent or approval to import medicinal cannabis applies to category A as well as other pathways. Second, the bill seeks to ensure that terminally ill patients can access domestic medicinal cannabis products under category A when they become available. It would amend the Narcotics Drugs Act 1967 to add category A as one of the purposes for which the secretary of Health can grant a licence to manufacture medicinal cannabis in Australia.


I also want to use today's debate to make some broader comments on medicinal cannabis in Australia. Labor understand that medicinal cannabis can ease suffering for Australians who are dying. We also accept that there is evidence to support the use of medicinal cannabis for a number of other conditions, such as chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, and multiple sclerosis spasticity symptoms. That's why Labor led the way and introduced legislation for a national medicinal cannabis scheme in 2015 and supported the government's legislation when it was finally introduced in 2016. Over time, medicinal cannabis should be treated in the same way as other medicines. Products will be assessed for safety by the TGA and, where they pass that test, they will be prescribed by doctors, dispensed by pharmacists and possibly one day subsidised by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. A system of licences has also been established to govern research, cultivation, production and manufacture of medicinal cannabis products in Australia. But the government remains sceptical of medicinal cannabis and they have been too slow to implement the national scheme. Labor is particularly concerned that the government has done little to ensure a consistent supply of regulated and affordable product. The government has also failed to drive consistency across states on the legal treatment of people currently accessing medicinal cannabis. Bill Shorten has written to Mr Turnbull three times urging action and offering support, but patients have seen no change. That's one reason why Labor is supporting the bill that is before us, because the government has failed time and time again to improve other pathways.


I'd like to give some context to why this is an important issue by sharing one family's experience. Lucy Haslam is a Tamworth advocate and a mother who has campaigned for the legislation of medicinal cannabis after her son Dan was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Dan passed away in 2015. Lucy has continued to push for better access to medicinal cannabis for patients. In February, on the first anniversary of the passage of the federal medicinal cannabis legislation, Ms Haslam wrote that little had changed. Because of the time, I can't read the entire letter, but I would like to share some excerpts from it. She wrote:


On the first anniversary of Australian medicinal Cannabis legislation which was supposed to be the ""missing link"" for Australian patients (according to the previous Health Minister Sussan Ley), I want to shout from the rooftops that nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, although it pains me to say it, it is coming very close to being an outright lie.


Off the back of strong public support for patients like my son Dan who sought relief from serious disease and symptoms with medicinal Cannabis, the Government rode the wave of popular opinion, made all the right sympathetic noises, and passed legislation to allow for the cultivation, manufacture, and research into Cannabis for therapeutic purposes.


That sounds wonderful and I used to feel very proud that Dan's courage to speak out had some impact for the welfare of other patients. I thought it a beautiful tribute that the Legislation was passed on the first anniversary of his death.


However, Ms Haslam said that this pride of passage of the legislation has been replaced by anger that little has changed in reality. She wrote:


People often say to me you must be very pleased with how things have progressed ... so let me honestly answer that right now:


Patients are still criminals. This includes the terminally ill and children with intractable epilepsy.


Patients are still reliant on the black market and will be for a long while yet. They are still taking medicine procured from illicit sources which is like playing the lottery ... the medicine could be contaminated, each batch is likely to contain different cannabinoids, there is no certainty that there will be continuity of supply, there is no appropriate supervision by health professionals, there is no practical and viable alternative.


The black market is thriving; in fact, compassionate suppliers cannot meet demand. This is compounded by police raids which seize the medicine destined for patients who are reliant upon it. What happens when a child whose epilepsy is controlled by illicit Cannabis cannot access their next supply because police have confiscated it? Who will take responsibility for that?


The score card for the Government is looking very sad. In fact, I would say that on all aspects I give them a fail.


Now I can immediately hear the gatekeepers and authors of the regulations jumping up and down and saying ""but there is a pathway for patients to lawfully access medicinal Cannabis."" I agree in theory, but the problem is in putting it into practice.


The Special Access Scheme (SAS) provides that pathway. Let me explain very briefly as the process is so convoluted that word limits make full explanation an impossible task in this context.


To begin the process the very sick patient needs to find a doctor who is happy to prescribe Cannabis and who has the time to firstly undertake the arduous time consuming process to become an ""Authorised Prescriber"". This involves applications to State and Federal agencies. Once approved the doctor must then demonstrate to a committee the evidence for the patient's illness. (A little difficult after decades of blanket prohibition making research illegal).


The very sick patient then needs to find the product overseas (bearing in mind these products are not allowed to be advertised). Once found, the patient must negotiate a price and apply to the TGA to have it approved and they must also apply for Federal and State permits to have it imported. The patient bears the full cost plus the doctor's costs.


If they are successful in getting ""Special Access"" the approval only lasts three months and they are only allowed three months' supply. Think on this for a while ... A sick person must apply repeatedly placing an enormous burden on someone who is already battling illness and possibly even dying. This was the reality for a young Queensland patient with a brain tumour who took nineteen months to navigate the SAS. He is now several months into his second application and supplies are exhausted.


So, on the topic of patient access I would definitely give the Federal Government a huge fail!


This is a firsthand account of why things need to change, bringing us back to the bill here today.


If the Senate supports this bill, it will be a step in the right direction. But I want to assure the patients and families who are listening that Labor knows that much more needs to be done to ensure safe and timely access to medicinal cannabis across Australia, where it is clinically appropriate. Unlike the government, Labor is committed to working with patients and clinicians to make that a reality.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2017-10-19,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (10:10):  I rise to support the Medicinal Cannabis Legislation Amendment (Securing Patient Access) Bill 2017, and I thank Senator Di Natale for introducing it. The bill will allow medicinal cannabis to be imported for terminally ill patients through category A of the Special Access Scheme. It can already be imported for other purposes, such as for general patients, under category B of the scheme. This would remove all doubt that importers of medicinal cannabis can import medicinal cannabis for the terminally ill under category A and not just for category B patients. The bill also allows the government to authorise the manufacture of medicinal cannabis in Australia for terminally ill category A patients. This makes it clear that there's nothing in the law stopping the terminally ill from accessing domestically manufactured medicinal cannabis under the existing category A arrangements, so there would be no reason for the government to force terminally ill patients onto the slow road to pain relief that general patients are suffering along—the category B route.


The government loves generic arrangements like the category B arrangement. Its plan is for all patients to get access to medicinal cannabis in this way in a timely and low-stress manner. But the terminally ill patients of Australia don't live in the plans of the government; they live in reality—a reality in which the government's generic arrangements for access to medicinal cannabis are murderously slow. I've said it before and I'll say it again: the government and its health department officials have blood on their hands. Through their lack of urgency, through their comfort in slow bureaucratic processes that might eventually lead to access, once the working groups have met and written their reports, and through their unwillingness to change course once it became clear that these processes weren't working, they are responsible for terrible, unnecessary suffering and very likely a number of premature deaths.


The Liberal Democrats saw this coming. We supported the government's legislation, establishing a process to legalise medicinal marijuana. But we warned that the maintenance of a ban on recreational cannabis would ensure that the regime for medicinal cannabis would be a red-tape minefield for patients, and so it has come to pass. Recreational cannabis is not something I recommend, but it should be a matter of choice for adults. It's already a choice in a number of countries, including eight states in America. In any case, recreational cannabis use is less harmful than both alcohol and tobacco, according to bodies such as the UK's Independent Scientific Committee on Drugs. The Liberal Democrats are the only party in this parliament that supports legalising the supply, distribution, possession and use of cannabis, whether for medicinal or recreational purposes. This approach would not only let people pursue their own lifestyle choices and allow a better use of scarce police resources but also, by cutting the red tape surrounding the supply of medicinal cannabis, be the surest way to relieving suffering in Australia.


It is an unfortunate characteristic of Australia that we ignore the experience of the rest of the world and continue to rely on policies of prohibition. Cannabis, e-cigarettes and online gambling are three current examples, and yet prohibition will be no more successful than it ever has been. It's time we got our heads out of the sand. I commend this bill as a means to relieving suffering, but I commend even more the Liberal Democrats' policy of legalising cannabis regardless of its use.

"Smith, Sen Dean",LP,2017-10-19,"



Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (10:14):  For me, nothing demonstrates the capacity for community opinion to change and evolve more than the issue of medicinal cannabis and its use in our community. I hear very regularly people's personal accounts of loved ones, people in their friendship circles, who are benefiting from access to medicinal cannabis. I readily admit that, on this particular issue, I come with little personal experience. So I'm inclined to trust the position of those in our community who are trusted to make difficult decisions around access to drugs—the Therapeutic Goods Administration and, indeed, the government and the Honourable Greg Hunt, who, as the current Minister for Health, has responsibility for health matters.


But that's not to say that my opinions won't evolve or change over time. As a member of the Senate Community Affairs Committee, I regularly sit in the Senate estimates process—probably on 15 occasions now since I've been a senator—and I've regularly heard Senator Di Natale's questioning of health officials from the Department of Health and the Therapeutic Goods Administration around the access arrangements. I don't doubt his great passion and sincerity in the issue; Senator Di Natale was, of course, a general practitioner before coming to the Senate.


That said, it is wise to adopt a precautionary principle when it comes to giving people access to medicinal cannabis. And it is important to clear up some of the facts, to correct the public record, in regard to some of the media commentary that occurred around the 'securing patient access category A' issue in this parliament back in June. In June, we did talk about the disallowance motion which effectively has given passage to the bill we are talking about now. Key among these points for me is the allegation that has been made that the Office of Drug Control is breaching legislation in not permitting the import of medicinal cannabis products for use in Special Access Scheme category A.


Those who have paid attention to this particular allegation would know that the allegation rests on a misinterpretation of a letter that was sent to existing importers, under the bulk import policy, reminding them that their existing import permissions are conditional for supply under Special Access Scheme category B and authorised prescriber schemes. This letter was necessary as at least one importer interpreted the disallowance motion that was agreed to in June as meaning that they could supply under the securing patient access arrangements category A. So what we had was a situation where an importer misinterpreted what the disallowance motion meant, which made it necessary to write to every importer to make it very clear what the arrangements were. This particular importer would have breached the conditions of their permission and potentially been subjected to regulatory action under the Customs Act of 1901.


This letter did not say they could not import for the purposes of supplying under SAS category A. The Office of Drug Control has always given SAS category A import applications a one-day priority processing time and continues to do so for medicinal cannabis products that are characterised under the SAS category A. Since the disallowance motion, though there have been five notifications to the TGA, the office has only received and processed one import permission application for SAS category A. To discharge its regulatory obligations set out in regulation 5 of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956, the office must necessarily make an assessment of each SAS category A importation. In addition, the scheme established by the government, with bipartisan support, in October 2016 ensured access to medicinal cannabis for terminally ill patients.


I think it is important on matters such as this to lean heavily on the advice of those in our community who are trusted with looking after our health. On this issue I would argue that the view of the established medical community in our country—indeed, they are same people that the Greens and Labor would go to, and then they would come back to in this place with numerous quotes about why the AMA's views on particular issues should be heeded to. For consistency sake, if you are going to stand behind the views of the AMA on some issues then it's important perhaps to stand behind the AMA on issues of great sensitivity like issues of medicinal cannabis.


On that point, I think it is worth noting that in June 2017, with the disallowance motion having been debated, AMA President Dr Michael Gannon said—these are his quotes now; and I think this is particularly important given some of the discussions that have happened in recent days in this building around the mental health and wellbeing of people:


And let's not forget, we're talking about cannabis, we're talking about a substance that, used in the form it's used by most people, is a major source of mental illness in our community. It's absolutely essential that we're assured that whatever's being brought into the country, whatever's being brought in for prescription is safe…


Those are not my words and not the words of well-meaning senators. They are the words of the Dr Michael Gannon, the president of the Australian Medical Association. In that same Sky News interview in June of this year, he went on to say:


…we're satisfied with the process being put in chain by Minister Hunt and the Government using the Therapeutic Goods Administration, using appropriate care and diligence that is used for all other therapeutic products.


… … …


The Australian community would be outraged if prescription medication was rushed in, if someone said that it was okay to use. The Australian people would be outraged if new operations got brought in or, for that matter, new foodstuffs were brought in without appropriate care and safety.


Dr Gannon is saying that if you have a regulatory regime that keeps the community safe, that does allow for products to be brought to market and that does allow for products to be given to people to support their care, then it's important that there be some consistency around that regime in order to not only relieve people of pain and suffering but also protect them and others from unsafe products


I argue that a consistent national regime is important. I accept the point that Senator Leyonhjelm was making—that it's important that the regime be as responsive as it possibly can. But I would argue that, on this particular issue, the regime is a good one, is responsive and is meeting community expectations. What gives me confidence in arguing the government's position is that it is built on the clear medical evidence informed by the attitudes of those people who are trusted in the medical profession to provide advice to government. The government continues of course to take advice from the TGA and the medical profession, including the Australian and New Zealand Society of Palliative Medicine, which I think is a particularly important organisation when considering the safe and proper medicinal use of cannabis. It is taking the advice of the Australasian College of Physicians and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. The advice is that it is potentially dangerous to patient safety to allow access to medicinal cannabis products through the Special Access Scheme category A. Unlike other registered medicines, they are prescribed through this scheme with one medical exception: no medicinal cannabis product has been subjected to a full safety, quality and efficacy assessment by a competent medicines regulator anywhere in the world. There is not easily accessible evidence of safety available to guide prescribing conditions in accordance with doctors' medico-legal obligations to their patients.


I think this is the most important point in the brief time that is available to me: terminally ill patients already have access. This does not mean that terminally ill patients cannot have access to medicinal cannabis products. Where doctors have educated themselves and demonstrated a clear understanding of the risk or benefit profile, they gain timely approval from the Therapeutic Goods Administration to prescribe the medicine under the SAS B category. This happens in as little as one day. Let me paraphrase: the current regime protects safety, protects patient safety, puts requirements on medical practitioners, and that regulatory process is achieved within one day. The argument that ill people are suffering delays in regards to the use of medicinal cannabis in their care is not true. That statement provided to me by the Minister for Health demonstrates that point very clearly.


Let me end where I started. I'm lucky enough that in my family and in my circle of friends they are not suffering illness where they require medicinal cannabis. Would my attitude be different if I had a personal experience much closer to these sorts of issues? It may well be, but on this issue and at this particular point in time I think the Australian community should trust the advice of the government, which is informed by specialist medical practitioners and the Therapeutic Goods Administration to ensure that Australians don't just get the best possible care but are protected from unsafe and unproven medical products.

"Kakoschke-Moore, Sen Skye",NXT,2017-10-19,"



Senator KAKOSCHKE-MOORE
 (South Australia) (10:26):  I rise to indicate the Nick Xenophon Team's support for this bill. At the outset, I wish to note that NXT has always enjoyed a very constructive working relationship with the Minister for Health, and we expect that this will continue.


However, respectfully, I think in this instance the government ought to be doing more than it is. When the disallowance motion to which this bill relates was dealt with in June of this year, the minister provided NXT with a list of actions the government was prepared to take to ensure faster and more streamlined access to medicinal cannabis for terminally ill patients in particular. NXT acknowledges the government has made some progress in relation to the actions and undertakings, but there is still a long way to go. The longer we wait for the government to act, the longer we prolong the suffering of terminally ill patients.


This bill sends a very strong message to the government that we cannot continue to allow terminally ill patients to suffer unnecessarily. The Special Access Scheme category A is used for terminally ill patients for whom other treatments have failed. This bill does not broaden the scope of patients who would have access to medicinal cannabis under category A; nor does it weaken that regulatory framework. But it does seek to ensure that Australian medicinal cannabis and imported medicinal cannabis is available to those who need it most.

"Urquhart, Sen Anne",ALP,2017-10-19,"



Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania—Opposition Whip in the Senate) (10:27):  I rise to speak on the Medicinal Cannabis Legislation Amendment (Securing Patient Access) Bill 2017 and to indicate our support for the bill. It is a bill that seeks to simply reflect the will of this Senate from June this year, when the Senate disallowed the government's amendment to the Therapeutic Goods Regulations 1990 so that medicinal cannabis could be imported for use for patients under the Department of Health's Special Access Scheme category A, as well as category B. Three days after the disallowance motion was passed the government sent a sharply worded letter to importers, threatening them that, despite the Senate's disallowance motion, it would be a breach of permit and licence conditions if they were to supply any imported medicinal cannabis product to a patient under Special Access Scheme category A. I feel that was a bit of a heavy-handed approach by the government. It was an approach that failed to recognise the will of this Senate, but that can now be corrected through the passage of this bill.


The bill makes two legislative changes to improve access to medicinal cannabis for terminally ill patients under category A of the Special Access Scheme. Category A allows terminally ill patients access to unregistered therapeutic goods with a doctor's prescription, but without preapproval by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. It is, therefore, quicker than other pathways. Because of the threat made by the government to import permits, it amends the Customs Act 1901 to clarify that 'a licence, permission, consent or approval' to import medicinal cannabis applies to category A, as well as other pathways.


The second change is to ensure that terminally ill patients can access domestic medicinal cannabis products under category A when they become available. It amends the Narcotic Drugs Act 1967 to add category A as one of the purposes for which the secretary of Health can grant a licence to manufacture medicinal cannabis in Australia. These amendments are for category A of the Special Access Scheme. Category A applies, as previous speakers have indicated, only to terminally ill patients.


As I've said for many years, when debating medicinal cannabis, this is a matter of compassion. That's what it's about; it's about compassion. It's about politicians, doctors and bureaucrats demonstrating some compassion towards a group of people who suffer from an incurable condition, with no idea what tomorrow will bring, or even if there will be a tomorrow. This is about a group of people who experience unimaginable pain on a daily basis, a group of people who have found that traditional medicines do not assist in suppressing their conditions. Whether it's a case of seizures in a young girl, like that of April, who I know, or a case of a mother's lung function, like that of Natalie, who I also know, this is about a minister hearing their pleas, listening to the community and doing the right thing.


If the vote goes the same way as the disallowance in June then this bill will pass the Senate. But it is then up to Minister Hunt to bring the matter to the House of Representatives, recognise that he made a mistake and that the amendment was too heavy handed, and accept the will of the Senate. The minister could even achieve half a what this bill seeks to achieve without even taking the bill to the House of Representatives. If the minister directed his department to change import permit conditions to allow imports for category A patients then the spirit of the disallowance would be enacted. This is about helping people who have been assessed by their doctor as terminally ill. We're not looking at a free-for-all here. 


The Special Access Scheme is administered by the Department of Health, like all of our health regulations. It is a very rigorous process for a patient and their GP. It comprises three categories: A, B and C. Under the government's policy, access is only available for Australians under category B. Category B is an application pathway, while category A is a notification pathway. The critical difference is that under category A the doctor only has to notify the Therapeutic Goods Administration that they are accessing medicinal cannabis products for patients who are seriously ill with a terminal illness, but under category B the doctor must first apply to the TGA and receive an approval letter before medicinal cannabis products can be accessed. 


What we're debating today is recognising the mounting global evidence that medicinal cannabis is a safe, effective product for many, many people. We're debating the rights of doctors to work with their patients, to work with the TGA and to work with suppliers so that we can improve access to medicinal cannabis for the many thousands of Australians who need it. This bill today is just one small part of the huge web of legislative changes needed to improve access to medicinal cannabis. 


With brave community advocates and many parliamentary colleagues, I've been fighting for a long time for improved access to safe, reliable, legal and affordable medicinal cannabis. There is no doubt that cannabis has brought relief to and a dramatic reduction in pain and suffering for so many Australians. In my home state of Tasmania I have personally met with many individuals who have seen their lives and the lives of their loved ones turned around through this treatment. 


Sadly, though, there are just as many heartbreaking stories of those who continue to suffer because they are unable to gain access to this treatment. There are many others who are still branded as criminals under Australian law for accessing and using this treatment, despite the incredible and proven health outcomes to them and their loved ones. For too long Australians have been forced to navigate underground criminal networks in order to secure a medication that we know works, because it works for them; they demonstrate it. 


There is no doubt in my mind that change is desperately overdue. I would like to formally acknowledge all the brave Tasmanians who have had the courage to go public with their own stories, despite potential personal risks, in order to mount the case for reform. Some of these people are elderly; they look after their children. Some of them are very young. They are very nervous about the prospects of what dealing with an illegal substance may mean for them, but they cut through that, because it means to them that they can provide the help for their loved ones in suffering.


Last year, I spoke in this place about Natalie, about Lyn and Jeremy, about Nicole and Alice, and about Jessie and April, in the debate on the Narcotic Drugs Amendment Bill 2016. Tragically, Natalie Daley, a young mum with three children, lost her battle with cancer mid-year last year. Natalie was from my home town of Ulverstone. She was a pioneering advocate for medicinal cannabis, and her resilience was an inspiration to so many people. Despite the risks, Natalie went public with her very, very personal experience of the incredible change that medicinal cannabis made to her life after she was diagnosed with a very rare form of cancer.


Another Natalie, who is still fighting, is Natalie Vassallo from Burnie. I have known Natalie for some time. Earlier this year, at a forum in Burnie, we had a lengthy chat about her current situation, and she penned a powerful, logical email to me detailing her experience with medicinal cannabis and the Tasmanian health system and about her strong will to keep fighting to live so she could see her boys grow up. Natalie has spent time educating her GP on whole-plant medicinal cannabis therapy. Natalie said to me that she's one of the lucky ones: she is lucky enough to have a reasonable GP who is willing to listen but also to do his own research. But, under the Tasmanian government's scheme for accessing medicinal cannabis, only a specialist can make prescriptions, and Natalie, unfortunately, rarely gets to see her lung specialist. Her first appointment is scheduled for November this year. But she doesn't know if he'll have the time, or the interest, to help her apply for the state government's prescribed access scheme. Natalie says that her lung function improvements under medicinal cannabis have been nothing but remarkable. When she wrote the email to me in August, she was off all pain medications after using cannabis oil over the past two years, and she says that cannabis oil is the reason she's still here for her three boys, one of whom is still in school, while an older boy is her carer. The main issue is of course supply. The lack of pathways to access cannabis oil is a story told countless times to me and to all of us in this place, and it is the absolute core of this debate here today. Thank you, Natalie, for sharing your story, and thank you to your GP for listening but also for having the willingness to learn. And thank you to your boys for their support of each other but also of you. Every change that we can make in this place and in the Tasmanian parliament to empower our GPs and improve access is a step in the right direction.


I also want to commend Andrew Irving from Tasmania for his enduring leadership of Medicinal Cannabis and Hemp Tasmania. Andrew had been a full-time carer to his wife, Marilyn, until she, sadly, passed away earlier this year. Marilyn had a neurodegenerative condition and used medicinal cannabis. When she passed away, Andrew's resolve was to educate our community on medicinal cannabis and advocate for patients' rights, and he wanted to continue that legacy. Andrew publishes a regular newsletter called The Leaf, for Medicinal Cannabis and Hemp Tasmania members, and last year successfully crowdfunded for thousands of dollars and provided many hours of his own labour and other people's to create two educational trailers for the state. The trailers are packed full of information that can educate people and dispel the myths surrounding medicinal cannabis.


The trailers have been a huge success. They have been such a success, in fact, that Andrew is now building a third one, ready to go to the mainland. I was at the launch in Ulverstone last year for the trailer that was dedicated to Natalie Daley, and I know that Senator Brown, who is here in the chamber, was also at the launch in Hobart. That demonstrates Labor's commitment, right across the state, from the north to the south.


Also in Tasmania, we have had absolutely tremendous advocacy from our Tasmanian Labor politicians. That advocacy has been led by our former Premier Lara Giddings. While both the Labor and Liberal parties are supportive of improving access to medicinal cannabis, just like here in Canberra, the Liberal Party is overly cautious in its approach. It is leaving people to suffer, leaving people in fear of prosecution and creating uncertainty at a time when all we need to do is make access simpler. Under the Tasmanian Liberal government, specialists can apply to the health department to prescribe the drug, but the government can't say how long it will take to access medicinal cannabis. Labor's position is that doctors should be able to prescribe it, to make the drug more accessible. It has taken the Liberal government 3½ years to come up with a system that is simply too slow and doesn't facilitate safe and prompt access.


I've just told this place about Natalie's delays in accessing her specialist. I said her appointment is in November, but she doesn't actually have a date yet. All she has is: 'It's November.' As I said, she's concerned that the specialist won't have the time to help her apply through the state government's scheme. An ABC story from 5 October reported that in the first month of operation the Tasmanian government's Controlled Access Scheme received only three applications from medical specialists, with none having been approved at the time of writing. The health department has no timeline on a decision regarding pending applications.


While the Tasmanian Liberal government is off being overly cautious, GPs are confused with how the scheme works. Dr Bastian Seidel from the college of GPs said in the 5 October story that it is difficult for GPs to refer to the appropriate organisation or hospital specialist. He went on to say that states each have their own scheme and that patients who might benefit from medicinal cannabis can't get it, while GPs who want to prescribe it are not able to. Meanwhile, hundreds of Tasmanians are using medicinal cannabis every day. As I said earlier, they are risking prosecution. They don't have an easy, or good, supply chain—the quality quite often is questionable. They're suffering. I really hope that the government will hear the pleas not only in the stories I've shared today but in the stories I'm sure they've heard, as well as from the many others who are constant in their strong advocacy for improved access. What we need is support for this sensible legislation and movement to improving access for Australians who need it.


I thank Senator Di Natale for introducing this bill and for his longstanding commitment to working across the parliament—with me and other members of the Labor Party and with members of the coalition—to improve access to medicinal cannabis for people in Australia. In the last parliament, medicinal cannabis access was a great story of people coming together from across the political spectrum to do the right thing for those people in our community who are suffering, for those people who are helped in some way by medicinal cannabis. I remind the Senate that passage of this bill won't allow free access for all. To access products under category A a patient must be terminally ill. The heavy handed, cruel approach by the Minister for Health is undermining patient safety, it's undermining collaboration between the federal and state governments and it's miring GPs and patients in hours and hours of unnecessary red tape. Minister, please respect the will of the Senate, acknowledge the skills and expertise of our medical fraternity and move urgently to improve access for people who need our help.

Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (10:44):  I also rise to speak in support of the Medicinal Cannabis Legislation Amendment (Securing Patient Access) Bill 2017. It is a great pleasure for me to follow Senator Urquhart in this debate, because Senator Urquhart has been, not only in our home state of Tasmania but also here in the parliament, a tireless advocate for improving access to medicinal cannabis. I echo my support for Senator Urquhart's contribution here today.


There will be many people watching and listening to the Senate this morning to see how this chamber votes on this bill. Included amongst those people listening will be Andrew Irving. As Senator Urquhart mentioned in her contribution, Andrew Irving and his wife, Marilyn, were key drivers in the creation of medicinal cannabis education trailers. They built and launched two. Senator Urquhart and I were at the launch of one of them up on the north-west coast. Indeed, that trailer was dedicated to Natalie Daley, who unfortunately passed away.


Andrew Irving has been a tireless advocate in producing educational information and ensuring that information is provided to not only those people who require medicinal cannabis but members of the community across the board to raise awareness about what we're talking about when we talk about medicinal cannabis. As Senator Urquhart indicated, we lost Marilyn earlier this year, but that hasn't stopped Andrew's drive to ensure that Tasmanians are informed about the benefits of medicinal cannabis and to engage Tasmanians to support the use of medicinal cannabis. I take this opportunity to commend and congratulate him on the work that he is doing.


Labor supports the changes proposed in this bill, which will improve access to medicinal cannabis for terminally ill patients. I again echo Senator Urquhart's comments where she congratulated Senator Di Natale on bringing this bill to the chamber.


Earlier this year we saw—and Labor supported—the disallowance motion, which the Senate passed, that allows patients to access imported medicinal cannabis products under category A of the Special Access Scheme. In one of those rather rare occurrences in this chamber, Labor, the Greens, One Nation, Senator Lambie, Senator Hinch, Senator Gichuhi and Senator Leyonhjelm were united in voting to disallow the government's restrictions. Only the Nick Xenophon Team and Senator Bernardi supported the government. As we've already heard in the previous contribution by Senator Kakoschke-Moore, the Nick Xenophon Team will be supporting this bill, so that is indeed very good news.


This bill will uphold the Senate's intent by amending the Customs Act 1901 to clarify that a licence permission, consent or approval to import medicinal cannabis applies to category A as well as other pathways. The Therapeutic Goods Administration states that category A is strictly limited to:


… patients who are seriously ill with a condition from which death is reasonably likely to occur within a matter of months, or from which premature death is reasonably likely to occur in the absence of early treatment.


We need to be clear in this debate that this is what we're talking about: we're talking, unfortunately, about Australians who are dying. We should also be clear that under category A of the Special Access Scheme only a doctor will be able to prescribe medicinal cannabis. What this bill and the debate in this chamber are about is whether dying patients who have a legitimate clinical need for medicinal cannabis should have access to it. Labor believes they should, and that is why Labor will be supporting this bill.


This bill will go some way in ensuring there is a legal and regulated market so that family members and carers aren't forced to rely on the black market to relieve the pain of their loved ones in their final stages of life. This is a complex issue, which Labor acknowledged in this chamber back in June when the Senate voted to improve access to medicinal cannabis for dying Australians. On balance, Labor is proud to stand up for the rights of terminally ill Australians who are in need of medicinal cannabis. The fact is that some terminally ill Australians cannot find relief from pain within existing therapeutic goods. Patients who are suffering from a terminal illness should have access to safe, reliable and legal medicinal cannabis if it is prescribed by their doctor.


I have been fortunate to meet with people who have been suffering unbearable pain and to see firsthand the benefits of medicinal cannabis. Sadly, not all Australians who need medicinal cannabis have access to it. That must change. This chamber's vote in June should have resolved this issue. Terminally ill patients should've had easier access by now to a prescribed therapy that can ease their suffering. Unfortunately, in the months since June the government has continued to deny the parliament's will and much-needed relief to dying Australians. Straight after the vote, we saw the health minister equate dying Australians and their families with drug smugglers. The health minister said the disallowance was—and I quote from the Fairfax newspapers—'reckless and irresponsible'. He said it would put lives at risk and potentially make it easier for criminals to get drugs.


Mr Turnbull should be ashamed of the way his government has tried to scaremonger on this issue, stigmatising dying people who are trying to access medicinal cannabis. Even worse, the government has put in place a new barrier to prevent people from accessing cannabis. In June, soon after the disallowance vote, the government wrote to medicinal cannabis importers instructing them not to supply products to anyone holding a prescription under category A of the Special Access Scheme. Instead of helping Australians with terminal illness and their families, Mr Turnbull's priority has been to find a way to get around the Senate's decision to give dying Australians access to the pain relief they need.


The bill before us today, the Medicinal Cannabis Legislation Amendment (Securing Patient Access) Bill, will enshrine the intent of our disallowance vote in legislation. Because the government hasn't respected the parliament's will, this bill will amend the Customs Act 1901 to clarify that a licence, permission, consent or approval to import medicinal cannabis applies to category A as well as other pathways. Secondly, the bill seeks to ensure that terminally ill patients can access domestic medicinal cannabis products under category A when they become available. The bill will also amend the Narcotic Drugs Act 1967 to add category A as one of the purposes for which the secretary of health can grant a licence to manufacture medicinal cannabis in Australia.


Ultimately, in Labor's view, medicinal cannabis should be treated in the same way as medicines: products will be accessed for safety and efficacy by the TGA and, where they pass the test, they will be prescribed by doctors, dispensed by pharmacists and, possibly one day, subsidised by the PBS. Labor understands that medicinal cannabis can ease suffering for Australians who are dying. That is why Labor led the way and introduced legislation for a national medicinal cannabis scheme in 2015 and supported the government's legislation when it was finally introduced in 2016. It's a terrible shame that we have a government that remains sceptical of medicinal cannabis and has been much too slow to implement the national scheme.


The government has also failed to drive consistency across the states on the legal treatment of people currently accessing medicinal cannabis. Mr Shorten has written to Mr Turnbull three times urging action and offering support. But patients have seen no change. That is another reason why Labor is supporting the bill that is before us, because the government has failed time and time again to improve other pathways. Passage of this bill will be a step in the right direction. However, it will not be the end of the matter. I would like to see, and Labor is committed to, ensuring safe and timely access to medicinal cannabis is made available across Australia where it is appropriate to do so.


Unlike this government, Labor is committed to making sure those who are terminally ill have the access to treatment options they need and deserve. That is why we'll be supporting this bill. And I hope, when this bill is passed today, that the government will do the right thing and we can see this bill passed in the House of Representatives.

Senator HINCH
 (Victoria) (10:55):  This is a disgrace. This is an absolute disgrace what the government is doing here. I agree with Senator Brown when she quotes Mr Hunt in the Sydney Morning Herald saying it was reckless and irresponsible. It's not the people who brought this bill to the House that are irresponsible; it's the Minister for Health and the government. I don't give a damn we are seeing that they are thwarting the will of the Senate. I don't care they're thwarting the will of the Senate. They are thwarting the will and the rights of sick people in Australia. They are thwarting the will of sick people.


Before I jumped the shark and came here to the Senate, I worked for Saturday Night and did a lot of stories about medical cannabis. And I have talked to mothers of little kids who have had hundreds of thousands of convulsions that were cured by the efficacy of medical cannabis. I have been to Nimbin, to the Mardi Gras for the last two years for this very issue, to talk at a conference on medical cannabis, why it should be allowed and why it should be easily imported. I talked to man who had a brain tumour, and what keeps him peaceful, what keeps him out of pain is medical cannabis. And what is wrong with that? Everything else was not working for him. A mother brought her baby to Nimbin to see us and said, 'Here he is and now he's well.'


For the government now to do the shameful thing, to thwart the use of it, is a disgusting thing. If down the track, as Senator Di Natale says, we build up an Australian industry of medicinal cannabis, I'll be the first person to join the government in saying, 'We stopped the imports; we are building the Australian industry up.' I would love to see Norfolk Island become the producer of medicinal cannabis the same way we have morphine coming from poppies in Tasmania. That would be fantastic if we could do that and I would support the government to say, 'Okay, now we have got a business running here.' As Senator Hanson said, we want to build up the local industry, and I'd go along with that.


But, right now, the government has callously, methodically and indecently blocked the will of the Senate, blocked the will of the people, blocked terminally ill people and people in pain from getting access to something that eases their pain, makes their life better, makes their life bearable, and I think the government and the health minister should be ashamed of themselves. They ambushed some crossbenchers the last time around. They ambushed the Xenophon Team when we got this letter from the health minister suddenly tabled by Senator McGrath at the last minute. I don't want to see that happen again. What has to happen today is we must pass this. You must make it right, make it work for the last time, so that families of terminally ill people, mothers of kids with fits can get access to a health product that works, that is proven to work. That should happen in this country as we speak.

Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (10:59):  One Nation will be supporting Senator Di Natale's bill and supporting the thousands of the Australians who have called for the change of attitude and, more importantly, the change in legislation that allows those people under category A facing terminal illness, imminent death, access to this miracle drug. One Nation federally and our Queensland state leader, Steve Dickson, have worked tirelessly to decriminalise this medicinal cannabis. I will say it again: this is a miracle drug, and this monumental change will be remembered long into the future.


I cannot understand why the government is so against fighting for this and is against this change. It is important that we do it, and this is why we support it. It's known that a lot of Australians want this and want to see this drug used. I have spoken to a patient who came back from America and who had the use of medicinal cannabis there. She had a brain tumour. After using it, there was clearly a shrinking of the tumour. Yet she got no help in Australia. Under this bill, licensed importers will be permitted to import and supply to category A patients. We are now on the precipice of real change in the way that category A patients can access much-needed pain relief.


I know a young lady by the name of Caitlin who suffers from 19 medical conditions, including cerebral palsy, epilepsy, chronic lung disease, obstructive sleep apnoea and hyperventilation and autoimmune disease, to mention just a few. She is just nine years old. Her mother is forced to produce illegal medical cannabis oil to keep her daughter alive; failing to give her the six daily doses would lead to endless seizures and permanent hospitalisation, with her connected to oxygen.


What we are doing here today will lift the legal hurdles and, if you like, stop making criminals out of caring mums and dads, family members and a raft of people in our community who are simply trying to ease the suffering of loved ones during their final months of life. Who are we to deny these people that choice? The denial, I hope, will stop today.


I welcome the future of Queensland company Medifarm in bringing proven genetic plant strains, extraction and manufacturing processes to Australia from their Israeli partners, who have over 20 years experience in producing medical cannabis oils that work. In a recent survey of over 1,540 responsibilities, 95 per cent of Australians from all states and territories supported the use of medical cannabis oil. Of that 95 per cent, 75 per cent of respondents called for whole-plant medical cannabis oil, not synthetic pharmaceutical rip-offs.


Our next step is to lift the numbers of doctors throughout the country willing to prescribe medical cannabis oil. It's not good enough that my own home state of Queensland has just 20 doctors registered to prescribe the drug. Worse still, current legislation prevents the medical board from revealing those registered GPs' names. This is just another barrier between the patient and true care. I can hear the frustration from my constituents in Queensland from here in Canberra. My Queensland state leader, Steve Dickson, and future elected Queensland One Nation members of parliament will do everything in their power to broaden those GP numbers and to make their names accessible. In the meantime, my One Nation colleagues and I commend the bill to the Senate.

Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (09:31):  Thank you, Mr President. I'm very proud to bring my Medicinal Cannabis Legislation Amendment (Securing Patient Access) Bill 2017 to the Senate. On behalf of those many thousands of Australians who are suffering as a result of this government's failure to secure timely access to a medication that we know relieves people of suffering. 


I'm introducing this bill in the name of Australian patients who are sick and tired of the obstacles that are put in front of them and of the regulatory nightmare that this government's medicinal cannabis framework has become. Doctors who desperately want to give treatments that relieve people of distressing symptoms are facing hurdle after hurdle after hurdle when they try to access medicinal cannabis. I have to say that it is remarkable that we have a government of this nation that would make life for terminally-ill patients so difficult, and I am proud that the Senate, based on the preliminary discussions we've had with members of the chamber, looks like it will support this move to secure timely access to medicinal cannabis. 


We worked very constructively during the early days of the government's legislation on medicinal cannabis. The history of this legislation is one that we Greens are very, very proud of. We established a cross-party working group—members of the government, members of the opposition, members of the crossbench—to work constructively to try and bring the stories of people who are suffering here to Canberra and put them in front of politicians so that they could understand just how important it was that individuals who are suffering needlessly and have potentially a remedy that could relieve them of symptoms like intractable nausea, pain, muscle spasms and so on. 


We worked very constructively through that cross-party working group, and the pressure came to bear on the government, who ultimately said, 'We will move. Please don't introduce your legislation, because we are prepared to act.' The Greens had legislation ready to go. In good faith, we accepted the government's word that they would introduce legislation that would make sure that individuals who were suffering got timely access to medicinal cannabis. I'll be very frank: it was a mistake. It was a mistake to trust this government. It was a mistake to hand over the legislative response to medicinal cannabis to a government who has shown itself to be more interested in giving the appearance of doing something when, in substance, it is making life so difficult for suffering people. Instead of having a pathway to access, what we do have is this disaster of regulation and red tape, which I can only assume is because they have some ideological objection to providing life-saving medicines to people simply because there's stigma associated with cannabis.


When it comes to the patients who we know will benefit from this bill, let's remember who they are. We are only talking about patients who are suffering and who, by definition, have a terminal illness. What the government are doing by opposing this legislation is saying, 'We want to make your life more difficult in your final months when you're suffering from terminal cancer which might produce symptoms like intractable nausea.' That is, you're having chemotherapy and you can't keep your food down because of the nausea that's not responding to the traditional agents that we give you. If you have a response to medicinal cannabis that allows you to tolerate food, that helps you maintain your condition and that can give you, in your final months of life, a higher quality of life, the government are saying, 'We don't want that. We're going to stop that.'


The Australian Greens are standing up for those patients. We're standing up for those patients because we don't believe any government should get in the way of access to medicines that make their final few months a little easier with a little less suffering. This bill makes two small changes—they're only small—to give dying patients rapid access to medicinal cannabis when a doctor has prescribed it. Let's be clear about this: this is only after medicinal cannabis has been prescribed by a doctor.


The first amendment is to ensure that the government follows what the Senate has already ordered this government to do, and that is to allow the importation of medicinal cannabis for terminally ill patients through what's known as category A of the Special Access Scheme. Only a few short weeks ago in this chamber we saw a Greens motion supported by the Labor Party and members of the crossbench—I see Senator Hinch is behind me; he's also been a strong advocate for medicinal cannabis. We saw members of the crossbench and the Labor Party introduce a motion that should have made access to medicinal cannabis through category A of the Special Access Scheme much easier and, instead, the government refused to accept the will of the Senate. The government has ignored the Senate, has threatened importers and has gone so far as to say that they would have their permits revoked if they followed the law. This bill ensures that the government can no longer block that importation of medicinal cannabis for category A—that is, those people who have a terminal illness.


The second amendment to this legislation just levels the playing field so that, when they become available, Australian medicinal cannabis products, not just those from overseas, can be provided through category A. The problem we have at the moment is we don't have a mature medicinal cannabis industry in this country, and that is why we needed, through our previous motion, to allow the importation of medicinal cannabis for people with a terminal illness. But we think that the moment Australian product comes online that should also be made available through the Special Access Scheme. We want a vibrant, mature, effective medicinal cannabis scheme in Australia. We know it's good for patients, but it's also good for Australian farmers. We want to make sure that that industry thrives, and we want to make sure that they have the best incentives to supply medicinal cannabis to terminal patients who need it most.


I know that this bill won't fix everything. One of the problems we have is that we have different layers of regulation. Once people get through the first hurdle—that is, federal red tape—there are also the layers of regulation at a state level which need to be addressed. We can't do much about that right now, except continue to put pressure to bear on those states who are also dragging their heels. What we can do is make sure that that first barrier—that is, the restrictions that are put in place by the federal government—is addressed.


I have spoken with many patients and their families; I know how much this change means to them. We all know the story of Lucy Haslam's son, Dan, who was a young man with terminal bowel cancer. This is a man in his 20s who developed bowel cancer, was having chemotherapy and wasn't getting any relief from his nausea from those traditional agents that we use to treat chemotherapy induced nausea. He got instant relief from medicinal cannabis after it was suggested to his family by a friend, and as a result he was able to tolerate food and his quality of life improved immeasurably. I have spoken to patients who have had brain tumours and, again, have found that the relief that medicinal cannabis provides them is significant. While it might not save their lives, it improves their quality of life in those final few months. We Greens stand here today with those many thousands of Australians who are suffering, or indeed are caring for someone who is suffering, and who know that as a result of the lack of access to these treatments they are being denied treatment that could make such a difference to their quality of life. We are going to keep fighting until patients can safely and quickly access these medicines.


I'm so proud to bring this bill to the Senate. I'm absolutely delighted that we're achieving a rare victory here today, and that is that the majority of the Senate looks like it will stand with us in opposition to this government's cruel intransigence. We will also pursue this in the lower house. I know there are members of the LNP who say they support medicinal cannabis, who want medicinal cannabis to be made available from doctors through a regulated framework and who want to make sure that patients who live in their own constituencies get access to these medicines. I know they're out there because I've spoken to them. I say this to them right now: this legislation looks like it will pass the Senate. Have the guts and the decency to stand up when this legislation makes it through to the lower house. Cross the floor if you have to. We only need one or two of you to stand up and have a bit of courage to say you stand with patients and their needs, not your own political self-interest, and we can get this through both houses of parliament. In the meantime, I'll be pursuing a meeting with Minister Hunt. I'll be doing what I can to ensure that he understands just how critical it is that this bill gets through the Senate.


When we are elected to this place, we make a commitment to those people who elect us that we will act in their interests—that we will come to this place and represent them. We have an opportunity to help people who are now suffering, whose lives will be cut short because of the tragedy of a terminal illness. We have an obligation to them to make sure we do everything we can to make their final days on this earth as tolerable as possible and to relieve them of the pain and suffering that they're experiencing. I can think of no greater obligation given to us in this place, and today's an opportunity for members to stand up and indicate that they stand with those patients.

"Brockman, Sen Slade",LP,2017-10-19,"



Senator BROCKMAN
 (Western Australia) (09:44):  With indulgence, I want to thank all the members of the Senate for their warm words of support and encouragement following my first speech a couple of days ago.


The government will not be supporting this bill. The issue of medical cannabis is a recurring one that the government has resolved in a way that provides access to those Australians who need it, makes the use of medical marijuana a medical decision and keeps adequate safeguards in place to ensure access is not misused. It has been made clear that medical cannabis is potentially valuable in some cases, particularly in a palliative care setting, but the media surrounding this bill has, unfortunately, been extremely misleading. Central to this false campaign is the allegation that the Office of Drug Control is breaching legislation by not permitting the import of medical cannabis products for use in Special Access Scheme category A. There is no truth to this. It is based on a misinterpretation of a letter sent to existing importers under the bulk import policy reinforcing the standards of their import permissions and how they are conditioned for supply under the Special Access Scheme category B and Authorised Prescriber Scheme. This letter was a necessary measure to ensure the regulations were being followed, due to the fact that at least one importer interpreted the disallowance motion as meaning that they could supply under the Special Access Scheme category A, which was not allowed. Doing so would breach the conditions of their licence and potentially be subject to regulatory action under the Customs Act 1901. The letter contained no language that stated or implied in any way that they could not import product for the purpose of supplying under category A. The Office of Drug Control has always been very clear about this and has always given Special Access Scheme category A swift application processing times—I understand it's a one-day priority processing time.


There have been five notifications to the TGA since the disallowance motion, but the Office of Drug Control has only received and processed one import permission application for category A. In accordance with the regulation, namely regulation 5 of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956, the office must thoroughly and necessarily make an assessment of each Special Access Scheme category A importation.


I feel it's important to note at this point that this scheme was established by the government in October 2016, with bipartisan support, in order to ensure access to medicinal cannabis for terminally ill patients. This issue has been looked at extensively by the parliament—and often with a bipartisan approach. The Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee report in 2015 was one such example. This report covered extensively the safety and efficacy of medicinal marijuana and the regulatory framework around its use. One thing that was very clear from this report was that, at best, medical benefits of marijuana are equivocal, untested and in need of further research. The report said:


For example, Professor Wayne Hall, Director of the Centre for Youth Substance Abuse Research at the University of Queensland, expressed the view that the current research indicated medicinal cannabis is 'at best, modestly effective for some purposes (for example vomiting and nausea) and probably for others (for example chronic pain, depression, muscle spasm)'. Professor Hall stated:


'An informed policy towards the medical use of cannabinoids requires much better evidence than we currently have...we need clinical trials of the safety and efficacy of CBD and other cannabinoids in treating intractable epilepsy and chronic pain. Evidence from these trials is essential for rational decisions to be made about the medical use of cannabinoids.'


The Royal Australasian College of Physicians considered that 'while medicinal marijuana shows some potential for certain patients, further research is required to determine its efficacy and it should be subject to the same scrutiny as any other medicine'.


Painaustralia expressed the view that, for individuals with chronic non-cancer pain, there is little proven evidence for the effectiveness of cannabinoids in helping patients, and that it did not endorse the use of cannabinoids for this group of patients 'until such time as a clear therapeutic role for [cannabinoids] is identified in the scientific literature'.


On a point of clarification, medicinal cannabis can be administered in a variety of ways that do not include smoking, which very obviously carries heavy known risks. These include oral administration by a pill, oromucosal spray, tinctures, ointments, the ingestion of oil derived from cannabis plants and vaporisation of a herbal product. As a side note, the Turnbull government also does not support changing the current legal status of vaping for a number of reasons, but, first and foremost, that there is limited scientific and medical understanding of the effects. Evidence, when making these kinds of regulatory decisions, is vital.


The science and evidence behind medical cannabis is complex and incomplete. The Australian government is taking advice on the matter from the Therapeutic Goods Administration and medical professionals, including the Australian and New Zealand Society of Palliative Medicine and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. These professionals agree with the current arrangements and do not support the changes as set out. It is potentially dangerous to patient safety to allow access to medicinal cannabis products through the Special Access Scheme category A, due to the fact that unlike other unregistered medicines under this scheme, with the single exception of Sativex, which is a formulated extract of the Cannabis sativa plant, no medicinal cannabis products have been subject to a full safety, quality and efficacy assessment by a competent medicines regulator anywhere in the world.


If government allowed medical products onto the market that have not been properly tested, we would be rightly criticised and all those opposite would be the first ones to stand up and criticise us. There is no easily accessible evidence of safety available that can be used to guide prescribing decisions that work in conjunction with the various medico-legal obligations that doctors have to their patients. Despite all this, I want to make it quite clear that terminally ill patients already have access to medicinal cannabis products and are gaining access to them. In consultation with their clinicians, patients are able to gain timely approvals from the Therapeutic Goods Administration to prescribe the medicine under Special Access Scheme category B, and that can happen in as little as one day. Any rhetoric about excessive delays or wait periods is false. The delays are occurring where the prescribing doctor has insufficient knowledge of the product, along with the risks and benefits associated with the medicine, and, therefore, cannot justify their decision in prescribing it, or cannot describe the product which they wish to prescribe.


For any condition, it is never in the best interests of the patient to have an ill-informed medical practitioner prescribing their care. However, this is a delicate matter and an area where having an informed doctor at the heart of these decisions is crucial. The government's policy on medicinal cannabis is central to a medical decision. It puts the medical professional at the centre of the decision to prescribe. In this way, the government adheres to the advice of the medical profession. If the medical professional does not support the use of a particular pathway, then the government will listen to that advice. Naturally, there are those who are strong supporters of medicinal cannabis being extremely accessible and seek to increase the availability of the drug. However, this is not necessarily a choice that the medical profession endorses. For example, on 13 June this year, AMA president Michael Gannon said:


… doctors are reluctant to prescribe medicinal cannabis. This is no different to any other new drug, new technology, new operation; we want to be assured of the safety, assured of the effectiveness. 


Again, if governments weren't able to be very sure of the safety and effectiveness, and if doctors are not sure of the safety and effectiveness, then I think criticising the current regulatory regime is a mistake. 


The Australian government has a responsibility to the Australian people to ensure the changes we make in this space are not done recklessly or without adequate forethought and research. Michael Gannon later said in the same interview:


… let's not forget, we're talking about cannabis, we're talking about a substance that, used in the form it's used by most people, is a major source of mental illness in our community. It's absolutely essential that we're assured that whatever's being brought into the country, whatever's being brought in for prescription is safe …


Beyond our own legislation, Australia is subject to a number of different international obligations that exist under various treaties, including the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1961, which specifies the obligations of signatory states for narcotic drugs listed in various schedules to the UN convention. The Department of Health in its submission to an earlier inquiry into this issue noted that the Commonwealth is responsible for the implementation of Australia's treaty obligations, stating: 


The Commonwealth is responsible for the implementation of international agreements that it enters into and generally has the power to make legislation to implement Australia's treaty obligations. Accordingly, the Commonwealth is responsible for ensuring that any Commonwealth, State or Territory medicinal cannabis scheme is consistent with Australia's treaty obligations under the three drug control conventions …


Further to this, obviously, we do have an additional layer of complexity in our federation, which is that states and territories have their own initiatives in this space.


While the government will use many different sources to make decisions about the use of medicinal cannabis, we listen to the medical profession, and I think we need to continue to do that into the future. There is a demand for medicinal cannabis, and the path we currently have in place allows a safe, legal and effective way for terminally ill patients to gain access to medicinal cannabis. As of 17 October, there have been 287 individual patients who've been given access to medicinal cannabis either via the Special Access Scheme or an authorised prescriber. Additionally, there have been 21 licences granted for domestic cultivation: nine for medicinal cannabis cultivation, six for further research and six for manufacturing. So, we can see that the scheme is working. It is allowing patients who feel that they need this drug, with the support of their medical practitioner, to gain access. On that basis, the government will not support this bill and will not be looking at making changes to this regulatory environment.

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2017-10-19,"



Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (09:56):  In June, the Senate voted to improve access to medicinal cannabis for dying Australians. In particular, Labor and most of the crossbench voted to disallow the government's restrictions on access to medicinal cannabis under category A of the Special Access Scheme. I want to emphasise two things about category A from the outset of this debate. Firstly, this is a pathway for accessing therapeutic goods for people who are terminally ill. According to the Therapeutic Goods Administration—the TGA—category A is strictly limited to:


… patients who are seriously ill with a condition from which death is reasonably likely to occur within a matter of months, or from which premature death is reasonably likely to occur in the absence of early treatment.


We should be very clear in this debate that we are talking about dying Australians. Secondly, under category A of the Special Access Scheme, medicinal cannabis can only be accessed with a prescription from a doctor. We're not talking about illegal recreational use or inappropriate medicinal use; we're talking about dying patients who have a legitimate clinical need for medicinal cannabis as prescribed by their doctor.


In the debate in June, Labor did acknowledge the complexities of this issue. We acknowledged that some groups have raised concerns about the possible abuse of category A. We also acknowledged the need to strike a balance between access for dying patients and protection of the broader community. But, on balance, Labor was proud to stand up for the rights of terminally ill Australians who have been prescribed medicinal cannabis by their doctors. The Senate overwhelmingly agreed with Labor, voting 40 to 30 to disallow the government's restrictions. There ain't many votes in this place that unite Labor, the Greens, One Nation, Senator Lambie, Senator Hinch, Senator Gichuhi and Senator Leyonhjelm, but this one did exactly that. Among the crossbench, only the Nick Xenophon Team and Senator Bernardi supported the government. I would urge them to explain that vote and to reconsider their position today.


The Senate vote in June should have resolved this issue. Terminally ill patients should have had easier access to a prescribed therapy that can ease their suffering. But what we've seen from this government in the months since June is an attempt to block the parliament's will and to continue denying relief to dying Australians. Straight after the vote, we saw the health minister equate dying Australians and their families with drug smugglers. In the sort of temper tantrum that we saw from the Prime Minister on election night, the health minister said the disallowance was—and I quote from Fairfax—'Reckless and irresponsible,' saying it would put lives at risk and, potentially, make it easier for criminals to get drugs. It was a disgraceful slur for which the health minister still hasn't apologised. Mr Turnbull should be ashamed of the way his government has tried to scaremonger on this issue, stigmatising the dying people who are trying to access medicinal cannabis. Even worse, the government has put in place a new barrier to prevent people from accessing medicinal cannabis. In June, soon after the disallowance vote, the government wrote to medicinal cannabis importers, instructing them not to supply products to anyone holding a prescription under category A of the Special Access Scheme. This was despite the fact that the Senate had just voted to reopen that pathway. It says everything about Mr Turnbull. Instead of helping Australians with terminal illnesses and their families, his priority is to find a way to get around the Senate's decision to give dying Australians access to the pain relief they need.


That brings me to the bill before us today: the Medicinal Cannabis Legislation Amendment (Securing Patient Access) Bill 2017. Labor will support this bill which simply enshrines the intent of our disallowance vote in legislation. The bill would make two legislative changes to improve access to medicinal cannabis for terminally ill patients under category A of the Special Access Scheme. First, the bill would ensure that terminally ill patients can access imported medicinal cannabis products under category A. Again, this was the intent of the disallowance motion in June, but, because the government hasn't respected the parliament's will, this bill would amend the Customs Act 1901 to clarify that a licence, permission, consent or approval to import medicinal cannabis applies to category A as well as other pathways. Second, the bill seeks to ensure that terminally ill patients can access domestic medicinal cannabis products under category A when they become available. It would amend the Narcotics Drugs Act 1967 to add category A as one of the purposes for which the secretary of Health can grant a licence to manufacture medicinal cannabis in Australia.


I also want to use today's debate to make some broader comments on medicinal cannabis in Australia. Labor understand that medicinal cannabis can ease suffering for Australians who are dying. We also accept that there is evidence to support the use of medicinal cannabis for a number of other conditions, such as chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, and multiple sclerosis spasticity symptoms. That's why Labor led the way and introduced legislation for a national medicinal cannabis scheme in 2015 and supported the government's legislation when it was finally introduced in 2016. Over time, medicinal cannabis should be treated in the same way as other medicines. Products will be assessed for safety by the TGA and, where they pass that test, they will be prescribed by doctors, dispensed by pharmacists and possibly one day subsidised by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. A system of licences has also been established to govern research, cultivation, production and manufacture of medicinal cannabis products in Australia. But the government remains sceptical of medicinal cannabis and they have been too slow to implement the national scheme. Labor is particularly concerned that the government has done little to ensure a consistent supply of regulated and affordable product. The government has also failed to drive consistency across states on the legal treatment of people currently accessing medicinal cannabis. Bill Shorten has written to Mr Turnbull three times urging action and offering support, but patients have seen no change. That's one reason why Labor is supporting the bill that is before us, because the government has failed time and time again to improve other pathways.


I'd like to give some context to why this is an important issue by sharing one family's experience. Lucy Haslam is a Tamworth advocate and a mother who has campaigned for the legislation of medicinal cannabis after her son Dan was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Dan passed away in 2015. Lucy has continued to push for better access to medicinal cannabis for patients. In February, on the first anniversary of the passage of the federal medicinal cannabis legislation, Ms Haslam wrote that little had changed. Because of the time, I can't read the entire letter, but I would like to share some excerpts from it. She wrote:


On the first anniversary of Australian medicinal Cannabis legislation which was supposed to be the ""missing link"" for Australian patients (according to the previous Health Minister Sussan Ley), I want to shout from the rooftops that nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, although it pains me to say it, it is coming very close to being an outright lie.


Off the back of strong public support for patients like my son Dan who sought relief from serious disease and symptoms with medicinal Cannabis, the Government rode the wave of popular opinion, made all the right sympathetic noises, and passed legislation to allow for the cultivation, manufacture, and research into Cannabis for therapeutic purposes.


That sounds wonderful and I used to feel very proud that Dan's courage to speak out had some impact for the welfare of other patients. I thought it a beautiful tribute that the Legislation was passed on the first anniversary of his death.


However, Ms Haslam said that this pride of passage of the legislation has been replaced by anger that little has changed in reality. She wrote:


People often say to me you must be very pleased with how things have progressed ... so let me honestly answer that right now:


Patients are still criminals. This includes the terminally ill and children with intractable epilepsy.


Patients are still reliant on the black market and will be for a long while yet. They are still taking medicine procured from illicit sources which is like playing the lottery ... the medicine could be contaminated, each batch is likely to contain different cannabinoids, there is no certainty that there will be continuity of supply, there is no appropriate supervision by health professionals, there is no practical and viable alternative.


The black market is thriving; in fact, compassionate suppliers cannot meet demand. This is compounded by police raids which seize the medicine destined for patients who are reliant upon it. What happens when a child whose epilepsy is controlled by illicit Cannabis cannot access their next supply because police have confiscated it? Who will take responsibility for that?


The score card for the Government is looking very sad. In fact, I would say that on all aspects I give them a fail.


Now I can immediately hear the gatekeepers and authors of the regulations jumping up and down and saying ""but there is a pathway for patients to lawfully access medicinal Cannabis."" I agree in theory, but the problem is in putting it into practice.


The Special Access Scheme (SAS) provides that pathway. Let me explain very briefly as the process is so convoluted that word limits make full explanation an impossible task in this context.


To begin the process the very sick patient needs to find a doctor who is happy to prescribe Cannabis and who has the time to firstly undertake the arduous time consuming process to become an ""Authorised Prescriber"". This involves applications to State and Federal agencies. Once approved the doctor must then demonstrate to a committee the evidence for the patient's illness. (A little difficult after decades of blanket prohibition making research illegal).


The very sick patient then needs to find the product overseas (bearing in mind these products are not allowed to be advertised). Once found, the patient must negotiate a price and apply to the TGA to have it approved and they must also apply for Federal and State permits to have it imported. The patient bears the full cost plus the doctor's costs.


If they are successful in getting ""Special Access"" the approval only lasts three months and they are only allowed three months' supply. Think on this for a while ... A sick person must apply repeatedly placing an enormous burden on someone who is already battling illness and possibly even dying. This was the reality for a young Queensland patient with a brain tumour who took nineteen months to navigate the SAS. He is now several months into his second application and supplies are exhausted.


So, on the topic of patient access I would definitely give the Federal Government a huge fail!


This is a firsthand account of why things need to change, bringing us back to the bill here today.


If the Senate supports this bill, it will be a step in the right direction. But I want to assure the patients and families who are listening that Labor knows that much more needs to be done to ensure safe and timely access to medicinal cannabis across Australia, where it is clinically appropriate. Unlike the government, Labor is committed to working with patients and clinicians to make that a reality.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2017-10-19,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (10:10):  I rise to support the Medicinal Cannabis Legislation Amendment (Securing Patient Access) Bill 2017, and I thank Senator Di Natale for introducing it. The bill will allow medicinal cannabis to be imported for terminally ill patients through category A of the Special Access Scheme. It can already be imported for other purposes, such as for general patients, under category B of the scheme. This would remove all doubt that importers of medicinal cannabis can import medicinal cannabis for the terminally ill under category A and not just for category B patients. The bill also allows the government to authorise the manufacture of medicinal cannabis in Australia for terminally ill category A patients. This makes it clear that there's nothing in the law stopping the terminally ill from accessing domestically manufactured medicinal cannabis under the existing category A arrangements, so there would be no reason for the government to force terminally ill patients onto the slow road to pain relief that general patients are suffering along—the category B route.


The government loves generic arrangements like the category B arrangement. Its plan is for all patients to get access to medicinal cannabis in this way in a timely and low-stress manner. But the terminally ill patients of Australia don't live in the plans of the government; they live in reality—a reality in which the government's generic arrangements for access to medicinal cannabis are murderously slow. I've said it before and I'll say it again: the government and its health department officials have blood on their hands. Through their lack of urgency, through their comfort in slow bureaucratic processes that might eventually lead to access, once the working groups have met and written their reports, and through their unwillingness to change course once it became clear that these processes weren't working, they are responsible for terrible, unnecessary suffering and very likely a number of premature deaths.


The Liberal Democrats saw this coming. We supported the government's legislation, establishing a process to legalise medicinal marijuana. But we warned that the maintenance of a ban on recreational cannabis would ensure that the regime for medicinal cannabis would be a red-tape minefield for patients, and so it has come to pass. Recreational cannabis is not something I recommend, but it should be a matter of choice for adults. It's already a choice in a number of countries, including eight states in America. In any case, recreational cannabis use is less harmful than both alcohol and tobacco, according to bodies such as the UK's Independent Scientific Committee on Drugs. The Liberal Democrats are the only party in this parliament that supports legalising the supply, distribution, possession and use of cannabis, whether for medicinal or recreational purposes. This approach would not only let people pursue their own lifestyle choices and allow a better use of scarce police resources but also, by cutting the red tape surrounding the supply of medicinal cannabis, be the surest way to relieving suffering in Australia.


It is an unfortunate characteristic of Australia that we ignore the experience of the rest of the world and continue to rely on policies of prohibition. Cannabis, e-cigarettes and online gambling are three current examples, and yet prohibition will be no more successful than it ever has been. It's time we got our heads out of the sand. I commend this bill as a means to relieving suffering, but I commend even more the Liberal Democrats' policy of legalising cannabis regardless of its use.

"Smith, Sen Dean",LP,2017-10-19,"



Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (10:14):  For me, nothing demonstrates the capacity for community opinion to change and evolve more than the issue of medicinal cannabis and its use in our community. I hear very regularly people's personal accounts of loved ones, people in their friendship circles, who are benefiting from access to medicinal cannabis. I readily admit that, on this particular issue, I come with little personal experience. So I'm inclined to trust the position of those in our community who are trusted to make difficult decisions around access to drugs—the Therapeutic Goods Administration and, indeed, the government and the Honourable Greg Hunt, who, as the current Minister for Health, has responsibility for health matters.


But that's not to say that my opinions won't evolve or change over time. As a member of the Senate Community Affairs Committee, I regularly sit in the Senate estimates process—probably on 15 occasions now since I've been a senator—and I've regularly heard Senator Di Natale's questioning of health officials from the Department of Health and the Therapeutic Goods Administration around the access arrangements. I don't doubt his great passion and sincerity in the issue; Senator Di Natale was, of course, a general practitioner before coming to the Senate.


That said, it is wise to adopt a precautionary principle when it comes to giving people access to medicinal cannabis. And it is important to clear up some of the facts, to correct the public record, in regard to some of the media commentary that occurred around the 'securing patient access category A' issue in this parliament back in June. In June, we did talk about the disallowance motion which effectively has given passage to the bill we are talking about now. Key among these points for me is the allegation that has been made that the Office of Drug Control is breaching legislation in not permitting the import of medicinal cannabis products for use in Special Access Scheme category A.


Those who have paid attention to this particular allegation would know that the allegation rests on a misinterpretation of a letter that was sent to existing importers, under the bulk import policy, reminding them that their existing import permissions are conditional for supply under Special Access Scheme category B and authorised prescriber schemes. This letter was necessary as at least one importer interpreted the disallowance motion that was agreed to in June as meaning that they could supply under the securing patient access arrangements category A. So what we had was a situation where an importer misinterpreted what the disallowance motion meant, which made it necessary to write to every importer to make it very clear what the arrangements were. This particular importer would have breached the conditions of their permission and potentially been subjected to regulatory action under the Customs Act of 1901.


This letter did not say they could not import for the purposes of supplying under SAS category A. The Office of Drug Control has always given SAS category A import applications a one-day priority processing time and continues to do so for medicinal cannabis products that are characterised under the SAS category A. Since the disallowance motion, though there have been five notifications to the TGA, the office has only received and processed one import permission application for SAS category A. To discharge its regulatory obligations set out in regulation 5 of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956, the office must necessarily make an assessment of each SAS category A importation. In addition, the scheme established by the government, with bipartisan support, in October 2016 ensured access to medicinal cannabis for terminally ill patients.


I think it is important on matters such as this to lean heavily on the advice of those in our community who are trusted with looking after our health. On this issue I would argue that the view of the established medical community in our country—indeed, they are same people that the Greens and Labor would go to, and then they would come back to in this place with numerous quotes about why the AMA's views on particular issues should be heeded to. For consistency sake, if you are going to stand behind the views of the AMA on some issues then it's important perhaps to stand behind the AMA on issues of great sensitivity like issues of medicinal cannabis.


On that point, I think it is worth noting that in June 2017, with the disallowance motion having been debated, AMA President Dr Michael Gannon said—these are his quotes now; and I think this is particularly important given some of the discussions that have happened in recent days in this building around the mental health and wellbeing of people:


And let's not forget, we're talking about cannabis, we're talking about a substance that, used in the form it's used by most people, is a major source of mental illness in our community. It's absolutely essential that we're assured that whatever's being brought into the country, whatever's being brought in for prescription is safe…


Those are not my words and not the words of well-meaning senators. They are the words of the Dr Michael Gannon, the president of the Australian Medical Association. In that same Sky News interview in June of this year, he went on to say:


…we're satisfied with the process being put in chain by Minister Hunt and the Government using the Therapeutic Goods Administration, using appropriate care and diligence that is used for all other therapeutic products.


… … …


The Australian community would be outraged if prescription medication was rushed in, if someone said that it was okay to use. The Australian people would be outraged if new operations got brought in or, for that matter, new foodstuffs were brought in without appropriate care and safety.


Dr Gannon is saying that if you have a regulatory regime that keeps the community safe, that does allow for products to be brought to market and that does allow for products to be given to people to support their care, then it's important that there be some consistency around that regime in order to not only relieve people of pain and suffering but also protect them and others from unsafe products


I argue that a consistent national regime is important. I accept the point that Senator Leyonhjelm was making—that it's important that the regime be as responsive as it possibly can. But I would argue that, on this particular issue, the regime is a good one, is responsive and is meeting community expectations. What gives me confidence in arguing the government's position is that it is built on the clear medical evidence informed by the attitudes of those people who are trusted in the medical profession to provide advice to government. The government continues of course to take advice from the TGA and the medical profession, including the Australian and New Zealand Society of Palliative Medicine, which I think is a particularly important organisation when considering the safe and proper medicinal use of cannabis. It is taking the advice of the Australasian College of Physicians and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. The advice is that it is potentially dangerous to patient safety to allow access to medicinal cannabis products through the Special Access Scheme category A. Unlike other registered medicines, they are prescribed through this scheme with one medical exception: no medicinal cannabis product has been subjected to a full safety, quality and efficacy assessment by a competent medicines regulator anywhere in the world. There is not easily accessible evidence of safety available to guide prescribing conditions in accordance with doctors' medico-legal obligations to their patients.


I think this is the most important point in the brief time that is available to me: terminally ill patients already have access. This does not mean that terminally ill patients cannot have access to medicinal cannabis products. Where doctors have educated themselves and demonstrated a clear understanding of the risk or benefit profile, they gain timely approval from the Therapeutic Goods Administration to prescribe the medicine under the SAS B category. This happens in as little as one day. Let me paraphrase: the current regime protects safety, protects patient safety, puts requirements on medical practitioners, and that regulatory process is achieved within one day. The argument that ill people are suffering delays in regards to the use of medicinal cannabis in their care is not true. That statement provided to me by the Minister for Health demonstrates that point very clearly.


Let me end where I started. I'm lucky enough that in my family and in my circle of friends they are not suffering illness where they require medicinal cannabis. Would my attitude be different if I had a personal experience much closer to these sorts of issues? It may well be, but on this issue and at this particular point in time I think the Australian community should trust the advice of the government, which is informed by specialist medical practitioners and the Therapeutic Goods Administration to ensure that Australians don't just get the best possible care but are protected from unsafe and unproven medical products.

"Kakoschke-Moore, Sen Skye",NXT,2017-10-19,"



Senator KAKOSCHKE-MOORE
 (South Australia) (10:26):  I rise to indicate the Nick Xenophon Team's support for this bill. At the outset, I wish to note that NXT has always enjoyed a very constructive working relationship with the Minister for Health, and we expect that this will continue.


However, respectfully, I think in this instance the government ought to be doing more than it is. When the disallowance motion to which this bill relates was dealt with in June of this year, the minister provided NXT with a list of actions the government was prepared to take to ensure faster and more streamlined access to medicinal cannabis for terminally ill patients in particular. NXT acknowledges the government has made some progress in relation to the actions and undertakings, but there is still a long way to go. The longer we wait for the government to act, the longer we prolong the suffering of terminally ill patients.


This bill sends a very strong message to the government that we cannot continue to allow terminally ill patients to suffer unnecessarily. The Special Access Scheme category A is used for terminally ill patients for whom other treatments have failed. This bill does not broaden the scope of patients who would have access to medicinal cannabis under category A; nor does it weaken that regulatory framework. But it does seek to ensure that Australian medicinal cannabis and imported medicinal cannabis is available to those who need it most.

"Urquhart, Sen Anne",ALP,2017-10-19,"



Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania—Opposition Whip in the Senate) (10:27):  I rise to speak on the Medicinal Cannabis Legislation Amendment (Securing Patient Access) Bill 2017 and to indicate our support for the bill. It is a bill that seeks to simply reflect the will of this Senate from June this year, when the Senate disallowed the government's amendment to the Therapeutic Goods Regulations 1990 so that medicinal cannabis could be imported for use for patients under the Department of Health's Special Access Scheme category A, as well as category B. Three days after the disallowance motion was passed the government sent a sharply worded letter to importers, threatening them that, despite the Senate's disallowance motion, it would be a breach of permit and licence conditions if they were to supply any imported medicinal cannabis product to a patient under Special Access Scheme category A. I feel that was a bit of a heavy-handed approach by the government. It was an approach that failed to recognise the will of this Senate, but that can now be corrected through the passage of this bill.


The bill makes two legislative changes to improve access to medicinal cannabis for terminally ill patients under category A of the Special Access Scheme. Category A allows terminally ill patients access to unregistered therapeutic goods with a doctor's prescription, but without preapproval by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. It is, therefore, quicker than other pathways. Because of the threat made by the government to import permits, it amends the Customs Act 1901 to clarify that 'a licence, permission, consent or approval' to import medicinal cannabis applies to category A, as well as other pathways.


The second change is to ensure that terminally ill patients can access domestic medicinal cannabis products under category A when they become available. It amends the Narcotic Drugs Act 1967 to add category A as one of the purposes for which the secretary of Health can grant a licence to manufacture medicinal cannabis in Australia. These amendments are for category A of the Special Access Scheme. Category A applies, as previous speakers have indicated, only to terminally ill patients.


As I've said for many years, when debating medicinal cannabis, this is a matter of compassion. That's what it's about; it's about compassion. It's about politicians, doctors and bureaucrats demonstrating some compassion towards a group of people who suffer from an incurable condition, with no idea what tomorrow will bring, or even if there will be a tomorrow. This is about a group of people who experience unimaginable pain on a daily basis, a group of people who have found that traditional medicines do not assist in suppressing their conditions. Whether it's a case of seizures in a young girl, like that of April, who I know, or a case of a mother's lung function, like that of Natalie, who I also know, this is about a minister hearing their pleas, listening to the community and doing the right thing.


If the vote goes the same way as the disallowance in June then this bill will pass the Senate. But it is then up to Minister Hunt to bring the matter to the House of Representatives, recognise that he made a mistake and that the amendment was too heavy handed, and accept the will of the Senate. The minister could even achieve half a what this bill seeks to achieve without even taking the bill to the House of Representatives. If the minister directed his department to change import permit conditions to allow imports for category A patients then the spirit of the disallowance would be enacted. This is about helping people who have been assessed by their doctor as terminally ill. We're not looking at a free-for-all here. 


The Special Access Scheme is administered by the Department of Health, like all of our health regulations. It is a very rigorous process for a patient and their GP. It comprises three categories: A, B and C. Under the government's policy, access is only available for Australians under category B. Category B is an application pathway, while category A is a notification pathway. The critical difference is that under category A the doctor only has to notify the Therapeutic Goods Administration that they are accessing medicinal cannabis products for patients who are seriously ill with a terminal illness, but under category B the doctor must first apply to the TGA and receive an approval letter before medicinal cannabis products can be accessed. 


What we're debating today is recognising the mounting global evidence that medicinal cannabis is a safe, effective product for many, many people. We're debating the rights of doctors to work with their patients, to work with the TGA and to work with suppliers so that we can improve access to medicinal cannabis for the many thousands of Australians who need it. This bill today is just one small part of the huge web of legislative changes needed to improve access to medicinal cannabis. 


With brave community advocates and many parliamentary colleagues, I've been fighting for a long time for improved access to safe, reliable, legal and affordable medicinal cannabis. There is no doubt that cannabis has brought relief to and a dramatic reduction in pain and suffering for so many Australians. In my home state of Tasmania I have personally met with many individuals who have seen their lives and the lives of their loved ones turned around through this treatment. 


Sadly, though, there are just as many heartbreaking stories of those who continue to suffer because they are unable to gain access to this treatment. There are many others who are still branded as criminals under Australian law for accessing and using this treatment, despite the incredible and proven health outcomes to them and their loved ones. For too long Australians have been forced to navigate underground criminal networks in order to secure a medication that we know works, because it works for them; they demonstrate it. 


There is no doubt in my mind that change is desperately overdue. I would like to formally acknowledge all the brave Tasmanians who have had the courage to go public with their own stories, despite potential personal risks, in order to mount the case for reform. Some of these people are elderly; they look after their children. Some of them are very young. They are very nervous about the prospects of what dealing with an illegal substance may mean for them, but they cut through that, because it means to them that they can provide the help for their loved ones in suffering.


Last year, I spoke in this place about Natalie, about Lyn and Jeremy, about Nicole and Alice, and about Jessie and April, in the debate on the Narcotic Drugs Amendment Bill 2016. Tragically, Natalie Daley, a young mum with three children, lost her battle with cancer mid-year last year. Natalie was from my home town of Ulverstone. She was a pioneering advocate for medicinal cannabis, and her resilience was an inspiration to so many people. Despite the risks, Natalie went public with her very, very personal experience of the incredible change that medicinal cannabis made to her life after she was diagnosed with a very rare form of cancer.


Another Natalie, who is still fighting, is Natalie Vassallo from Burnie. I have known Natalie for some time. Earlier this year, at a forum in Burnie, we had a lengthy chat about her current situation, and she penned a powerful, logical email to me detailing her experience with medicinal cannabis and the Tasmanian health system and about her strong will to keep fighting to live so she could see her boys grow up. Natalie has spent time educating her GP on whole-plant medicinal cannabis therapy. Natalie said to me that she's one of the lucky ones: she is lucky enough to have a reasonable GP who is willing to listen but also to do his own research. But, under the Tasmanian government's scheme for accessing medicinal cannabis, only a specialist can make prescriptions, and Natalie, unfortunately, rarely gets to see her lung specialist. Her first appointment is scheduled for November this year. But she doesn't know if he'll have the time, or the interest, to help her apply for the state government's prescribed access scheme. Natalie says that her lung function improvements under medicinal cannabis have been nothing but remarkable. When she wrote the email to me in August, she was off all pain medications after using cannabis oil over the past two years, and she says that cannabis oil is the reason she's still here for her three boys, one of whom is still in school, while an older boy is her carer. The main issue is of course supply. The lack of pathways to access cannabis oil is a story told countless times to me and to all of us in this place, and it is the absolute core of this debate here today. Thank you, Natalie, for sharing your story, and thank you to your GP for listening but also for having the willingness to learn. And thank you to your boys for their support of each other but also of you. Every change that we can make in this place and in the Tasmanian parliament to empower our GPs and improve access is a step in the right direction.


I also want to commend Andrew Irving from Tasmania for his enduring leadership of Medicinal Cannabis and Hemp Tasmania. Andrew had been a full-time carer to his wife, Marilyn, until she, sadly, passed away earlier this year. Marilyn had a neurodegenerative condition and used medicinal cannabis. When she passed away, Andrew's resolve was to educate our community on medicinal cannabis and advocate for patients' rights, and he wanted to continue that legacy. Andrew publishes a regular newsletter called The Leaf, for Medicinal Cannabis and Hemp Tasmania members, and last year successfully crowdfunded for thousands of dollars and provided many hours of his own labour and other people's to create two educational trailers for the state. The trailers are packed full of information that can educate people and dispel the myths surrounding medicinal cannabis.


The trailers have been a huge success. They have been such a success, in fact, that Andrew is now building a third one, ready to go to the mainland. I was at the launch in Ulverstone last year for the trailer that was dedicated to Natalie Daley, and I know that Senator Brown, who is here in the chamber, was also at the launch in Hobart. That demonstrates Labor's commitment, right across the state, from the north to the south.


Also in Tasmania, we have had absolutely tremendous advocacy from our Tasmanian Labor politicians. That advocacy has been led by our former Premier Lara Giddings. While both the Labor and Liberal parties are supportive of improving access to medicinal cannabis, just like here in Canberra, the Liberal Party is overly cautious in its approach. It is leaving people to suffer, leaving people in fear of prosecution and creating uncertainty at a time when all we need to do is make access simpler. Under the Tasmanian Liberal government, specialists can apply to the health department to prescribe the drug, but the government can't say how long it will take to access medicinal cannabis. Labor's position is that doctors should be able to prescribe it, to make the drug more accessible. It has taken the Liberal government 3½ years to come up with a system that is simply too slow and doesn't facilitate safe and prompt access.


I've just told this place about Natalie's delays in accessing her specialist. I said her appointment is in November, but she doesn't actually have a date yet. All she has is: 'It's November.' As I said, she's concerned that the specialist won't have the time to help her apply through the state government's scheme. An ABC story from 5 October reported that in the first month of operation the Tasmanian government's Controlled Access Scheme received only three applications from medical specialists, with none having been approved at the time of writing. The health department has no timeline on a decision regarding pending applications.


While the Tasmanian Liberal government is off being overly cautious, GPs are confused with how the scheme works. Dr Bastian Seidel from the college of GPs said in the 5 October story that it is difficult for GPs to refer to the appropriate organisation or hospital specialist. He went on to say that states each have their own scheme and that patients who might benefit from medicinal cannabis can't get it, while GPs who want to prescribe it are not able to. Meanwhile, hundreds of Tasmanians are using medicinal cannabis every day. As I said earlier, they are risking prosecution. They don't have an easy, or good, supply chain—the quality quite often is questionable. They're suffering. I really hope that the government will hear the pleas not only in the stories I've shared today but in the stories I'm sure they've heard, as well as from the many others who are constant in their strong advocacy for improved access. What we need is support for this sensible legislation and movement to improving access for Australians who need it.


I thank Senator Di Natale for introducing this bill and for his longstanding commitment to working across the parliament—with me and other members of the Labor Party and with members of the coalition—to improve access to medicinal cannabis for people in Australia. In the last parliament, medicinal cannabis access was a great story of people coming together from across the political spectrum to do the right thing for those people in our community who are suffering, for those people who are helped in some way by medicinal cannabis. I remind the Senate that passage of this bill won't allow free access for all. To access products under category A a patient must be terminally ill. The heavy handed, cruel approach by the Minister for Health is undermining patient safety, it's undermining collaboration between the federal and state governments and it's miring GPs and patients in hours and hours of unnecessary red tape. Minister, please respect the will of the Senate, acknowledge the skills and expertise of our medical fraternity and move urgently to improve access for people who need our help.

Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (10:44):  I also rise to speak in support of the Medicinal Cannabis Legislation Amendment (Securing Patient Access) Bill 2017. It is a great pleasure for me to follow Senator Urquhart in this debate, because Senator Urquhart has been, not only in our home state of Tasmania but also here in the parliament, a tireless advocate for improving access to medicinal cannabis. I echo my support for Senator Urquhart's contribution here today.


There will be many people watching and listening to the Senate this morning to see how this chamber votes on this bill. Included amongst those people listening will be Andrew Irving. As Senator Urquhart mentioned in her contribution, Andrew Irving and his wife, Marilyn, were key drivers in the creation of medicinal cannabis education trailers. They built and launched two. Senator Urquhart and I were at the launch of one of them up on the north-west coast. Indeed, that trailer was dedicated to Natalie Daley, who unfortunately passed away.


Andrew Irving has been a tireless advocate in producing educational information and ensuring that information is provided to not only those people who require medicinal cannabis but members of the community across the board to raise awareness about what we're talking about when we talk about medicinal cannabis. As Senator Urquhart indicated, we lost Marilyn earlier this year, but that hasn't stopped Andrew's drive to ensure that Tasmanians are informed about the benefits of medicinal cannabis and to engage Tasmanians to support the use of medicinal cannabis. I take this opportunity to commend and congratulate him on the work that he is doing.


Labor supports the changes proposed in this bill, which will improve access to medicinal cannabis for terminally ill patients. I again echo Senator Urquhart's comments where she congratulated Senator Di Natale on bringing this bill to the chamber.


Earlier this year we saw—and Labor supported—the disallowance motion, which the Senate passed, that allows patients to access imported medicinal cannabis products under category A of the Special Access Scheme. In one of those rather rare occurrences in this chamber, Labor, the Greens, One Nation, Senator Lambie, Senator Hinch, Senator Gichuhi and Senator Leyonhjelm were united in voting to disallow the government's restrictions. Only the Nick Xenophon Team and Senator Bernardi supported the government. As we've already heard in the previous contribution by Senator Kakoschke-Moore, the Nick Xenophon Team will be supporting this bill, so that is indeed very good news.


This bill will uphold the Senate's intent by amending the Customs Act 1901 to clarify that a licence permission, consent or approval to import medicinal cannabis applies to category A as well as other pathways. The Therapeutic Goods Administration states that category A is strictly limited to:


… patients who are seriously ill with a condition from which death is reasonably likely to occur within a matter of months, or from which premature death is reasonably likely to occur in the absence of early treatment.


We need to be clear in this debate that this is what we're talking about: we're talking, unfortunately, about Australians who are dying. We should also be clear that under category A of the Special Access Scheme only a doctor will be able to prescribe medicinal cannabis. What this bill and the debate in this chamber are about is whether dying patients who have a legitimate clinical need for medicinal cannabis should have access to it. Labor believes they should, and that is why Labor will be supporting this bill.


This bill will go some way in ensuring there is a legal and regulated market so that family members and carers aren't forced to rely on the black market to relieve the pain of their loved ones in their final stages of life. This is a complex issue, which Labor acknowledged in this chamber back in June when the Senate voted to improve access to medicinal cannabis for dying Australians. On balance, Labor is proud to stand up for the rights of terminally ill Australians who are in need of medicinal cannabis. The fact is that some terminally ill Australians cannot find relief from pain within existing therapeutic goods. Patients who are suffering from a terminal illness should have access to safe, reliable and legal medicinal cannabis if it is prescribed by their doctor.


I have been fortunate to meet with people who have been suffering unbearable pain and to see firsthand the benefits of medicinal cannabis. Sadly, not all Australians who need medicinal cannabis have access to it. That must change. This chamber's vote in June should have resolved this issue. Terminally ill patients should've had easier access by now to a prescribed therapy that can ease their suffering. Unfortunately, in the months since June the government has continued to deny the parliament's will and much-needed relief to dying Australians. Straight after the vote, we saw the health minister equate dying Australians and their families with drug smugglers. The health minister said the disallowance was—and I quote from the Fairfax newspapers—'reckless and irresponsible'. He said it would put lives at risk and potentially make it easier for criminals to get drugs.


Mr Turnbull should be ashamed of the way his government has tried to scaremonger on this issue, stigmatising dying people who are trying to access medicinal cannabis. Even worse, the government has put in place a new barrier to prevent people from accessing cannabis. In June, soon after the disallowance vote, the government wrote to medicinal cannabis importers instructing them not to supply products to anyone holding a prescription under category A of the Special Access Scheme. Instead of helping Australians with terminal illness and their families, Mr Turnbull's priority has been to find a way to get around the Senate's decision to give dying Australians access to the pain relief they need.


The bill before us today, the Medicinal Cannabis Legislation Amendment (Securing Patient Access) Bill, will enshrine the intent of our disallowance vote in legislation. Because the government hasn't respected the parliament's will, this bill will amend the Customs Act 1901 to clarify that a licence, permission, consent or approval to import medicinal cannabis applies to category A as well as other pathways. Secondly, the bill seeks to ensure that terminally ill patients can access domestic medicinal cannabis products under category A when they become available. The bill will also amend the Narcotic Drugs Act 1967 to add category A as one of the purposes for which the secretary of health can grant a licence to manufacture medicinal cannabis in Australia.


Ultimately, in Labor's view, medicinal cannabis should be treated in the same way as medicines: products will be accessed for safety and efficacy by the TGA and, where they pass the test, they will be prescribed by doctors, dispensed by pharmacists and, possibly one day, subsidised by the PBS. Labor understands that medicinal cannabis can ease suffering for Australians who are dying. That is why Labor led the way and introduced legislation for a national medicinal cannabis scheme in 2015 and supported the government's legislation when it was finally introduced in 2016. It's a terrible shame that we have a government that remains sceptical of medicinal cannabis and has been much too slow to implement the national scheme.


The government has also failed to drive consistency across the states on the legal treatment of people currently accessing medicinal cannabis. Mr Shorten has written to Mr Turnbull three times urging action and offering support. But patients have seen no change. That is another reason why Labor is supporting the bill that is before us, because the government has failed time and time again to improve other pathways. Passage of this bill will be a step in the right direction. However, it will not be the end of the matter. I would like to see, and Labor is committed to, ensuring safe and timely access to medicinal cannabis is made available across Australia where it is appropriate to do so.


Unlike this government, Labor is committed to making sure those who are terminally ill have the access to treatment options they need and deserve. That is why we'll be supporting this bill. And I hope, when this bill is passed today, that the government will do the right thing and we can see this bill passed in the House of Representatives.

"Hinch, Sen Derryn",DHJP,2017-10-19,"



Senator HINCH
 (Victoria) (10:55):  This is a disgrace. This is an absolute disgrace what the government is doing here. I agree with Senator Brown when she quotes Mr Hunt in the Sydney Morning Herald saying it was reckless and irresponsible. It's not the people who brought this bill to the House that are irresponsible; it's the Minister for Health and the government. I don't give a damn we are seeing that they are thwarting the will of the Senate. I don't care they're thwarting the will of the Senate. They are thwarting the will and the rights of sick people in Australia. They are thwarting the will of sick people.


Before I jumped the shark and came here to the Senate, I worked for Saturday Night and did a lot of stories about medical cannabis. And I have talked to mothers of little kids who have had hundreds of thousands of convulsions that were cured by the efficacy of medical cannabis. I have been to Nimbin, to the Mardi Gras for the last two years for this very issue, to talk at a conference on medical cannabis, why it should be allowed and why it should be easily imported. I talked to man who had a brain tumour, and what keeps him peaceful, what keeps him out of pain is medical cannabis. And what is wrong with that? Everything else was not working for him. A mother brought her baby to Nimbin to see us and said, 'Here he is and now he's well.'


For the government now to do the shameful thing, to thwart the use of it, is a disgusting thing. If down the track, as Senator Di Natale says, we build up an Australian industry of medicinal cannabis, I'll be the first person to join the government in saying, 'We stopped the imports; we are building the Australian industry up.' I would love to see Norfolk Island become the producer of medicinal cannabis the same way we have morphine coming from poppies in Tasmania. That would be fantastic if we could do that and I would support the government to say, 'Okay, now we have got a business running here.' As Senator Hanson said, we want to build up the local industry, and I'd go along with that.


But, right now, the government has callously, methodically and indecently blocked the will of the Senate, blocked the will of the people, blocked terminally ill people and people in pain from getting access to something that eases their pain, makes their life better, makes their life bearable, and I think the government and the health minister should be ashamed of themselves. They ambushed some crossbenchers the last time around. They ambushed the Xenophon Team when we got this letter from the health minister suddenly tabled by Senator McGrath at the last minute. I don't want to see that happen again. What has to happen today is we must pass this. You must make it right, make it work for the last time, so that families of terminally ill people, mothers of kids with fits can get access to a health product that works, that is proven to work. That should happen in this country as we speak.

 (Queensland) (10:59):  One Nation will be supporting Senator Di Natale's bill and supporting the thousands of the Australians who have called for the change of attitude and, more importantly, the change in legislation that allows those people under category A facing terminal illness, imminent death, access to this miracle drug. One Nation federally and our Queensland state leader, Steve Dickson, have worked tirelessly to decriminalise this medicinal cannabis. I will say it again: this is a miracle drug, and this monumental change will be remembered long into the future.


I cannot understand why the government is so against fighting for this and is against this change. It is important that we do it, and this is why we support it. It's known that a lot of Australians want this and want to see this drug used. I have spoken to a patient who came back from America and who had the use of medicinal cannabis there. She had a brain tumour. After using it, there was clearly a shrinking of the tumour. Yet she got no help in Australia. Under this bill, licensed importers will be permitted to import and supply to category A patients. We are now on the precipice of real change in the way that category A patients can access much-needed pain relief.


I know a young lady by the name of Caitlin who suffers from 19 medical conditions, including cerebral palsy, epilepsy, chronic lung disease, obstructive sleep apnoea and hyperventilation and autoimmune disease, to mention just a few. She is just nine years old. Her mother is forced to produce illegal medical cannabis oil to keep her daughter alive; failing to give her the six daily doses would lead to endless seizures and permanent hospitalisation, with her connected to oxygen.


What we are doing here today will lift the legal hurdles and, if you like, stop making criminals out of caring mums and dads, family members and a raft of people in our community who are simply trying to ease the suffering of loved ones during their final months of life. Who are we to deny these people that choice? The denial, I hope, will stop today.


I welcome the future of Queensland company Medifarm in bringing proven genetic plant strains, extraction and manufacturing processes to Australia from their Israeli partners, who have over 20 years experience in producing medical cannabis oils that work. In a recent survey of over 1,540 responsibilities, 95 per cent of Australians from all states and territories supported the use of medical cannabis oil. Of that 95 per cent, 75 per cent of respondents called for whole-plant medical cannabis oil, not synthetic pharmaceutical rip-offs.


Our next step is to lift the numbers of doctors throughout the country willing to prescribe medical cannabis oil. It's not good enough that my own home state of Queensland has just 20 doctors registered to prescribe the drug. Worse still, current legislation prevents the medical board from revealing those registered GPs' names. This is just another barrier between the patient and true care. I can hear the frustration from my constituents in Queensland from here in Canberra. My Queensland state leader, Steve Dickson, and future elected Queensland One Nation members of parliament will do everything in their power to broaden those GP numbers and to make their names accessible. In the meantime, my One Nation colleagues and I commend the bill to the Senate.

Senator PATERSON:
  Thank you. Today I rise to speak on a petition tabled by the Vietnamese community in Australia. The Vietnamese community in Australia was established as a result of the wave of people who fled Vietnamese communism after the civil war ended. The petition I have presented has over 10,000 signatures on an issue of great importance to the Australian Vietnamese community. It concerns the response to an environmental issue in Vietnam whereby millions of tonnes of fish were found dead on Vietnam's central coastline as a result of toxic waste discharged into the ocean illegally.


The petitioners ask the Senate to condemn the tactics used by the Vietnamese government against priests who helped to organise peaceful protests and to undertake a comprehensive review of aid and other commitments to Vietnam, and requests that the Australian embassy undertakes an active role in monitoring the treatment of religious leaders and practitioners in Vietnam.

I don't know now whether my amendment is an amendment to Senator Fifield's amendment.

Senator GALLAGHER:
  Thank you. I move an amendment to Senator Fifield's amendment:


At the end of the motion, add:


(1) but, in respect of the provisions of the Coastal Trading (Revitalising Australian Shipping) Amendment Bill 2017, the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee report by 4 December 2017;

The reporting date is the only change to Senator Fifield's amendment. We don't believe that, considering the legislative workload for the rest of the year, it's reasonable to expect, for a bill which we haven't seen, which we have only read about in the paper, that an inquiry and a report be done in essentially the next two weeks. I think it's entirely reasonable for a bill on this matter—on which, I imagine, based on the reports we read in the newspaper, there will be disputed views—to have a reasonable time frame. The reason it is February is more that we don't sit in January. We're not trying to unreasonably delay, but we believe that it is reasonable for the committee to have time to take submissions, to have hearings and to report back to the Senate in an orderly way.

 (Queensland—Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister) (12:09):  I table the explanatory memorandum relating to the bill and move:


That this bill be now read a second time.



I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated into the Hansard


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



This Bill amends the Bankruptcy Act 1966 to improve Australia's personal insolvency regime.


It will reduce the default period of bankruptcy from three years to one year but will preserve a trustee's ability to extend the period of bankruptcy in cases of misconduct.


Our current personal insolvency laws put too much focus on stigmatising and penalising failure. As part of the National Innovation and Science Agenda, this reform aims to promote entrepreneurship and innovation and to reduce the stigma associated with bankruptcy.


This reform is designed to foster entrepreneurial activity by reducing the negative effects that harsh bankruptcy laws may have on prospective entrepreneurs. Further, a reduced bankruptcy term will decrease stigma associated with entering into bankruptcy by recognising the importance of giving bankrupts a 'fresh start'. This will encourage entrepreneurs to re-engage in business sooner and encourage people, who have previously been deterred by punitive bankruptcy laws, to pursue their own business ventures.


The amendments in Part 1 of this Bill will mean that current restrictions associated with bankruptcy will automatically reduce from three years to one year so that upon discharge a former bankrupt may:


travel overseas without trustee permission


apply for credit over the prescribed amount without obligation to actively disclose their bankruptcy, and


enter into certain professions or positions, for example, becoming a company director.


One year is sufficient time for the administration of the vast majority of bankruptcies. Currently, where more time is required, a trustee can continue to administer a bankruptcy after discharge. This may occur for various reasons, including: ongoing investigations, assets to be realised, outstanding income contributions, and incomplete distribution of funds. This safeguard will continue to operate to ensure trustees can properly administer a bankruptcy even after a bankrupt's one year discharge.


Currently bankrupts are obligated to pay income contributions until discharge where their income exceeds the prescribed threshold. Part 1 of the Bill contains measures that extend income contribution obligations for discharged bankrupts for a minimum period of two years following discharge or, in the event that a bankruptcy is extended due to non-compliance, for


five to eight years. This will ensure high income earners do not abuse bankruptcy laws by reducing their income for a year, hiding their assets and incurring excessive debt.


The amendments in Part 2 of this Bill relate to the application and transitional arrangements. Commencement of these new provisions will occur six months after Royal Assent to allow trustees, debtors and creditors time to adjust to the new laws. It will give trustees time to object to discharge in cases of misconduct.


On the commencement of this reform all bankruptcies, including those on foot, will be discharged if they are over a year old unless they are subject to an objection. This will remove any incentives for individuals to delay petitioning for bankruptcy as all bankruptcies filed after Royal Assent will only run for one year.


Broadly, this reform encourages Australians to take reasonable educated risks, to leave behind the fear of failure and be more innovative and ambitious.


Owners of small businesses in Australia often need to secure business loans with their personal assets or provide personal guarantees. This blurs the distinction between personal and business liability, but it is the reality for many Australians


contemplating starting or building a business or any enterprise. The current bankruptcy regime deters entrepreneurs from taking risk for fear of failure where the consequences include being locked out of one's profession, being barred from overseas travel, or identifying as a bankrupt for a period of three years. The 2015 Productivity Commission Report on Business Set-Up, Transfer and Closure also suggests that more forgiving personal bankruptcy laws encourage entrepreneurial activity. Reducing the default period of bankruptcy to one year supports this.

Senator McGRATH
 (Queensland—Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister) (12:09):  I table the explanatory memorandum relating to the bill and move:


That this bill be now read a second time.



I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated into the Hansard


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



This Bill amends the Bankruptcy Act 1966 to improve Australia's personal insolvency regime.


It will reduce the default period of bankruptcy from three years to one year but will preserve a trustee's ability to extend the period of bankruptcy in cases of misconduct.


Our current personal insolvency laws put too much focus on stigmatising and penalising failure. As part of the National Innovation and Science Agenda, this reform aims to promote entrepreneurship and innovation and to reduce the stigma associated with bankruptcy.


This reform is designed to foster entrepreneurial activity by reducing the negative effects that harsh bankruptcy laws may have on prospective entrepreneurs. Further, a reduced bankruptcy term will decrease stigma associated with entering into bankruptcy by recognising the importance of giving bankrupts a 'fresh start'. This will encourage entrepreneurs to re-engage in business sooner and encourage people, who have previously been deterred by punitive bankruptcy laws, to pursue their own business ventures.


The amendments in Part 1 of this Bill will mean that current restrictions associated with bankruptcy will automatically reduce from three years to one year so that upon discharge a former bankrupt may:


travel overseas without trustee permission


apply for credit over the prescribed amount without obligation to actively disclose their bankruptcy, and


enter into certain professions or positions, for example, becoming a company director.


One year is sufficient time for the administration of the vast majority of bankruptcies. Currently, where more time is required, a trustee can continue to administer a bankruptcy after discharge. This may occur for various reasons, including: ongoing investigations, assets to be realised, outstanding income contributions, and incomplete distribution of funds. This safeguard will continue to operate to ensure trustees can properly administer a bankruptcy even after a bankrupt's one year discharge.


Currently bankrupts are obligated to pay income contributions until discharge where their income exceeds the prescribed threshold. Part 1 of the Bill contains measures that extend income contribution obligations for discharged bankrupts for a minimum period of two years following discharge or, in the event that a bankruptcy is extended due to non-compliance, for


five to eight years. This will ensure high income earners do not abuse bankruptcy laws by reducing their income for a year, hiding their assets and incurring excessive debt.


The amendments in Part 2 of this Bill relate to the application and transitional arrangements. Commencement of these new provisions will occur six months after Royal Assent to allow trustees, debtors and creditors time to adjust to the new laws. It will give trustees time to object to discharge in cases of misconduct.


On the commencement of this reform all bankruptcies, including those on foot, will be discharged if they are over a year old unless they are subject to an objection. This will remove any incentives for individuals to delay petitioning for bankruptcy as all bankruptcies filed after Royal Assent will only run for one year.


Broadly, this reform encourages Australians to take reasonable educated risks, to leave behind the fear of failure and be more innovative and ambitious.


Owners of small businesses in Australia often need to secure business loans with their personal assets or provide personal guarantees. This blurs the distinction between personal and business liability, but it is the reality for many Australians


contemplating starting or building a business or any enterprise. The current bankruptcy regime deters entrepreneurs from taking risk for fear of failure where the consequences include being locked out of one's profession, being barred from overseas travel, or identifying as a bankrupt for a period of three years. The 2015 Productivity Commission Report on Business Set-Up, Transfer and Closure also suggests that more forgiving personal bankruptcy laws encourage entrepreneurial activity. Reducing the default period of bankruptcy to one year supports this.


More often than not, entrepreneurs will fail several times before they experience success and will generally learn valuable lessons during the process. Helping these entrepreneurs to succeed requires a cultural shift. We need to provide the opportunity for a fresh start as soon as possible.


Reducing the default period of bankruptcy to one year will decrease the stigma of failure and encourage a culture of entrepreneurship and innovation.


Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of this bill be adjourned to the first sitting day of the next period of sittings, in accordance with standing order 111.

  Yes.




Senator DI NATALE:
  In lieu of suspending standing orders, I seek leave to make a two-minute statement.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for two minutes.




Senator DI NATALE:
  The government has objected to this motion being taken as formal on the grounds that it's a foreign policy motion. It's interesting that, only two minutes ago, we passed a motion about the plight of the Rohingya people of Myanmar. It seems that this government uses this tactic whenever it is faced with an uncomfortable motion where its hypocrisy is exposed. It is remarkable that it uses this tactic to deny foreign policy motions that it doesn't like and, yet, it is quite happy to see foreign policy motions debated in this chamber when they take a position that it supports. It's rank hypocrisy and it needs to be exposed. In future, should the government adopt the same tactic, we will be moving to suspend standing orders—let us make that point absolutely clear.


This is a motion that deals with the petition of the West Papuan people. Nearly two million people have come together, representing 70 per cent of the population of West Papua, despite the fact that there were threats that people who signed this petition would be arrested and tortured. Almost two million people have signed a petition calling on the United Nations to allow a free vote for West Papuan independence. Of course, this is against the backdrop of persistent human rights abuses in West Papua. A number of people are political prisoners in West Papua, many of them having been imprisoned for many years for doing nothing other than unfurling the flag of independence. The media is denied access. We need to say to the government of Indonesia and, indeed, to the United Nations that self-determination is critical for all peoples and that the United Nations should investigate the human rights abuses that are occurring in the region immediately.

The speeches read as follows—



TREASURY LAWS AMENDMENT (HOUSING TAX INTEGRITY) BILL 2017


Housing is fundamental to the wellbeing of all Australians and is a driver of social and economic participation, promoting better employment, education and health outcomes.


To support Australian households, the Government has designed a comprehensive package of measures which includes assisting first home buyers, increasing the supply of affordable housing and reforms to housing-related payments to the States and Territories.


The Government is ensuring home ownership is more achievable for Australians, and that they have access to secure and affordable housing, while continuing to strengthen the integrity of Australia's tax system.


This Bill implements measures announced in the Government's 2017-18 Budget Housing Affordability package to both improve the integrity of the tax system and increase the supply of rental accommodation.


The first two Schedules of this Bill deliver on the Government's commitment to reduce pressure on housing affordability by better targeting deductions relating to residential investment properties.


Travel related to use of residential premises


Schedule 1 to this Bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to disallow deductions for travel costs relating to residential investment properties.


The existing law allows deductions for travel relating to income produced or gained from residential investment properties. When a property is used for a mixed purpose, such as a holiday home and rental; or where the travel is for a mixed purpose, such as travelling to maintain an investment property and go on a family holiday; travel expenses need to be split between income-producing and private purposes.


The problem is there has been widespread abuse around excessive travel expense claims relating to residential investment properties.


As a result of these changes, travel costs for individual investors inspecting and maintaining residential investment properties will no longer be deductible.


This will stop residential property investors from using the tax system to pay for their holidays by claiming costs as a rental expense.


However, these changes do not prevent investors from engaging third parties, such as real estate agents, to provide property management services. These expenses will remain deductible.


We have consulted the community and stakeholders in developing this measure. Public consultation on the exposure draft legislation and explanatory material occurred over four weeks.


Some minor technical changes have been made in response to the consultations, to provide clarity to taxpayers.


Disallowing travel related to residential investment properties has an estimated gain to revenue of $540 million over the forward estimates.


The changes will improve the integrity of the tax system by addressing the systemic risk of excessive and incorrect claims for travel expenses associated with residential investment properties.


Limiting depreciation deductions for plant and equipment in residential premises


Schedule 2 to this Bill will amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997to limit deductions for plant and equipment assets used for producing assessable income from residential premises to when the asset was first used for a taxable purpose.


The tax system currently creates opportunities for plant and equipment to be depreciated by multiple owners of a property in excess of its actual value. Plant and equipment items are usually mechanical fixtures or those which can be 'easily' removed from a property such as dishwashers and ceiling fans.


We have seen significant abuse of the tax system with property investors claiming excessive deductions for these items. These changes will improve the integrity of the tax system by better targeting deductions for plant and equipment forming part of residential investment properties.


As a result of the changes in this Bill, investors who purchase new plant and equipment for their residential investment property after 9 May 2017 will still be able to claim a deduction over the effective life of the asset. However, subsequent owners of the property will not be able to claim deductions for that plant and equipment. Instead, acquisitions of existing plant and equipment items will be reflected in the cost base for capital gains tax purposes for subsequent investors.


These changes will not affect capital works depreciation deductions relating to residential property investments.


These changes will apply on a prospective basis, with existing investments grandfathered. Plant and equipment used or installed in residential investment properties as of 9 May 2017, or acquired under contracts already entered into on 9 May 2017, will continue to give rise to deductions for depreciation until either the investor no longer owns the asset, or the asset reaches the end of its effective life.


Again, we have consulted the community and stakeholders in developing this measure. In addition to releasing exposure draft legislation and explanatory material


for a four week consultation, Treasury engaged with key stakeholders including quantity surveyors, accounting organisations and industry representatives.


In particular, this Bill allows investors to claim a deduction for plant and equipment installed in a new residential investment property where the property has been purchased within six months of completion, even if the property has been tenanted.


This means investors who have purchased a newly-built residential investment property are not disadvantaged when no other person has claimed a depreciation deduction.


The change to limit depreciation deductions has an estimated gain to revenue of $260 million over the forward estimates.


Together with the changes to travel deductions, this Bill will improve the integrity of the tax system by better targeting deductions for residential investment properties.


Full details of the measures are contained in the explanatory memorandum.


FOREIGN ACQUISITIONS AND TAKEOVERS FEES IMPOSITION AMENDMENT (VACANCY FEES) BILL 2017


To support Australian households, the Government has designed a comprehensive package of measures which includes assisting first home buyers, increasing the supply of affordable housing and reforms to housing-related payments to the States and Territories.


The changes contained in this Bill are part of the Government's 2017-18 Budget package to reducing pressure on housing affordability.


This Bill amends the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 to implement an annual vacancy charge on foreign owners of residential real estate where property is not occupied or genuinely available on the rental market for at least six months in a 12 month period.


The vacancy charge builds on the Government's existing foreign investment regime which seeks to increase the number of houses available for Australians to live in. The charge provides a financial incentive for the foreign owner to make their property available on the rental market.


The charge payable will be equivalent to the residential application fee that was paid by the foreign person at the time the application to purchase the property was made to the Foreign Investment Review Board.


The vacancy charge applies to foreign persons who make a foreign investment application for residential property from 7:30PM on 9 May 2017. For eligible foreign owners of residential real estate the vacancy charge will be levied on an annual basis.


The annual vacancy charge is expected to result in greater use of foreign-owned properties. Reporting and notification requirements are also expected to provide greater visibility of vacancy rates for foreign-owned properties.


The Australian Taxation Office will administer the vacancy charge.


This Bill represents an important component of the Government's comprehensive plan to reduce pressure on housing affordability.


Full details of the Bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum.


Debate adjourned.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2017-10-19,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:20):  I'm a co-sponsor of this disallowance motion. Before I start, I would like to acknowledge the first peoples of our nation, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, and acknowledge that they are the first peoples of these lands and waters and that the Australian Greens recognise that 26 January is a day of mourning for many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. This land was never ceded. We acknowledge that the issues around sovereignty and treaty have never been dealt with in this country, and it is high time that we as a nation acknowledge these issues, that the land was not ceded and that we have a great deal of unfinished business.


The Greens' policy very strongly supports Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, and we strongly support Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples who are calling for a change to the date of Australia Day. Many Aboriginal people see 26 January, which is currently marked as Australia Day, as in fact Invasion Day. The first Day of Mourning held by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples was on 26 January 1938. That was the official day. That was the 150th anniversary, for them, of British invasion. Interestingly, it was only three years earlier that all Australian states and territories commenced using the name Australia Day to mark 26 January, and it was not until 1994 that there was consistently a public holiday on that date.


We will never be truly reconciled as a nation while we put Australia Day on a date that is seen as a day of dispossession and invasion and that Aboriginal people officially claim as a day of mourning. As I said, this date was first marked officially for the Aboriginal community in 1938. In other words, for all those people who think that there is just a group of people that are suddenly trying to change the date because it's fashionable, let me tell you that this has long been marked as a day of invasion for many, many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.


The Turnbull government first threatened to ban citizenship ceremonies in Fremantle, in my home state, at the end of last year, when the City of Fremantle rekickstarted an important conversation about cultural inclusivity. This is the same Turnbull government that say that they want to listen to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. They've claimed with their heart on their sleeve several times that they are committed to listening to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and that they need to follow their lead. Well, I'm sorry; that is not worth the paper it is written on when you consider their response to councils and local government authorities who have listened to their communities, have held discussions and are actually enacting what their local communities have asked them to do. So the government that say, 'We are listening to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples,' is the same government that are now trying to stop citizenship ceremonies being carried out by local governments that do not want to mark Australia Day on 26 January because they have listened to their communities and are aware that many of the members of their communities are in fact concerned about it and also want to celebrate Australia Day on a day that is not the day that Aboriginal people see as the day of dispossession and invasion.


This is a conversation that we need to have. It was kickstarted in 1938 and has been ignored for many years so this is a continuation of a conversation that should have been held by now. Unfortunately it hasn't been. The Australian Greens commended the City of Fremantle for re-engaging in this conversation and for listening to the requests made by local Aboriginal leaders to change the date and put on culturally inclusive celebrations on 28 January. While the City of Fremantle was the first council to take action on the increasingly louder calls to respect those for whom 26 January represents a tragedy, not a celebration, the change in Fremantle was a huge success. Other councils could see the benefits of this and so have been listening to their communities and have been moving towards a day that is more inclusive. The day in Fremantle, 28 January, was a huge success and the City of Fremantle was congratulated by its local community.


The City of Hobart was then the next to start a local conversation with its community about Australia Day in their city. In August this year the City of Yarra, which represents Melbourne's inner north-east, made the unanimous decision to change the way it marks 26 January following months of consultation with the local Aboriginal community and the broader Yarra community. The Turnbull government responded by revoking the council's power to hold citizenship ceremonies at any time of the year. The City of Darebin became the second council to be stripped of its powers to hold citizenship ceremonies after it decided that 26 January was not an appropriate day for an inclusive national celebration. And then it was told that it would no longer be able to hold citizenship ceremonies on 26 January. The Turnbull government's response was the same—again, a government that say they want to listen to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Unfortunately, they are obviously not using their ears to listen, because what was their response? They would stop those local governments that have consulted their communities, that have listened to Aboriginal communities and have responded by saying, 'Yes, we want to mark 26 January in a different way.'


The actions of these two councils helped spark a passionate national conversation about Australia Day, with people on both sides of the issues talking to the media and speaking out. They have also been talking about the role of councils in addressing issues of national importance. This is an issue of national importance and one that affects local communities. Obviously local communities have strong ideas and strong feelings about it and feel that they want to listen to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples who are saying, 'Please respect what we are saying. Please respect that this is not a day for celebration for us, that we want an inclusive celebration.'


And I should point out here that people are not objecting to celebrating Australia Day and celebrating this fabulous country. What they're objecting to is celebrating it on a day which Aboriginal people call and see as a day of mourning, a day of dispossession. I would like to note here the comment I started my contribution with, and that is: we have unresolved business, unfinished business, in this country. So not only have we not dealt with this unfinished business, but we add insult to injury by celebrating this great country on a day that constantly reminds Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples of their dispossession and of that unfinished business—of the fact that we are not a reconciled nation.


The councils that have had the courage to take these actions have shown leadership by acting on their convictions and having celebrations that ensure that their communities are more inclusive and respectful communities that truly want to be inclusive of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. It is unfortunate that they have been treated with contempt by this government and had their autonomy over citizenship ceremonies removed. Councils have shown leadership in moving away from celebrating our nation on 26 January. They should not be punished by having their ability to hold citizenship ceremonies taken away. As the mayor of Darebin council, Councillor Kim Le Cerf, said:


Darebin Council hosts large, lively and joyous citizenship ceremonies all year round and we very much wish to continue doing so, just not on January 26.


So here we have a council that celebrates citizenship that, as they said, holds joyous, lively citizenship ceremonies. They also want to celebrate this great country. They want to celebrate the inclusive nature of this country. But they don't want to do it on a day that hurts many of their community members. This decision disadvantages new residents waiting to become citizens, and it makes no sense, as Councillor Kim Le Cerf said. It does make no sense. It is a punitive, top-down attack on local government—you can see it as nothing else—by a government that has turned its back on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community, who have said: 'This is not the appropriate day to be celebrating Australia Day.'


In June this year the National General Assembly of Local Government passed a motion, 64 to 62, that urges all local councils to lobby the federal government on changing the date for Australia Day. In short, this means that just over half of Australia's councils are open to changing the date to be more inclusive. This is not just a few councils; this is over half of the local councils around Australia saying, 'We want to start talking about changing the date of Australia Day.' This is a significant motion to come out of the #NGA17 conference and shows a significant shift by local councils that are aligning themselves with the community view that Australia Day should be for everyone, including our first peoples.


The government needs to wake up to the changing discourse around Australia Day. They need to show some leadership and start leading the discussion on this. They are on the wrong side of history because history will show us that we will move Australia Day. We will! Get on board with this issue. Support Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. And it is not only Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities that are calling for this, of course; other members of the community are doing so. Members of the CALD community have also been speaking to me about this and saying that they feel uncomfortable celebrating this nation then; they are new citizens and they want to be part of an inclusive society but not at the cost to our first peoples.


The government needs to listen to the community. It needs to engage in the conversations that are happening around Australia about the date of Australia Day. That is our clear message to the government: listen to the community. Don't punish those local governments for listening to their community and showing the leadership that the government should be showing in terms of changing the date. Change the date so that we can all participate in celebrating this great nation. 


This great nation has been built on inclusiveness. It has been built, supposedly, on listening to all our citizens; yet they're shutting out our first peoples. They're shutting out the peoples whose land they took. They never negotiated a treaty despite having clear instructions to negotiate with the local peoples. They did not do that. They did not ensure that a treaty was negotiated with our first peoples, as, for example, occurred in New Zealand with the Waitangi treaty—which, I very strongly argue, has helped the Maori people in New Zealand address many of the issues that we are yet to address in this country. Having ignored those instructions, having taken this country and dispossessed our first peoples, having failed to negotiate a treaty or treaties and denied Aboriginal people sovereignty ever since, they continue to slight our first peoples by saying, 'We will celebrate this great nation on a day that causes you pain.' 


Not only that, we have failed to establish something like a truth and justice commission, as, for example, occurred in South Africa; failed to negotiate treaties; failed—and are failing—to address Aboriginal disadvantage; failed to ensure that our stolen generations have adequate reparations; failed to implement the groundbreaking recommendations from the Bringing them home report; and failed to implement the majority of the 339 recommendations from the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. At every stage where we needed to make sure we addressed these issues, this nation has failed. 


This government is yet to respond to the Referendum Council's report that was delivered to the government at the end of June. They have failed to address the 'Uluru statement from the heart', which is such a passionate statement and which so eloquently sends a clear message to Australia about our unfinished business. All the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples that came together at Uluru sent that clear, passionate, eloquent, strong statement to Australians and to this place about the need to address this unfinished business—for example, the need for a makarrata commission to start addressing issues around a treaty, the need for truth telling, and the need for a voice in the Constitution so that they can reflect, to this parliament, on matters of importance to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. 


The Turnbull government needs to refrain from interfering in local government's business and stopping them holding citizenship ceremonies. It's an outrageous infringement on the right of local councils and local government to hold those ceremonies and the people who wish to become citizens in their communities. 


I stand proudly here today to say: we want Australia Day to take place on a day that is not a day of mourning for our first peoples, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples around this country. We want a conversation in our communities around this country so that we can collectively decide on a date where we can celebrate this wonderful country and not marginalise and discriminate against the first nations of this place. We need to ensure that we have a conversation in this place and that we find a day we can truly celebrate this nation that does not cause so much hurt to so many people.

Senator McGRATH
 (Queensland—Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister) (12:40):  The government opposes the disallowance motion. The Australian Citizenship Ceremonies Code provides that citizenship ceremonies are non-commercial, apolitical, bipartisan and secular. They must not be used as forums for political, partisan or religious expression. In August, certain councils passed motions cancelling their Australia Day citizenship ceremonies to protest the practice of holding Australia Day on 26 January. They also endorsed the 'change the date' campaign and defied a warning from the Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection that their motion seriously breached the code. Assistant Minister Hawke responded by revoking the councils' authority to preside over citizenship ceremonies. Good!

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2017-10-19,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:20):  I'm a co-sponsor of this disallowance motion. Before I start, I would like to acknowledge the first peoples of our nation, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, and acknowledge that they are the first peoples of these lands and waters and that the Australian Greens recognise that 26 January is a day of mourning for many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. This land was never ceded. We acknowledge that the issues around sovereignty and treaty have never been dealt with in this country, and it is high time that we as a nation acknowledge these issues, that the land was not ceded and that we have a great deal of unfinished business.


The Greens' policy very strongly supports Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, and we strongly support Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples who are calling for a change to the date of Australia Day. Many Aboriginal people see 26 January, which is currently marked as Australia Day, as in fact Invasion Day. The first Day of Mourning held by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples was on 26 January 1938. That was the official day. That was the 150th anniversary, for them, of British invasion. Interestingly, it was only three years earlier that all Australian states and territories commenced using the name Australia Day to mark 26 January, and it was not until 1994 that there was consistently a public holiday on that date.


We will never be truly reconciled as a nation while we put Australia Day on a date that is seen as a day of dispossession and invasion and that Aboriginal people officially claim as a day of mourning. As I said, this date was first marked officially for the Aboriginal community in 1938. In other words, for all those people who think that there is just a group of people that are suddenly trying to change the date because it's fashionable, let me tell you that this has long been marked as a day of invasion for many, many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.


The Turnbull government first threatened to ban citizenship ceremonies in Fremantle, in my home state, at the end of last year, when the City of Fremantle rekickstarted an important conversation about cultural inclusivity. This is the same Turnbull government that say that they want to listen to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. They've claimed with their heart on their sleeve several times that they are committed to listening to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and that they need to follow their lead. Well, I'm sorry; that is not worth the paper it is written on when you consider their response to councils and local government authorities who have listened to their communities, have held discussions and are actually enacting what their local communities have asked them to do. So the government that say, 'We are listening to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples,' is the same government that are now trying to stop citizenship ceremonies being carried out by local governments that do not want to mark Australia Day on 26 January because they have listened to their communities and are aware that many of the members of their communities are in fact concerned about it and also want to celebrate Australia Day on a day that is not the day that Aboriginal people see as the day of dispossession and invasion.


This is a conversation that we need to have. It was kickstarted in 1938 and has been ignored for many years so this is a continuation of a conversation that should have been held by now. Unfortunately it hasn't been. The Australian Greens commended the City of Fremantle for re-engaging in this conversation and for listening to the requests made by local Aboriginal leaders to change the date and put on culturally inclusive celebrations on 28 January. While the City of Fremantle was the first council to take action on the increasingly louder calls to respect those for whom 26 January represents a tragedy, not a celebration, the change in Fremantle was a huge success. Other councils could see the benefits of this and so have been listening to their communities and have been moving towards a day that is more inclusive. The day in Fremantle, 28 January, was a huge success and the City of Fremantle was congratulated by its local community.


The City of Hobart was then the next to start a local conversation with its community about Australia Day in their city. In August this year the City of Yarra, which represents Melbourne's inner north-east, made the unanimous decision to change the way it marks 26 January following months of consultation with the local Aboriginal community and the broader Yarra community. The Turnbull government responded by revoking the council's power to hold citizenship ceremonies at any time of the year. The City of Darebin became the second council to be stripped of its powers to hold citizenship ceremonies after it decided that 26 January was not an appropriate day for an inclusive national celebration. And then it was told that it would no longer be able to hold citizenship ceremonies on 26 January. The Turnbull government's response was the same—again, a government that say they want to listen to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Unfortunately, they are obviously not using their ears to listen, because what was their response? They would stop those local governments that have consulted their communities, that have listened to Aboriginal communities and have responded by saying, 'Yes, we want to mark 26 January in a different way.'


The actions of these two councils helped spark a passionate national conversation about Australia Day, with people on both sides of the issues talking to the media and speaking out. They have also been talking about the role of councils in addressing issues of national importance. This is an issue of national importance and one that affects local communities. Obviously local communities have strong ideas and strong feelings about it and feel that they want to listen to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples who are saying, 'Please respect what we are saying. Please respect that this is not a day for celebration for us, that we want an inclusive celebration.'


And I should point out here that people are not objecting to celebrating Australia Day and celebrating this fabulous country. What they're objecting to is celebrating it on a day which Aboriginal people call and see as a day of mourning, a day of dispossession. I would like to note here the comment I started my contribution with, and that is: we have unresolved business, unfinished business, in this country. So not only have we not dealt with this unfinished business, but we add insult to injury by celebrating this great country on a day that constantly reminds Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples of their dispossession and of that unfinished business—of the fact that we are not a reconciled nation.


The councils that have had the courage to take these actions have shown leadership by acting on their convictions and having celebrations that ensure that their communities are more inclusive and respectful communities that truly want to be inclusive of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. It is unfortunate that they have been treated with contempt by this government and had their autonomy over citizenship ceremonies removed. Councils have shown leadership in moving away from celebrating our nation on 26 January. They should not be punished by having their ability to hold citizenship ceremonies taken away. As the mayor of Darebin council, Councillor Kim Le Cerf, said:


Darebin Council hosts large, lively and joyous citizenship ceremonies all year round and we very much wish to continue doing so, just not on January 26.


So here we have a council that celebrates citizenship that, as they said, holds joyous, lively citizenship ceremonies. They also want to celebrate this great country. They want to celebrate the inclusive nature of this country. But they don't want to do it on a day that hurts many of their community members. This decision disadvantages new residents waiting to become citizens, and it makes no sense, as Councillor Kim Le Cerf said. It does make no sense. It is a punitive, top-down attack on local government—you can see it as nothing else—by a government that has turned its back on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community, who have said: 'This is not the appropriate day to be celebrating Australia Day.'

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (12:48):  Dumping, the sale of products on the Australian market below their normal price on a foreign exporter's home market is a major threat to manufacturers in this country. Dumped products are often inferior in quality to local products, and in some cases their export to Australia has the potential to undermine strategically vital industries such as steelmaking and construction.


Labor fully supports the Customs Amendment (Anti-Dumping Measures) Bill 2017, which closes a loophole that allows overseas exporters to evade Australia's antidumping regime. At present, it is possible for exporters who have had dumping duties imposed to cease exporting or export low volumes at high prices before applying for a review of antidumping measures imposed on them. The 12-month interruption of normal export behaviour makes it difficult for the Anti-Dumping Commission to determine the appropriate export price, and dumping duties can be revised to zero per cent. This effectively clears the slate for the foreign exporter, allowing a resumption of dumping without penalty or restriction for up to 18 months.


This bill was unanimously supported by industry stakeholders who made submissions to the inquiry by the Senate Economics Committee. They included BlueScope Steel, the Manufacturers' Trade Alliance, the Australian Steel Institute and unions with members in manufacturing and construction: the AMWU, the AWU and the CFMEU. BlueScope's submission explained that they have witnessed a surge in the number of requests by Chinese and Taiwanese steel exporters for reviews of antidumping measures. BlueScope said:


It became obvious that a new strategy had been employed by a large number of these exporters to exploit a 'gap' …


The strategy was to withdraw from the Australian market for a year and then request a review with a view to securing a reduced duty. BlueScope surmised:


The outcome of such a strategy was to effectively guarantee a new interim anti-dumping duty of 0%.


The BlueScope submission stated that, in a three-month period, nine of 11 requests for a review of antidumping measures were made by foreign exporters who had ceased exporting to Australia for the 12-month period after duties had been imposed. All these exporters had their interim antidumping duty reduced to zero. As a result, they resumed exporting to Australia immediately.


Within three months of the minister's ruling, exports from China had increased by 300 per cent, with a price drop of 15 per cent. The exporters were therefore able to resume dumping products on the Australian market for 18 months. That is because affected local industries cannot apply for a review until a 12-month interval has passed, and it takes up to six months for a review to be completed.


This bill aims to eliminate this evasive tactic by foreign exporters. It sets out new methodologies to be used by the Anti-Dumping Commission in determining an export price when no goods have been exported or goods have been exported at low volumes. The changes are administrative. There is no substantial alteration to existing policy. The new review process will, however, allow the Anti-Dumping Commission to be more vigilant in blocking unfair trade practices that harm Australian industry. Labor is pleased that the government has heeded the concerns of affected local industries and their employees. We will therefore wholeheartedly support this bill.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",NXT,2017-10-19,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (12:52):  I too, on behalf of my colleagues, support the Customs Amendment (Anti-Dumping Measures) Bill 2017. This bill will improve our antidumping regime, but for too long our antidumping regime has been too weak in this country. We have not ensured that Australian industry can compete on a level playing field with those countries that dump goods on our shores. The dumping and, in effect, foreign government subsidisation of goods exported to Australia hurt Australian manufacturers, producers and jobs, and we must do everything we can to stop it.


There are opportunistic and predatory exporters who dump such goods and who look for weak international targets that don't enforce their WTO rights. For too long, Australia has been seen as a soft target for those who want to dump goods on our shores. We've been seen as a soft touch for predatory practices and, in effect, an easy dumping ground for those who seek to bend and break WTO rules. So I support this bill.


The administrative measures that Senator Collins referred to are welcome. The government is doing the right thing in terms of these measures, but there are other things that need to be done, and I want to put that on the public record. Initiating and prosecuting an antidumping claim can be arduous and expensive. That's why there ought to be an independent advocacy and advisory service, similar to the previous International Trade Remedies Advisory Service, to assist those small and medium enterprises to determine whether a prima facie case of dumping and countervailing subsidies or duty circumvention exists and to help them prepare those applications.


There was a case I was involved in some time ago, advocating for a small Australian business with about 30 employees. They were quoted a million dollars in legal fees to run an antidumping case. That's why we need to have that service to help those small manufacturers and those small and medium enterprises to prepare these complex applications.


The current application process to complain about dumping has been criticised as extremely complex, expensive and bureaucratic by those in industry that I have spoken to. We need to adopt a simplified application process for SMEs. That is essential. The European Commission's approach would still satisfy the need to be WTO compliant but would reduce the burden on the Australian industry applicant to ensure that we don't have extraneous and irrelevant information, that we get to the core of the issues in terms of a dumping claim. 


The shift to a European Commission inquisitorial style process would see the commissioner drawing out the relevant merits of the case without placing a blanket burden on Australian businesses. That is why we need to do that. We need to make is simpler for Australian businesses because they're up against these companies that dump these goods. Sometimes it costs them an absolute fortune in terms of legal fees. But what it costs them in terms of the impact it has on their businesses can be disastrous. We need to have an increased focus on countervailable subsidy investigations, and the Anti-Dumping Commission needs the resources to do that. As Australia has become more effective in investigating the dumping of imported goods causing material injury to Australian producers, the role of countervailable subsidies has continued to grow; and that's one way of circumventing the antidumping regimes.


Consistent with the recommendations of the 2012 Brumby review into antidumping arrangements, the Anti-Dumping Commissioner needs to further address the shortage of staff with appropriate skill sets to execute his functions. The increased use of independent non-government experts, especially during exporter verification visits, needs to be implemented as a matter of urgency; and the power to collect any shortfall in duty payable needs to be addressed immediately. The current optional duty assessment process encourages exporters and importers to continue to trade in dumped goods—in some cases, by a greater magnitude of dumping—with no risk of back-capture of underpaid duties. These are the issues we need to deal with. This bill is welcome but we need to go much further. We can be WTO compliant but ensure Australian industry has a fighting chance—and, with that, save many thousands of Australian jobs.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2017-10-19,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (12:57):  Businesses fail. New businesses start up. Customers end up getting more of what they want. And workers, whose wages never prosper in a failing business, end up working in better jobs, more often than not. It's called free market capitalism. It's not perfect but there's nothing better. And it's the proven recipe for improving the welfare of Australians. Governments should be the guardians of free market capitalism. So when a failing business complains to government that competitors are selling products at a cheaper price, the government response that best serves the Australian people is to do nothing. For instance, suppose an Australian business facing competition can't cut its costs and the workers involved won't accept a lower wage to keep the business afloat—presumably because they think they can get a better-paying job else where. In this case, the business should close and those workers should take those better-paying jobs they think are available elsewhere. This is in the interests of both workers and consumers.


However, this government is not a guardian of capitalism and is not looking after the welfare of Australians. It responds to complaints by failing businesses by putting up prices for Australians. That is what the bill before us today, the Customs Amendment (Anti-Dumping Measures) Bill 2017, seeks to do. It gives the minister more options to increase tariffs under antidumping law. Under antidumping law, the minister imposes tariffs on certain goods from certain importers. The lower the importer's prices in Australia compared to the country of origin, after accounting for transport costs, the greater the rate of tariff imposed. This is a ridiculous approach. Competition in Australia might be greater than in the country of origin such that lower prices in Australia is what we would expect and want. To calculate the tariff, the minister first declares the importer's price in Australia to be the observed price during a particular reference period or, if the information on this price is insufficient, whatever price the minister chooses. With this bill the government wants to change this arrangement. The bill would allow the minister in certain circumstances to deem the importer's price in Australia to be different from the observed price. So, essentially, if there is no case for claiming that dumping is occurring, the minister can invent a case.


This is a step from the ridiculous to the outrageous. If an importer's prices in Australia are observable, the minister should not be allowed to make up different, lower prices just so the minister can sustain the victim complex of those who bleat about dumping to maximise the tariff and to drive up prices.


There are few Liberal senators in the chamber at the moment, but most will be listening on their televisions in their offices nearby. I ask them: when will you stop in this place the daily flow of socialist, rather than capitalist, legislation slowly squeezing the prosperity out of this country? If it is not soon, comrades, we may as well rename the country the Democratic People's Republic of Australia.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2017-10-19,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (12:48):  Dumping, the sale of products on the Australian market below their normal price on a foreign exporter's home market is a major threat to manufacturers in this country. Dumped products are often inferior in quality to local products, and in some cases their export to Australia has the potential to undermine strategically vital industries such as steelmaking and construction.


Labor fully supports the Customs Amendment (Anti-Dumping Measures) Bill 2017, which closes a loophole that allows overseas exporters to evade Australia's antidumping regime. At present, it is possible for exporters who have had dumping duties imposed to cease exporting or export low volumes at high prices before applying for a review of antidumping measures imposed on them. The 12-month interruption of normal export behaviour makes it difficult for the Anti-Dumping Commission to determine the appropriate export price, and dumping duties can be revised to zero per cent. This effectively clears the slate for the foreign exporter, allowing a resumption of dumping without penalty or restriction for up to 18 months.


This bill was unanimously supported by industry stakeholders who made submissions to the inquiry by the Senate Economics Committee. They included BlueScope Steel, the Manufacturers' Trade Alliance, the Australian Steel Institute and unions with members in manufacturing and construction: the AMWU, the AWU and the CFMEU. BlueScope's submission explained that they have witnessed a surge in the number of requests by Chinese and Taiwanese steel exporters for reviews of antidumping measures. BlueScope said:


It became obvious that a new strategy had been employed by a large number of these exporters to exploit a 'gap' …


The strategy was to withdraw from the Australian market for a year and then request a review with a view to securing a reduced duty. BlueScope surmised:


The outcome of such a strategy was to effectively guarantee a new interim anti-dumping duty of 0%.


The BlueScope submission stated that, in a three-month period, nine of 11 requests for a review of antidumping measures were made by foreign exporters who had ceased exporting to Australia for the 12-month period after duties had been imposed. All these exporters had their interim antidumping duty reduced to zero. As a result, they resumed exporting to Australia immediately.


Within three months of the minister's ruling, exports from China had increased by 300 per cent, with a price drop of 15 per cent. The exporters were therefore able to resume dumping products on the Australian market for 18 months. That is because affected local industries cannot apply for a review until a 12-month interval has passed, and it takes up to six months for a review to be completed.


This bill aims to eliminate this evasive tactic by foreign exporters. It sets out new methodologies to be used by the Anti-Dumping Commission in determining an export price when no goods have been exported or goods have been exported at low volumes. The changes are administrative. There is no substantial alteration to existing policy. The new review process will, however, allow the Anti-Dumping Commission to be more vigilant in blocking unfair trade practices that harm Australian industry. Labor is pleased that the government has heeded the concerns of affected local industries and their employees. We will therefore wholeheartedly support this bill.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (12:52):  I too, on behalf of my colleagues, support the Customs Amendment (Anti-Dumping Measures) Bill 2017. This bill will improve our antidumping regime, but for too long our antidumping regime has been too weak in this country. We have not ensured that Australian industry can compete on a level playing field with those countries that dump goods on our shores. The dumping and, in effect, foreign government subsidisation of goods exported to Australia hurt Australian manufacturers, producers and jobs, and we must do everything we can to stop it.


There are opportunistic and predatory exporters who dump such goods and who look for weak international targets that don't enforce their WTO rights. For too long, Australia has been seen as a soft target for those who want to dump goods on our shores. We've been seen as a soft touch for predatory practices and, in effect, an easy dumping ground for those who seek to bend and break WTO rules. So I support this bill.


The administrative measures that Senator Collins referred to are welcome. The government is doing the right thing in terms of these measures, but there are other things that need to be done, and I want to put that on the public record. Initiating and prosecuting an antidumping claim can be arduous and expensive. That's why there ought to be an independent advocacy and advisory service, similar to the previous International Trade Remedies Advisory Service, to assist those small and medium enterprises to determine whether a prima facie case of dumping and countervailing subsidies or duty circumvention exists and to help them prepare those applications.


There was a case I was involved in some time ago, advocating for a small Australian business with about 30 employees. They were quoted a million dollars in legal fees to run an antidumping case. That's why we need to have that service to help those small manufacturers and those small and medium enterprises to prepare these complex applications.


The current application process to complain about dumping has been criticised as extremely complex, expensive and bureaucratic by those in industry that I have spoken to. We need to adopt a simplified application process for SMEs. That is essential. The European Commission's approach would still satisfy the need to be WTO compliant but would reduce the burden on the Australian industry applicant to ensure that we don't have extraneous and irrelevant information, that we get to the core of the issues in terms of a dumping claim. 


The shift to a European Commission inquisitorial style process would see the commissioner drawing out the relevant merits of the case without placing a blanket burden on Australian businesses. That is why we need to do that. We need to make is simpler for Australian businesses because they're up against these companies that dump these goods. Sometimes it costs them an absolute fortune in terms of legal fees. But what it costs them in terms of the impact it has on their businesses can be disastrous. We need to have an increased focus on countervailable subsidy investigations, and the Anti-Dumping Commission needs the resources to do that. As Australia has become more effective in investigating the dumping of imported goods causing material injury to Australian producers, the role of countervailable subsidies has continued to grow; and that's one way of circumventing the antidumping regimes.


Consistent with the recommendations of the 2012 Brumby review into antidumping arrangements, the Anti-Dumping Commissioner needs to further address the shortage of staff with appropriate skill sets to execute his functions. The increased use of independent non-government experts, especially during exporter verification visits, needs to be implemented as a matter of urgency; and the power to collect any shortfall in duty payable needs to be addressed immediately. The current optional duty assessment process encourages exporters and importers to continue to trade in dumped goods—in some cases, by a greater magnitude of dumping—with no risk of back-capture of underpaid duties. These are the issues we need to deal with. This bill is welcome but we need to go much further. We can be WTO compliant but ensure Australian industry has a fighting chance—and, with that, save many thousands of Australian jobs.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2017-10-19,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (12:57):  Businesses fail. New businesses start up. Customers end up getting more of what they want. And workers, whose wages never prosper in a failing business, end up working in better jobs, more often than not. It's called free market capitalism. It's not perfect but there's nothing better. And it's the proven recipe for improving the welfare of Australians. Governments should be the guardians of free market capitalism. So when a failing business complains to government that competitors are selling products at a cheaper price, the government response that best serves the Australian people is to do nothing. For instance, suppose an Australian business facing competition can't cut its costs and the workers involved won't accept a lower wage to keep the business afloat—presumably because they think they can get a better-paying job else where. In this case, the business should close and those workers should take those better-paying jobs they think are available elsewhere. This is in the interests of both workers and consumers.


However, this government is not a guardian of capitalism and is not looking after the welfare of Australians. It responds to complaints by failing businesses by putting up prices for Australians. That is what the bill before us today, the Customs Amendment (Anti-Dumping Measures) Bill 2017, seeks to do. It gives the minister more options to increase tariffs under antidumping law. Under antidumping law, the minister imposes tariffs on certain goods from certain importers. The lower the importer's prices in Australia compared to the country of origin, after accounting for transport costs, the greater the rate of tariff imposed. This is a ridiculous approach. Competition in Australia might be greater than in the country of origin such that lower prices in Australia is what we would expect and want. To calculate the tariff, the minister first declares the importer's price in Australia to be the observed price during a particular reference period or, if the information on this price is insufficient, whatever price the minister chooses. With this bill the government wants to change this arrangement. The bill would allow the minister in certain circumstances to deem the importer's price in Australia to be different from the observed price. So, essentially, if there is no case for claiming that dumping is occurring, the minister can invent a case.


This is a step from the ridiculous to the outrageous. If an importer's prices in Australia are observable, the minister should not be allowed to make up different, lower prices just so the minister can sustain the victim complex of those who bleat about dumping to maximise the tariff and to drive up prices.


There are few Liberal senators in the chamber at the moment, but most will be listening on their televisions in their offices nearby. I ask them: when will you stop in this place the daily flow of socialist, rather than capitalist, legislation slowly squeezing the prosperity out of this country? If it is not soon, comrades, we may as well rename the country the Democratic People's Republic of Australia.

Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (15:03):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister representing the Prime Minister (Senator Brandis) to questions without notice asked by Senator Collins and Senator Polley today relating to energy.


I remember so clearly standing exactly here a few months ago when we had a range of questions about the Finkel review, and that there was great exhortation across the chamber that we needed to work together—that we needed to work together on an effective policy—and there was the praise given to the recommendations of the Finkel review. Ministers of the government, doing the same kind of marketing that they're doing now for this next plan that they're proposing, were saying how strong Finkel and the recommendations around renewable energy were. They were saying they were going to work together on prices. Here we have another process now.


We should've known we'd be having this discussion this week, because last week The Australian actually told us what the government was going to do. The Australian and, in fact, my own local newspaper, the Courier-Mail had as much detail as we have now. We heard what the government was going to do. Headlines said they were no longer going to be looking at supporting renewable energy. In fact, they were saying they'd moved away from many of the recommendations of the Finkel review.


We had the warning that the government was going to be doing this. For most policy now, if we can just get hold of a Murdoch press a couple of days earlier, we'll have what's going to be done by the government. We had that warning, and then we had to go through the process because it had to go to the cabinet and it had to go to the party room. Then Senator Brandis, in his answers this week, told us about what happened in the party room and about how excited they were in the party room about this new policy. But then the document was released. We now have the eight pages which are, in fact, all we have to look at on what is going to be this Holy Grail of energy policy into the future. What we don't have is any detail. We don't have modelling—in fact, we very rarely have modelling, but we live in hope that this time we will get some modelling that gives detail to the would-be guarantees that the government has given to the community about this new policy.


In his normal, gracious way, today the leader of the Senate talked about the need for us to work together. In his normal, gracious way he talked about U-turns from the Labor Party and backsliding from the Labor Party and desperation from the Labor Party. This is, as usual, the way the government actually wants to seek to work together. Clearly, we have looked at the eight pages in detail, we have studied the Courier-Mail to see exactly what the government was going to do, and now we are asking quite direct and quite simple questions like, 'How is the policy expected to work?'


It's good to have goals. In fact, we often have goals and we can actually share those goals, because we do want the community to have an effective energy policy. We listen to the community, and we know it's an issue of importance to them. We've heard that the government is offering guarantees, and we've also heard that they're working very, very hard to fix the energy issues in Australia. We acknowledge that. We'd just like to know how it's going to work so that we will have information that our people can look at so we can make an informed decision about engaging in future energy policy. It's not enough just to say, 'You should get onboard, because this is what we want to do,' but that's exactly what the Treasurer has been saying in his marketing campaign to make sure that this eight-page document becomes the future energy policy for our country. He's saying he wants to make it so secure that the awful prospect of a change of government would not be able to wind back what they are now putting into place.


We aren't talking about U-turns. We aren't talking about backsliding. What we're talking about is getting some information, some facts, some details and some modelling about how we can turn an eight-page concept paper into an effective energy policy about which the whole of the community can feel secure and with which we can look at ways that we can work together. To just say what you're working hard on is not a policy. (Time expired)

"Reynolds, Sen Linda",LP,2017-10-19,"



Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia) (15:09):  I too rise to take note of the Attorney-General's answer this afternoon. I start by heartily congratulating both the Prime Minister and our outstanding Minister for the Environment and Energy, Josh Frydenberg. They have done an extraordinary job with this policy. It is absolutely based on science and expertise. I also congratulate the Energy Security Board for their advice on this matter. What gives me great heart is knowing that we're going in the right direction. The first person who came out, probably before even reading the document, was the Leader of the Greens. When he's almost frothing at the mouth and having a heart attack about a policy, then you know you're going in the right direction. It also seems to have caught those opposite flat-footed. Instead of arguing against any of the measures that the government has announced, they're already trying to drill into the detail. They fail to acknowledge that a policy is only a piece of paper. So many policies of those opposite have been broken and never implemented. What this is is a very clear plan for reform of the energy market. 


What makes me so proud of this document and to be sitting on this side of the chamber as part of a government that's initiating this plan, is that it is affordable and reliable and still meets an emissions guarantee. I am so proud that this is all based on what Australians need. The average Australian wants, demands and expects in the 21st century that they can have reliable and affordable power. Needless to say, their employers, or prospective employers, will actually be able to afford to operate here, to manufacture, to keep the lights on and to keep their plants and machinery operating. Again I say how proud I am of this government.


The details will be worked out and, in fact, are being worked out. Any good policy needs at the start to have very clear objectives and outcomes: things about which you can nail your colours to the mast and say, 'This is what we are going to achieve.' It is wonderful. What I particularly love about this is that it embraces new technologies. It implements new technologies that are based on science, and not some extreme green theology. Also, what is very sensible about this is that it is based on dispatchable power. Guess what? As great as they are, things such as solar and wind are variable. When the sun doesn't shine and the wind doesn't blow, the consequences are devastating, as South Australia has seen. The focus on using the best technologies we have to provide and guarantee dispatchable power when every Australian needs it at an affordable cost is critically important. We're doing this all without a clean energy target and with no extension of the RET. It is absolutely fabulous. It is completely focused on this country and not some ideological theology that would see us back in the dark ages where we can't even turn the lights on, as South Australia has seen, and with absolutely scant or no regard at all to the economy and to jobs.


We have a plan. It now has to be worked through COAG, but we have a plan that is good for all Australians because it provides affordable and reliable electricity and provides an emissions guarantee so we can still meet our emissions targets. We're doing it based on science and on what Australians need and are still meeting our targets. We're also still transitioning, over time and in a sensible way, to renewable technologies. We have a plan. I hope those opposite come on board, but today I've heard there is no alternative. In the absence of those opposite not having an alternative at all for this policy, I really hope that, in the national interest, they do come on board with this policy and work with the government and the state Labor leaders, to encourage them to come on board, because this is in the interest of every single Australian.

"McAllister, Sen Jenny",ALP,2017-10-19,"



Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:14):  I think senators may know about the Rorschach ink-blot test—the psychological test, very popular in the sixties, where you show the respondent a blot of ink and they tell the psychiatrist or the psychologist what they see there. It is the subject of a very funny joke with a good punchline, but it's a little bit too risque for the chamber so I'm not going to repeat it. But the point of the joke is that, with the Rorschach ink-blot test, you can pretty much look at it and see anything you like, and I'm starting to think that this eight-page policy released by the coalition is a little bit like the ink blot and, much like the ink-blot test, a lot of the reactions to this National Energy Guarantee tell us as much about the respondents' energy-policy id as they do about the plan itself.


The first issue, I suppose, is whether or not people viewing these eight pages consider that they contain any sort of carbon price. The briefing note said, 'Some electricity retailers will not be able to meet the required emissions profile, while others will overachieve, and therefore a secondary exchange'—which sounds a little bit like an emissions trading market—'will occur between retailers to balance their portfolios.' So that is what is in the eight-page glossy.


Energy minister Frydenberg was asked about this: 'Is it like a carbon tax?' He said: 'Two letters: N O.' Asked the same question, the CEO of the Australian Energy Council, Matthew Warren, answered, 'Of course.' David Uren, a commentator in The Australian newspaper and an economist, says:


The proposed emissions guarantee is the carbon tax you get when you ask a regulator to design one …


So there is quite a lot of disagreement from respondents when they look at that particular ink blot.


Will there be price reductions? Senator Brandis has been extremely keen in this chamber to reassure everybody that there will be a price decrease and that that will be in the order of $115 a year per household—a big call, because that's not actually what nearly anybody else is willing to say. Asked about the same question, Dr Schott, who Mr Brandis has been so keen to rely on, said:


… I don't think anybody can guarantee a price reduction …


Mr Pierce, Chair of the AEMC, when asked about it, said: 'Well, there's a range of reductions you might see. It really depends on the scenario that you model.' The Prime Minister, according to newspaper reports, has repeatedly refused to guarantee a price reduction. I think that what he has told the other place is that savings are 'likely'. 'Likely'? He's refusing to guarantee any sort of price reduction until the regulators conduct more modelling. Mr Morrison, of course, always fierce, defends the $115 annual savings estimate. He's on the same page as Mr Brandis. But what you can see is a very wide range of views, and they seem to depend a great deal on just how keen you are to defend the government's record, as opposed to how keen you might be to engage with the actual facts that are on the table.


Is this a plan for coal or is it a plan for renewables? Senator Reynolds said that it will introduce new technologies based on science, and she went on in her later remarks to say that they'll be transitioning in a sensible way to renewables. The renewables sector says that this requires us to place an artificial cap on the amount of renewables that would come into the system, while Mr Christensen from the National Party says that the test of this is that the NEG will only work if it enables investment in coal-fired power, preferably in North Queensland, and he calls on the government to directly invest, to provide public funds, to build a new coal-fired power station.


How can there be this much confusion? How can so many respondents look at the same ink blot and come up with such different answers? The truth is: it's because this is a half-baked plan. There is no detail. And, as my colleagues in this place have pointed out repeatedly, eight pages is no real substitute for an actual policy. Dr Finkel produced 200 pages. When Labor introduced our carbon pricing approach, we had an 800-page analysis. I had the good fortune to work in part on the Garnaut review from a state government perspective—only a little bit—and it was thousands of pages. This isn't a policy. It's a joke.

"Brockman, Sen Slade",LP,2017-10-19,"



Senator BROCKMAN
 (Western Australia) (15:19):  I also rise to take note of answers given by the Attorney-General to questions asked during question time today. I'm not sure I have an energy policy id, but I'll try and find it later. The Labor Party are playing their usual political games in this place and in this policy space because they're incapable of delivering anything else or anything that looks like a policy. The National Energy Guarantee is designed to ensure that Australian families and businesses have access to reliable and affordable electricity whilst meeting our international commitments. For too long, governments, federal and state, have seen fit to meddle in the Australian energy market, picking winners through a vast regime of subsidies and regulation. The coalition's National Energy Guarantee brings to an end the government subsidies for energy, bringing us back to a technologically neutral energy policy which will allow energy providers to invest in the reliable base-load capacity that Australians need whilst meeting those important international commitments.


There was an interjection during the excellent contribution of Senator Reynolds that the government should be investing in batteries. No, actually—the government should never be investing in batteries or any particular technology. What we should do is have a technologically neutral policy, which we have for the first time in a long time. This policy will provide power generators with the certainty they require to invest in the latest technology, be it batteries or the next generation of low-emission, high-efficiency coal—or who knows? Perhaps one day Australia will see investment in fourth-generation nuclear. Thorium power inches closer to commercialisation. It will no longer find itself at an unreasonable competitive disadvantage in the future, and we may see investment in that area. Similarly, we may see a breakthrough in fusion technology. Who knows what the future will hold in 10 or 15 years? That is why we need a completely technologically neutral policy. We don't want to pick winners. We need to let the energy market make those decisions on a source of supply whilst maintaining reliability. We can't have the blackouts. These cutting-edge low-emissions technologies can produce cheap, reliable energy for Australia for generations to come. It is not acceptable that a country as prosperous and energy-rich as Australia faces a second summer in a row of potential brownouts, blackouts and energy rationing in South Australia and across the eastern seaboard. Reliable and cheap energy is the cornerstone of Australia's economy, and virtually every sector is completely dependent on the provision of this as a basic part of operating.


Those opposite us have done nothing in this space. We saw the Leader of the Opposition out yesterday playing games again, manipulating numbers to suit his own agenda while offering no solutions whatsoever. It's clear that Labor has no plan for energy. Senators opposite prefer to sit on their hands as their colleagues in South Australia and Victoria take a wrecking ball to energy infrastructure, with no plan to address the shortfall in base-load capacity. Those opposite bemoan the demise of the Australian manufacturing sector, once a pillar of our economy. Yet how can we have a manufacturing sector unless we can deliver reliable and affordable electricity? When it comes to energy security, Labor simply cannot be trusted. Whilst senators opposite will no doubt jump up and down bemoaning the end of the grandiose regime of renewable energy subsidies that have strangled our energy sector, I remind them of the words of the Chief Scientist, Alan Finkel, who this week described our plan as 'a credible mechanism'. That's what the sector needs. It needs credibility, it needs security of policy and it needs an end to the game playing. Don't just take Dr Finkel's word for it when it comes to subsidies; perhaps also listen to the words of our colleague Senator Di Natale, who said: 'It's cheaper to build wind power than to build coal-fired power.' If this is true then there's no reason not to end the subsidies.


Only the coalition government has a plan to ensure Australians have access to reliable and affordable electricity while continuing to meet our international obligations for emission reductions. Labor have no plan for reliable energy. They refuse to prioritise affordability and reliability, ignoring the advice of energy industry experts. They are addicted to the reckless renewable energy targets that would drive up prices and undermine reliability. (Time expired)

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2017-10-19,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (15:24):  I also rise to take note of answers from Senator Brandis on the government's National Energy Guarantee.


What a display we saw today! The question from Senator Collins couldn't have been a simpler question to Senator Brandis. I just want to go to what the question was, because it was a very good one from Senator Collins. What she asked was:


Given electricity retailers will trade to meet required emissions targets, can the minister confirm the policy effectively imposes a price on carbon?


Of course, Senator Brandis used a quote from one individual—Mr John Pierce, the Chair of the AEMC—to try to put together an answer. This was cherry-picking of the highest order as only Senator Brandis can. But when faced with alternative opinions from Mr Matthew Warren, Chief Executive of the Australian Energy Council, and Mr Hugh Grossman, Executive Director of RepuTex, Senator Brandis went to water. All he could do was attack the Labor Party; all he could do was make the most ludicrous accusations and feign ignorance of the comments from Mr Warren and Mr Grossman.


Of course, we on this side are very used to that, as Senator Brandis often says he's unaware of comments made when they don't suit his policy positions. As always with Senator Brandis, there was so much bravado and so little basis to his arguments. It was a sad display! Senator Brandis kept trying to make the claim that the Labor Party doesn't have an energy policy. Senator Brandis had the gall to come into this place and claim that the party that has led the debate on energy for over a decade doesn't have a policy. Senator Brandis couldn't be further from the truth.


For almost 10 years, the opposition has led this debate. Senator Brandis, Mr Turnbull, Mr Abbott and others in the government have been running around fighting one another, fighting with the science and fighting with the economics as they search for a way to reintroduce a price on carbon in Australia. While they might all be in agreement up here in Canberra that this new policy—this eight-page concept—is a winner, I want to refer the Senate to comments from the Tasmanian Liberal government's newly-minted energy minister, Mr Guy Barnett. Some of us here in the Senate would be familiar with Mr Barnett; he graced this chamber some years ago.


Obviously, Mr Barnett is now a member of the Tasmanian parliament, and he is their new Minister for Energy. Mr Barnett made an interesting start, to say the least. Yesterday, Mr Barnett issued a statement where he stated unequivocally:


We aren't yet convinced by what we have heard and we need further detail on the Federal Government's plan.


I have to say, he was probably being very generous to suggest it was actually a 'plan'! But he said, 'we need further detail on the federal government's plan.' This is one of the two state Liberal energy ministers in the country who says he is not convinced and that his government is not convinced. Mr Barnett set three criteria the federal government needs to satisfy before receiving the government's support:


Any federal energy policy needs to meet those aims for Tasmania before receiving our support.


And what are those aims?


That means lower prices, energy security and developing more renewable energy generation in Tasmania.


And what does the National Energy Guarantee do for Tasmania? Lower prices? Well, supposedly. Maybe. No guarantees, because no modelling has been done. The NEG will supposedly save households $115 a year from 2020. There are still no guarantees.


Tasmanians remember the false promise from Senator Brandis, from Mr Abbott and those three amigos, who said that households would save $550 a year from the abolition of the Clean Energy Future Package. (Time expired)

That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



The bill provides a broad package of measures which strengthen the laws that safeguard children in Australia from sexual abuse.


The Crimes Legislation Amendment (Sexual Crimes against Children and Community Protection Measures) Bill 2017 complements recently legislated measures that stop convicted child sex offenders from travelling overseas to commit criminal acts against children.


The bill addresses all aspects of child sex offending. It targets inadequacies in the criminal justice system that result in outcomes that do not sufficiently punish, deter and rehabilitate offenders. It also introduces new offences directed at the use of the internet for the sexual abuse of children.




Strengthening the criminal framework throughout the offence cycle 



The Government is increasingly concerned about the manifestly inadequate sentences which do not sufficiently reflect the harm suffered by victims of child sex abuse or protect the community from the risk of future harm. Such sentences do not recognise that these crimes increase the demand for child abuse material.


Since 2012, less than two thirds of Commonwealth child sex offenders have received a term of imprisonment on conviction. This is a staggering 269 child sex offenders convicted of a Commonwealth crime released directly back into the community over the past five years. Of those who were imprisoned, the most common sentence length was 18 months and the most common non‑parole period was 6 months. That is clearly too short.




Mandatory Minimum Sentencing



This bill introduces mandatory sentencing for specified offences to address the disparity between the seriousness of child sex offending and the lenient sentences handed down by the courts. Mandatory minimum sentences will apply to the child sex offences that attract the highest penalties and to re-offenders previously convicted of a separate child sex offences. 


The introduction of mandatory sentencing complements a new presumption in favour of cumulative sentences for multiple child sex offences. This will ensure that the sentences imposed adequately reflect the seriousness of the offending. 




Ensuring adequate sentencing



To strengthen the sentencing regime even further, the bill increases penalties for particular child sex offences:


1. introduces a presumption of actual imprisonment to reduce the imposition of wholly suspended sentences for child sex offenders


2. ensures that all sex offenders, upon release from custody, are adequately supervised and subject to appropriate rehabilitative conditions 


3. overhauls the sentencing factors for all federal offenders 


4. prevents courts from discounting sentences on the basis of good character, where this is used to facilitate the crime, and


5. emphasises the importance of access to rehabilitation and treatment when sentencing child sex offenders




Bail



The bill inserts a presumption against bail for offenders who commit serious child sex offences. 


The presumption recognises that such offenders pose an unacceptable risk to the community and to their victims. 




Post release options



This bill introduces a requirement for the courts to set treatment and supervision conditions for all child sex offenders upon sentencing to prevent such offenders from being released without supervision and appropriate treatment conditions. 


This bill also introduces community safety as a primary consideration when deciding whether a federal offender's parole should be revoked, to ensure the protection of the community.


The bill will also ensure that once an offender's parole has been revoked they will serve a period of time in custody. 




Criminalising emerging forms of child sexual abuse



The bill also introduces two new measures to target emerging forms of sexual offending. 


The first measure criminalises the provision of services like websites that provide access to child abuse material online. These services facilitate and encourage offending by a large, sometimes global audience and promote the production of new child abuse material. 


The second measure criminalises the transmission of communications to 'groom' any person, such as parents or carers, with the aim of procuring a child for sexual activity. 




Protecting vulnerable persons




The Government remains committed to strengthening the protections afforded to child and other vulnerable witnesses giving evidence in Commonwealth criminal proceedings. This bill improves justice outcomes by limiting the re‑traumatisation of vulnerable witnesses by removing barriers to the admission of pre-recorded video evidence and ensuring that they are not subject to cross-examination at committal and other preliminary hearings, thus allowing them to put their best evidence forward at trial.




Aggravating factors for child sex offences



The Government is deeply disturbed by the emerging trend where offenders inflict severe violence on children alongside sexual abuse. To ensure that this conduct is appropriately punished, the bill will criminalise activities that aggravate particular types of sexual offending such as subjecting a child to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, and causing the death of the child. 


This bill also introduces new aggravating factors that a court must take into account when sentencing an offender for a relevant offence. These would apply if the victim was under the age of 10 at the time of the offending and if multiple people were involved in the offending.


These measures send a clear message – this Government will not tolerate such appalling acts committed against children.




Conclusion



This bill contains the most comprehensive and significant Commonwealth Child Sex Offender reforms since the introduction of the Criminal Code in 1995. 


The bill is consistent with a number of recommendations made by the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse in its recently released Criminal Justice report.


This bill signifies this Government's commitment to addressing child sex offences that occur both domestically and overseas and ensuring that the Australian community is protected from heinous crimes. 



These new measures send a strong message to child sex offenders that such abhorrent crimes will not be tolerated.


Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of this bill be adjourned to the first sitting day of the next period of sittings, in accordance with standing order 111.

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2017-10-19,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (16:00):  I rise to speak in support of the disallowance motion before us. The motion will disallow a regulation that a very petty government has put forward in order to bully local governments out of making their own democratic choices as to when they want to celebrate their citizenship ceremonies. Local councils to take great pride in these ceremonies. As a senator for South Australia, I have attended many of them, including in my local council area in the city of Mitcham. It's one of the most delightful things that we get to do as senators. You talk to and listen to the stories of people who have actively chosen to make Australia their home. I must say that, when I'm there and in that moment, hearing their stories and hearing the passion from individuals about why they have taken up citizenship in Australia, it makes me feel a little bit sad that I didn't ever get the opportunity to choose to become an Australian; I just am. As many of us are, I was lucky enough to be born in this country and, as a result, am an Australian citizen, but sometimes I think how nice it would be to have actively chosen to become part of this great nation and part of the Australian community.


When you hear the stories of why people have chosen to become Australian citizens and the passion with which they speak about their decision—they often come to join family or bring their family with them—it's often one of the best reminders of what makes our country great. I love Australia. I think it is the best country in the world, and I love hearing why people from other corners of the globe love this country too. One of the reasons why Australia is such a great nation is that we have a proud history of welcoming others, of helping each other out, of looking after each other and of making sure that, when somebody is a little bit full of themselves, we remind them that we're all equal. We have so many great Australianisms that make us a unique, vibrant and safe place.


I have been reflecting on why the government has decided to try and bully these local councils out of their decision not to hold citizenship ceremonies on Australia Day. It is because, in reflecting on what makes Australia a great country and as a community and a group of citizens on why we all love dearly to be Australian, these councils have bravely taken the opportunity to say that every person in Australia deserves to be able to celebrate being a member of the Australian community together on the same day. We know that 26 January is not a day that can be celebrated by everyone and never will be a day that can be celebrated by everybody. That is because it is a day that is very, very reminiscent and symbolic of the day that the British invaded this country. And it marked the beginning of the slaughter and the genocide of First Australians. We've been debating the issue of changing the date of Australia Day in this country ever since 26 January was chosen to be our national day. Back in 1938, in the first year that Australia Day was marked as a national day of celebration, there was a very live debate about whether this day was the most appropriate. Indigenous communities and leaders of First Australian communities stood up in 1938 and said, 'This is not a day that we can feel part of, that we can celebrate and that enables us to be included in the progress of our nation.' They begged the rest of the community leaders to choose a different day—one that was more unifying.


Decades and decades on, we are still having this debate. Some people say we shouldn't worry about this, that Indigenous Australians should just get over it. Some of the most offensive comments of racism and dismissal of generations of being disenfranchised, of genocide, have been simply used as an excuse not to have this debate in this place or even in the public eye. This year, when local councils decided that they would choose a different day to celebrate Australia Day, a different day to celebrate being part of the wonderful Australian community, it caused a massive political stoush. And the ideological warriors from the right-wing corners of the politics in this place raised their ugly head, and we saw some of the most offensive comments about how Aboriginal and Indigenous and First Australians should simply get over the history, suck it up, and we can all move on and pretend that Australia Day being celebrated on 26 January is okay. Well, it's absolutely not.


We heard from Senator Pauline Hanson, the leader of One Nation—that people were being too precious and that of course we should be celebrating Australia Day on 26 January because it was the day of Federation. Wrong! It is not the day of Federation, Senator Hanson. In fact, the day of Federation would be a great day for us to celebrate as our national day of unity. The day of Federation—for those of you playing at home—is 1 January.


I think we're mature enough as a nation to be able to have this discussion. I think we should be embracing this debate. But the tactics from the government of bullying two local councils out of making their own choice about holding citizenship ceremonies on a day other than 26 January just shows how afraid of this debate the government is. Why on earth is the federal government getting involved in trying to dictate whether local councils can hold citizenship ceremonies and the days on which they are held? Haven't they got better things to do with their time than bullying small, local councils out of choosing what days they hold events?


Obviously not, but that is because this is more of an ideological and cultural war. This government is so obsessed with dividing groups in the community.


When I think about Australia Day, I think about celebrating as a nation the various, diverse and rich tapestries of our different communities and the success of Australia being a multicultural nation. I think about that picture of the two young girls from Melbourne who proudly wore their headscarves with their Australian flags in their hands. I think about Australia's soldiers, returned from places like Afghanistan and Iraq, who have harrowing stories to tell but amazing stories of mateship and community, of young men and women who have been told that they can't talk about the horrors that they saw when they were there and that those young men and women have a right to feel part of this community as well. I think about the young Indigenous kids in my home state of South Australia who every year make an effort to feel part of and included in the Australian community. But that Australia Day is not the Australia Day we've currently got. We can't do that on 26 January when we know that Indigenous Australians, our first people, can't and won't be able to celebrate and feel included on a day that symbolises murder, slaughter, genocide and generations of discrimination and racism. 


What I hate seeing is the pseudonationalists who drape themselves in the Australian flag, wear the flag as balaclavas and run around pretending as though they represent our great nation. If you want to talk about what is offensive when it comes to Australia Day, it's a bunch of drunk blokes running around wearing Australian flags as balaclavas, espousing racism and bigotry. That doesn't make us proud to be Australian. It doesn't make me proud to celebrate Australia Day when I see behaviour like that. I don't think it would make any of us proud.


But, of course, what we have here from the government is that they don't want to participate in this debate. They want to bully local governments and stir the ideological pot. They don't want to take on racism and bigotry. They want to shut down the democratic rights of local councils to make their own decisions. It's just pathetic. 


If we're worried about people understanding, recognising and celebrating Australian history, how about we start with educating people in the Senate like Senator Hanson, the leader of One Nation, who thinks that Australia Day is the day of Federation. Well, it's not. Senator Hanson has just walked into the chamber, so I've decided to remind her that—through you, Acting Deputy President Williams—Federation is 1 January, not 26 January. 


This is an important national conversation that we should be having about changing the date of Australia Day. It's a debate that started in 1938. It hasn't gone away and it won't go away. The date of Australia Day will change. It will change. It's not a matter of what or if; it's simply a matter of when.

"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2017-10-19,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (16:15):  I rise to speak on this disallowance motion. It's a disallowance motion because the motion to try to overturn the legitimate democratic decision of the cities of Yarra and Darebin to hold citizenship ceremonies on the days that they want to hold citizenship ceremonies—the attempt by government to do that—is complete overreach by the federal government. It is an insult to local government, it is vindictive and it is bullying. It's basically our government saying: 'We don't like what you, the cities of Darebin and Yarra, are doing here. We are going to do what's in our power to try to turn that around.' Well, the government should not have the right to do that, and if this disallowance motion is successful today, this Senate will be saying, 'They don't have the right to do that.'


Local government is a tier of government in its own right, and it has the power to hold citizenship ceremonies. The power to hold citizenship ceremonies is vested in local governments. This attempt to overrule that is basically saying, 'You local governments, you'll just do as you are told,' and that is not right. I speak as someone who spent six years in local government. I was a councillor and then I was Mayor of the City of Maribyrnong. It's incredibly important to people who are involved in local government to be recognised as a tier of government and to have the same rights as state and federal governments.


Our colleagues in the cities of Yarra and Darebin have made a decision after talking with their local communities. As to whether to celebrate citizenship ceremonies and whether to celebrate 26 January as Australia Day is a conversation that this country needs to have. Certainly, within their local government areas, they know that this is something that their communities are on side with. And it's important to note that it's not just the cities of Yarra and Darebin. The regulation that we are moving to disallow today explicitly specifies just Yarra and Darebin. It is vindictiveness and really going in for the kill of those two. It specifies that the mayor can't hold citizenship ceremonies, that the deputy mayor can't, that the general manager can't and that the CEO can't.


But it's not just Yarra and Darebin that we're talking about here. I know from my conversations and from talking to people right across Victoria—in fact, right across the country—but particularly within the councils across metropolitan Melbourne, that this is a very live debate. It's a very live debate across Australia—in fact, so much so that this isn't something that has just sprung out of the councils of Yarra and Darebin, in my patch. It's something that is bubbling up all over the country, because it's about the issue of respecting Indigenous Australians. It's about saying that we're celebrating our national day on a day which, for them, is Invasion Day, a day of mourning and a day of marking the huge change and the huge disruption to their way of life and their wellbeing. That is the conversation that's being had and that needs to be had.


In fact, so much is this conversation being held around the country that, at the Australian Local Government Association conference on 20 June this year, the Australian Local Government Association, the ALGA, moved a motion to encourage Australian councils to consider the efforts they could make to lobby the federal government to change the date of Australia Day. That was the ALGA. It represents local governments all across the country. That was the ALGA, which is represented on the Council of Australian Governments. That is the significance of this movement to have this conversation about changing the date of Australia Day. That's how much importance, how much significance, it has in our community today.


That motion was moved by the Lord Mayor of the City of Hobart, Alderman Sue Hickey. Again, it didn't come out of inner Melbourne; it came out of Tasmania. In fact, I've just been told that Alderman Sue Hickey has just been endorsed as one of the Liberal candidates for the seat of Denison at the state election. So it's not just a Greens thing here. I know that there is a lot of support amongst the Labor Party for having this conversation in the community. There is clearly a lot of support from the Liberal Party, from the government side of politics, as well. So for the government to say, 'No, we are just going to use these heavy-handed tactics to shut down Yarra and Darebin,' is just so wrong.


Why is this important? That's what I want to move on to covering. Why is it so important that Yarra and Darebin said, 'We want to shift our citizenship ceremonies away from 26 January'? I can speak from experience. As my colleague Senator Hanson-Young said, as senators we get to attend citizenship ceremonies, and they are one of the most joyous parts of the job of being a senator. But even more so, as a councillor and as a mayor, representing the city, putting on those citizenship ceremonies for your local community is an incredibly empowering and an incredible positive thing—welcoming those new local residents as Australians. In Maribyrnong, we used to have about six or seven, sometimes eight, citizenship ceremonies every year because we had so many new residents becoming citizens. In fact, Yarra and Darebin too probably have four, five or six ceremonies a year. So it's not just on Australia Day that they have these citizenship ceremonies, but the Australia Day ones are seen as being the special ones because Australia Day is the day that we are meant to be celebrating coming together as Australians. The year that I was mayor—I knew that it was quite a significant thing to be standing up and giving a speech, as mayor of a council, at an Australia Day citizenship ceremony—I was incredibly torn because I knew that Australia Day wasn't a day that brought all Australians together.


At these citizenship ceremonies, almost always, across local government, we have an acknowledgement of country. There's often now a welcome to country by the local Indigenous custodians of the land. We are recognising and acknowledging the Indigenous history of Australia, and yet we are holding these ceremonies on a day which is so problematic. It is a day which is divisive, a day which, in saying, 'This is Australia Day,' is perpetuating the myth of terra nullius. It's perpetuating the myth that the invasion of Australia was done peacefully, when we know that it wasn't. We know that Australia has a very dark history. For us to be able to move on, we've got to acknowledge that history, and we cannot acknowledge that history while saying that 26 January is the appropriate day to be celebrating our national day.


I want to quote Senator Eric Abetz. When this all blew up a few months ago, he said, in media commentary:


Australia Day is about bringing together all Australians from all walks of life to reflect on our history and look to the future with optimism …


I agree with Senator Abetz. I think that is a great intention for what we should be able to achieve on Australia Day. That, in itself, is why it is inappropriate for Australia Day to be on 26 January.


I love Australia. I love celebrating Australia. I think it is entirely appropriate that we have a celebration of Australia, but we need to change the date. It needs to be shifted from 26 January. I think it's quite appropriate to acknowledge the significance of 26 January. It was the day that the First Fleet arrived in Botany Bay. But I think we should acknowledge it as that. We should acknowledge it as Anniversary Day or Foundation Day. It was once considered to be Anniversary Day, before it was given the title of Australia Day. We should acknowledge it as that, but we need to find a different date to celebrate us coming together as Australians. Anyone who reads our history and who looks back at our history and at the interaction and the process that occurred with the settlement of Australia knows that marking 26 January, as the beginning of that, is marking a very dark beginning for first Australians.


I recently read the book Dark Emu by Bruce Pascoe, which I really recommend to you if you haven't read it. It outlines what was lost with the beginning of the white settlement of Australia; the wars that were held; the deaths; the massacres; the disease. There were really complex technologies, there were settlements, there was agriculture, and there were villages and towns of thousands of people, in some cases, which have been wiped from our history, unacknowledged, because we have a myth of our history now which says, 'Oh, no, we had this peaceful settlement; white Australians arrived and Aboriginal Australians just sort of said, ""Yes, we're happy to let you be here.""' But that wasn't the case, and there is more than enough historical evidence to show that that wasn't the case. This is what happened. It was our history. We can't deny it.


We need to work out how we can move forward to make reparations. The best way of moving forward, and the only way of moving forward, is to acknowledge that that was our history, and to acknowledge that there are still repercussions from that history that are rippling out to today, and to say, 'Yes, we know that that happened. Now we are going to work with the first Australians.' We want to work for justice. We want to work for sovereignty. We want to work for treaties. We want to work with the first Australians for self-determination for Aboriginal Australians. We need to acknowledge that, and acknowledging that 26 January is not the day to celebrate our national day is a critical part of doing that. We need to have reparations. We need to have the makarrata. We need to bring people together. This is how we can move forward as Australians.


If we're able to find a different date and find something that can genuinely bring everyone together—Indigenous Australians, non-Indigenous Australians and people of every background who all can come together and celebrate Australia for all of the wonderful things that we know there are in Australia—then we will be a better nation. We will then truly be able to say that we truly respect everyone in this country and that we are not denying our history—that we are not denying what's occurred in the past.


How do we choose the right date? I don't know. That's the conversation that we need to have. But the statement that the cities of Yarra and Darebin—and there will be other councils after them—are making is, 'Let's have this conversation.' The beginning of this conversation is to say, 'Let's not pretend that we can celebrate how good it is to be an Australian on 26 January.' So choosing to not have citizenship ceremonies on 26 January is something that local government is able to do. It's empowering to local government. It's empowering through listening to all of their communities and to the people who recognise that this is the conversation that Australia needs to have. By doing that, we can begin to move forward.


So I really commend this disallowance motion to the Senate. Again, it's a statement that we can make that we don't want to continue on with the racism that is inherent in celebrating Australia Day on 26 January and we want to be able to move forward and celebrate Australia on a different date. So I would really encourage everyone to support this, both because we don't want to override the legitimate rights of local governments to be able to choose their own way forward on this and because, as a federal government, we can give them support for doing that. I would prefer us to be taking actions that actually celebrate the fact that the cities of Yarra and Darebin have taken this step and other councils like Moreland and Port Phillip in Melbourne are also talking about this. Hobart is also having this conversation. We as a federal parliament should be celebrating that and we should be encouraging more communities across the country to have those conversations and supporting the Australian Local Government Association and other local government associations all across the country to move forward and to have these conversations.


That's what we should be doing: having the federal government working together with our state governments and with local governments all across the country, suggesting that they also reach out to their community, have the conversation and invite conversations with the Indigenous communities and non-Indigenous communities to bring groups together. Imagine having the resources of federal, state and local governments all working together to be encouraging conversations at Rotary clubs, at sporting clubs and in school communities about what it means to be Australian and how we should recognise that and celebrate that in a way that is truly inclusive. Until we have this debate and this conversation, we are going to just continue to be stuck in the same sorts of divisiveness that we've had over the last years.


We've got examples from all around the world. We've got the South African reconciliation process. We know that here in Australia we have stopped. We have taken some small steps forward, but we haven't gone the whole way, and that's what we need to do. Until we do that, we are going to be lesser people. Until we do that, we know that we really have this unfinished business here in Australia and that we can't truly celebrate having a fully inclusive Australia. I can't feel, personally, that Australia is genuinely inclusive and genuinely recognises the rights and the aspirations of all Australians until we have reached that situation of justice for Aboriginal Australians, because we have that history. We've got to acknowledge that history. We've got to be able to acknowledge that history, to recognise the damage that's been done and to work out how to move forward from here.


In conclusion, I think the right of local government, as a tier of government, to make these decisions in their own right is critical, and I see this move, the move to change the date, as being a really important step forward. Both of these things are why it is so important that we pass this disallowance motion today and then move forward as a community and as a parliament to genuinely embrace and support the rights, the aspirations and justice for Indigenous Australia.

Why on earth is the federal government getting involved in trying to dictate whether local councils can hold citizenship ceremonies and the days on which they are held? Haven't they got better things to do with their time than bullying small, local councils out of choosing what days they hold events?


Obviously not, but that is because this is more of an ideological and cultural war. This government is so obsessed with dividing groups in the community.


When I think about Australia Day, I think about celebrating as a nation the various, diverse and rich tapestries of our different communities and the success of Australia being a multicultural nation. I think about that picture of the two young girls from Melbourne who proudly wore their headscarves with their Australian flags in their hands. I think about Australia's soldiers, returned from places like Afghanistan and Iraq, who have harrowing stories to tell but amazing stories of mateship and community, of young men and women who have been told that they can't talk about the horrors that they saw when they were there and that those young men and women have a right to feel part of this community as well. I think about the young Indigenous kids in my home state of South Australia who every year make an effort to feel part of and included in the Australian community. But that Australia Day is not the Australia Day we've currently got. We can't do that on 26 January when we know that Indigenous Australians, our first people, can't and won't be able to celebrate and feel included on a day that symbolises murder, slaughter, genocide and generations of discrimination and racism. 


What I hate seeing is the pseudonationalists who drape themselves in the Australian flag, wear the flag as balaclavas and run around pretending as though they represent our great nation. If you want to talk about what is offensive when it comes to Australia Day, it's a bunch of drunk blokes running around wearing Australian flags as balaclavas, espousing racism and bigotry. That doesn't make us proud to be Australian. It doesn't make me proud to celebrate Australia Day when I see behaviour like that. I don't think it would make any of us proud.


But, of course, what we have here from the government is that they don't want to participate in this debate. They want to bully local governments and stir the ideological pot. They don't want to take on racism and bigotry. They want to shut down the democratic rights of local councils to make their own decisions. It's just pathetic. 


If we're worried about people understanding, recognising and celebrating Australian history, how about we start with educating people in the Senate like Senator Hanson, the leader of One Nation, who thinks that Australia Day is the day of Federation. Well, it's not. Senator Hanson has just walked into the chamber, so I've decided to remind her that—through you, Acting Deputy President Williams—Federation is 1 January, not 26 January. 


This is an important national conversation that we should be having about changing the date of Australia Day. It's a debate that started in 1938. It hasn't gone away and it won't go away. The date of Australia Day will change. It will change. It's not a matter of what or if; it's simply a matter of when.

"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2017-10-19,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (16:15):  I rise to speak on this disallowance motion. It's a disallowance motion because the motion to try to overturn the legitimate democratic decision of the cities of Yarra and Darebin to hold citizenship ceremonies on the days that they want to hold citizenship ceremonies—the attempt by government to do that—is complete overreach by the federal government. It is an insult to local government, it is vindictive and it is bullying. It's basically our government saying: 'We don't like what you, the cities of Darebin and Yarra, are doing here. We are going to do what's in our power to try to turn that around.' Well, the government should not have the right to do that, and if this disallowance motion is successful today, this Senate will be saying, 'They don't have the right to do that.'


Local government is a tier of government in its own right, and it has the power to hold citizenship ceremonies. The power to hold citizenship ceremonies is vested in local governments. This attempt to overrule that is basically saying, 'You local governments, you'll just do as you are told,' and that is not right. I speak as someone who spent six years in local government. I was a councillor and then I was Mayor of the City of Maribyrnong. It's incredibly important to people who are involved in local government to be recognised as a tier of government and to have the same rights as state and federal governments.


Our colleagues in the cities of Yarra and Darebin have made a decision after talking with their local communities. As to whether to celebrate citizenship ceremonies and whether to celebrate 26 January as Australia Day is a conversation that this country needs to have. Certainly, within their local government areas, they know that this is something that their communities are on side with. And it's important to note that it's not just the cities of Yarra and Darebin. The regulation that we are moving to disallow today explicitly specifies just Yarra and Darebin. It is vindictiveness and really going in for the kill of those two. It specifies that the mayor can't hold citizenship ceremonies, that the deputy mayor can't, that the general manager can't and that the CEO can't.


But it's not just Yarra and Darebin that we're talking about here. I know from my conversations and from talking to people right across Victoria—in fact, right across the country—but particularly within the councils across metropolitan Melbourne, that this is a very live debate. It's a very live debate across Australia—in fact, so much so that this isn't something that has just sprung out of the councils of Yarra and Darebin, in my patch. It's something that is bubbling up all over the country, because it's about the issue of respecting Indigenous Australians. It's about saying that we're celebrating our national day on a day which, for them, is Invasion Day, a day of mourning and a day of marking the huge change and the huge disruption to their way of life and their wellbeing. That is the conversation that's being had and that needs to be had.


In fact, so much is this conversation being held around the country that, at the Australian Local Government Association conference on 20 June this year, the Australian Local Government Association, the ALGA, moved a motion to encourage Australian councils to consider the efforts they could make to lobby the federal government to change the date of Australia Day. That was the ALGA. It represents local governments all across the country. That was the ALGA, which is represented on the Council of Australian Governments. That is the significance of this movement to have this conversation about changing the date of Australia Day. That's how much importance, how much significance, it has in our community today.


That motion was moved by the Lord Mayor of the City of Hobart, Alderman Sue Hickey. Again, it didn't come out of inner Melbourne; it came out of Tasmania. In fact, I've just been told that Alderman Sue Hickey has just been endorsed as one of the Liberal candidates for the seat of Denison at the state election. So it's not just a Greens thing here. I know that there is a lot of support amongst the Labor Party for having this conversation in the community. There is clearly a lot of support from the Liberal Party, from the government side of politics, as well. So for the government to say, 'No, we are just going to use these heavy-handed tactics to shut down Yarra and Darebin,' is just so wrong.


Why is this important? That's what I want to move on to covering. Why is it so important that Yarra and Darebin said, 'We want to shift our citizenship ceremonies away from 26 January'? I can speak from experience. As my colleague Senator Hanson-Young said, as senators we get to attend citizenship ceremonies, and they are one of the most joyous parts of the job of being a senator. But even more so, as a councillor and as a mayor, representing the city, putting on those citizenship ceremonies for your local community is an incredibly empowering and an incredible positive thing—welcoming those new local residents as Australians. In Maribyrnong, we used to have about six or seven, sometimes eight, citizenship ceremonies every year because we had so many new residents becoming citizens. In fact, Yarra and Darebin too probably have four, five or six ceremonies a year. So it's not just on Australia Day that they have these citizenship ceremonies, but the Australia Day ones are seen as being the special ones because Australia Day is the day that we are meant to be celebrating coming together as Australians. The year that I was mayor—I knew that it was quite a significant thing to be standing up and giving a speech, as mayor of a council, at an Australia Day citizenship ceremony—I was incredibly torn because I knew that Australia Day wasn't a day that brought all Australians together.


At these citizenship ceremonies, almost always, across local government, we have an acknowledgement of country. There's often now a welcome to country by the local Indigenous custodians of the land. We are recognising and acknowledging the Indigenous history of Australia, and yet we are holding these ceremonies on a day which is so problematic. It is a day which is divisive, a day which, in saying, 'This is Australia Day,' is perpetuating the myth of terra nullius. It's perpetuating the myth that the invasion of Australia was done peacefully, when we know that it wasn't. We know that Australia has a very dark history. For us to be able to move on, we've got to acknowledge that history, and we cannot acknowledge that history while saying that 26 January is the appropriate day to be celebrating our national day.


I want to quote Senator Eric Abetz. When this all blew up a few months ago, he said, in media commentary:


Australia Day is about bringing together all Australians from all walks of life to reflect on our history and look to the future with optimism …


I agree with Senator Abetz. I think that is a great intention for what we should be able to achieve on Australia Day. That, in itself, is why it is inappropriate for Australia Day to be on 26 January.


I love Australia. I love celebrating Australia. I think it is entirely appropriate that we have a celebration of Australia, but we need to change the date. It needs to be shifted from 26 January. I think it's quite appropriate to acknowledge the significance of 26 January. It was the day that the First Fleet arrived in Botany Bay. But I think we should acknowledge it as that. We should acknowledge it as Anniversary Day or Foundation Day. It was once considered to be Anniversary Day, before it was given the title of Australia Day. We should acknowledge it as that, but we need to find a different date to celebrate us coming together as Australians. Anyone who reads our history and who looks back at our history and at the interaction and the process that occurred with the settlement of Australia knows that marking 26 January, as the beginning of that, is marking a very dark beginning for first Australians.


I recently read the book Dark Emu by Bruce Pascoe, which I really recommend to you if you haven't read it. It outlines what was lost with the beginning of the white settlement of Australia; the wars that were held; the deaths; the massacres; the disease. There were really complex technologies, there were settlements, there was agriculture, and there were villages and towns of thousands of people, in some cases, which have been wiped from our history, unacknowledged, because we have a myth of our history now which says, 'Oh, no, we had this peaceful settlement; white Australians arrived and Aboriginal Australians just sort of said, ""Yes, we're happy to let you be here.""' But that wasn't the case, and there is more than enough historical evidence to show that that wasn't the case. This is what happened. It was our history. We can't deny it.


We need to work out how we can move forward to make reparations. The best way of moving forward, and the only way of moving forward, is to acknowledge that that was our history, and to acknowledge that there are still repercussions from that history that are rippling out to today, and to say, 'Yes, we know that that happened. Now we are going to work with the first Australians.' We want to work for justice. We want to work for sovereignty. We want to work for treaties. We want to work with the first Australians for self-determination for Aboriginal Australians. We need to acknowledge that, and acknowledging that 26 January is not the day to celebrate our national day is a critical part of doing that. We need to have reparations. We need to have the makarrata. We need to bring people together. This is how we can move forward as Australians.


If we're able to find a different date and find something that can genuinely bring everyone together—Indigenous Australians, non-Indigenous Australians and people of every background who all can come together and celebrate Australia for all of the wonderful things that we know there are in Australia—then we will be a better nation. We will then truly be able to say that we truly respect everyone in this country and that we are not denying our history—that we are not denying what's occurred in the past.


How do we choose the right date? I don't know. That's the conversation that we need to have. But the statement that the cities of Yarra and Darebin—and there will be other councils after them—are making is, 'Let's have this conversation.' The beginning of this conversation is to say, 'Let's not pretend that we can celebrate how good it is to be an Australian on 26 January.' So choosing to not have citizenship ceremonies on 26 January is something that local government is able to do. It's empowering to local government. It's empowering through listening to all of their communities and to the people who recognise that this is the conversation that Australia needs to have. By doing that, we can begin to move forward.


So I really commend this disallowance motion to the Senate. Again, it's a statement that we can make that we don't want to continue on with the racism that is inherent in celebrating Australia Day on 26 January and we want to be able to move forward and celebrate Australia on a different date. So I would really encourage everyone to support this, both because we don't want to override the legitimate rights of local governments to be able to choose their own way forward on this and because, as a federal government, we can give them support for doing that. I would prefer us to be taking actions that actually celebrate the fact that the cities of Yarra and Darebin have taken this step and other councils like Moreland and Port Phillip in Melbourne are also talking about this. Hobart is also having this conversation. We as a federal parliament should be celebrating that and we should be encouraging more communities across the country to have those conversations and supporting the Australian Local Government Association and other local government associations all across the country to move forward and to have these conversations.


That's what we should be doing: having the federal government working together with our state governments and with local governments all across the country, suggesting that they also reach out to their community, have the conversation and invite conversations with the Indigenous communities and non-Indigenous communities to bring groups together. Imagine having the resources of federal, state and local governments all working together to be encouraging conversations at Rotary clubs, at sporting clubs and in school communities about what it means to be Australian and how we should recognise that and celebrate that in a way that is truly inclusive. Until we have this debate and this conversation, we are going to just continue to be stuck in the same sorts of divisiveness that we've had over the last years.


We've got examples from all around the world. We've got the South African reconciliation process. We know that here in Australia we have stopped. We have taken some small steps forward, but we haven't gone the whole way, and that's what we need to do. Until we do that, we are going to be lesser people. Until we do that, we know that we really have this unfinished business here in Australia and that we can't truly celebrate having a fully inclusive Australia. I can't feel, personally, that Australia is genuinely inclusive and genuinely recognises the rights and the aspirations of all Australians until we have reached that situation of justice for Aboriginal Australians, because we have that history. We've got to acknowledge that history. We've got to be able to acknowledge that history, to recognise the damage that's been done and to work out how to move forward from here.


In conclusion, I think the right of local government, as a tier of government, to make these decisions in their own right is critical, and I see this move, the move to change the date, as being a really important step forward. Both of these things are why it is so important that we pass this disallowance motion today and then move forward as a community and as a parliament to genuinely embrace and support the rights, the aspirations and justice for Indigenous Australia.


Debate adjourned.

Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (16:35):  I move:


That the Senate—


(a) notes that Australia has the largest per capita immigration program in the world; and


(b) calls on the Government to address the extremely high, unsustainable immigration intake, including from both permanent and temporary residency visas, that:


(i) impacts on local, state and Federal Government delivery and planning for the supply of water, power and gas, and the protection of arable land for food production,


(ii) overburdens infrastructure, including roads and transport, telecommunications, schools, hospitals, nursing homes, sewerage, government welfare and services, and


(iii) has put a strain on available residential land, affordable housing, standard of living and employment prospects, including under-employment.


Notice given 18 October 2017


When it comes to immigration and population policy, the other parties are like drunken fools pouring petrol onto a bonfire. Unless we put a stop to this madness, it is going to blow up in our faces. It is time for the adults in the room to speak up and call them out because, otherwise, the idiots with the petrol can are going to burn the economy to the ground. Of course, it is difficult for anyone to question the level of immigration without being called a racist because it has always been seen as a legitimate tactic to label anyone a racist when they propose policy that others do not like. The racist card has been pulled out so many times in respect of policies I propose that it is fraying around the edges from the grubby little hands that hold it. I am, of course, talking about the Australian Greens and Labor.


Both major political parties believe more is better when it comes to immigration, with a result that voters have, up until now, been given no choice on the level of immigration or population size. In 1994, Barry Jones, a Labor member of parliament, conducted an inquiry into Australia's population and carrying capacity. His committee recommended that the year-by-year decisions on immigration should not be taken in an ad hoc fashion without realising the incremental downstream effects. Two years later, I made my maiden speech. I warned the parliament about the high rate of immigration. This warning was timely. The Commonwealth Bank, in a recent study, had found immigration was papering over Australia's economic weakness, as per capita GDP had been falling since 1990. The Commonwealth Bank recommended a reduction in immigration so that jobs would be soaked up by the existing pool of unemployed and underemployed. I agreed.


In 1997, Barry Jones admitted Labor uses immigration to gain political capital—by which he meant Labor uses immigration to lock up political votes for the future—and nothing has changed. I referred to what Barry Jones had said at that time, and he admitted that they only used to bring in people from certain countries purely for the vote. They knew it would create social incohesion in our country. Yet, here I am again, 21 years after my first maiden speech, warning parliamentarians about the high rate of immigration. We reached a tipping point in 1990. This was the year our standard of living began decreasing because of an excessive level of immigration. One Nation believes in taking 70,000 to 80,000 migrants a year and a stable population.


Who benefits from high levels of immigration? Both major parties use immigration to buy votes for the future, but these parties are also hostages to big business. I include our universities in the definition of big business because they set aside more than a quarter of a million places for international students. The government will say these students cross-subsidise Australian students, and I say, 'Rubbish.' Last year, the government granted 343,035 international student visas, and most of these visas carried work rights of 40 hours a fortnight in term time and unlimited work rights in other times.


On Tuesday this week, the Senate agreed with me that it is a matter of urgency that we understand the number of jobs taken by international students, because international students on temporary visas take lower-paid jobs that could be done by unemployed young Australians. I would remind the Senate that 37.5 per cent of young Australians aged between 15 and 24 are unemployed and many of them are in the same locations as our universities. International students are good for the remuneration packages of university vice-chancellors and those who invest in student housing, but they are bad for unemployed young people and others who find their wages and conditions depressed by hundreds of thousands of international students with automatic rights to work in Australia.


Not only do they have rights to work in Australia, but we find that a lot of them stay on to work after they have done their degrees here in Australia. It is quite often that I might get into a taxi in Sydney, Melbourne or Brisbane and find they did their university degrees here and have gone on to actually become taxidrivers. Have we actually really opened up our universities for these people to get their degrees and go back to their own countries or have they used our universities as a back door to get into the country? That's because it then allows them the right to get permanent residency here and then to move on to citizenship. Or should we say: 'No, you get your degree and then you go back to your country. Then from your country you can apply, like everyone else, to Immigration to migrate to Australia.'


The unemployed have no friends in the Labor Party, because this week Labor strongly defended the rights of international students to work here in Australia. A 2015 Deloitte Access Economics study for the government revealed that 95 per cent of international students live and study in our big cities, where we are already experiencing most of the population growth. In the 2016-17 financial year, the government granted over 343,000 international student visas with work rights, over 200,000 permanent visas and over 87,000 four-year temporary skilled visas. That is over 630,000 people coming into the country every year on these visa categories. It is pure madness. The government is on steroids. Australians don't want it. These numbers are driving the largest per capita immigration program in the world. It is a social experiment on an unprecedented scale, and no-one knows how it will end. It's a population Ponzi scheme.


A bigger population means more demand for more goods and services, which in turn increases an economic measurement called gross domestic product, or GDP. The government says that our growing GDP is a sign of their good economic management; but these figures are inflated by export sales of our gas, even though these revenues do not contribute to the income or welfare of Australians. The only Australians to benefit from the export of our gas are the small number of people directly employed in the industry and those who own shares in Chevron, BP, Shell and ExxonMobil, because these companies don't pay tax in Australia. One Nation is shocked that neither major political party is willing to address the overly generous taxation regime which sees Australians pay foreign-owned multinationals to take our gas and never pay for it. This ridiculous situation is the result of the way oil and gas companies are allowed to treat expenses when calculating their paper profits.


Next time you see your electricity or gas bill, just remember this government allows petroleum giants to claim more in expenses than they actually paid, which, in effect, represents a subsidy by taxpayers. Let me explain: these gas giants are able to claim 18 per cent more than they pay for goods and services. The genuine expense—plus 18 per cent—is a base amount, which is further increased year by year by 15 per cent, plus the long-term bond rate, until the moment the companies earn revenue. By the time the gas cartel companies earn money on the export sales of our gas, they can call on the mountain of existing tax credits—a $250 billion mountain—to ensure they never make a profit. I would remind the parliament that $250 billion in petroleum resource rent tax credits is enough to pay nearly half of our national debt.


An article, 'Population growth masking Australia's economic weakness: CBA report' was put out on 12 July 2017 by Michael Janda. It basically says that a report by the Commonwealth Bank's senior economist, Gareth Aird, has found that Australia's high immigration intake is papering over economic weakness in headline figures, and:


Per capita measures of the economy suggest that growth in living standards has stagnated and for some sections of the resident population, in particular younger people, it has gone backwards.


He also:


…pointed out that Australia has one of the highest population growth rates among developed economies, more than half of which is due to net immigration. However, while this makes Australia's headline economic growth rate look reasonable, on a per capita basis GDP growth has been trending downwards since the recovery from Australia's last recession in the early 1990s.


Most Australians will tell you that they are feeling the pinch of high immigration in our country. I want the Australian economy to grow for the right reason, which is growth because of increased productivity. As it stands, our economy is growing for the wrong reason—growth because of increased population.


I wonder how many Australians have made the connection between high energy prices and high immigration. Every new international student or permanent migrant requires essential services like housing and electricity. Excessive demand causes prices to go up. Very soon, we will see council and water rates increase rapidly to reflect the increased cost of water, access to sewerage networks and places to dispose of rubbish. Services we take for granted, services we call essential, will take an increasing proportion of our income and crowd out the ability to pay for other things. This is what I call a fall in the standard of living. It's a smaller slice of the economic cake. Despite the fact living standards are dropping, we continue with our high level of immigration consequently increasing our population through naturalised citizenship.


Australians have been surveyed often over the past 30 years and, every time, respondents say that the population growth is too high. But, of course, governments, both Liberal and Labor, believe they know what is best for the uninformed voter. Recently, the October Fairfax-Ipsos poll found two-thirds of Australians thought the population growth was too high. What Australians are really saying is that they want lower levels of immigration because 60 per cent of our population growth now comes from immigration. I believe Australians have a right to decide the pattern and number of migrants we take in and they have a right to say what is in the national interest.


Australians are feeling this in their cities—mainly in the capital cities. They have to put up with road congestion and they have increased costs in housing and services. They have to line up if they want to go to the hospital or doctor. They can't see specialists—there's even a waiting period of 12 months to see a specialist in this country. This is where our standard of living has dropped and yet we don't have a debate about this. People have nowhere to turn to get our politicians to listen to what is happening. It's all right for people in this House. We have a very good income. We have a standard of living and a lifestyle. Many Australians will never ever know what it's like to be in our shoes. But I feel for the struggling people of this nation and the younger generations that are coming through with no hope of a job or a long-term position—they're underemployed. And that's why, with high immigration too, we have casualisation. This is why real wages have not increased over a period of time.


We have too many people coming into this country, and it's only going to get worse. We are now in debt by over $500 billion in this country. How are we going to pay it off? We can't provide the services for the people here with the increasing population. We are one of the driest nations in this world, yet we are not providing the water resources that we need. How many dams have we built? Where is the water coming from? And the answer to that is, 'Well, look, we've got a water shortage, so let's start and keep increasing the prices.' So we're telling people, 'We don't have the water, but you're going pay for it.' That's what we're doing to our farming sector with the amount that we're charging them. It's all right for foreigners and everyone else to own our water rights in this country, but it's not all right for the farmers to have the use of the water when they need it to grow the food that will eventually feed us.


This is all due to high immigration, and we have to look at this sensibly. What sort of country do we want? What do we expect in the future? Or are we just going to be here for the number of years that we are here, passing legislation without the true vision of seeing what this country is going to be like further down the track? Are we just going to pass it on to the next people: 'That's your problem. That's your responsibility; that's not mine; I'm out of here.' That's not the way to deal with this.


And this has been the big issue. When I raised it in the early nineties, when I was in this parliament first off, we had high immigration—around 150,000 a year then. And the then Prime Minister, John Howard, realised what the people wanted. He knew the impact it was having on our country, and he reduced the numbers. It was a sensible move. But now it has increased time and time again. Now the fact is that we're bringing in approximately 600,000-plus a year into this country. We can't sustain this, maintain our standard of living that we have today and also ensure that we're handing on a strong country for future generations.


It's not only our immigration. I'm going to touch on the facts about our free trade agreements, which are actually going to open up the borders for these countries to bring the people in here to Australia. There's no limit to it. These are things that our government is doing behind the scenes, that people—the general populace—don't understand. I feel for these workers. They live in the cities—they've grown up in those towns and suburbs—and they actually want to stay there, but they can't. They have been forced out, not only by high immigration but by foreign ownership. There are people who are not supposed to be buying established housing in this country, but everyone seems to turn a blind eye to it—councillors and governments, the federal government and the Treasurer. How many have we reined in? We know that we have so many people from other countries buying up our established housing. It's against our laws, but who really looks at it? Who really wants to do anything? They don't want to do it.


I will tell you why. It's because these state governments are pulling in so much revenue from stamp duty from these people, without regard to the Australian people, because of supply and demand. If we have more people coming in here and buying up investment properties then foreign ownership is driving up the demand so Australians can't buy those houses. They're forced out of the suburbs that they grew up in, where they're around their families. And we're forcing them out—out of their own cities and out of their own towns. And the attitude of the government is: 'Oh, well, go out west. Go out to rural and regional Australia. There's plenty of housing there.' Yes, there is. But those areas are for people who want that lifestyle, and we are forcing people there. If you're not a lover of the land who wants to be there in that environment, well, you shouldn't have to be forced out there.


But we've just opened up our borders, and I feel for the people. As I said, people in these cities actually have to get in their cars and drive an hour plus, or maybe two hours, to get to work. Or if they want to catch a train—if there is a train—then they're stuck on the train for ages. Then our infrastructure, whether it be trains, buses or whatever—we can't provide that as well. It's just that everything is impacting.


What we're doing is propping up big business in this country. Oh, they want high immigration: 'Bring 'em in.' Do you know why? Because they sell more whitegoods and products. They're making more profits to put into their own hip pockets. But a lot of these companies now are also foreign owned, so we don't get the profits here. Those profits go overseas, and it's at the expense of the Australian people.


Yesterday, the citizenship bills were withdrawn. And I am disgusted with that as well, because what is happening here is: we're allowing people into this country, and Labor and the Greens have no respect for what it is to be an Australian. Someone can come in here and only be in this country for one year, and then they can go for their citizenship. Where's their allegiance to this country? Why are we the lowest one, out of the Western world, for anyone to get their citizenship in this country? Where is the allegiance that we demand of them? What is wrong with someone waiting four years, as the government wants—but I believe eight years—to prove their allegiance to this country? Let's start being Australians and looking after our country first.

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales—Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (16:55):  I rise to speak today on Senator Hanson's general business debate topic regarding the Australian immigration program. Can I just firstly say—as somebody who has lived my life across the diversity that is, today, contemporary Australia—that there are a few things that I really believe need to be said in this debate. The first thing that I would like to say is that Australia is one of the most culturally diverse yet socially cohesive nations on earth. We are, indeed, an international and unique model for respect, for inclusion and for integration.


Senator Hanson, you are correct to say that, per capita, Australia has a generous immigration and humanitarian program. However, under the Turnbull government, we have ensured that our migration settings and underlying visa systems are specifically designed to meet our nation's needs. Because of our migration system, today we are a nation which has welcomed people from right across the globe and our country is home to people from over 300 nationalities. Australia welcomes people to our shores from across the globe, with about 190,000 people moving to Australia every year. But that's not a figure, Senator Hanson, that's just simply plucked out of the air. It is a considered decision that is made on the basis of looking at a whole range of different factors, including economic and other factors, combined, and looking at what our needs are—what our employment needs are; what our needs are as a nation—and that's the figure that governments have got to. Governments from different parts of the political spectrum have consistently, over decades, made these decisions.


We do recognise that this is a significant number for a country with 24 million people. Over half of us were either born overseas or have at least one parent born overseas. Whilst times have changed from when my parents came here, the aspiration of migrants remains the same, and that is to work hard and to build a better life for yourself and for your children. I am a product of this migration story. My father came to Australia in 1953; my mother came in 1959. And, as I said, my parents, like millions of other migrants, came here to build a better life for themselves and for the children that they were to have.


Since World War II, we have welcomed to Australia 7½ million migrants, including over 860,000 under our humanitarian program. Indeed, our postwar migration program is lauded today as the start of our very modern and diverse society. Of course, this has included people from a humanitarian-program background, and there was the decision made by the then Abbott government to add 12,000 places under our humanitarian program as a consequence of the Syrian and Iraqi conflict. We have delivered one of the largest offshore humanitarian programs. Indeed, we are not just one of the highest contributors to the permanent resettlement of refugees under the UNHCR but also balance that with community support programs that enable Australia to support genuine refugees and also to ease the burden on our taxpayers. But, of course, we cannot effectively manage Australia's migration program without first securing our borders. I doubt that the public would have supported the government had we continued to face daily boat arrivals. The coalition has taken back control of Australia's borders and restored integrity to the migration program. One of the most important reasons we are a successful migration country is that we have had an ordered migration process. When you have an ordered migration process, things are done in an appropriate manner. 


Without any policy foresight, those opposite—Labor and their Greens alliance partners—tore down the successful framework of the Howard government's border-protection policies. So, Senator Hanson, as a consequence of that, we had 50,000 illegal maritime arrivals on over 800 boats, 1,200 deaths at sea—that we know of—and over 8,000 children in detention, and we were forced to open detention centres. As a consequence of Operation Sovereign Borders, we have now restored respectability to our border-protection policies. We haven't had boat arrivals for three years, we haven't had deaths at sea, we've closed 17 detention centres and we have removed children from detention. 


Our humanitarian program has been a very good one, but it's also supported by good settlement services that include full access to the Australian labour market, which supports integration. It's encouraging to see that, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics employment statistics, the long-term employment outlook for our humanitarian entrants is promising. Of those who arrived between January 2006 and August 2011, the percentage employed is 72 per cent. For those who have been in Australia for a longer period of time, who arrived between 1 January 2000 and 2005, the percentage employed is 82 per cent. These people are not only vital contributors to our economy but also pay taxes, which generates revenue to enable governments to provide services. I think this is something that we should all be very proud of. 


Australia is known and respected internationally for its migrant heritage. This longstanding record is underpinned by Australian core, shared values of rights and responsibilities. As a nation built on migration, it is important that the Australian public have confidence in the migration process. As I have said, a well-managed migration program is crucial for Australia's future prosperity. The benefits of migration and its effect on lifting living standards must flow to all Australians, and temporary and permanent migration both bring significant benefits to Australia. Skilled migration makes Australia more internationally competitive. It has helped our nation achieve more than 20 years of uninterrupted economic growth. The Migration Council Australia estimates that migration will add $1.6 trillion to Australia's GDP and 16 per cent to workforce participation by 2050. Temporary migration is also increasingly important. More than 560,000 foreign students have helped make education our third-most-important export, worth nearly $22 billion in 2016 alone. Family migrants reunite families and retain skilled Australians onshore, enhancing Australian society.


Let's look at one of the very interesting statistics that emerged from a 2013 inquiry into migration and multiculturalism. Thirty per cent of small businesses are owned by migrants in Australia. You only have to look at the top 100 wealthiest people in this country. How many of them are migrants? They started out with a small business, and today they are amongst the most successful Australians. Some have international enterprises and virtual economic empires internationally that all started from their small business in Australia.


Any government has to retain the sovereign right to determine who comes to their country—to Australia—and it must work in the interests of all Australians. I would now like to say something on the work this government is doing in reforming the visa system to ensure that this remains the case. Whilst our visa system has served our nation well, it needs modernising. We do need a visa system that is more responsive to our economic, social and security interests. That is why the government has signalled an intent to reform our visa system and has engaged in a public consultation process to seek input into what our future visa and migration systems should look like. The public consultations on designing the new visa system concluded in September this year, and the design of the new system is underway.


To inform future changes to the visa system, the government commissioned a review by the Productivity Commission into the migration program to ensure that we have the settings right. The Productivity Commission made a number of recommendations to improve the economic contribution of migration for all Australians, including through positive growth in per-capita incomes. The Productivity Commission noted that there are, indeed, a number of important benefits from migration. For example, by increasing the proportion of people in the workforce, immigration can provide a demographic dividend to the Australian economy and reduce the impacts of population ageing. But the benefits of migration to the Australian community, including increased incomes on a per-capita basis, can be achieved especially when the migrants entering the labour force have high levels of employability. Selecting migrants with high rates of workforce engagement and employment in skilled and high-demand occupations will deliver economic outcomes.


There is also a benefit to having a diverse workforce. Australia's workforce obviously reflects our diversity, but having people with different skills and different language skills enables Australia to be a country where people may wish to invest and do business, and it also affords us the opportunity to offer ourselves up as a gateway for companies wishing to come to Australia to invest. It also affords companies the opportunity to be a gateway into the Asia-Pacific area, knowing that here in Australia they are able to find a workforce with different language skills to enable them to do business not just in Australia but in the Asia-Pacific area.


Coming back to visa reform, the coalition will now be looking at reforming our visa programs with the aim of delivering safer communities to support employers with genuine skill needs, and reduce the scope for migrants to compete with local workers and graduate jobseekers in the labour market. By doing so, we have restored Australia's migration program following six disastrous years of Labor government.


In my closing comments, I will make some observations. As Minister for International Development and the Pacific, I have responsibility for our neighbourhood, including for labour mobility. I would like to take this opportunity to talk about our new Pacific Labour Scheme, which is important not only to enable citizens from Pacific Island countries to take up low- and semi-skilled work opportunities in rural and regional Australia for up to five years but also to enable a transfer of vital capacity building in our area. What this will do is afford Australian employers access to a reliable and returning pool of workers.


I did hear what Senator Hanson had to say but the reality is, Senator Hanson, that there are job opportunities in rural and regional areas, and our farmers do require labour, particularly in the horticultural area. For this reason, there are job vacancies. Regrettably, there are people who do not wish to take up opportunities in those areas. But it's incumbent on us to ensure that Australian employers in regional and rural areas have availability, have a pool of workers that they can rely on to plan and to grow their businesses secure in the knowledge that workers will be available when needed.


The Pacific Labour Scheme will commence in July 2018 with an initial intake of up to 2,000 workers. It will focus on those sectors with projected employment growth in Australia which match a Pacific Island skill set. It will be employer sponsored and require, importantly, labour market testing to ensure that Australians have priority for local jobs. And it will contain protections to safeguard against worker exploitation. The important thing to understand is that, as part of this scheme, we will be focusing on sectors and industries where there are needs. In the accommodation and food services industry, for example, hospitality and tourism, employment levels are projected to grow by around 100,000 for the five years to May 2022. In the healthcare and social assistance industry, in aged care and in disability care, employment levels are projected to grow by around 250,000 for the five years to May 2022.


Of course, in an ageing population and with the introduction of the NDIS, there is going to be a greater need for us to fill jobs in these two vitally important sectors. Also, in the non-seasonal agriculture, forestry and fishing industries, employer demand remains high, but employment levels are projected to decrease by 2,400 workers, or 2.4 per cent, for the five years to May 2022. This scheme will be flexible, but it will be vitally important to those sectors and industries where there is a genuine shortage of Australian workers. But, more importantly, it will be employer-driven where an employer has demonstrated that they cannot fill these positions from the Australian labour market.


I will conclude my remarks on the importance of immigration in this way: Australia is a country of migrants. Migration has been a feature of our past. It is a feature of our present. And it will be a feature for the future. We have a wonderful migration legacy. There are so many people in this country who are, today, occupying positions and contributing to Australian society and who but for our successful migration program could not have made that contribution. So, Senator Hanson, I think it is important to put migration and our migration intake into context and to emphasise the importance that migration has made to Australia, to our history and to our heritage.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",NXT,2017-10-19,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (17:16):  Last night, I thought it may have been my very last speech in this chamber. But here I am! I'm still here and still waiting for the wise women and men of the High Court to determine the outcome of the so-called 'citizenship seven' case. But I'm very pleased that I'm still here because it gives me an opportunity to repudiate what Senator Hanson said and to endorse what Senator Fierravanti-Wells said. I look forward to Senator Dastyari's contribution.


I am very proudly the child of migrant parents. My father, Theodore, came here from Cyprus in 1951. He came here just as my mother, Georgia, did in 1956 from Greece—wanting a better life and wanting a chance to contribute to this wonderful country of Australia that they adopted as their own. And can I emphasise that neither of my parents sought dual citizenship once they became Australian citizens. They are very proud of the fact that they are Australian citizens and that they have contributed to this nation.


We are a nation where migration has been such an integral and important part of this nation's development. Almost one in two Australians were either born overseas or have at least one of their parents born overseas. That is testament to what a great success Australia has been as a multicultural nation. It reminds me of the words of former US President Jimmy Carter, who said this:


Different people, different beliefs, different yearnings, different hopes, different dreams. We become not a melting pot but a beautiful mosaic.


Migration has made Australia part of the beautiful mosaic we have today.


What Senator Hanson said about the economic impact of migration was fundamentally wrong. Study after study—whether an OECD study or a local study in South Australia—indicates that, with an orderly migration program, with a sensible, well-planned migration program, it clearly has direct and net economic benefits for Australia. It adds to the economic wealth of the nation. It deals with issues such as ageing populations, it deals with issues such as genuine skill shortages, particularly in regional communities, and it builds those communities.


To blame international students, as Senator Hanson did, for our increasing electricity prices is absurd. To blame international students for water rates going up is absurd. It has more to do with failed energy policies and bad administration than anything to do with international students. When you consider that international students play such a vital role to Australia's economy—it's one of our biggest export earners, it's the third-biggest export earner behind iron ore and coal and it is, conservatively, worth $21.8 billion, which is the figure from last year and which does not include education consultancy services, royalties from intellectual property or income from correspondence courses—it is a huge earner for this country and it is something that, unambiguously, builds this country up.


Of course we need to have an orderly program. Of course there are issues of proper and appropriate border security so that we do not have an immigration policy in any way determined by people smugglers. But we must acknowledge the benefits of migration to this country. We must acknowledge what the OECD says in its position papers and the research that it's done—that migration is good for the economy with a proper and orderly migration program and that migrant workers make important contributions to the labour market and to spur innovation and economic growth. They contribute more in taxes and social contributions than they receive in individual benefits, according to the OECD study. These are important issues that we cannot ignore.


We cannot have a debate on migration being dictated by irrationality and xenophobia. This is something that we must deal with, because it is wrong to say that migration is a drag on the economy. Indeed, in my home state of South Australia, we have a situation where our population growth has fallen behind the rest of the nation. We have an ageing population, we have a drag on economic growth, we have regional depopulation, and we have a disproportionate reliance on owner-managers who are, on average, older and cannot sell their businesses.


That is why the work of Migration Solutions, in conjunction with many other key stakeholders in South Australia—including the work done by the SA Centre for Economic Studies—indicates that a balanced migration program to encourage more people to come to South Australia, to encourage the economic growth that comes with it, to deal with population imbalances and to deal with the ageing demographic would be a clear net benefit. When you see Melbourne and Sydney bursting at the seams, I say to the federal government and to state governments that you need to go back to a regional program where you acknowledge the benefits of migration to low-population and low-economic-growth areas. Done properly and sensibly, it will deliver real economic benefits to a state such as South Australia. Mark Glazbrook, the CEO of Migration Solutions, says:


Unfortunately, the current migration system does not support South Australian businesses, particularly in regional areas.


There are skills gaps. There are gaps in terms of businesses being filled. As ageing owners of these businesses want to leave their communities, there's no-one to replace them. That is why investment migrants and business migrants are very important to that.


Of course, if we have skills shortages in this country as a result of failures in our vocational training system, we need to deal with those. For instance, in the automotive sector, there is the shortage of 27,000 skilled employees that the Motor Trades Association has spoken about; I launched their report a few weeks ago. These are issues that point to policy failures, but they are not the fault of our migration policy. We can do both. We can fill our skills shortages primarily with young, Australian-born workers, but we also have other skill shortages which we need migration to fill.


I think it's important to indicate that the UDIA in 2014, prior to the state election, released a policy document entitled Growing South Australia to economic and social prosperity. In it, the following observation was made about South Australia:


… if we do not grow then we are locked within our existing paradigm. Only population growth can deliver the changes we need to make to urban form, public infrastructure and service delivery.


Incredibly and inexcusably, since then the state's rate of population growth has gone backwards. The population situation in SA has gone from bad to worse to critical. The data released at the end of last year shows that SA's population growth has fallen to just 0.5 per cent, an increase of just 9,300 per annum, whereas seven years ago the state's population growth was 1.3 per cent, with an annual increase of more than 21,000. ABS figures released last year show that Melbourne grew by 2.1 per cent in 2014-15, Sydney by 1.7 per cent, Brisbane by 1.6 per cent, and the ACT by 1.3 per cent. Adelaide's growth was an anaemic 0.9 per cent, just above Hobart's, which was 0.8 per cent. Victoria, like Melbourne, is racing ahead at 2.1 per cent population growth.


All I am saying is that a proper, well planned, well reasoned migration policy is unambiguously a good thing for our nation; and it is particularly good for South Australia, which has been struggling with low population growth. I want to emphasise this so it's not misrepresented by my political opponents: if we had a population growth strategy in areas of low population growth and low economic growth to encourage business migrants—a program designed to facilitate and boost economic growth, jobs and training opportunities—that would be a good thing for South Australia and a good thing for our country.


Looking at demand in regional areas, where there has been a dearth of positions that need to be filled and there is no other way to fill those positions, that needs to be looked at. We need to be able to attract prospective migrants willing and able to invest in designated areas such as South Australia for extended periods. This could involve a four-year provisional visa with a pathway to permanent residency over several more years. We also need to consider a class of visa for business start-ups in designated areas—again, binding visa holders to specific regions for a specified number of years so that they can establish themselves in those communities. This will revive regional areas and lift population growth. If Victoria and New South Wales get a little less population growth—which may be welcomed when you look at issues of congestion and services and the like—and these people go to areas of low population growth, that would be a win-win for those communities.


I repudiate what One Nation has said in relation to this. It is important that we have a reasoned and balanced population/migration policy that is good for our nation. We need to be very mindful of a debate that has more heat than light, that is devoid of facts, because the economic impact of a sensible migration policy is unambiguously good for a nation such as Australia. That is why I repudiate the premise of this motion and that is why we need to do much better to explain to all Australians that migration can deliver real benefits when done properly.

"Dastyari, Sen Sam",ALP,2017-10-19,"



Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (17:27):  Senator Hanson just got up in this chamber and said, 'In this debate, there is no respect any longer for being Australian.' In doing so, she implied that those of us who oppose extreme proposals by the Minister for Immigration to change citizenship fail to understand Australian identity. I say it is those like Senator Hanson who don't understand what it means to be Australian. What makes this country great, part of the great Australian story, has been our ability to embrace wave after wave of migrants, not our ability to reject migration. Our ability to take people with skills and talents from around the world and incorporate them into our society makes them great Australians and part of the great Australian story.


I'm proud to be in this chamber. Sitting in front of me is Senator Dodson, who can trace his history back to the First Australians up in Indigenous country in Western Australia. The success of this nation has been our ability to look at these generations that have come, to grow from those generations and to use migration as a tool to make this country great. Migration creates jobs, it creates culture, it creates identity and it makes being part of the Australian story so much greater. Frankly, we can all throw the economic statistics at one other and we can all throw around the facts and figures and show how powerful migration has been. But it's more than just the figures themselves: it's part of what it means to be Australian. And there's something very unique about the Australian story when it comes to migration.


But you have those, like Senator Hanson, who like to attack it. It's cheap politics and it's easy politics. Senator Hanson herself says that she's been banging on about this for 21 years, since she was first elected. And she has. But 21 years ago she was banging on about Asian migration. Now, 21 years later, it's about Muslims and it's about those from the Middle East. And 20 years from now it'll be about blaming another group, a third group—whichever group ends up coming next. It's the politics of fear, it's the politics of hate, it's the politics of division and, unfortunately, it's the politics that Senator Hanson is very, very effective at.


And the irony of all this is that sitting behind Senator Hanson today was Senator Roberts, someone who his own lawyer refers to as a natural-born Indian. That is a matter of fact—he is part of the great Australian migration story. I think it was really telling when it was his lawyers in a recent High Court matter who were talking about how it would be 'un-Australian' for him to be treated differently from anyone else simply because of where he was born—that that would be something un-Australian. But they went on to say of him:


I'm trying to get myself in the same boat as Mr Joyce and Senator Nash, and then I want to demonstrate that I'm actually in a better boat.


Now, I welcome Senator Roberts and wish him all the best in his boat journey. I know a lot of Australians—migrants, people who weren't born in this country—who made a boat journey of their own to be part of the Australian story. I think it's going to be telling if Senator Roberts is fortunate enough in his own legal matter and determined to be able to stay in the Australian Senate—we can say at the end of it that the only path for Senator Roberts to remain in the Australian Senate was to become a boat person while being a senator for One Nation. It's something that certainly will not be lost on any of us.


I know you'll listen to everything I say now, Senator Roberts. Senator Malcolm Roberts from One Nation, your own lawyer said that you're trying to get yourself in the same boat as Mr Joyce and Senator Nash, and that you want to demonstrate that you're in a better boat. So I wish you, as the first senator in this nation aspiring to be a boat person, the best on your boat journey. If you're fortunate enough, it will be great to have another migrant in this Australian Senate, be they Indian—as you clearly are.


The migrant story in this country is a powerful one. The migrant story is one that we should be proud of. I'm very conscious of time and I'm very conscious that there are other matters pressing in the Australian Senate, but I do want to stress the sheer economic benefits that come from immigration. The fact is that we have had 7.5 million people arrive since World War II who've helped to build Australia into a vibrant society. When it comes to the issues that this motion purports to address, like communications and NBN, these failures have nothing to do with migration and have everything to do with poor government planning. Certainly, we will demonstrate in estimates next week the failure of this government. When it comes to infrastructure, energy and housing, in fact, the story of migration is a strong and powerful one.


I also want to take this very brief opportunity to mention that when we're talking about migration, we're talking about the best of our society at times and those who really contribute to our society. I want to note that two of my very close friends, Mustafa and Zhalla, recently had a baby: Shershan Khattak Sayed. I note that, being the terrible, terrible friend that I am, I did not send a gift. But let me just say this: toys get broken and clothes get grown out of, but forever your son's name will be recorded in the Hansard of the Australian Senate! And, yes, that may demonstrate just what a cheap individual I am, but I still think it's a fantastic gift!

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2017-10-19,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (17:36):  Yesterday I attempted to speak to the third interim report of the Select Committee on Red Tape on environmental regulation; however, due to repeated interruptions, political stunts and senators talking, I was unable to complete my contribution. Accordingly, I wish to continue my remarks today and trust that this time other senators will allow me to complete them without disruption.


Rather than being a dry subject that causes some senators to doze off, chat in the back row or throw paper planes at each other, environmental regulation should be an issue of concern to everyone here, as the actual and opportunity costs to the nation run into many hundreds of millions of dollars in lost or delayed investment. This means lost or delayed employment opportunities for our fellow Australians. As an example, the Roy Hill Iron ore project in the Pilbara required more than 4,000 licences, approvals and permits for its preconstruction phase, delaying the project needlessly. Likewise, the Adani Carmichael mine in Central Queensland spent seven years in an approvals process, fighting more than 10 legal challenges and having to prepare a 22,000-page environmental impact statement. The IPA estimates that antidevelopment activism has caused delay and disruption valued at more than $1.2 billion over the past 17 years, and some projects never go ahead due to heightened risk of legal challenges and higher capital costs. 


Many of the recommendations of the committee concern aspects of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, including provisions that duplicate state laws. The committee recommends the Australian government expedite its review of this act, as required under section 522A, by bringing it forward to 2018. The Productivity Commission and the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee have both supported the establishment of a one-stop shop for assessment of projects to enable compliance with environmental regulations without duplication. This is something the red tape committee strongly supports. 


In terms of meeting environmental expectations, the committee recommends the adoption of a risk based approach to environmental assessments. This is in line with the views of the Minerals Council; COAG, which previously agreed to explore adopting trusted international standards in risk assessment; the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority; and the processes of the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority. The committee concluded that the broader adoption of a risk based approach offers a real opportunity to reduce unnecessary, expensive and burdensome red tape.


The committee also found that section 487 of the EPBC Act is clearly being misused by environmental activists. Given that other legislative and judicial processes already provide an avenue for legitimate appeal at the state and territory level, the committee recommends the government repeal this. The committee further heard a range of concerns relating to the adverse effect of native title regulations on project developments and the manipulation of land councils by environmental activists, and the causal impact of this on the impoverishment of Aboriginal people. Accordingly, as a means to both materially assist Aboriginal development and economic development more broadly, the committee recommends the government amend the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act to remove the ability of land councils to arbitrarily veto applications for exploration and/or mining licences.


To overcome landholder objections to mining, which have paralysed the exploitation of coal seam gas, the committee urges Commonwealth, state and territory governments to consider statutory royalty systems for the benefit of land owners. In response to concerns that the problem of environmental overregulation is even worse for leasehold properties than freehold, and this is an issue particularly in Western Australia, the committee recommends that state and territory governments identify opportunities to convert leasehold title to freehold title. The committee also recommended that regulatory oversight of activities on leasehold land be eased to put it on the same basis as freehold.


Throughout the inquiry, the committee heard again and again that environmental red tape is excessive and that, thanks to this, project approval processes are a bureaucratic nightmare. Ironically, the origin of the term 'red tape' is generally attributed to the 16th-century administrative system of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, which used red tape for priority documents which required immediate action. Given that red tape is now pernicious, corrosive and difficult to eradicate, it seems highly appropriate that Charles V is more notable for his army's spreading syphilis across Europe and thence to the rest of the world. In its efforts to cure the Australian economy of its own administrative social disease, the Red Tape Committee, not to mince words, seeks to beat the clap out of environmental overregulation. Like its venereal legacy of the great pox, the red-tape legacy of Emperor Charles V lives on in our own time and continues to be spread through the incautious infatuations of his Australian political successors.


I commend the interim report of the Select Committee on Red Tape to the Senate in the hope that whichever of the legacies of the Holy Roman Emperor that senators may have injudiciously embraced, the committee's recommendations will prove prophylactic. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

In response to concerns that the problem of environmental overregulation is even worse for leasehold properties than freehold, and this is an issue particularly in Western Australia, the committee recommends that state and territory governments identify opportunities to convert leasehold title to freehold title. The committee also recommended that regulatory oversight of activities on leasehold land be eased to put it on the same basis as freehold.


Throughout the inquiry, the committee heard again and again that environmental red tape is excessive and that, thanks to this, project approval processes are a bureaucratic nightmare. Ironically, the origin of the term 'red tape' is generally attributed to the 16th-century administrative system of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, which used red tape for priority documents which required immediate action. Given that red tape is now pernicious, corrosive and difficult to eradicate, it seems highly appropriate that Charles V is more notable for his army's spreading syphilis across Europe and thence to the rest of the world. In its efforts to cure the Australian economy of its own administrative social disease, the Red Tape Committee, not to mince words, seeks to beat the clap out of environmental overregulation. Like its venereal legacy of the great pox, the red-tape legacy of Emperor Charles V lives on in our own time and continues to be spread through the incautious infatuations of his Australian political successors.


I commend the interim report of the Select Committee on Red Tape to the Senate in the hope that whichever of the legacies of the Holy Roman Emperor that senators may have injudiciously embraced, the committee's recommendations will prove prophylactic. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.
