"Price, Roger, MP",ALP,2004-08-09,"—On behalf of the Standing Committee on Procedure I present the committee's interim report entitled Media coverage of House proceedings, including the chamber, Main Committee and committees, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. I am pleased to have this opportunity to present the Procedure Committee's interim report, which was released out of session on 29 June. The report covers an important aspect of the inquiry: access by the parliamentary press gallery to proceedings in the House, Main Committee and committees of the House. The report addresses both television images and still photography.
As this is likely to be the last report of the committee, I would like to place on record deep appreciation for the committee staff, in particular Judy Middlebrook and Peter Fowler, both of whom have made an outstanding contribution to the extensive work of the committee. I know that if our chair had been present she would have wished to make the same comments. I would also like to acknowledge the contribution of the chair, the honourable member for McPherson, and other members of the committee.
As part of its inquiry, the committee invited members of the press gallery, media managers, AUSPIC and staff from the Broadcasting section of the Department of Parliamentary Services to a roundtable discussion. The discussion covered current guidelines on media access and coverage, as well as proposals for amending the guidelines. I extend special thanks to Mr Neil Pickering from the Broadcasting section of the Department of Parliamentary Services for his support in providing technical information. Earlier, the committee had held a roundtable discussion with a range of persons, including your good self, Mr Speaker, the Deputy Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition, the Leader of the House, the Manager of Opposition Business, the whips and the Clerk. I would like to place on record the committee's appreciation for all those who attended, and especially for their contribution to this report.
The committee recognises that the policy governing access by the media and the implementation of that policy can most effectively be managed by one person, the Speaker. The television bureaus expressed the view that they are dependent on footage produced by the DPS and that they are disadvantaged in comparison to still photographers, who are allowed to take their own images. Not surprisingly, representatives from the print media pointed out that still photographers are disadvantaged when compared with television broadcasters, because they are limited mainly to images of question time.
The committee considered proposals by the television bureaus that would have allowed them to have their own camera operators in the galleries. There is an occupational and health difficulty with this proposal, associated with the physical presence of camera operators in the galleries, particularly at question time. A visit to the galleries with press gallery camera operators highlighted the fact that the eight television cameras operated by the DPS already occupy the best vantage positions for covering the chamber. They cover all angles and, being housed in the walls, do not interfere with public access.
The committee considers that one way of meeting the requirements of the television bureaus was better use of the so-called iso, or isolated, feeds. DPS broadcasting staff could take footage as requested by a television bureau on a cost recovery basis. This could supplement the current composite feed—as seen on channel 1 of the House Monitoring Service—which is made available at no cost to the gallery. 
The committee hopes that television broadcasting of public hearings by the parliamentary committees can be extended and applauds Sky News initiatives to increase the coverage of proceedings generally. Increasing the number of committee rooms with cameras would assist in this regard. The committee recommends that the Speaker revise the guidelines to permit access by still photographers to, as well as question time, discussions of matters of public importance, divisions and adjournment debates. If this proves satisfactory after a three-month trial period, perhaps further extensions of access could be considered. The committee was informed that technological changes to still cameras are not reflected in the relevant guidelines. The committee recommends that this should be corrected.
The committee has yet to finalise its views on all aspects of this inquiry and hopes that by presenting an interim report feedback will be provided which can be taken into account in the final report. The media is the principal way ordinary Australians are informed about parliamentary proceedings. The Leader of the Opposition has expressed the view that restrictions on the media need to be freed up. This report goes some way to that end.
What is clear is that the dialogue with the media was most worth while and there is merit in continuing that process to better appreciate its needs. This will, I suspect, not be the last report to recommend further changes to media guidelines. On behalf of the committee, I would like to thank the members of the press gallery, the media managers and others who helped us understand the issues.

"Haase, Barry, MP",LP,2004-08-09,"—I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak at the presentation of the Procedure Committee's interim report on media coverage of the House. This report is, in part, a response to questions which arose when photographs of a protester in the House were published earlier this year. The photographs breached the guidelines for still photography in the House and penalties were imposed by the Speaker. Not surprisingly, some sections of the media were a little unhappy about this outcome.
If there were no guidelines preventing coverage of demonstrations and protests, it is highly likely that there would be more photographs of these incidents in our newspapers and a consequent rise in the incidents themselves. We believe that parliamentary proceedings should not be available as a platform for protest. The ban on such photographs is a sensible policy and has the support of all members of the committee and, I believe, of members of both sides of this House. As Mr Speaker has noted in the past, anyone who wishes to have a voice in the chamber should first get elected by his or her fellow citizens.
Whilst there is unanimity on this point, there are differing views on media access to proceedings. Still photographers would like to be able to take photographs whenever anything they consider newsworthy happens. Television bureaus would like to be able to take their own footage of proceedings and not be completely dependent on the footage received from the Department of Parliamentary Services on the House monitoring service. As the deputy chair of the committee said, the interim report—which was released out of session but presented today—addresses both these points. 
Having met with representatives of the press gallery as well as AUSPIC photographers and parliamentary Broadcasting staff, the committee is inclined to ask the Speaker to extend the times at which still photographers can use the galleries. We think it reasonable that still photographers can take photographs during divisions, discussions of matters of public importance and adjournment debates as well as question time, which is already covered. We do think it is important that there continue to be rules on when photographers can be in the public galleries and how many should be there, for both security and public safety reasons.
To move on to video recordings of proceedings: we were asked by representatives from the television networks to review their access. There are eight cameras here in the chamber and they are placed at best possible positions in special housing in the walls to cover every aspect of the chamber. The cameras are operated by parliamentary staff. Images from the television cameras are mixed in an editing suite and the resulting footage is available on channel 1 of the House monitoring service. This footage is provided free of charge to the press gallery. The television bureaus want to continue using this source of video footage but supplement it with their own footage. They suggested a pooling arrangement using one video camera on each side gallery.
To investigate the practicality of this suggestion, committee staff accompanied press gallery camera operators to the galleries. The area used by still photographers turned out to be quite unsuitable for video cameras. It might be possible to get useful footage by placing video cameras in fixed positions in the front row, but it would put the safety of the public at risk if the camera operators moved around whilst the galleries were fully occupied. On the other hand, it would be too inflexible for the camera operators to require them to stay in the one position at busy times. Because of these practical problems, the committee investigated other ways of meeting the needs for more flexible footage for the television bureaus.
The committee heard evidence from Sky News, which is already televising extended parliamentary proceedings on its network. The committee applauds this endeavour and looks forward to a time when the public can see more than question time on their television sets. We particularly support extended coverage of parliamentary committees and the Main Committee. In relation to coverage of parliamentary committees, we acknowledge that the provision of more television cameras in committee rooms is a practical way of supporting better coverage.
In conclusion, I would like to remind the press gallery and others that this is an interim report and we welcome feedback. I thank our chair, Margaret May, who cannot be with us today; our deputy chair, Mr Price; and all members of the committee for their work during this very busy year. Thank you also to the secretariat for their continued good and hard work. I commend this report to the House.

"Rudd, Kevin, MP",ALP,2004-08-09,"—The purpose of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Amendment (Review of Decisions) Bill 2004 is to change the test of `standing' in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975. The current test for `standing' in the AAT Act is defined in section 27 of the act. Subsection 27(2) of the act states:
An organization or association of persons, whether incorporated or not, shall be taken to have interests that are affected by a decision if the decision relates to a matter included in the objects or purposes of the organization or association.
Subsection 27(3) of the act states:
Subsection (2) does not apply in relation to a decision given before the organization or association was formed or before the objects or purposes of the organization or association included the matter concerned.
In recent years, the AAT, the Federal Court and the High Court have tended to narrow the definition of those persons who can bring a decision for review before the AAT when those persons are seeking to act on behalf of another person or persons whose interests are affected by the administrative decision in question. Most recently, a decision by Deputy President Wright of the AAT in February 2002 in the matter of Rudd v. the Minister for Transport and Regional Services found that the applicant had no standing as a member of parliament, because a person cannot derive standing from being an elected representative, without having a special interest of his or her own. While Deputy President Wright in turn found that the applicant did have standing as a result of a special interest of his own, as a homeowner and occupant whose enjoyment of his property might be adversely affected by a decision of the transport minister, this decision of Deputy President Wright was subsequently overturned in the Federal Court.
Militating against these recent decisions is a decision by Justice Vincent in the Supreme Court of Victoria in the matter of the Shire of Beechworth v. the Attorney-General of Victoria in 1991. The principle that Justice Vincent enlivened in his decision on standing and the Beechworth Shire Council was that elected representatives can have standing in representing the interests of their constituents. However, the advice I have received since the High Court's most recent decision on the question of standing, in the matter of Allan v. Transurban, is that it is unlikely that the courts will find any more liberally on the question of standing in the absence of statutory change. In other words, despite the earlier finding of the Victorian Supreme Court in the matter of the Beechworth Shire Council, the tendency in recent judgments has been to tighten the definition of standing, thereby flying in the face of much of the rationale that underpinned the establishment of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal under the Whitlam government in the mid-1970s. 
For these reasons I am introducing a private member's bill which would have the legislative effect of clarifying the capacity of a member of parliament to act on behalf of his or her local community when his or her community has had its interests adversely affected by an administrative decision of the federal government. The scope of this proposed legislative amendment is much narrower than that which has been proposed by the Australian Law Reform Commission, which has expressed concern about the incremental erosion of the capacity of the AAT to act as an appropriate legal forum for laypersons seeking redress from administrative decisions that have impacted on their interests.
The rationale for this private member's bill of course comes from my own experience in seeking to overturn a decision by the federal transport minister to endorse the Brisbane Airport Corporation Master Plan, which in turn recommended the construction of a parallel runway at Brisbane airport, a decision which will have significantly adverse effects on the community I represent in Brisbane. While this private member's bill, if accepted by the parliament, comes too late in my fight to overturn the Howard government decision to approve the construction of a parallel runway at Brisbane airport, it may help other members of parliament dealing with similar matters in the future, where they seek to stand up and fight for their local communities against government decisions that adversely affect those communities.
Regrettably, as I have just noted, in the case of Brisbane airport the parallel runway which has been proposed by the Brisbane Airport Corporation will be built. This is despite the fact that submissions against the construction of the parallel runway have been lodged on two occasions as part of the master plan process and despite the fact that there have been significant large-scale protest activities on behalf of the local community to this effect as well. Notwithstanding this opposition, the Howard government, through the transport minister, has on two occasions endorsed the Brisbane Airport Corporation Master Plan and its recommendation for the construction of a parallel runway. The construction will proceed; I am advised that this means the Brisbane Airport Corporation has a legal right to proceed. My efforts on behalf of my local community will now concentrate on the development of a noise management plan for the local community.

"Organ, Michael, MP",AG,2004-08-09,"—I would like to inform the House of the shameful position adopted by this government regarding the Draft Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. I do so on behalf of Mr Roy `Dootch' Kennedy of the Kuradgi Sandon Point Aboriginal tent embassy in my electorate of Cunningham. Under the auspices of the United Nations, the declaration was drafted between 1985 and 1995 by the Working Group on Indigenous Populations and then handed over to a special working group comprising nation states and Indigenous organisations. Prior to the election of the Howard government in 1996, Australia was leading the way in supporting Indigenous rights. However, things changed dramatically and tragically when the present government took control. In a disgraceful move, in 1998 this government rejected the use of the term `self-determination'. This is a core issue for Indigenous peoples around the world, and the decision was soundly opposed by all Indigenous groups and many governments. Today Australia, the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Japan are seen as the fiercest challengers to the fundamental principles underlying the declaration, including those of self-determination, promotion of Indigenous language and collective rights. 
Dootch Kennedy, one of Australia's representatives at last year's working group meeting in South Africa, told me only this morning that the Australian proposal would:
... water down the rights of Indigenous Australians and make it more difficult to pursue those rights in the future.
The working group is due to meet in September and then in December to finalise the declaration and pass it on to the UN for ratification. This present government shames us all by its opposition to the draft declaration and its advocacy against Indigenous rights and sovereignty.",REPS,<title>STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS</title>,<title>Draft Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</title>,Statements by Members,2,1,speech
"Latham, Mark, MP",ALP,2004-08-09,"—My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer him to the call for greater honesty in government by 43 eminent former military, diplomatic and Public Service leaders and the claim by the former Chief of the Defence Force, General Peter Gration, that the statement also represents the views of many currently serving military officers, diplomats and public servants.
Honourable members interjecting—
—Order! I will deal with members who interrupt, from either side. The Leader of the Opposition has the call.
—My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer him to the call for greater honesty in government by 43 eminent former military, diplomatic and Public Service leaders and the claim by the former Chief of the Defence Force, General Peter Gration, that the statement also represents the views of many currently serving military officers, diplomats and public servants. Doesn't the government now face an unprecedented crisis of credibility as a result of its repeated dishonesty? When is the Prime Minister going to start telling the truth to the Australian people? What positive measures does the Prime Minister propose to restore the nation's trust in its Australian government? ",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Intelligence: Weapons of Mass Destruction</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,question
"Howard, John, MP",LP,2004-08-09,"—The short answer to the question is no. The slightly longer answer to the question is as follows. On behalf of the government, I reject the claims that have been made by the 43 people. I completely reject the claims that have been made. Could I just take the House back to the basis of the claim. The basis of the claim of dishonesty and deception is that the government deliberately misled the Australian people regarding the existence of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction when the decision was taken to involve this country in the military conflict.
Let me point out to the House that it been found by not only the Flood inquiry but also the Jull committee inquiry—which included in its membership the current shadow minister for defence; a former defence minister in the Keating government, Senator Robert Ray; as well as government members—that there was absolutely no evidence that the government had put any pressure on the intelligence agencies. The debate in March last year was not about whether Iraq had weapons of mass destruction but, indeed, about how we should deal as a nation and as a world with the possession of those weapons of mass destruction.
It is interesting, in the light of the comments that have been made by General Gration, that General Gration himself, in November 2002, in an article published by the Australian National University, had this to say:
I think we can accept that Iraq has numbers of weapons of mass destruction and has programs to develop them further.
They were, in fact, the words. I do not criticise General Gration for those remarks. I merely point out—
—That was a policy failure.
—The member for Wills! Standing order No. 55 applies as equally to answers as it does to questions.
—that, in November 2002, General Gration himself said that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. I think it is instructive that a few months earlier the shadow minister for foreign affairs had said that it was an empirical fact—and you do not get any tougher than that—that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. May I say to the 43 people who penned that letter that in order to establish a charge of deception you have to prove that the government deliberately set out to mislead the Australian people, and they have not done that. In fact, their principal spokesman has acknowledged that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. But if you do not want to rely on General Gration's remarks and you do not want to rely on the shadow minister for foreign affairs, may I draw your attention to an interview on Lateline between Tony Jones and Robert Ray on 1 March this year on the Jull committee report. This is what Tony Jones asked:
Robert Ray, what do you think about that? Were the Australian people effectively misled by the Government's reliance on flawed intelligence to justify the war?
Robert Ray replied:
Well, the key question is were they deliberately misled. 
And his answer was:
I believe not.
That is what Robert Ray said. So you have General Gration, you have the shadow minister for foreign affairs and you have a former Labor Party defence minister all saying that, of course, there was no deception. In fact, both General Gration and the shadow minister for foreign affairs argued that Iraq did possess weapons of mass destruction. I repeat: the debate last year was not about whether Iraq had weapons of mass destruction; the debate was about how you dealt with it. It remains the case that if the coalition of the willing had not acted Saddam Hussein would still be in power in Iraq, with all the horrific human rights consequences that that would have entailed.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Intelligence: Weapons of Mass Destruction</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,answer
"Ticehurst, Kenneth, MP",LP,2004-08-09,—My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer outline to the House data released today on housing finance commitments? What does this data indicate about the housing market? Is the Treasurer aware of any recent policies that may have had an effect on housing market conditions?,REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Finance: Housing</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,question
"Costello, Peter, MP",LP,2004-08-09,"—I thank the honourable member for Dobell, and I acknowledge all of the wonderful work that he does for his constituents in that electorate. Today the Australian Bureau of Statistics released the housing finance commitments data for the month of June, which showed that the total value of housing finance fell 4.7 per cent and is 9.5 per cent lower over the course of the year. This is the fifth decline in the last eight months, and total housing finance is now 20 per cent lower than the peak in October 2003. In particular, the figures were led by a fall in housing finance for investor financing, which was down 8.8 per cent in June and is now 30.4 per cent lower than its peak in October last year. 
As a consequence, we are beginning to see something show up in those figures that I have been warning of for some time—that unsustainable rises, particularly in investor financing, could not be continued. For the last 12 to 18 months the government has been warning that, as supply exceeds demand, you would see a correction in relation to that market. Indeed, as I have also said in the House, the government welcomes the fact that finance appears to be stabilising on a more sustainable base. The government has also indicated that it welcomes the fact that prices may well be plateauing. All of the available indicators show that house price growth in the first half of 2004 either moderated or declined slightly. Auction clearance rates have fallen sharply, and building approvals have fallen by around 13 per cent.
A consequence of all of this is that the proportion of first home buyers is rising. The number of loans to first home buyers has increased around 30 per cent since the trough of January 2004. From a low of 12.8 per cent, the finance data shows that first home buyers accounted for 14.4 per cent in June. So we are seeing first home buyers come back into the market and that proportion rising again. It still has quite a way to go to get back to historical levels, but it is rising from the trough.
In a situation where finance is turning down—particularly turning down in the investor area—one of the worst economic responses that you could possibly introduce would be a new tax on investor financing. Who would introduce a new tax on investor financing right at the time when investor financing has declined by 30.4 per cent from its peak in October? Who would introduce it? None other than the state Labor government of New South Wales under Premier Carr and Treasurer Egan, who blundered into this market precisely at the wrong time with a new exit tax on investors who are in the housing market in New South Wales. It illustrates the damage you can do if you are an incompetent government that does not understand an economic cycle.
Why do I raise that? I raise it for another reason. To my knowledge, the only person in this House who has previously advocated a capital gains tax on the family home is the member for Werriwa. I regret to inform the House that the member for Werriwa was, to my knowledge, the only person who has ever advocated the introduction of a capital gains tax on the family home. It was also the member for Werriwa in his celebrated first interview on the Lateline program who advocated revisiting negative gearing in the property market. It is true that it was the policy that lasted from Lateline to lunchtime, but it did actually take its place on that Lateline program.
The government has been saying for quite some time that it is important to bear in mind that a market that is growing at 20 or 30 per cent is unsustainable and that what we needed was some sustainable plateauing of prices and development in relation to the housing cycle. We are now seeing the evidence of that come through. We are seeing it in market clearance, we are seeing it in loan approvals, we are seeing it in credit and we are seeing it in relation to construction. But this will take very careful management, and certainly not the kind of incompetent management we have seen practised by the New South Wales Labor government and advocated by the member for Werriwa.

That this House:
(1)	notes:
(a)	reports of many independent observers, including those sent by the African Union, that the so-called Janjaweed militias have carried out numerous massacres, summary executions, rapes, burnings of towns and villages, and forcible depopulations in the Darfur region of western Sudan;
(b)	reports by Human Rights Watch that the Sudanese military regime has armed, supported and supervised the militias, and that Sudanese government forces have directly participated in some of these actions;
(c)	estimates by reputable sources that at least 300,000 people have already been killed or died as a direct or indirect result of this campaign, that more than a million people have been made homeless, that more than 100,000 have been forced to seek refuge in Chad, and that an unknown but large number of women have been raped in the course of these attacks; and
(d)	reports that the militias have destroyed mosques, killed Muslim religious leaders, and desecrated Qurans in the course of their attacks;
(2)	condemns the military regime in Sudan for instigating a policy of forcibly depopulating areas considered disloyal to Khartoum and which has led to massive social dislocation and deaths of innocent civilians, in particular, the Fur, Masalit and Zaghawa ethnic groups in Darfur;
(3)	holds the Sudanese regime responsible for the crimes committed by its armed forces and by the militias under its control; 
(4)	welcomes the decision by the Australian Government to allocate $20 million for relief in Darfur, but calls on the Government to make a significantly greater commitment to aid the people of Darfur through appropriate international agencies;
(5)	notes that UN Security Council Resolution 1556 has imposed an arms embargo on Sudan and authorised the creation of an international protection force for Darfur; and
(6)	calls on the Australian Government:
(a)	in the event that this force does not succeed in preventing further armed attacks on the people of Darfur, to take immediate action at the United Nations to ensure that the UN force is given a mandate to disarm the militias, secure the withdrawal of Sudanese government forces from the area, protect the people of Darfur and enable all refugees to return to their homes;
(b)	to make a contribution, proportionate with Australia's military capacity, of Australian forces to any peace-keeping force dispatched to Sudan under a United Nations mandate; and
(c)	to take action at the United Nations to secure the prosecution for war crimes at the appropriate international tribunal of President Omar Bashir and other officials of the Sudanese military regime responsible for the massacres of civilians in Darfur.
I thank the House for the opportunity to raise this important motion. It appears that 30,000 to 50,000 people have already died in the desperate situation in the Darfur region in Sudan. Since I submitted this motion for consideration last month the situation has, if anything, grown worse. Let me quote what CNN's chief international correspondent, Christiane Amanpour, reported today:
There could be 300,000 people dead in Darfur by the end of the year, and that's if aid gets to them rapidly. If aid does not get there quickly, a million people could die in Darfur by the end of this year. So the need to get the Sudanese government to react and to end this is very, very urgent right now.
That is a quote from someone on the spot at the moment. When we hear of hundreds of thousands of people dying it is usually in connection with some natural disaster such as an earthquake or a famine, but what is happening in Darfur is not a natural disaster; it is an entirely man-made catastrophe being brought about by the Islamist dictatorship of General Bashir in the Sudan.
Many members will know that there has been a long-running secessionist movement in south and south-western Sudan, which is mainly black African and Christian, seeking independence or autonomy from the mainly Arab north. Now the military regime in Khartoum has decided to bring this matter to a head by launching a massive campaign of ethnic cleansing against the peoples of the Darfur region. The so-called Janjaweed militias are being used as a cover by the Sudanese government for its activities, but reliable reports make it clear that the government itself has planned and instigated attacks. People have testified to Amnesty that Sudanese Antinov aircraft have dropped bombs on columns of people leaving villages and that the Sudanese air force has participated in direct attacks on people in the Darfur region.
As the motion I have moved notes, as many as 30,000 people have already been killed and about one million have been forced to flee their homes. Several hundred thousand have fled to Chad, a very poor country which cannot afford to support these refugees. They are currently in squalid camps and in immediate danger of starvation and disease, as we can see on any of the channels that are beaming into Parliament House this afternoon. But they are the lucky people of Darfur because at least they can be reached by international aid. Perhaps half a million people have been displaced inside Sudan and no-one really knows what is happening to these people. Clearly the Sudanese regime wants all these people either dead or driven from the country, and so far the regime is being allowed to get away with, quite literally, murder on a massive scale. 
It is only a few months since this House marked the 10th anniversary of the genocide in Rwanda, where nearly a million people were killed, when the United Nations and the international community did little. I am pleased to see that, perhaps as a result of the international concern over that experience, we seem to have learned some lessons. The UN Security Council and the Secretary General have been very active in demanding that Sudan disarm the militias and prevent further attacks on civilians in Darfur, and have threatened sanctions if the demands are not met. The African Union, to its credit, has taken a similar stand, and France and Nigeria have dispatched troops to Chad where it borders Sudan.
I note the Arab League has said that they will dispatch troops rather than have British or American troops in that area, but clearly more is needed if a disaster on the scale of Rwanda is to be prevented in Darfur. The Sudanese regime, and General Bashir personally, must be told that the most serious consequences will befall them if they fail to stop immediately their campaign of genocide in Darfur. Large-scale humanitarian aid must be dispatched at once, followed by a peace-keeping force with the power to enter Sudan and rescue the people of Darfur if necessary. I think it is quite understandable that the Arab League would prefer to set its own house in order rather than have outsiders come and do it.
I do not move this motion in any partisan spirit. I note that the Australian government has announced $12 million in relief funding for the people in camps in Chad, and I welcome that. I note that the government has indicated its willingness to contribute to a peacekeeping force, and I welcome that too. But I think we all need to understand both the scale and the urgency of this crisis. I also note that there are many government members who will speak in favour of this motion. We are talking about up to a million people being in immediate danger of death. If the invasion of Iraq was justified after the fact by the doctrine of pre-emptive humanitarian intervention, as the government now maintains, then I would like to know why very firm action against the regime of Sudan cannot be justified on the same grounds. I am not arguing in favour of armed intervention, but sanctions and other things must be contemplated in a month or so when the UN Security Council considers these matters. (Time expired)

"Baird, Bruce, MP",LP,2004-08-09,"—I rise to support this motion on the situation in Sudan and also to congratulate the member for Melbourne Ports for bringing it into the House. The motion is similar to one I had prepared for the same day, so I am very glad we combine it and express the views of both sides of the House in condemning the Sudanese government for allowing this incredible humanitarian disaster to proceed. We call on governments around the world and the UN to take rapid action to minimise the number of deaths. We know that 30,000 to 50,000 people have already died in Sudan and that that number significantly increases each day. It is true to say that, unless significant aid is introduced into the region, more lives will be lost and it is possible that we could see as many as one million people die in that area. The motion calls on all of us in this House to take urgent action to do our small part to ensure that that outcome does not occur. 
The UN has described Darfur as the worst humanitarian crisis in the world today. This is a catastrophe that demands immediate international action. We on this side of the House applaud the government for responding generously to the crisis in Darfur. We welcome the announcement on 27 July by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of an additional $12 million in emergency humanitarian assistance, which brings to $20 million the government's commitment and contribution to the region since May. This is a significant amount. As events unfold, it is likely that we will see a further commitment of funds to try to minimise the impact of events as people are simply removed from their own homes and forced into Chad. We have seen images on our television sets of many thousands of children dying from the appalling starvation that exists in this area. That highlights the need for aid to be sent to this region as soon as possible. Funds that the government has provided are being channelled through major UN agencies, such as WFP and UNICEF, and NGOs, including ICRC, Oxfam, CARE and World Vision to provide emergency food, water supplies, sanitation and health care for displaced people in Darfur and Sudanese refugees in Chad.
I have noticed that World Vision have ramped up their campaign in recent days and that Tim Costello is over there and drawing attention to the problem. I also noticed that a Channel 9 journalist reported on it last night. We need a greater emphasis to make people aware of the problem and to ensure that the NGOs receive funds to help make their aid programs significant so that they assist in the best way possible.
There is still a huge need for emergency assistance to keep displaced people in Darfur alive over the next few months. With the onset of the wet season in western Sudan, there is a real risk that many displaced people will be cut off from international aid efforts. The security situation is also restricting the access of humanitarian agencies and many thousands are now at risk of starvation and disease. We understand that various UN agencies and NGOs involved in the provision of aid are still well short of the funds and resources they require to save the victims of this conflict. We need this combined effort of governments around the world as well as the initiative and determination of the UN to not only condemn the government of Sudan but also to galvanise aid efforts to ensure that people recognise the seriousness of the unfolding tragedy.
Although Australia cannot be expected to be the leading donor in Africa, we should consider favourably any further request. It is vital that the international community focuses on what is happening there. We welcome the adoption of UN Security Council resolution 1556, which calls on the Sudanese government to end the humanitarian disaster in Darfur and disarm the Janjaweed militias within 30 days. We are pleased that the government of Sudan has taken steps to facilitate humanitarian relief in Darfur in line with its 3 July commitments to the UN Secretary General Kofi Annan. We urge further strong action by the government of Sudan to ensure desperately needed aid reaches the people of Darfur. I commend the motion to the House.

"Lawrence, Dr Carmen, MP",ALP,2004-08-09,"—I had pleasure in seconding this motion moved by the member for Melbourne Ports. We have already heard the outlines—bare as they may be, given the time we have available—of the catastrophe that has unfolded in the Darfur region of Sudan. Some of us have seen the images and read material, and there is now a considerable amount of information available because of reports by groups such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the International Crisis Group and the UN itself. So we cannot plead ignorance of this very serious problem. 
As we have heard, it was described by the United Nations in March as the `world's greatest humanitarian crisis'. We should respond accordingly to the estimated 30,000 deaths—some put it higher; the displacement, both internally and over the border, particularly into Chad, of some 1.2 million people; and the systematic rape of thousands, maybe tens of thousands, of women. I want to return to this in the body of my speech. Homes and crops have been burned and cattle—the main form of subsistence for many people in the region—killed or looted, so we have looming starvation and the related illnesses that go with that.
This amounts to a massive human rights violation. It has been committed in a systematic manner by the so-called Janjaweed—often, it would appear, at least according to Amnesty International and others, `in coordination with Sudanese soldiers and the Sudanese air force, with total impunity'. According to Amnesty International the Sudanese government themselves have clearly been supporting and indeed sponsoring the Janjaweed and have engaged in their own arbitrary arrests, incommunicado detentions, disappearances and torture of their own citizens, unfair and summary trials, confessions extracted under torture, amputations, floggings and the death penalty.
There has been violence perpetrated particularly against women in Darfur. Amnesty has collected personal testimonies from some hundreds of women, mainly those in the camps, because they are not able to get access to women in Sudan itself. They tell appalling stories of rape, abductions, sexual slavery, torture and, of course, forced displacement. As we well know, the consequences of rape in the context of civil violence are many and varied, for the individuals and for the society. First of all, you get in societies such as this the inevitable social stigmatisation of women who have been raped. In the process of their being set outside their communities, there is considerable destruction of the social fabric of those communities, because it is women who are responsible for the children and other dependants, and they are the main caregivers in these societies. Of course, for the women themselves, there is the trauma of the rape itself and the health consequences.
One of the tragedies is that in a society such as this, with a taboo against speaking about such matters, women are really very hesitant to speak openly and to complain. The risk of stigmatisation is great. As a result, it is certain that they are not getting the necessary medical and psychological care. They cannot even begin to speak about it. Obviously, in the long term we are going to need to investigate what has happened to these people and attempt to reintegrate them into their communities.
I think it is worth pausing briefly to think about the use of rape in civil conflict. Death is obviously the worst possible outcome for any individual, and a great many men have been killed in this conflict. A lot of the people in the camps are women caring for children, and rape has been used as a form of humiliation of these women. The stories show that they have been raped in public, often in front of their husbands and relatives and the wider community, so their shame—as they would see it—is known. It is meant to humiliate them as well as to injure them. From time to time it has included gang rapes. There are reports of the rape of pregnant women and of killings of unborn children—one woman's stomach was slit, with the observation from one of the soldiers of the Janjaweed militia: `It's the child of an enemy.' Women who resist are beaten, stabbed, killed, and tortured to reveal, sometimes, their husbands' whereabouts. There are systematic abductions and sexual slavery. Women are being held in Janjaweed camps. 
In supporting this motion, I want to draw attention to the fact that it is vital for the United Nations to stick to its timetable; for the African Union and the Arab League to pressure Sudan to act to prevent this catastrophe unfolding even further; and of course for Australians, as they do so generously, to do what they can to support the humanitarian aid effort and to ensure that we pay attention to the people in these parts of the world, who may not look like our neighbours but are people just like us.

"Moylan, Judi, MP",LP,2004-08-09,"—First, I thank the member for Melbourne Ports for bringing this matter to the parliament and giving us an opportunity to speak on this motion. There is no doubt that the world has watched in horror as we see the unfolding of a tragedy of monumental proportions. I am sure that every person who is aware of this situation is deeply concerned about the shocking abuses of human rights in Darfur. I support the comments from the member for Fremantle that what we are seeing is the men being killed and the women being systematically abused in a very deliberate campaign of indiscriminate killings, looting, mass rape and wanton destruction of property, which all amounts, in anyone's language, to ethnic cleansing.
It is particularly disturbing to see growing evidence that the government of Sudan has encouraged, armed and supported the Janjaweed militias in their attacks against the people of Darfur. There is also evidence that the Sudanese air force has bombed villages in this region and that government officials have obstructed access of United Nations officials, international aid agencies and the media in an effort to conceal the true nature and extent of this terrible crisis. I know that many Australians have watched the horror scenes unfolding on their television screens, and I guess it brings these terrible events closer to home. As my colleague the member for Melbourne Ports said, as we think about the anniversary of the happenings in Rwanda where almost a million people were killed, we all need to speak out, speak up and condemn in no uncertain terms these terrible crimes against humanity.
I must say that I welcome our government's continued efforts, which I am sure are supported by those on the other side, to ensure that Sudan complies with the terms of United Nations Security Council resolution 1556 on Darfur, which calls on the Sudanese government to cooperate with the United Nations in allowing independent investigation of violations of human rights and international humanitarian law. The Sudanese government must end its support for the Janjaweed militias. It must prosecute all those who have committed ethnic cleansing and the atrocities in Darfur.
Again I welcome the intervention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Hon. Alexander Downer, who on 21 June wrote to the Sudanese foreign minister to express Australia's deep concern over the situation in Darfur, urging the government of Sudan to end its support for the Janjaweed; to disarm the militias and bring to justice the perpetrators of human rights violations; to commence negotiations with the Darfur rebel groups in an effort to reach a lasting and peaceful solution to the conflict there; and to give free access and freedom of movement to all humanitarian workers and agencies and facilitate the distribution of aid to the victims of conflict.
I must say there are many non-government agencies who have been involved in providing humanitarian aid. What we are seeing on our television screens, as I think the member for Melbourne Ports said, is just the tip of the iceberg. There are many thousands of people whose plight is unknown. But I know the Australian Red Cross, World Vision and UNICEF are all in there trying to alleviate the terrible suffering that we have seen amongst women and children in particular who are homeless, who have been abused and who have perhaps only disease and death to look forward to. I congratulate those who are involved in providing that aid. I hope that the Australian public will continue to give generously to support the tremendous efforts of our non-government agencies.

"Ferguson, Laurie, MP",ALP,2004-08-09,"—An earlier speaker said that the genesis of this might be seen as far back as March. I initially congratulate those 50 members of this parliament who signed a letter some months ago urging the administration to desist from certain practices. One of the more fascinating television glimpses after September 11 was actually in Sudan, where Sudan's minister for foreign affairs and other government dignitaries were rushing to the US embassy to sign a book of condolence and saying that Sudan would defend the US embassy there. It was a typical attempt by the government there to change its pariah status from that period when it had harboured bin Laden and when it had been attacked by the United States in regard to alleged chemical weapon work, but that attempt by Sudan to rehabilitate itself—to change its spots—has been dismally unsuccessful.
As previous speakers have indicated, the degree of collaboration between the government and the Janjaweed militia has been exposed by most commentators. Clearly the government have been logistically supportive of it. There have been bombings by Sudanese forces in conjunction with the Janjaweed. There is clear evidence that the Janjaweed's arms are supplied by the central administration and that they are very much implicated in this. Particularly cynical are the comments of a spokesman for the department, who described the UN resolution as a direct declaration of war and went on to say:
The door of the jihad is still open ...
The pure effrontery of this government, which instigates an attack upon black Muslims and then talks about launching a jihad to renew the war in the south! And they have come up with the outrageous allegations—such as those that were overnight mentioned at the Arab League—that basically Israel is behind this Darfur insurgency. The sheer abuse of religious prejudice by the government of Sudan is so thorough as to allege that what is happening is in some way a result of external interference. The notion that the UN has no right to push very strongly for action within 90 days to disarm these militias is preposterous, because quite clearly it is a regime that has historically been involved in the most, probably the only, clear-cut instance of slavery, sexual abuse of opponents et cetera being enforced by a government.
Peter Moszynski in an article in the Guardian Weekly this week commented that, with 50,000 expected to die in this latest surge added to the two million victims in the war in the south over past decades:
... President Omar al-Bashir is responsible for more deaths than Slobodan Milosevic, Saddam Hussein and Pol Pot put together.
That perhaps puts it in some context. He is certainly in there with some major international offenders. It gives some indication of the magnitude of repression instigated by this regime. They have unfortunately perhaps been given an impression that if they negotiate with their southern opponents—strongly related to the country's oil industry's needs—then they might be given a free hand in the north. There has been international criticism of the fact that they have felt the world would turn a blind eye to this oppression of the northern regions if they ended this war and gave some stability to the oil industry in the country. It is interesting to note that in total contravention of the peace treaty with the southern forces they moved 40,000 soldiers into that southern region to protect oil installations. 
Previous speakers have said that we support the government's efforts in voting $20 million to this international humanitarian disaster. I agree with them in regard to the need for adherence to the UN resolution and for the UN to stick to its guns. I deplore the degree to which the Arab League overnight seems to have given some comfort to the regime by being critical of some of this UN activity. I also support very strongly the other speakers who have said that we must maximise international efforts to make sure that humanitarian aid does get in, because, quite frankly, as the UN has indicated, it is a humanitarian disaster of the first order.

"Hunt, Gregory, MP",LP,2004-08-09,"—In supporting the motion moved by the member for Melbourne Ports in relation to the tragedy in Darfur in Sudan, I recall the words of William Shawcross, the great British author, who has said that some areas of the world are bathed in light, some areas of the world live in a half-light and there are those areas of the world which dwell in darkness. He was referring to the way in which the international media covers the different parts of the world.
In looking at this tragedy, I am reminded that in my own life I have had the opportunity—dark as it was—to visit Rwanda soon after the genocide there; to serve in Cambodia as Australia's chief electoral observer in 1998 and to witness the aftermath of the genocide there; and to work for the United Nations in Geneva chronicling some of the most extraordinary abuses in Bosnia, which included the rape of families, the mutilation of children and the murder of entire legions of young men. In each of those cases what struck me was the inaction and passivity of the international community.
This topic—this day, this moment—brings to life the challenge we face in Darfur in western Sudan. I want to make two brief points: firstly, that this is a recurring problem; and, secondly, that there is an inadequate set of international approaches to the solution. This problem has occurred in Ethiopia, Cambodia, Rwanda, Bosnia and Iraq. It is the problem of systemic, systematic and ruthless human rights abuse, which amounts to crimes against humanity. This case in Darfur, as the member for Fremantle pointed out, is characterised by a process of ethnic cleansing, including the most brutal and publicly humiliating practice of rape on a systematic community-wide basis, the utter humiliation of the women involved and the murder of children and adults on a systematic basis.
In the face of this activity, which is not new to the world that we know, how do we deal with it as an international community? I think there are two parts to the answer. There is a systemic weakness in that chapter 7 of the United Nations Charter recognises the role of the UN to take action in the case of threats to peace, breach of peace or acts of aggression. It does not formally recognise the need and opportunity for humanitarian intervention by the international community in the case of gross, systematic, prolonged and precipitous human rights abuse, and that is a conversation to which I dedicate myself over the coming decade. It is something which I am passionate about and committed to and believe is absolutely fundamental and necessary to the maintenance of peace and the prevention of crimes against humanity. There is work which as an international community we have to do. That is something which I believe we must work on. 
In the case of Sudan, there are fundamentals and we are involved in those. It is vital for the people of southern Sudan that the work and commitment of the United Nations is carried through. There must be backing to stop these crimes against humanity. There must be a willingness to carry through and to enforce the decisions that are made. There must be a commitment to bring in the African Union to carry on, on the ground, the work which is necessary to prevent abuse and to protect and promote a respect for human rights. These are the things which are fundamental. We need a systemic change and we need a commitment on the ground. Above all else, it is the African Union which can do that in a way which promotes civil harmony. But we must not cower in the face of crimes against humanity—for that is what is occurring. I commend this motion, I commend the mover and I urge the international community to take steps, both generically and in the particular case of Darfur.

"Ellis, Annette, MP",ALP,2004-08-09,"—It gives me pleasure to speak during the grievance debate today on a matter of very great importance not only to my constituency of Canberra but to the broader Australian community. In doing so, I would like to note that the local Liberal Party are currently distributing material around Canberra stating what I think is quite a laughable proposition—that it is only they who are the party dedicated to protecting Public Service integrity and Public Service jobs. When we look at the history of the Public Service, particularly in recent times, one would have to sit back and think that maybe they are joking a little. I would imagine that some of their representatives may be exercising selective memory when they talk about this. 
I would like to reflect on a comment that Treasurer Peter Costello made in his response to a question at the National Press Club on 12 May this year. He was asked how Canberrans can trust the coalition to increase jobs in Canberra `given that your administration axed 17,000 public sector jobs in its first term'. In his response, the Treasurer stated:
Now, I think you are coming from another angle, you are saying there should be more public servants, I think. I think you are saying that we have cut too many, but I don't think that is right. I think Canberra actually survived the cuts in the public service and I think it was the best thing that ever happened to it.
I am not sure whether he meant it was the best thing that has happened to the Public Service or the best thing that has happened to Canberra. In both cases I would debate that point with him quite seriously. I find it a little disturbing that he could have such a quick and simple response. The fact that Canberra as a community did survive—eventually—the sorts of things that happened in 1996 onwards in relation to jobs in this town has nothing to do with the Treasurer. I would suggest that it has everything to do with the entrepreneurship, hard work, dedication and sheer determination, despite those sorts of decisions, displayed by the small and larger sectors of the Canberra business community and the ACT government of the day.
I particularly pay tribute to the Canberra business community, because times really were very difficult at that point in our history. The only type of business in Canberra that was actually growing at the time—and I say this very seriously, because it was reflected in the news at the time—was the furniture removals business, because there were so many people being forced to leave this town. I recall that an article in the Canberra Times showed that, horrendously, the furniture removal business in Canberra was doing really well. Nobody else was, but it was.
I would like to look at this government's record in relation to the Public Service and what actually happened. Before the government came to power in 1996, they stated that they would cut only 2,500 Public Service jobs and that there would be no forced redundancies. It is interesting that I am talking about this on a day when we have been reflecting on truth in government. The truth is that on coming to power the Prime Minister sacked six departmental secretaries virtually immediately. By the end of the first financial year in office, his government had cut 11,200 Public Service jobs. The total number of Public Service jobs lost under this government was 32,400—at a total cost to the budget of $700 million. This was a massive blow to the Public Service and to its corporate memory. The government replaced experienced public servants with contractors and consultants at a cost to taxpayers of more than $2 billion.
We on this side of the House are very concerned at the abuse of government processes by this government. We have seen ministers hiding behind ministerial advisers and senior public servants. We have seen the reputation and the integrity of the Australian Public Service brought into question as a result of this kind of behaviour. I believe the actions of this government have failed the APS and the Australian community. The children overboard affair best illustrates the claims that the Public Service has been politicised. Reporting mechanisms have been constructed which assist the denial of matters and incidents which affect our national interest. There is no doubt about the effect that this government's policies have had on the Public Service and on this community. 
We in the Labor Party believe in a truly independent, professional and innovative Public Service. I might add that, prior to 1996, the Australian Public Service was held up in the OECD and elsewhere as one of the most efficient, proficient and highly regarded in the world. We are releasing a policy in relation to the Public Service; it is available publicly now. I would like to talk about the fact that only Labor have a plan to reverse the damage that we believe has been done to the Public Service by this government. We recognise the essential role that the Public Service plays in our society. We are committed to making the Public Service responsive, accountable, efficient and independent. While the APS works for the government of the day, it must never become an extension of the apparatus of the particular party in government at the time. We have developed a Public Service policy to ensure that, under a Latham Labor government, the gross excesses of the Howard government's interference with the Public Service will end. We will foster a frank and fearless Public Service by giving senior public servants the freedom to give honest advice without fear of reprisals. We will make political advisers accountable. We will improve the administration of the Public Service by making it more open and transparent. And we will restore a unified, merit-based, career public service. We will amend the Public Service Act to give departmental secretaries a minimum term of engagement of five years, unless a shorter term is agreed by the parties concerned due to some exceptional circumstances that may be in place.
We on this side of the House see the Howard government as being driven by an ideological obsession in relation to the Public Service. They believe that the Public Service must be constantly cut and its role taken over by the private sector. This is a flawed belief. There is a fixation that the private sector will always do a better job than the Public Service. Chasing the fantasy of outsourcing and privatisation has led to the waste of hundreds of millions in taxpayers' dollars over the past few years. The disaster of information technology outsourcing is the best example of the government's folly and its needless, ideology-driven waste. We are committed to a best practice Public Service based on commonsense improvements, and we are committed to open and honest outsourcing where and when outsourcing is proven to be the best option economically—not just on an ideological basis.
People would understand that, as the member for Canberra, on behalf of my constituency I have a very strong interest in matters to do with the Public Service. In the past, Canberra has been called a Public Service town. That is right, but only to a certain extent. We have a vibrant, entrepreneurial and well-developed private sector, which now employs the majority of workers in this town. Some decades ago, public sector employment was very much the major area of employment here, with a small component of private sector employment as well. The situation now is reversed—or almost. Over 50 per cent of this town's employment base is now in the private sector. I applaud that. It adds diversity and complexity to our employment base, but the public sector here is also a vitally important component of my community. It is fair to say that a lot of that private sector work comes from supporting the public sector in the work they carry out here. 
My constituents, my community—and, I believe, the community around Australia that have any interest in the public sector—want to see it as a really good, vibrant, honest choice of career. We are committed to a single, integrated, merit-based, non-discriminatory career Public Service. We want to see long-term security for public servants, ensuring access to promotion based on merit. We want to attract young, talented people to the Public Service by offering them training and career paths. We want to improve the representation of women in the higher levels of the Public Service, especially at executive and SES levels, where currently they are woefully underrepresented. We want to rebuild the corporate memory of the Public Service so that we actually see good policy and advice coming out of it, innovation being promoted and good professionalism available to it. We also want older public servants to be assisted to stay within the service longer, if they wish. These are not the sorts of actions we have seen under this government in recent years.
In conclusion, we want a unified, professional, innovative Public Service. People working in the public sector do all they can, under these difficulties, to serve the community as best they can. I want to guarantee them that under a Labor government they will be allowed to do that and promoted to do that. It will be a good, professional, open and innovative service, not one that has been dampened down from the top—by this government.

"McClelland, Robert, MP",ALP,2004-08-09,"—The Crimes Legislation Amendment (Telecommunications Offences and Other Measures) Bill (No. 2) 2004 is an omnibus bill which updates a number of offences originally enacted in 1989 relating to the misuse of telecommunications services and moves them from the Crimes Act to the Criminal Code. The bill also creates a number of offences on a range of topics, including offences of using a carriage service, including the Internet, to access, transmit or publish child pornography or child abuse material, or to procure or groom a person under 16 years of age for sexual activity. These complement existing offences in place at the state and territory level. 
Secondly, the bill includes offences of using a carriage service, including the Internet, to make threats to kill or cause serious harm, to perpetrate a hoax relating to explosive or dangerous substances, or to engage in menacing, harassing or offensive behaviour. Thirdly, there are offences to prevent the rebirthing of stolen mobile phones and the copying of mobile phone SIM cards. Fourthly, there are offences of making hoax or vexatious calls to emergency service numbers. There are also offences of contaminating goods, threatening to contaminate goods or perpetrating a contamination hoax. Finally, the bill includes offences of dishonestly obtaining or dealing in personal financial information, targeted at credit card skimming and Internet banking fraud. These implement model legislation developed jointly by the Commonwealth, state and territory governments. The bill also makes a number of miscellaneous amendments to criminal law statutes, dealing with matters including alternative verdicts, knowledge of criminal law, proof of narcotics offences and international assistance in criminal matters.
We note that the bill appears to have had a long period of gestation within the government, if the public statements of numerous ministers, past and present, are anything to go by. As long ago as 4 April 2003—almost a year and a half ago—the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Ellison, issued a media release titled `New offences to clamp down on Internet child pornography'. That release made mention of the offences covering child pornography and material that incites suicide. Then, on 20 August 2003, just a year ago, Senator Ellison and the then Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Alston, issued a joint media release titled `Using Internet for offensive and menacing purposes to be outlawed'. This release mentioned offences dealing with offensive, menacing or harassing Internet content, re-announced the child pornography offences and also mentioned the offences dealing with rebirthing of stolen mobile phones.
On 14 March 2004, Senator Ellison and the then Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, the Hon. Daryl Williams, issued a joint media release titled `Tough laws to target Internet child sex crime', re-announcing the legislation and releasing an exposure draft. Then, on 19 March 2004, Senator Ellison again issued a media release, titled `Agreement reached on new national laws to outlaw credit card skimming', which announced the offences of fraudulent dealing with personal financial information. Finally, on 25 June this year, Senator Ellison and the Hon. Daryl Williams, then the communications minister, issued another media release titled `Internet child sex abuse offences bill tabled'. That coincided with the introduction of an earlier bill in the Senate which bears the same name as the current bill—that is, of course, without the words `No. 2'—and which we understand the government will no longer be proceeding with.
All of these announcements have culminated in the current bill, which was introduced into the House last Wednesday, 4 August. It is worth summarising this series of announcements for the public record so that the community has an accurate picture of how the bill has developed and in anticipation of the Attorney-General, who is so fond of accusing all and sundry but the government of procrastination when it comes to the implementation or development of legislation.
In conclusion, the opposition supports the second reading of this bill. The overwhelming majority of the bill is not controversial and makes improvements to the criminal law. In some areas of the law, members on both sides of the House would regard the conduct to be penalised and criminalised as entirely reprehensible and properly the subject of the strongest possible criminal sanction. We note that, following discussion between the government and the Democrats in the Senate, the government itself has referred the bill to a Senate committee, with a reporting date this week, to examine any controversial issues surrounding particular provisions of the bill. We look forward to the report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, and we can further address those potentially controversial issues with the benefit of the committee report during the debate in the Senate. But certainly, from the opposition's point of view, despite the long lead time in the development of this legislation, we can indicate to the House that we will cooperate with its expeditious passage.

"Baird, Bruce, MP",LP,2004-08-09,"—It is my pleasure to support the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Telecommunications Offences and Other Measures) Bill (No. 2) 2004. It certainly reflects the changes that have occurred in our community and society and our use of the Internet and mobile phones. Very few areas of life these days are not impacted by the use of the Internet and mobile phones. They have changed our way of communicating and our way of life. The changes that have occurred have also meant that we have seen some people in our society use the Internet and mobile phones in less attractive ways. That is why some of the offences that have been included in this bill have been brought forward. I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration for bringing this legislation forward, because it is long overdue.
I am particularly pleased to speak on this bill because I chair the Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission and we actually undertook an inquiry and produced a report on cybercrime. We looked at how the Internet was being used by criminal elements. We particularly looked at how the Internet is used in banking fraud, pornography, chat rooms, the grooming of under-age children by paedophiles and the skimming of credit cards. I am very pleased to see that the recommendations we made in that report have been picked up by the government and instituted in this legislation, because these offences are of concern in a number of areas.
The No.1 concern with the Internet for me and for many people in our community is the way in which chat rooms are used for the grooming, as it is called, of young people, particularly those who are around 12 or 13 years of age. We actually set up a simulated exercise with the High Tech Crime Centre, which is in the AFP, whereby we created the name of a young person who we said was 12 and we went into a chat room and watched what happened. Within 24 hours, someone was targeting this young person—who of course was fictional—making all types of pretty suggestive comments to them. As it happens, this instance was monitored by the police and they were aware of this individual, who was a paedophile using this grooming. I am very pleased to see that the High Tech Crime Centre of the AFP is able to track down these individuals, both within Australia and internationally, and that offences have been included in this bill for those who use the chat rooms for grooming.
New federal offences targeting online grooming practices by sexual predators will provide national leadership on an emerging aspect of child sexual abuse. The offences align with the government's commitment to a nationally consistent child sex offender registration system and the CrimTrac Agency's work in this area. I think the worst nightmare of every parent in Australia is their child being molested by a paedophile. The Internet has been used on a number of occasions for the grooming of an individual—where paedophiles pretend they are a similar age to the young person whose name comes up in the chat room and then they pursue them. They talk to them, make suggestive comments to them and eventually set up a meeting. It is then that the child finds that the other person is not a 14- or 15-year-old boy but rather a 35- or 40-year-old man. We have had some very unfortunate instances of this occur. This bill has provided these new offence categories in recognition of the fact that this practice does occur and that it is a danger for all parents. Parents think they are protected by using Net Nanny. To a certain degree, it does offer protection in terms of the use of words et cetera, but because of grooming they should still be concerned when their children go into chat rooms. That is one of the key aspects of this new bill that I believe needs highlighting. 
The other aspect concerns the Internet child pornography and child abuse material offences. These are a significant step, with law enforcement agencies estimating that around 85 per cent of child pornography seized in Australia is distributed via the Internet. We have seen cases where a significant amount of pornography that has been downloaded from the Net onto CDs has been seized. This new offence carries a prison term of between one and 10 years, making it consistent Australia wide. Currently, an array of state and territory child pornography offences are used to prosecute these people, so this bill brings these offences into line.
Another aspect of the bill is the telecommunications offences and personal financial information offences. These demonstrate the Australian government's commitment to proactively combating new and emerging technological developments in crime, which is important. Telecommunications related offences reflect the changing telecommunications environment and our growing reliance on various telecommunications technologies. That is significant as well.
The offences dealing with the making of threats and hoaxes using a telecommunications service target conduct that has become more prevalent post 11 September 2001. We saw a high-profile hoax publicised in the last 24 hours, when someone in the United States pretended that they were about to be beheaded. That turned out to be a total hoax. This legislation will deal with that.
The offences dealing with the improper use of emergency service numbers, such as triple zero, target an increasing problem which significantly drains the resources of those involved in the provision of the emergency call service and adds to the response time for legitimate calls made to report actual emergencies. It is estimated that fewer than 10 per cent of calls to emergency service numbers relate to anything approaching an emergency. That figure of 10 per cent is pretty small, so obviously there are some people who take up the time pretending that there is an emergency. This legislation will make sure that we minimise this problem and allow the phones to be used for genuine concerns and genuine emergencies.
Contamination of goods offences and financial information offences are included in this legislation, which also addresses the question of credit card skimming, something that is becoming quite common in restaurants, roadhouses and service stations. Credit card skimming is the practice of taking an imprint of a credit card and then using that imprint—it is passed on, often finding its way up into Asia. The bill before the House addresses that particular issue and the wrong use of mobile phones, as I have outlined. 
This bill is important for a number of key reasons. It recognises that changes have occurred in everyday life in relation to the use of the Internet and mobile phones. It addresses some of the key and most significant concerns in those regards, including those relating to pornography and all the implications there. The bill introduces penalties of one to 10 years imprisonment for the offence of keeping pornographic images of young people. It also addresses the issues of grooming, hoax calls which are made to emergency services, rebirthing of mobile phones, offences concerning the wrong use of phones, credit card skimming and the passing on of numbers to others for criminal purposes. Overall, this is a comprehensive range of measures which should be supported by all members in the House. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TELECOMMUNICATIONS OFFENCES AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL (NO. 2) 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1,speech
"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,2004-08-09,"—in reply—On behalf of the government, I would like to thank honourable members for their support of the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Telecommunications Offences and Other Measures) Bill (No. 2) 2004. The amendments in this bill address a number of important issues that impact on many Australians' everyday lives. Schedule 1 of the bill contains a range of new and updated offences dealing with abuse of and interference with the telecommunications system. Measures in this bill deal, most importantly, with use of the Internet to access, transmit or make available child pornography and to `groom' or procure children with the intent of engaging in sexual activity with them. These measures will ensure that paedophiles who use the Internet to facilitate their repulsive activities can be prosecuted consistently, Australia-wide, under federal law. Those caught under these new measures will face very strong penalties of up to 15 years imprisonment. These penalties illustrate the government's zero tolerance approach towards child sexual abuse. I am pleased that members of the House agree with the government on the need for strong, uncompromising laws dealing with this issue.
Schedule 1 of the bill also contains a range of other new and updated telecommunications-related measures which will work towards making Australians' use of telecommunications more productive and more enjoyable. Amongst these measures are offences dealing with improper use of the emergency call service; use of a telecommunications service in a menacing, harassing or offensive way; threats and hoaxes made using a telecommunications service; and modification of the International Mobile Subscriber Identity number of a mobile phone.
Schedule 2 of the bill contains comprehensive new contamination of goods offences. These offences reflect the economic loss and public alarm that can arise from the actual contamination of goods, the threat to contaminate goods or falsely claim that particular goods have been contaminated. They will be an important addition to the federal Criminal Code, and they will complement existing state and territory offences and extend to threats made to contaminate Australian goods from outside Australia.
Schedule 3 contains personal financial information offences that are a key component of the government's national strategy to crack down on credit card skimming and Internet banking fraud. These offences will ensure that Australians can feel more confident when engaging in electronic, telephone or Internet banking. Dishonestly obtaining or dealing with personal financial information without consent will become an offence under these amendments, as will the possession or importation of a device with the intention of using the device to engage in this type of conduct. These offences also capture Internet banking fraud, such as `phishing', where apparently legitimate emails are used to trick people into divulging their banking details. 
This bill contains critical child protection measures and other measures that demonstrate the Australian government's commitment to proactively addressing new and emerging technological developments in crime. In particular, it contains measures that, as well as putting behind bars those people who would abuse our children for their own gratification, are intended to make the Internet a safer medium for our children to use and enjoy. The bill contains a package of new telecommunications offences that will contribute towards making telecommunications services more effective and making our use of these services less stressful. For example, the offence that targets improper use of the emergency call service will contribute towards a speedier response to calls to the triple zero emergency service.
The bill also contains new measures attacking actions that sap our confidence in the things we should be able to take for granted, such as the safety of our food supply and the security and confidentiality of our personal financial information. I thank honourable members for their support and I commend the bill to the House.

"Thompson, Cameron, MP",LP,2004-08-09,"—It is a pleasure to speak this evening on the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2004, because the government's proposals in this regard focus a lot more of the attention that is given to Indigenous education onto the specific issue of Indigenous education in remote areas. That is an important direction for the government to be taking, because of the huge imbalance that exists between the educational outcomes of Indigenous students in urban areas and the educational outcomes of Indigenous students in areas that are not so fortunately located—those students whose education is conducted in areas that can be quite remote, where the availability of and access to education is very restricted and the purpose of education can be less apparent and less immediately relevant to the local population. In discussing that, I will raise a whole range of issues, because this is the core of the question of performance in Indigenous education. It is important for Indigenous communities, just as it is important for other communities, that people be fully aware of the opportunities that are created by education and of the future direction that those communities can seek to undertake as a result. Doors are opened by education, and communities and young people, no matter what their background may be, need to be able to receive maximum benefit from their education. 
The purpose of this bill is to improve education for Indigenous students in a way that is proven to work. I underline that point—proven to work—because, whether the students are in remote communities or in urban communities, it is essential that we look at strategies for Indigenous people that are proven to work. There has been a lot of experimentation and a lot of theories have been tried. Things have gone around and around many times and many different aspects of education have been explored and tried in remote communities and among urban Indigenous people, but not all of them have worked. Some, though, have and, where we have strategies that have worked, it behoves us to focus our attention in that regard.
The IndigenousEducation (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill continues funding for the next four years. Indigenous education and non-Indigenous education do not produce the same results in this country. Under the Howard government there has been a marked improvement in Indigenous education's results, but there is still more to be done. Studies in 1996 indicated that the year 12 retention rate for Indigenous students was 29 per cent, and since then the retention rate has jumped to 38 per cent, but I do not select the retention rate as being the arbiter for what is good in Indigenous education. I really think that is entirely misguided. This is not purely about the retention rate; it is about the value of the education that the children get when they go to school—and going on to higher education is one course of action that they might seek.
That applies to students in general just as it applies to Indigenous students—and I must admit that Indigenous students do have innovative and appropriate methods for seeking out higher education. Batchelor College in the Northern Territory is an example. It has always had special meaning for Aboriginal people from remote communities. So I think it is important that higher education be considered as one course to be taken, but there is also practical vocational education. That is something that we need to encourage more people in general into, and it is also something that we need to encourage more Indigenous students to focus on.
Going back to the retention rate, however, just to use it as a measure of the situation, we find that the retention rate for Indigenous students is still only half the retention rate for non-Indigenous students. Today in primary schools we have the highest literacy and numeracy rates ever attained by Indigenous students. However, one in four year 3 Indigenous students still does not pass basic reading tests. This bill ensures that assistance to Indigenous students goes to where it is most needed. It ensures that help is given to those needing it most. It redirects funding to initiatives that have been demonstrated to work. Students in remote areas—the most disadvantaged in terms of education—will be the focus of the funding. There will be conditions attached, such as attendance benchmarks, to ensure performance and results. 
One aspect of this bill is the provision of highly targeted tutorial assistance. Tuition assistance will be available to those not meeting performance benchmarks. In-class tuition will be provided in years 3, 5 and 7, benefiting about 45,000 children over four years. After-school tuition will help about 11,600 students in years 10, 11 and 12. This bill also provides for the involvement of parents and communities—an essential part of Indigenous education—through the development of partnerships between schools and Indigenous communities.
The previous speaker on this bill focused to some extent on the ASPA committees and their fate. In some cases there has been a good experience in relation to ASPA committees. In other cases that I am aware of there has not been a good experience. What is important about this bill goes back to the opening statement that I made. We must focus on strategies that have been proven to work. There is no point in having ASPA committees just for the sake of having them. They have to work. If you want to pursue ASPA committees as a strategy then that has to be done in the context of those cases where they have worked. There are many cases where they have not worked, and we need to look at those cases. If we are expending quite a lot of money on an educational strategy that has had mixed results, we need to refocus our efforts in places where we have seen proven results—more across the board, so that the strategy is more reliable and people can be more confident of a positive outcome from the money spent.
We need a reliability of service in providing Indigenous education. It is not a hit-and-miss exercise—well, in fact, the problem is that it is a hit-and-miss exercise. What we need to do is to try and ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, the hit-and-miss character of this type of education is reduced so that it becomes more reliable, so that issues that get in the way of the development of a child's education through the Indigenous system as we provide it now are reduced. At almost every turn we need to ensure that to the maximum extent possible there will be a positive experience. I raise that because in some of the material I want to discuss later on, particularly in relation to attendance, there are situations where the negative experience can totally undermine the overall performance in education. That is a rather long way of discussing the fact that I think ASPA committees have not been completely without fault and there are other strategies that are more focused. This bill is seeking those out and seeking to fund them.
Localised problems will be isolated with the measurement of outcomes at a remote and regional level instead of the current state level reporting. That is important too. In studies that have been done in relation to performance in Indigenous education, we see that there are too many glaring black holes in this system that have not been picked up by globalised reporting. If we look at the question of attendance, which I spoke about, you can speak state wide about the attendance record but, as I think has already been mentioned, over 50 per cent of the Aboriginal student population is in New South Wales and Queensland and the vast majority of those students are in mainstream schools. To incorporate into their attendance records the attendance records at really remote Aboriginal communities is to gloss over the existence of two completely different worlds and to come up with a scenario which really says nothing. A statistic that incorporates all of that together says nothing about either of those worlds; it just runs up the middle somewhere. The fact is that attendance at schools in remote Indigenous communities can quite often be absolutely woeful. That is something that needs to be addressed. It is something that has to be addressed, and I will discuss it at greater length later on. 
Under this bill, quality education will be available to all students in Australia and assistance will be targeted to help those who need it most. This is the most accountable system. It will ensure funding tackles the hardest problems and produces the best results. The bill continues $865.9 million of non-Abstudy funding and $101.4 million in Abstudy away from base funding.
I would like to continue, drawing some remarks from the Bills Digest. It says:
Since 1990, when AESIP—
the Aboriginal Education Strategic Initiatives Program—
was introduced, there has been a steady increase in Commonwealth funding for Indigenous education.
I repeat:
... a steady increase in Commonwealth funding ...
It goes on:
The commitment to AESIP, now the Indigenous Education Strategic Initiatives Program (IESIP), in both policy and funding terms, has continued under the Coalition Government. However, in section 5(g) of the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000 (the current Act) the Government included the object of better literacy and numeracy outcomes and better attendance outcomes for Indigenous students.
This bill continues that trend to seek out the questions related to the core competencies and the issues of greatest importance in Indigenous education and seeks to provide strategies that work to address those problems. The Bills Digest goes on:
The Bill—
that is, the existing bill—
provides additional funding for further `practical reconciliation' through an additional $11.4 million for non-ABSTUDY payments over the period 1 January 2002 to 30 June 2005.
That particular provision of funding, as I say, has ensured that we have continued increases in funding for Indigenous education. Research that has been conducted provides evidence that the rate at which Indigenous education was advancing stalled in 1996; and there is evidence that there has been a recovery since 1996. That is canvassed quite effectively in the Bills Digest, and I commend the Parliamentary Library on the work that has gone into that.
I want to talk about some of the statistics and about how there really are two worlds in Aboriginal education—something I spoke about earlier. This bill at last really focuses on that. I want to make a few remarks that highlight some of the problems. I look firstly at the proportion of the Australian Indigenous population that attends schools in various states. Queensland has 27.5 per cent of the Indigenous school population; New South Wales has 29.7 per cent; Western Australia has 16 per cent; and the Northern Territory has 10.8 per cent. We can see that over 50 per cent attend schools in Queensland and New South Wales; and the Northern Territory, which encompasses a lot of very remote schools, covers 10.8 per cent. Of the Indigenous population, 87.5 per cent attend government schools and 8.3 per cent attend Catholic schools. It is interesting to note that the more than 50 per cent of Indigenous students who attend school in Queensland and New South Wales make up less than five per cent of the school population in each of those states—only that small percentage. So it is very hard to say that those Indigenous students are engaging in a system that is tailored purely to them. Perhaps that is one of the problems and is something that needs to be addressed, but there is a significant problem that arises further out, in remote areas where the population is largely Indigenous and where the system is tailored directly to them. 
I would like to talk about the 2002 National report to parliament on Indigenous education and training, which was tabled last year. We have seen some significant changes in the number of people from Indigenous backgrounds seeking access to higher education courses. It is interesting to note that the number of Indigenous students undertaking studies in natural and physical sciences has fallen by 10.8 per cent. In IT that number has increased by 14.1 per cent, in the creative arts it is up by 24.1 and in education it is up by eight per cent. In my home state of Queensland, 1,083 students from Indigenous backgrounds attended higher education in 2002. It is interesting to compare that with the figure of 1,052 students in the Northern Territory, including the 818 at Batchelor college which I made special mention of earlier on.
Looking at that vexed question I raised about attendance, one of the deficiencies in the National report to parliament on Indigenous education and training from 2002 is that it makes the mistake of dealing with it globally. It says that primary attendance is between 76 and 96 per cent for Indigenous students versus 90 to 95 per cent for the general population and secondary attendance is between 69 to 92 per cent for Indigenous students versus 88 to 93 per cent for the general population. I am disappointed that it does not break those figures down and say, `Let's look at what's actually happening with attendance in remote areas versus attendance in the mainstream system.'
I know from personal experience visiting a range of remote schools in the Northern Territory that attendance is quite significant. I am sure that a great deal of effort has been going into lifting attendance at those remote schools, and I congratulate everyone who is engaged in that, but it is a core problem. When I visit a school that has a capacity to cater for the local population of 300 students and maybe 30 per cent of those students attend the school on any given day—and it is a different 30 per cent every day—I know that the educational outcomes achieved by those students are going to be dramatically undercut by the issue of attendance. It is a very difficult question to address, and it cannot simply be glossed over.
One thing that I would like to report—and there has been quite a lot of coverage of this in Queensland—is the recent performance of the Cherbourg State School, which is just north of my electorate in Queensland. The current Queenslander of the year, Chris Sarra, became principal of the Cherbourg State School in 1998 and he has achieved some stunning turnarounds in relation to absence. I read the text of the ABC program Message Stick from 17 October 2003 about his contribution. Chris Sarra runs specific activities focused on attendance in the school, telling kids that they are strong and smart. In that program he was talking about how students were going not only in their learning but in their attendance, and he was celebrating and congratulating students on the fact that there were zero unexplained absences from the senior part of the school at that time. In 18 months, unexplained absences at Cherbourg have dropped by 94 per cent. Three years ago, 13 per cent of year 2 students reached the expected literacy mark and today more than 60 per cent reach the expected literacy mark. I believe that this is tightly linked to Chris Sarra's work and I believe that focusing on those remote area issues will reap a great reward in Indigenous education.

"Macklin, Jenny, MP",ALP,2004-08-09,"—Two weeks ago I visited a number of Aboriginal community schools in the Northern Territory with the member for Lingiari and had a first-hand lesson in the importance of targeted assistance programs for Indigenous education. This experience has instilled in me a fresh enthusiasm and a renewed determination to improve Aboriginal education. Unfortunately, my enthusiasm does not extend to the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2004. Labor will be allowing the bill to go through not because we agree with the changes that it contains but because we do not want to hold up vitally important funding for Aboriginal education. 
It has to be pointed out that the funding contained in this bill does not represent any significant new investment in Indigenous education, and that is a terrible shame. The combined Indigenous education programs contained receive just a 3.25 per cent per annum increase, which barely covers inflation in this four-year funding package. We also have very serious concerns about the amendments to Indigenous education direct assistance contained in this bill. I have had the opportunity to talk with some members of the Aboriginal education community and I certainly believe that the changes to the Aboriginal Student Support and Parent Awareness program will be a barrier to community participation in Aboriginal education.
Labor is also opposed to the measures in the bill that prevent funding from flowing to Aboriginal children until they fail a year 3 literacy test. Delaying extra assistance to Aboriginal students until they have failed a year 3 literacy test is nothing short of a very serious tragedy. These changes demonstrate that this minister for education and this Howard government are more interested in testing Aboriginal students and finding out how many of them fail than preventing them from failing in the first place.
I must say it is typical of this government to, on the one hand, give the biggest funding increases to the wealthiest schools in this country, with absolutely no requirement for them to demonstrate that they are in need, and, on the other hand, hold back funding to the most disadvantaged group of children in our education system until they demonstrate that they have failed. It just goes to show that this government, the Howard government, is very generous and loose with taxpayers' funds when the recipients are the most privileged but turns extremely mean when providing extra educational support to the most disadvantaged children in this country.
I do not think anyone would be surprised to know that there are educational benefits to parental involvement in school decision making; these things are well documented. I think this is particularly so for Indigenous students, who often feel alienated from traditional schooling arrangements because these are so foreign to them. It is vitally important that we encourage Indigenous parents to be involved in the decision-making processes of their children's school. We do know that through their activities some of the cultural barriers can be broken down, some of the language barriers can be broken down and a much more supportive environment for Indigenous students can be fostered.
The Aboriginal Student Support and Parent Awareness program was originally established to promote Indigenous parental involvement in their children's education. It has been recently reviewed, and that review is supposedly being used to justify the minister's changes to the program. But when you look at the findings of the review you will see they do not actually recommend what we are debating in this bill. That review concluded:
	despite the lack of `hard' data there is evidence that ASSPA has in many cases significantly increased Indigenous students' access to school programs and activities, expanded students' educational horizons and helped raise students' confidence and self-esteem in the classroom. Case studies highlighted the potential of ASSPA to significantly improve student attendance and retention. 
So, despite this positive endorsement of the work of ASSPA committees, this bill contains measures that effectively abolish them.
At present, funding is allocated to each ASSPA committee on a per capita formula based on the number of Indigenous students enrolled in a school. The funding flows automatically once an ASSPA committee has been established, developed an annual ASSPA activity plan in line with program guidelines and lodged the ASSPA application for funding. The process requires that at the end of each year these committees complete an end-of-year report detailing the committee's activities and expenses.
The review in fact contains no justification for changing the funding process to a submission based process. That is what this bill does: it basically requires Indigenous parents to put in a submission to get the money that they had previously received if they had Indigenous children in their schools. What the review said in its conclusion was:
... more work would need to be done to bring clearer focus to attendance, retention and other educational outcomes ...
The minister has not indicated how he plans to overcome the serious barriers that submission based processes represent for Indigenous communities. It is going to be a total catch-22. This funding is designed to get Aboriginal parents involved in their children's schooling, but to receive funding these parents must already show sufficient nous to submit a successful funding submission.
I have received serious representations from the Darwin-Palmerston and rural area combined ASSPA working party, who are passionately opposed to elements of this bill because they believe it will disenfranchise Indigenous parents from the education system. As the ASSPA working party state in their letter to the minister, which they have copied to me:
Another problem with submission-based funding is that it will further disadvantage those Indigenous parents who do not have the capacity or confidence to articulate or negotiate their children's needs. There is a danger that schools within their current system will either write these submissions without proper consultation with Indigenous parents or worse, not bother writing them at all. The process needs to ensure that Indigenous parents continue to have a voice and retain ownership of the decision making process.
There is real concern within the Indigenous education community about the lack of consultation that preceded these changes and the fact that this bill disempowers Indigenous parents. I want to say tonight that, if Labor are elected at the forthcoming election, we will not proceed with these changes. Schools with Aboriginal students should not be forced to compete with other schools for targeted funding.
We all know that there is a clear need for all of these schools to promote Indigenous parental involvement in their schools and that assistance should be directed to those schools that do not have the capacity to write a funding submission in the first place. Submission based funding undoubtedly requires extra support for Indigenous communities to prepare successful submissions. Given the urgency and extent of the need, I believe—and it is certainly Labor's position—that it is much better to channel these resources into helping parents and communities provide the best support they can for their children, not deal with paperwork.
Labor do not support the submission based funding model included in this bill and, if we do win the election, in consultation—I emphasise that—with the Indigenous community Labor in government will introduce a funding system that will promote, not hinder, Indigenous parental involvement in schools. 
Labor is also concerned that this bill abolishes the Aboriginal Tutorial Assistance Scheme and replaces it with a new scheme, called the Indigenous Tutorial Assistance Scheme. It does not sound like much from the name change, but it has very serious implications. The old scheme, the Aboriginal Tutorial Assistance Scheme, was focused on prevention; the new scheme, the scheme that this bill contains, is all about testing and only providing assistance once an Aboriginal child has failed the year 3 literacy test.
The government's own discussion paper recognises that `around one in four Indigenous students cannot achieve agreed minimum year 3 reading standards and around one in three by year 5'. In the Northern Territory the statistics are even more alarming. In his 1999 review of Indigenous education in the Northern Territory, Bob Collins found that just four per cent of Aboriginal children in year 5 could read to the standard of the national benchmark—four per cent—and yet this government is saying that those children have to wait until they have failed before they will get any help. Among those year 3 Indigenous children who start school without any English language, from parts of the Northern Territory where English is a second language, that number fell to just two per cent. Not surprisingly, they are not able to pass a grade 3 reading test. And this government is saying that they are going to delay assistance to these children until they have failed their year 3 test.
Let us consider what this means. In 1999 almost all Aboriginal children growing up in the Northern Territory's outback could not read to the basic standards that we, as a country, expect. It is very clear that we do not need to test these children to find out that they need extra assistance and they need it from the day they start preschool. We need to make sure that we provide this assistance from the earliest point possible. Year 3 is far too late to be providing Aboriginal children with extra literacy support. For many of them, English is a second language and they need extra targeted literacy materials—and I have actually got some of those here with me today. I do not know how we can make them known to the parliament, but these are the sorts of books that are being produced in schools. One is being produced in Shepherdson College, a school I visited on Elcho Island—a fantastic book for young children, written in the children's own language. Children can then learn to read and write in their own language. It is just outstanding that we have these quality materials being provided for the children by the schools so they are given additional literacy support in the very early years of school.
We want Shepherdson College on Elcho Island, and other great schools like it, to have the financial resources to provide these early literacy programs and materials when the children really need them. They have a great preschool program on Elcho Island where the tiny little children as well as three- and fouryearolds come along to the preschool; they do not speak English. The only way we are going to make sure they can learn to read and write in English is to provide the additional support that they need in those very early years as well as throughout their schooling time. Delaying assistance until year 3 will mean that more of these children will fail these tests—and what will that do for the kids? It certainly will not improve their literacy.
There is a great need for extra resources for Aboriginal education. I must say that I completely reject this bill's premise that one disadvantaged group, urban Indigenous children, should forfeit extra funding because another disadvantaged group, children in remote Indigenous communities, are in greater need. We know that both groups are in urgent need of additional assistance, and it is a great shame that this government should take responsibility for introducing a bill such as this. 
The minister in his speech introducing this bill said that this will more heavily weight resources to the most disadvantaged students, being those in remote areas. Yes, they are very disadvantaged; there is no question about that. After I had been on Elcho Island where so many of the children have huge needs, I went to an outstation school of Shepherdson College at a place called Marparu, a tiny settlement where the children are in desperate need of additional resources. Yes, they do need additional resources, but so do those in inner Sydney, in the inner suburbs of Melbourne and in country towns where so many Indigenous students are in such great need. What this government is doing is just shameful—taking from one disadvantaged group to give to another. It is the height of hypocrisy for this minister to say that it is right to reduce funding for urban and regional Aboriginal education programs because remote Aboriginal people are in greater need, while he, this minister, doles out millions of dollars to some of the wealthiest schools in this country. We should not have the needs of urban Aboriginal students set up against the needs of remote Aboriginal students, but, very sadly, that is exactly what this bill does.
The minister for education says that school resources do not matter. He says that it is a student's ability that determines their academic achievement, not resources. He says that high-fee schools perform well because they attract students with high ability. You would have to ask why on earth he is giving high-fee schools the biggest funding increases in the country—as much as 300 per cent—while children in these schools in remote Australia are getting a bit over three per cent. Where is the sense in that? If this minister says that additional resources do not matter, I have to say that I do not know what world he is living in.
The minister needs to get back out into these schools and see the enormous need for resources at Shepherdson College at Marparu, and at the third school we went to in Oenpelli, a school at Gunbalanya. They do not even have proper classrooms; they are old classrooms, tiny classrooms. They have great teachers, I have to say, who are doing an outstanding job. But they have classrooms that would not be acceptable in any other part of Australia, and they should not be acceptable in Gunbalanya either. This minister has the hide to say that resources do not matter. How else will that school at Gunbalanya get new buildings if they do not get the money that is so desperately needed to make sure that those children have the resources they need? How will the school on Elcho Island or the one at Marparu have the capacity to produce these terrific reading materials in their own languages if they do not have the resources? Frankly, the minister is on some other planet. Let's get real.
The massive funding increases that this Howard government has given to the highest fee schools in Australia would be much better spent on helping poorer performing children in needy schools like the ones I have been talking about here today. That certainly is Labor's policy. We will be taking money off these high-fee schools, and the money will be going to the schools where the resources are so desperately needed. We are very reluctantly supporting the passage of this bill because we do not want to hold up these resources for Indigenous education, but we have very serious concerns about specific measures in the bill. As I have said, we do not believe that the changes to the ASPA committees will promote greater parental participation in their children's schooling. I am totally opposed to delaying literacy support until students fail their year 3 literacy tests. That means that in those vital early years students will be missing out on much needed extra literacy resources. 
I want to finish by saying that these changes will not proceed if Labor are elected. Labor will provide additional funding for Indigenous education over and above the miserly amount that this government is providing in this bill. We will not make parents write submissions for funding to encourage parental involvement or for the running of breakfast or homework clubs. Labor will make sure that early literacy funding is available right from the start of a child's education. We will not be waiting until a child fails their year 3 test. We want to make sure this money is in the schools at the earliest possible time. Most importantly, we will end the outrageous policy that has given the biggest funding increases to the wealthiest schools in Australia. Our funding will be based on the real needs of non-government schools and government schools. We will make sure that that is where the money goes. All of these schools that have large numbers of Indigenous students are in desperate need. That is where the money needs to go, not into the wealthiest schools that certainly do not need it.",REPS,<title>INDIGENOUS EDUCATION (TARGETED ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Plibersek, Tanya, MP",ALP,2004-08-09,"—Labor reluctantly support the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2004 simply because we do not want to see further delays to funding for Indigenous students, but we do have a number of concerns about the bill. On 22 June 2004, the Prime Minister released a document called the `Australian agenda for schools' which included a reference to significant commitments to:
... accelerate Indigenous education outcomes, to which the Australian Government is committing a record $2.1 billion over the next four years ...
The Minister for Education, Science and Training said in the chamber on the following day that the bill was to:
... maintain and enhance the Australian government's effort in improving education outcomes for Indigenous Australians over the 2005 to 2008 funding quadrennium.
If you were listening to the hype, you would think that a good thing had been done for Indigenous students through this announcement, but what you would be missing is that the very great areas of need experienced by Indigenous students and the subsequent effects on their life expectations and work expectations have not been addressed at all by this package. This bill presents us with an indexed continuation of current funding. We are looking at around three per cent for Indigenous students. It really compares very poorly, as the shadow minister for education has pointed out, with funding increases of up to 300 per cent for some of our wealthiest schools. Surely in any objective analysis of how governments should spend their money, the areas of greatest need should get first priority. This is another example of where the government has completely turned that notion on its head and instead gives greatest attention to the areas where greatest privilege already exists.
In summary, this bill legislates for $641.6 million over the 200508 period for the Indigenous Education Strategic Initiatives Program. That is $513.5 million of funding, which, including indexation, is essentially maintaining the value of the grants, and $128.1 million for ongoing and new strategic projects. Some supplementary funding will continue for education providers across preschool, school and vocational education and training. The figures sound large like that. It is only when you look at the detail of what a small improvement they are on existing figures—in fact, I think it is fair to argue that there is no improvement, but there is some indexation—that the problems with this bill really emerge. 
The other serious problem that Labor are very concerned about is, as the shadow minister for education also said, the delaying of targeted literacy funding until kids are failing, until you pick up that they are failing, before you pay them some attention. We know—it is incontrovertible—that the earlier we start inculcating children with a good attitude and good habits when it comes to literacy, the greater their chances of success are later in life. In an area where we have already measured low educational outcomes for many Indigenous Australians, it seems insane to wait until we have documentary proof that they are failing literacy tests before targeting attention to literacy problems.
It should be noted also that the government is setting up a situation such that urban and regional Aboriginal children will lose funding and that money will be transferred to remote communities. Nobody argues that remote Aboriginal communities do not need more attention. Of course they do. I do not think there would be a single person in the parliament who would argue that the resources available to children in remote Aboriginal communities are adequate and that they provide the same standard of education that any other Australian citizen should expect for their child. However, to improve that situation or to supplement that funding at the expense of other disadvantaged communities—and I certainly have a significant Aboriginal population in my seat and I can tell you that there are significant educational issues that have to be addressed there—and to say that money should be taken away from kids in urban areas to make up the shortfall in remote communities beggars belief, especially when you look at the way that funding has been massively increased to the wealthiest category 1 schools.
In my seat almost half of the Indigenous population is under the age of 18. That is fairly common across the Indigenous community. It is a very young community. I see constantly in my visits to the local schools that have a large number of Aboriginal kids that the schools are doing fantastic, innovative work. They are looking at the new Aboriginal studies syllabus developed by the New South Wales department of education but they are also doing their own things. They have good relationships with local Aboriginal communities. They have language programs to teach Aboriginal languages. They have sporting programs that involve Aboriginal sporting celebrities. Alexandria Park Community School, which is just one example in my electorate, has adopted terrific measures for dealing with truancy, which was a significant issue not just with their population of Aboriginal kids but with their population of non-Aboriginal kids as well. These innovative measures show the sort of special attention that is needed in urban Aboriginal communities. To think that these measures might be reduced to try and do something about remote Aboriginal communities beggars belief.
The existing strategic initiatives funding will continue in 2005-08 but has basically been frozen, so the funding for programs like the National Indigenous English Literacy and Numeracy Strategy, English as a Second Language for Indigenous Language Speaking Students, Scaffolding Literacy pilots, Indigenous education consultative bodies, Indigenous support units and Crocfest mentoring pilots is frozen. All of them are good and successful projects. Funding for all of them has been frozen.
One of the areas of concern that I also wanted to raise was the Aboriginal Student Support and Parent Awareness programs and the effect that this bill will have on funding for ASSPA. Indigenous parent committees were created as a way of improving access, participation and outcomes for Indigenous preschool and school students and involving Indigenous parents in educational decision making. In the past, each Indigenous parents committee was funded at about $215 per Indigenous student. The government's changes now require these committees to apply for funding, and there is a fairly well-founded expectation that a number of communities will not pick up the new arrangements. They will be further disadvantaged, even if they do find out what they are supposed to do, by not having a great deal of experience in putting in submissions for funding from government departments. 
The area of government support and financial assistance for Indigenous parents is an issue that is of particular interest to me. Recently we had a state government inquiry into issues in the Redfern and Waterloo area. The inquiry was sparked by the tragic death of a young Redfern boy, TJ—Thomas—Hickey. At the time, I presented a submission to the inquiry. I said then that early childhood programs can be really useful as a way of developing parenting skills, promoting health and improving the school preparedness of children from disadvantaged backgrounds. Child-care centres and preschools are generally unthreatening environments to run excellent courses like positive parenting programs. We should be extending our relationship with parents of all disadvantaged kids, but it really applies in Aboriginal communities as well.
In areas where there is a significant Indigenous population preschools should reflect that. While it is commonly acknowledged that preschool is a major benefit in overcoming early disadvantage, only a small minority of Indigenous students actually attend preschool. So improving residents' access to local and culturally appropriate child-care centres and preschools in my area should be a priority. That is just the sort of thing that the parent committees could be talking about. But it is also another example of how we should be focusing on disadvantage in urban areas, as well as in regional areas and remote areas.
We have a terrifically well-regarded preschool, Murrawina, in Redfern. I note that in New Zealand they have Maori preschools where part of the education is undertaken in the Maori language. In doing that, you develop bilingual children from an early age and you also instil in children an understanding of and a sense of pride in their culture, which I think is really important and valuable.
The Senate report on poverty and financial hardship, which was released earlier in the year, recommended that the Commonwealth provide additional funding to approve affordability of child care for Indigenous children and that the Commonwealth work with the states to improve access by Indigenous children to early childhood education facilities. Better access to culturally appropriate child care and early education would be very beneficial in the Redfern and Waterloo communities. In addition to such structured programs, support and recognition should be given to the Aboriginal aunties who perform such a stabilising and caring role for children as much in urban communities as in regional and remote communities. Another advantage of the Aboriginal Student Support and Parent Awareness Program is that it involves people like that in decisions about education.
The Senate report on poverty also acknowledged the failure of the education system to meet the needs of disadvantaged children and recommended that the Commonwealth fund the establishment of school breakfast programs in disadvantaged areas and provide additional funding for services for disadvantaged students based on the socioeconomic profile of the school community. That is a bit different to what this legislation suggests. 
Another area of the bill that I wanted to raise was the Aboriginal Tutorial Assistance Scheme. The department has indicated that there is a proposal to transfer $50 million from the Aboriginal Student Support and Parent Awareness Program to the Aboriginal Tutorial Assistance Scheme. As we said earlier, there is a concern when it comes to linking funding to literacy testing where tutorial assistance may not be available until the year after the first year of testing year 3 students—waiting for kids to fail before we start to do something about poor literacy standards.
I also wanted to speak a little about Abstudy. I have been contacted more than once by Aboriginal people seeking support for their studies in, for example, community management at university level and finding that the way the Commonwealth pays Abstudy makes it very difficult to undertake or complete these studies. In 1998 the government, as part of its mainstreaming of specialised and targeted assistance, foreshadowed changes to Abstudy that would in effect bring Abstudy in line with the then non-Indigenous student assistance—Youth Allowance. There were also significant changes to away from base benefits, whereby payments would no longer be made to the individual but instead would be made to the educational institution.
Under the Hawke-Keating governments, Indigenous enrolments doubled from two per cent in 1986 to 4.1 per cent in 1996. Most of this increase occurred in the non-university sector. Since then, the figures have fallen, which has to be, at least in part, because of the changes to Abstudy which have made life so much more difficult for Aboriginal students. In 2000, there was a 15.2 per cent drop in the number of Indigenous students commencing university courses. Broken down, there was a 16 per cent drop in male Indigenous students commencing enrolments and a 14.7 per cent drop in female Indigenous students commencing. Overall, there was an 8.1 per cent drop between 1999 and 2000.
There is another issue that I wanted to briefly mention in relation to Indigenous education. The Bachelor of Nursing, Indigenous Australian Health, course at Sydney University—a four-year degree, including a major in Indigenous studies and health—is, we hope, going to be offered at the Orange campus. There has been a great deal of controversy at Sydney University because the minister for education has made all sorts of announcements about allowing cuts to nursing to proceed at Sydney University. The Bachelor of Nursing, Indigenous Australian Health, is an incredibly highly specialised degree that has taken years to develop at Sydney University. The fact that this course will be cut at Sydney University is a terrible waste and a real disappointment.
We have a number of excellent supports for Aboriginal students—at Sydney University, the University of Technology and Tranby College in my electorate—but it is very hard to encourage young Indigenous Australians to take up their places at a university level when what we see is a government at infant school level, before preschool level, preschool level and high school level undermining support for Indigenous students and pitting one group of Indigenous students against another group of Indigenous students.",REPS,<title>INDIGENOUS EDUCATION (TARGETED ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2004-08-09,"—Before I get into the main part of my speech, I would like to endorse what the member for Sydney has said, in that it is very wrong for the government to introduce legislation that is creating two classes of Indigenous students. I would also like to acknowledge that the member for Sydney's electorate has one of the highest—if not the highest—populations of Indigenous Australians in Australia. The Indigenous people whom she represents in this parliament are as disadvantaged as Indigenous Australians elsewhere—if not more disadvantaged. I think it is very important to recognise that the level of disadvantage is the same for Indigenous people no matter where they live, and I will concentrate a little bit more on that later in my contribution to this debate. 
I rise to support the amendment to the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2004 moved by the member for Capricornia. In doing so, I would like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that it is International Day of the World's Indigenous People—a day on which Australia should be making a real commitment to improving outcomes for Indigenous Australians rather than debating more legislation that the Howard government has introduced to deliver second-class outcomes to Australia's Indigenous people. It is interesting to note on International Day of the World's Indigenous People that this government has not recognised the entrenched disadvantage experienced by all Indigenous Australians and has not made any real commitment to addressing this disadvantage.
During the time that the Howard government has been in office, it has been the decade of Indigenous people. That ends this year. I hope that coincides with the ending of the Howard government's term in office because I think that would be a really positive outcome for Indigenous Australians. Nations like the United States, Canada and New Zealand have narrowed the opportunity gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people, but Australia, unfortunately, has failed to make real progress in this area. In some cases, the level of disadvantage has even increased. That is a shameful legacy of this government. We as Australians should hang our heads in shame when we look at the fall in life expectancy of Indigenous women and the growing gap in the life expectancy of Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. I feel that any nation that can allow this to happen is not addressing the real issues.
One of the real issues that needs to be addressed is education. When you improve educational outcomes, you improve all other socioeconomic outcomes, such as the health of Indigenous Australians. I have already noted that poor health outcomes are one of the legacies of Indigenous Australians. They have a much higher morbidity rate and a much higher mortality rate than non-Indigenous Australians. In the previous parliament I was involved in an inquiry into Indigenous health. The inquiry found that no matter where Indigenous Australians lived those health outcomes were the same. If they lived in remote areas they had much poorer health outcomes than non-Indigenous Australians, but that was also the case in metropolitan and provincial areas. It was not something that was confined to remote areas.
Indigenous Australians have much poorer educational outcomes in every facet of education, and I will spend a little more time on that in my further contribution to this debate. They also have a higher level of unemployment, which is of course linked to their education and their ability to develop the skills and knowledge they need to compete in the employment market. There is a higher proportion of the Indigenous population in prisons, and that is something that we should hang our heads in shame about. Once again, that is linked to poor educational outcomes. There is a greater percentage of the Indigenous population in receipt of welfare payments. Once again, poor education leads to high unemployment and poorer socioeconomic outcomes. 
What is the response of the Howard government to the crisis that we have in Indigenous Australia? The Howard government's response is to mainstream programs and to remove specialist programs that are designed to address that level of disadvantage. Those programs that are left in place are to take place within the mainstream. Legislation like this will entrench the level of disadvantage that already exists and is synonymous with the Howard government's approach to anything to do with Indigenous Australians.
The Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2004 will legislate funding of $641.6 million over 2005-08 under the Indigenous Education Strategic Initiatives Program. A sum of $513 million will be provided to maintain supplementary recurrent assistance for Indigenous students and $128.1 million will be provided for ongoing and new strategic projects. Unfortunately, despite the rhetoric from the minister, there is no real growth money. When you look at the figures—when you look at the money that has been allocated—it really is indexation money that just keeps pace with the increase in costs.
Supplementary funding for Indigenous students will continue to be paid to government and non-government education providers across the preschool, school and vocational education and training sectors in remote, provincial, rural and metropolitan areas. The issue I have with this is that there will be a greater level of funding to students who are attending in remote areas. As I have pointed out, for health, education and every socioeconomic determinant there is a similar gap, be it in a remote area or in a metropolitan or provincial area.
No matter where an Indigenous student goes to school, they are more likely to leave school early, they are more likely to perform poorly and they are more likely to be unable to find employment once they leave school. I think that this is a very poor approach to dealing with Indigenous education, where you create two classes of students, where you create a situation where students that I represent in this parliament, who are equally as disadvantaged as students who live in remote areas, are going to be treated in a different way. There are special circumstances for students attending schools in remote areas, and those special circumstances need to be catered for within the education that they are offered. They do have some special needs. But the point I am making is that students within metropolitan areas—within areas like the electorate I represent—also have significant problems and also need special assistance. This government is failing to recognise the special needs of Indigenous students in electorates such as Shortland and Sydney.
This legislation will continue the strategic initiatives funding at its existing level of $128.1 million. That means that the funding has been frozen in nominal terms. Of course, this will have implications for Indigenous students. Existing projects which will continue to be funded include the $74.5 million National Indigenous English Literacy and Numeracy Strategy; the English as a Second Language-Indigenous Language Speaking Students program; the Scaffolding Literacy program, which is an excellent program that I may talk about a little later in my contribution; Indigenous education consultative bodies and Indigenous support units; Croc Festivals; and mentoring pilot programs. Those mentoring programs should be further extended. I do not think there is a better way of improving the situation for young Indigenous students than through mentoring and putting in place the resources to support those mentoring programs. Other projects will progress: coalitions with school principals to champion Indigenous education in their schools and communities by setting measurable goals for improvement in literacy and retention tests, and extending the Scaffolding Literacy program. The scaffolding approach to teaching literacy is a new flagship project that has proven especially effective with Indigenous students in remote areas. 
This legislation will also have implications for the Aboriginal Student Support and Parenting Awareness, ASSPA, program. This program has been very successful in bringing the parents of Indigenous students and the community as a whole into the school community. It has had very positive outcomes. The funding is around $215 per Indigenous student in the program within the school. I think that ASSPA has been a very positive experience in the schools that I represent in this House. I know that the ASSPA committees in my schools work very closely with the Indigenous students and with the school community as a whole. They have helped develop the self-esteem and the educational and sporting outcomes of many of the Indigenous students within those schools.
There is widespread concern about the government's proposal to change the funding arrangements for these programs. The arrangements will effectively be abolished, and funding for such programs will be based on submissions. Once again, that will produce a situation that this government uses regularly, where in order to get any funding you have to complete a submission. Your ability to complete that submission will determine the level of your funding, so a school or a community that has a high level of expertise in being able to complete a submission will do so and be able to attract the funding and the most disadvantaged communities with the least skills will be those that miss out. I have real concerns about that.
Let us look at the history that precedes this legislation. In 1989, all governments in Australia signed up to the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Policy. The broad goal of this was to increase equity between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians, and this was to be achieved through delivering supplementary programs to provide for Indigenous specific education. This has happened, and I think there have been some real improvements in the educational standards and outcomes of Indigenous students accompanying that, although I must say that that improvement has not been nearly good enough.
In 1999, the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs reaffirmed a set of eight priorities. These were: improving literacy; improving numeracy; improving educational outcomes for Indigenous students; increasing Indigenous enrolments; increasing Indigenous employment in education and training, which is a very important point, because once that happens it works well for the Indigenous students; increasing professional development of staff involved with Indigenous students; involving Indigenous parents and community members in education, which is exactly what ASSPA has done, and it has been very successful; and expanding cultural diversity and activities within schools.
When I was looking at how successful these initiatives have been, I decided to look at the National report to parliament on Indigenous education and training 2002. The retention rate to year 12 for Indigenous students was 38 per cent, compared to the rate for non-Indigenous students of 76.3 per cent. I must put on the record that the retention rate has improved over the years, but I think it is an absolute disgrace that the retention rate to year 12 for Indigenous students in this country is basically half that for non-Indigenous students. We need to look at all of the social indicators and the retention rates of Indigenous students, and I am doing that by referring to the report I just mentioned. There is a gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous students in formative writing, in numeracy and literacy, and in retention rates all through school. Also, there is a distinct gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous students in truancy. It is very important to point out that this gap is similar be they in remote Australia, metropolitan areas or provincial areas. 
In 2001, the results showed that 72 per cent of Indigenous students achieved the reading benchmark, compared to 90.3 per cent of all students; that 67.8 per cent of Indigenous students reached the writing benchmark, compared to 89.5 per cent of all students; and that 80.2 per cent of Indigenous students reached the numeracy benchmark, compared to 93.9 per cent of non-Indigenous students. It is important to note that numeracy was the category that Indigenous students performed best in. When it came to retention rates and school attendance, once again there was a big disparity between the rates for non-Indigenous and Indigenous students.
In the last minute remaining to me, I would like to turn to the amendment moved by the member for Capricornia and endorse the four points she made. It is absolutely imperative that the ASSPA programs continue and I think the changes mooted by the government will be very detrimental to them. The government has failed to recognise the needs of Indigenous students in non-remote areas, and that needs to be addressed. If this government continues to create two classes of people, Indigenous people will not be the only ones who are disadvantaged; all Australians will be disadvantaged. It is imperative that the government embraces Indigenous students who live in non-remote areas just as it embraces those living in remote areas.

"Katter, Bob, MP",IND,2004-08-09,"—In speaking on the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2004, I do not wish to canvass the debate and repeat the things I said in the House the other evening, but I think it behoves me and everyone else in the House to recall the figures that I quoted. Those figures show that, if you live in urban Australia, retention rates to 12th grade are over 70 per cent; if you live in rural Australia, retention rates are around 70 per cent; but, if you live in remote Australia, retention rates are only 55 per cent. The reason for those figures is that they incorporate what in Queensland were the old mission areas and the 40,000 or 50,000 people living on the Napranums and Mer and Yam islands in the Torres Strait, as well as the Woorabindas, the Doomadgees and the Mornington Islands. They also incorporate small towns, and so many of our small towns in Queensland—particularly in Western and Northern Queensland—comprise a very large proportion of people of part Aboriginal, part Torres Strait Island or part South Pacific descent.
There is no doubt, as the previous speaker, the member for Shortland, mentioned, that people in these areas show very low success rates academically. That being the case, the government should be going where the problems are most serious, and there is no doubt that the problems are most serious in these areas. You are dealing with people whose cultural values do not really lend themselves to having a formal education system.
When I was the Aboriginal affairs minister in Queensland, we launched programs that taught rough riding. In the first year, three of our pupils were in the money in the Mount Isa rodeo, which was a remarkable achievement. We went into the field of rugby league and got rugby league going in most of the community areas. This year, with the help of a number of others, I am proud to say that we have restarted the Mid West Rugby League, which includes Doomadgee. I do not know whether Doomadgee were really part of the rest of Australia until they started playing football. Now all the people in the mid-west towns of North Queensland know all the people in Doomadgee by name; they know them personally. They have met them and are friends with them—although in some cases they are worthy enemies on the football field. The people in Doomadgee are now a part of the rest of Australia. 
It is quite remarkable to see the achievements that come with success in these areas—including in the field of country music. When it is said that these people are culturally bereft, that is not actually true. I always listen to the Aboriginal radio stations when I am in the big major cities, because they play an awful lot of Australian country music and that is the music I most like. Having been brought up in a town where probably 50 per cent of the population were of part Aboriginal descent, the cultural background that I enjoy is the same as that of the people in the community areas of Doomadgee, Mornington Island, Pompuraaw, Kowanyama or wherever.
The problems with education in these remote areas are very real indeed. One of my first memories of one of these very isolated settlements was when I was out at Camooweal for the Camooweal sports. The wife of a friend of mine was a teacher out there. Of a morning they used to round the kids up from the Aboriginal part of Camooweal. One young teacher would go around the back and another would go round the front. When the kids would run out the back, playing truant, they would pick them up, put them in the car, and take them off to school. Today they would probably put those teachers in jail or run some terrible story about them in the newspapers. But those people at Camooweal got an education.
I can remember the governor tackling me about education in the area. I felt like pointing out to him that what happened to Charles I and James I is what happens when the Crown starts giving orders to the elected government. He pointed out that at Aurukun there were appallingly high truancy rates. I told the governor that it was not under my jurisdiction, and he said to me that he had given me a piece of paper saying that I was responsible for Aboriginal affairs in the state of Queensland and he wanted those kids to go to school. Short of what they were doing at Camooweal—rounding up the kids like you would round up cattle, putting them in the bus and taking them off to school virtually by force—I really could not figure out a way to force those kids to go to school in Aurukun. The values are different. I interjected during the previous member's contribution and asked, `How would you suggest we lift these figures?'
One way in which these figures are lifted dramatically is sending the kids away to boarding schools. This can be very hard on kids—particularly when kids from very Aboriginal backgrounds are suddenly thrown into predominantly European communities. But by the same token those kids love sport, as all kids do, and maybe they are a little bit better at it than most other kids; consequently they are suddenly valued in these schools and they start to understand that they can cut it in the wider world. When they go back to their communities they are not intimidated and do not feel that they are inferior to anyone. I am looking at mechanisms by which we can overcome the self-image of inferiority that has been so tragically ingrained in the people of these communities.
In saying these things, I must reflect upon the Torres Strait Islands. The education system in the Torres Strait Islands was basically a matter of the Anglican priest on each of the islands going away to do a course and then coming back as a school teacher. His major mission was to inculcate Christian values—the annual holiday in the Torres Strait Islands is the Coming of the Light, and I think that they are probably the most successful race. I have never been overseas—I only read books—but, at least when I was minister, the Torres Strait Islands had the lowest rate of alcoholism anywhere in the world, and that includes the predominantly European communities on the mainland. 
The Torres Strait Islands had the lowest crime rate of any communities in Queensland, as well as the most successful marriages. They probably had the highest rate of churchgoing of any communities in Queensland—or in Australia or, I suspect, on earth. It did not matter what social indicator you wanted to look at, these people seemed to be way out in front. I can remember going to Mer Island, which got a lot of fame because it was the island of Eddie Mabo—and I do not wish to reflect in any way upon Eddie Mabo, but he was out of the legal case on its third day. It was Father Passi—a man of towering integrity, intellectual vigour and very great sanctity—who carried that case forward, and Father Passi was very typical of the sort of school teacher that you had in the Torres Strait Islands.
I cannot assign the enormous success of the Torres Strait Islands communities to anything other than the Torres Strait Islanders' very deep commitment to Christianity, Christian values and the Christian way of life. I remember asking the lady who ran the store on Mer Island whether the store had ever been broken into. It took about 10 minutes to explain to her what `broken into' meant. She had never even heard of it. That store, in her lifetime—she was a woman of about 45 or 46 years of age—had never been broken into. When it was explained to her what it was, she recoiled in horror at the idea that anyone would do that. That would never happen on Mer Island. I told her that the store that my family owned in Cloncurry was broken into at least once every two years, and it was insured as burglar-proof. So the world in which the rest of us live is awfully different from the Torres Strait Islands.
The Torres Strait Islands deserve very close study, because they are enormously successful communities. From what I know of the rest of the world and Australia, they are easily the most successful communities around, and it is with very great regret that I have watched them come into the more conventional education system supplied by the Queensland government. As they do, I suspect that all the social indicators will fall more into step with the communities on mainland Australia, and that will not be a happy thing at all. Unfortunately and sadly, the social indicators at the old mission communities—once reserve communities and now deed of grant communities—are truly very ugly indeed. Some of the worst statistics that we can see anywhere in the world are from those communities. There are a lot of reasons for this, but I will just touch on two.
We have had people standing up this evening and telling us that education is going to solve the problems of remote Indigenous communities, but there is another issue. In the Aboriginal communities in Australia, by law you cannot own your own home. You cannot own your own business, you cannot own a piece of land, you cannot own your own station, you cannot own your own farm—you cannot own anything. We have a throwback to the Middle Ages—feudal times; we have a throwback to the era of communism, when the state owned everything. We have a most sad situation. 
Tonight I will not go over the infamous act that the incoming government inherited in 1956. A lot of socialists in this place often refer to conservative governments, but in 1956 it was the Labor government and the incoming Country Party government that inherited that legislation and got rid of it. Of the seven horrific elements of that infamous act—and it cannot be described in any other way—one that bears comment upon is the fact that people of Aboriginal descent were not allowed to drink. There will be those in this place and in the Queensland state parliament who will advocate that. They will say that that is a good thing. If ever there was an acknowledgement of the total bankruptcy of government policies, it was that legislation—the fact that they passed the most discriminatory of measures.
I can remember, back in the bad old days, when a big team would finish a drove and come into town after six months in the saddle. The whitefellas would go into the pub and drink, and the blackfellas would not be able to, because they were not allowed to. They were not allowed to have their wages paid to them either. They would sit around the next day, all day, waiting for the policeman, the local director of native affairs, to give them some money. But they still could not go to the pub, even when they were given that money. Of course, if they asked for money to buy alcohol, the money would not be given to them. Whether they were paid their own wages was at the discretion of the director of native affairs. Those were the horrific sorts of laws that existed in Queensland in 1956. I have just touched on two elements of them, but they had seven major elements and one of them was particularly pernicious.
We have heard a massive amount of publicity in the media about the stolen children, and what we always seem to hear about is a kid of Aboriginal descent being taken away and handed over to a white family for education and upbringing—and we are talking about education here now. But that is not the horrific happening that was the stolen children; the horrific happening that was the stolen children was the dormitory system. It is with deep regret that I say this, because I think the missionaries were very good people, but in my opinion they were terribly misguided when they took children from their parents. They did that for four generations and then they expected a race of people to still exist as a race of people, with any sort of civilisation and culture. You take four generations of kids off their parents, put them behind a big chain-wire enclosure and cut them off completely from their parents—it was pretty horrific stuff but it was all in the name of the little carpenter from Nazareth and it went on for four generations—and surprise, surprise, they are shattered. If you want to shatter a race of people, that is probably a very good way to go about it. I really do not think it was a very good advertisement for Christianity. But that, of course, did not happen on the Torres Strait Islands.
We see the results of these things. We see that people do not put a very high value upon the formal education system as it stands, but when we realise what their cultural inheritance is and what their horrific past was like we can understand that there are a lot of shortcomings out there that need to be addressed. If the rest of the community looks at the Torres Strait Islands, on the other hand, they will see a group of people doing it better than anywhere else in the world, and I think that has a lot to do with the education system they had. I pay a very fine tribute to the wonderful missionaries that went there. The Anglican priests that went to the Torres Strait Islands were Vanuatu islanders in the main, brought in by the London Missionary Society. They were black priests, to name the colour of those people, and they came to the Torres Strait Islands, bringing the light, and now their national day is called the Coming of the Light Day. 
Previous speakers spoke about the fact that there should not be discrimination between people of Aboriginal descent in the outlying and remote communities and those in the towns and cities. The necessity for a different approach to education in the remote communities is screaming at us. There is a huge difference between a remote community, an urban community and a rural community. The difference is absolutely enormous. We are talking about a 50 per cent versus a 70 per cent retention rate to 12th grade and worse for tertiary.
I pay great tribute to the very fine schools in Charters Towers. I went to one of them—Mount Carmel—and they also include All Souls, Thornborough and their concomitant girls' schools. A very good friend of mine at the Anglican school there found out he could get a lot of hard work academically out of the kids by simply dropping them from the football team. He found he could achieve a remarkable increase in the level of their academic performance by doing that. I mention these things with humour, but I mention them to indicate to you that there is a pathway out.
For Torres Strait Island teachers, for people of predominantly European background and for people of predominantly Aboriginal background there is a pathway out. Someone such as Peter Harvey-Sutton, a long-term teacher at All Souls in Charters Towers, shows us a pathway out. In Camooweal those two teachers that rounded the kids up every morning of their lives, grabbing them physically and putting them in the back of the bus to cart them off to school, showed the dedication that is really needed. If you are critical of those people for doing that then I have to tell you that it is important for the kids to get an education and there is no way that that is going to happen without the use of some form of force. It is simply not happening at the present moment. The kids are growing up without education. They are not completing their 12th grade. We are not getting the diesel fitters that we need—they are needed in any community; we are not getting the plumbers that we need; we are not getting the electricians that we need; and we are not getting the doctors that we need. Finally, on the issue of the bill before the House, there does have to be a different approach. I very strongly agree with the minister and disagree with the opposition. There needs to be a very strong commitment to those remote communities.

"Windsor, Antony, MP",IND,2004-08-09,"—I was listening very closely to the member for Kennedy, and I was just wondering towards the end of his speech how many times he was dropped from the football team. I am sure that had something to do with all his great contributions in this House not only on Aboriginal affairs but on ethanol and other matters of concern to country people.
Tonight I am pleased to be able to speak to the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2004. Not all of the speakers that have spoken tonight have stuck directly to the leave of the bill, and there are a number of issues that I would like to talk about, the first of which is a recent visit I made to a school in my electorate. It is called Ross Hill Public School and it is in Inverell. The visit was in order to look at in-school tuition. Part of the bill is about in-school tuition for Indigenous children, and the scheme I looked at in Inverell at Ross Hill was about in-school tuition for children in years 1, 2 and 3. It is a similar program to the one that is being endorsed in the bill, although there the age group is being shifted to years 3, 5 and 7. One of the issues that was raised very clearly at Ross Hill—by the staff and, very importantly, by the parents—was the fact that although the kids that were receiving the tuition were, in the main, Aboriginal children, not all of them were Aboriginal children. They were children who were starting to slip behind in terms of their academic futures and needed some special treatment—very similar to the in-house tuition that the bill talks about. 
I was very impressed with the way in which the tuition was being given and the cost-effectiveness of the tuition. You could see the progress of these kids over the period since the tuition had started—I think they had been going for something like six weeks at that particular time. Some of the Aboriginal parents were coming to the school to assist, and others were also assisting. The program allowed for two teachers plus some assistants for two hours a day—and the program runs for something like six months. But one of the points that was made to me at that school was that there was great concern that if the changes took place as indicated in this bill—if that in-house tuition and intervention to help these kids was moved from years 1, 2 and 3, if it was shifted to years 3, 5 and 7—in most cases it would be too late.
When the minister responds to the debate—I will not be supporting the opposition's amendment, even though I do have some very real sympathy for part 3 of the amendment that talks about the tuition in relation to years 3, 5 and 7—I ask him to outline, if he can, what he sees as the benefits of shifting to a higher age group. It seemed to me—and it seemed to the teachers and the parents at Ross Hill Public School—that this was a program that was working very well: it was very cost-effective; the kids were gaining confidence; and it had not been left until they were older and were set in concrete in terms of some of their ways and their capacity to address some of the issues relating to number, English expression and the sorts of things that they were learning. I ask the minister if he would explain why the shift has been suggested and I would ask him to look very closely at it. I personally invite him to come and see what is happening at Ross Hill Public School, because I think there are some great things to be learnt there. I ask him to reconsider the current position and at least to address it in his concluding speech.
Aboriginal education, as the member for Kennedy said, is very important. If we are really going to come to grips with some of the societal problems in our communities, everybody is going to have to receive at least some basic education—and I hark back again to the program I saw at Ross Hill. Another positive in my electorate is an independent, essentially private, Aboriginal school based in Armidale. It is called Minimbah school. There are a number of special problems at this school. It is a private school that mainly caters for Aboriginal students, but it does not cater only for Aboriginal students. It is funded—and I have had communications with the minister for education on this particular issue—under the same formula as other private schools such as the King's School, which is often mentioned in this place in terms of the allocation of funding.
There are a number of things that are peculiar to Minimbah Aboriginal school. One is that it is run by an outstanding Aboriginal woman called Diane Roberts, who has made a major contribution over many years to the Aboriginal community, particularly in trying to get kids to learn, to respect learning, respect their elders and respect their teachers. This woman has an amazing capacity and is probably one of the leaders in Aboriginal education. I would ask the minister to pay very special attention to some of the work that this lady has done. 
Diane Roberts set up Minimbah Aboriginal school—which, as I said, is not only for Aboriginal students—as an independent school, with similar funding formulas to those of the other independent schools, and in doing so she has faced two problems. One is, in a sense, peculiar to Aboriginal people and relates to their heritage, which is thousands of years old. The formula is based on the number of students who happen to be in the school. This can vary from time to time as they come and go. It is generally registered on a particular day of the year. You would probably recognise, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker Lindsay, that it can be quite cold in Armidale. Some of the Aboriginal people spend most of the year in Armidale but go back to the coast during some of the very cold months of winter. That has an impact on the school's funding stream.
The other problem, which is unique to this school, is that because of the income status of most of the parents there is no capacity for them to make a major contribution to the school, as happens in most other independent schools. There is a need—and, as I said, I have approached the minister for education on this issue—for some administrative controls and specialisation to be put in place. The school recently made to the minister a submission for assistance—firstly, to recognise the Aboriginality of the school in relation to the movement of some of the parents and hence the children that happens from time to time and upsets the numbers and obviously the funding formulas; secondly, to recognise the income capacity of the parents; and, thirdly, to recognise the need for some administrative support for the school so that it can be more correctly financially managed. I thank the minister for his recent communications. I think the most recent was on 6 August, when he said that his department would be working with Minimbah to assess their submission et cetera. I hope that there will be a positive outcome for that facility.
Obviously education is important for Aboriginal people. It is about preparedness for life after school. One of the other positives in my electorate—and it did not start in my electorate but in the member for Gwydir's electorate at Moree—was the Aboriginal employment strategy. It was started by a cotton grower named Dick Estens. Most of you have probably heard of Dick Estens in relation to the Telstra inquiry. I was somewhat critical of some of the determinations of that inquiry, but Dick Estens has done an outstanding job on the Aboriginal employment strategy, and I congratulate him on his efforts. That strategy started in Moree to try to come to grips with the unemployment levels of Aboriginal people, how work could be provided and how the business community could be involved, and there have been a number of outstanding successes.
The strategy has been transferred to Tamworth, which is in my electorate, and I am pleased to say that it is getting similar results there. The Aboriginal community are embracing the scheme. It is a very well-run operation. I am pleased to say that I have been into a number of businesses that have been involved in the strategy, and the scheme has worked so well that some of them are not on their first employee but on their second or, in some cases, third. That is the eventual outcome that is going to overcome a lot of problems.
Whether they are black, white or brindle, if a person has confidence in their own future, the capacity to express themselves and the ability to be engaged in the work force proper, they can become a very substantial and important part of our society. I raised the issue of Dick Estens's Aboriginal employment strategy because I think it should be examined as a model. It is a fairly trim and streamlined operation that is actually getting results. A lot of money has been invested over many years in a whole range of social programs that have not achieved any results. They sound good at the time and employ a number of public servants, but they do not in many cases deliver results. 
Another positive is the Youth Insearch program. I was talking abut this with the former Premier of New South Wales and former minister of this parliament, John Fahey, recently at Wal Murray's funeral in Moree. One of the things that I am very proud of, and was instrumental in with John Fahey—when he was Premier of New South Wales and I was the member for Tamworth—was the initiation of a funding package to establish the Coledale Community Centre. Coledale is a mainly but not totally Aboriginal community. Again, that community centre has been an outstanding success. I think we have to look at the things that are successful and grow those particular programs.
One of the things to come out of the Coledale Community Centre in recent months is the participation of many of the younger Aboriginal children, the teenagers, in the Youth Insearch program. That is a program which the government does not really pay much heed to in terms of financial assistance, but it is a program that has outstanding results with children who are on the edge of going one way or the other, and it is a program that I think should be assisted. I refer to a comment by the local magistrate in Tamworth who as a Rotarian has taken up the local custodianship, I guess, of the Youth Insearch program. He said he would rather help kids through Youth Insearch than when they come before him as a magistrate. I am very pleased to be able to report that recently a number of children from the Coledale Community Centre attended Youth Insearch camps and they were very favourably received. The majority of them were of Aboriginal descent.
Obviously, the bill refers to tertiary education as well. I would like to mention tonight the very concerning circumstances that became evident in the last week in relation to the University of New England, which is based in Armidale. It relates to allegations of cash for comment in terms of some advertorials that were placed in the Tamworth paper, the Northern Daily Leader, and the Armidale Express. A University of New England ad was printed, endorsing the new centre for mathematics, a great scheme that will help a whole range of teachers and professionals right across the education sphere, including Aboriginal and other communities—it is a great program. But the advertorial that was placed in the paper duped two of the university's senior staff.
I bring that to the minister's attention because I would ask that he carry out an investigation of the role that The Nationals Senator Sandy Macdonald and his office played in the placing of advertisements promoting a candidate of The Nationals and in using the editorial portion of an ad paid for by the University of New England, which was quite a genuine ad about the new centre for mathematics and information. The editorial, it seems, was written by the office of Senator Sandy Macdonald, so there seems to be a real need for an investigation. I am told that the university council, of which I am a member, is going to investigate this matter, but I think that, since it is to do with the role played by a senator in this parliament, the minister should investigate who paid for the ad, and whether that ad, in a sense, paid for the editorial.
There has been an admission through Rural Press that the advertorial was actually scripted by a senator from The Nationals but paid for by the University of New England. I ask Senator Sandy Macdonald—because radio stations have been calling me every 20 minutes today to make a comment on this, and this has been going on for a number of days—to comment on his role and the role of his office in this particular matter, apologise to the people of New England and repay to the University of New England the moneys that they expended on what they believed to be a legitimate advertisement, not one intended to pay for funded editorials. I raise that matter, which is of some concern, and ask the minister to take those comments on board and, particularly, to carry out an investigation. 
In conclusion, there has been a lot of talk over the years about Aboriginal communities and how we can help them into the future. There is a community not far from my electorate—again, in the member for Gwydir's electorate—that I have essentially grown up with and played football with as a kid, where I think there has been some outstanding leadership in terms of not only the education of children but also the society and community values that are held, and that is the Walhallow community.
If people are really looking for models, there are a number of them out there. Ross Hill, which I talked about, is a model; the Aboriginal Employment Strategy is a model; Minimbah Aboriginal school is a model; Coledale is a model of how people can work together and achieve; and the Walhallow community is an outstanding model of substantial government investment over the years. Walhallow has reaped the rewards of having a great community that has become part of the broader community while maintaining its Aboriginality in great fashion.
I will be supporting the legislation. I do ask the minister, though, to look very closely at the third section of the opposition's amendment, because it does reflect some very real concerns out in my electorate, particularly about the shift of in-class tuition from years 1, 2 and 3 to years 3, 5 and 7.",REPS,<title>INDIGENOUS EDUCATION (TARGETED ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2004-08-09,"—Tonight we are addressing the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2004, which provides funding for the Indigenous Education Strategic Initiatives Program—IESIP—and the Indigenous Education Direct Assistance—IEDA—program for the 2005-08 quadrennium. There is little contention with much of this bill, other than the government's continuing failure to properly address and recognise the crisis in Indigenous education across this country. While the government claims a so-called increase of $128.1 million in funding, frankly this is simply treading water and is just in line with inflation. However, I want to address my remarks in particular to the amendment which has been moved by the Labor Party. I want to read that amendment into the Hansard because my remarks from hereon in will go to each point in it. It states:
That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
“whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for:
(1)	failing to provide real increases in funding for urgently needed recurrent and capital programs in primary and secondary schools for indigenous students and their families;
(2)	introducing major changes to the operation of programs, particularly ASSPA committees, without full consultation with indigenous communities;
(3)	failing to provide strategic intervention in the early years of primary schooling by changing the focus of support for tutorial assistance to indigenous students who fail to meet national literacy and numeracy benchmarks in Years 3, 5 and 7; and
(4)	fostering instability in funding arrangements for the Supplementary Recurrent Assistance program and failing to recognise the disadvantage experienced by all indigenous students whether they live in metropolitan, regional, rural or remote areas of Australia”. 
I implore the House to support these amendments because they articulate, in a very coherent way, the concerns that have been expressed across Australia about this legislation and, in particular, the changes which the government proposes in relation to the IEDA program. On 5 April 2004, the minister announced changes to the Aboriginal Student Support and Parent Awareness Program. Frankly, these changes will bury that program in red tape and bureaucracy. As a result of these changes, the department will require ASSPA committees—which, as you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker Lindsay, are made up of parents of Indigenous students—to write detailed submissions each time their committee needs a payment for a school project, even a classroom aid. The consequences of this decision are obvious and are noted with great understatement in the digest of the bill: `This change may prove to be an onerous task for small and remote schools and their communities.'
In my view, as a result of these proposals, the ASSPA committees will become all but defunct. It is telling that this funding bill will remove money from ASSPA and put it into other programs. The government can afford to do this because it knows that its new arrangements will prevent ASSPA committees from accessing funding—a cynical and, might I say, puerile approach to the needs of Indigenous education across this country. It shows absolute contempt for Indigenous students, their parents and their communities by this minister and this government.
Let me put this in context. These recommendations are the result of a report undertaken at the minister's direction by his department. I am not sure whether you are aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, but there are 3,800 ASSPA committees across Australia. I believe it is fair to say that, up to this point, most of these committees would have no idea what the government proposes to do with this program. On 16 June this year I asked the minister about the government's failure to consult these committees. His response is illuminating:
We received 10 submissions from ASSPA committees. There was consultation with a random selection of 400 ASSPA committees, directors-general of education, the Catholic and independent schools sector, ATSIC and ATSIS, Indigenous education consultative bodies, Indigenous support units in WA, Queensland and New South Wales, and a selection of vocational education and training providers. Three discussion papers and questionnaires informed the review.
In other words, he seemed to rely on everyone but the parents and teachers involved in this program. The government received submissions from 10 ASSPA committees before approving changes to this program—that is, one quarter of one per cent of committees gave feedback. As a result of the minister's response I went out and purposely consulted with ASSPA committees across the Northern Territory. I managed to get more feedback from ASSPA committees in that short space of time than the government did in preparing its three discussion papers. There are a number of things—and I will come to them in a moment—that the parents of these committees across the Northern Territory have said.
But I want to canvass the other issue at the heart of the concerns being expressed by parents. We have the whole question of the lack of consultation—the lack of any preparedness by this minister and the government to take ASSPA parents, their communities and their schools into their confidence and to work with them, through consultation and discussion, on what the government proposes to do with these ASSPA committees and how it might impact upon them. 
There is also the proposal to change the ATAS program—the tutorial assistance program—so that students will, as a result of the proposals in this bill, now primarily be able to get tutorial assistance after years 3, 5 and 7, because those are the years that they will be required to undertake testing. If they fail to reach a benchmark in year 4 and year 6, they will get supplementary tutorial assistance in years 5 and 7. If they do not get past the test in year 2, they will get assistance in year 3.
I know the shadow minister raised this matter this afternoon in the context of a visit she took with me to some communities in Arnhem Land last week. Together, we visited the small outstation school at Mapuru in north-eastern Arnhem Land, where an Indigenous teacher assistant, Jackie Guyula, and another teacher assistant in the school have up to 40 kids. These are largely students without any educational experience, with an age profile going from preschool to probably 18 or 19. I would suggest that none of the students would pass the most basic of literacy tests—or numeracy tests for that matter—yet under this hideous proposal being put forward by this government none of those students will be entitled to tutorial assistance unless or until they have failed the benchmarks in years 2, 5 and 7.
We know—and it is very clear when you talk to school communities, education professionals and parents—that what is required is, throughout education and throughout the whole life of the education experience of each student, the possibility of tutorial assistance when it is required. We know that when you talk to the people who are actually the practitioners—those people charged with the responsibility of providing education to Indigenous kids—whether they live in urban communities like Darwin, Alice Springs or Katherine or in some small remote community or even a larger remote community, they all say the same thing: what the government is proposing is a hideous proposition that will not work and will fail their students.
The minister will have received two letters. One is from the school at Amanbidji—a very small school in the Northern Territory. Amanbidji is in the Victoria River region. I seek leave to table the letter from the school principal, Reg Robinson, to the minister about the community's concerns about changes to the IEDA, ASSPA, ATAS and VEGAS programs.
Leave granted.
—Before I pass this document over, I will quote from one component of it:
The Amanbidji ASSPA council presently has been able to contribute through communication with the schoolteacher about what they regard as being in the best interests of their children and the involvement of the community. The present system has allowed consultation to be open and flexible on a daily basis when needed. This system has promoted the respect and values of the community's members. Where has the government shown this level of consultation and respect in their decision to axe ASSPA? The current ASSPA application forms are able to accommodate this small community approach. The school community does not agree to further bureaucratic changes.
It goes on:
If tutoring will only be allowed for those who fail to reach benchmarks in years 4 and 6, then continuity has stopped and Indigenous students will again be left to adult remedies. The result at Amanbidgee school in the last three years quite simply has been a school where most students could not read at all to now all students, except transitional or transient students, reading thanks to ATAS.
It is very clear what the implications of that correspondence are for the government's program. 
I go to another piece of correspondence, which was sent to the government on or about 30 July and was signed by a number of people: Cherie Holtze, Delsey Tamiano, Robbo Robinson, Margie Anstess, Tanya Lockwood, Di Rollo and Sharna Traut. These people represent 14 Darwin, Palmerston and rural ASSPA committees—people who were not consulted by this government before it made these hideous proposals. The very first point they make in their correspondence to the minister is:
The first and foremost concern was the Government's lack of consultation with those who are most affected by the changes—the key stakeholders in Indigenous education: Indigenous parents, students and the community.
On the matter of removing tutorial assistance they say:
The decision to remove tutorial assistance from the Transition to Year 2 Indigenous students is totally illogical especially when research from your own Commonwealth Task Force on Child Development, Health and Wellbeing (2003) strongly recommends the need for comprehensive and ongoing support in this area.
They go on to detail the recommendations of that report. They make another significant observation when they say:
Another significant factoris that a majority of Indigenous children do not come from literacy rich environments and are not likely to have been exposed to “story books and reading”. Indigenous Australians have a strong oral tradition which is often the more widely used method of “teaching” in the home environment. With the low levels of Indigenous children participating in Preschool, it seems more appropriate that support is focussed at the Transition to Year 2 level in order to give Indigenous students a solid foundation on which to build upon. Waiting until Year 3 when Indigenous students are unable to perform academically in the classroom forces them into the difficult and endless struggle to “catch up” ...
That is a very astute observation. They go on to talk about the way in which the government proposes to change ASSPA funding. They say that they believe that this:
... will result in a much reduced level of participation by Indigenous parents and therefore a reduced level of outcomes ...
for Indigenous students. That is another very astute and informed observation—not one which has been contemplated by this government, with their failure to consult widely and appropriately with Indigenous communities and Indigenous parents and indeed school communities.
It is instructive to note another couple of observations which they make. They say:
It is also with extreme disappointment that we respond to further comments made by you during the Government's Indigenous Education quadrennium funding announcement (5Apr04). You stated that:
`... we've funded a range of things over the last four years which we've had evaluated that have been found not to deliver the outcomes that they should, for example, the Aboriginal Student Support and Parent Awareness Committees. There are 3,800 of these committees throughout Australia ...'
It goes on. These parents then make this observation:
These comments devalue and directly criticise the good work of thousands of Indigenous parents in schools. They are also inaccurate and misleading. The current, poor level of educational outcomes or achievement in Indigenous education cannot be—
Minister—
attributed to A.S.S.P.A. The underlying issues in Indigenous education stem from the long term failure of governments to properly consult Indigenous people when developing policy and practice that is supposed to be responsive to the needs of Indigenous students, parents and the community. The current disadvantage faced by Indigenous students is a direct result of successive, failed government policy, not A.S.S.P.A. 
Then they go on to talk about the other changes. They say:
The proposed changes look to be just another attempt by a government to assimilate Indigenous people into the mainstream education system when, in fact, the system should be reformed to be more responsive to the needs of Indigenous people. The decision to reallocate/redirect funding from the least disadvantaged to the most disadvantaged is just a bandaid approach. It is simply redefining Indigenous people's needs according to their `levels of disadvantage' relative to each other (urban vs remote) rather than relative to the rest of the community (Indigenous vs non-Indigenous). Again, what is really needed is an increase in funds commensurate to the needs of Indigenous students irrespective of where they live.
There can be no more important issue confronting Indigenous communities across Australia than education. I have commented in the past in this place about the great needs there are for increased expenditure in Indigenous education. I have made the point time and time again. There are somewhere between 3,000 and 5,000 young Indigenous people in the Northern Territory alone who have no access whatsoever to any educational institution, yet we have a government, not happy with the current structure, that puts in place an administrative review—designed no doubt to give it the outcome that it wants—that consults with 0.25 per cent of ASSPA committees across Australia and then comes back and has the gall to recommend to government that they should basically change the whole way in which ASSPA and the tutorial assistance scheme work.
The people who will be most disadvantaged by this are those people most in need in Australia—the poorest Australians; the most disadvantaged Australians; those most in need of educational assistance. They have demonstrated through the very coherent response they have made to these proposals that they understand what the game is. They understand that they need to work with their students throughout their school lives, not just in selected years if they fall through the cracks, as the government is proposing. What they also understand is that it should be based on need, and not where you live. Whether it is urban or remote, it should be based on need. What it underlines is the drastic lack of awareness by this government and indeed this minister of what their obligations truly are in terms of consulting and working with Indigenous families across Australia.",REPS,<title>INDIGENOUS EDUCATION (TARGETED ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Hunt, Gregory, MP",LP,2004-08-09,"—In addressing the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2004, I do so coming from an electorate which is known by most as being outer metropolitan and semi-rural. But the electorate of Flinders contains over 500 people who identify themselves as being of Indigenous origin. In that context, in the schools I have visited—West Park Primary, Hastings Primary, Crib Point Primary, Eastbourne and Tootgarook Primary—there are a number of beautiful Indigenous children whom I have had the privilege to meet and to work with. I have seen the challenges they face and the progress that they are making. One of the great challenges that these children face is that they risk falling between two options: they risk falling between being engaged and involved in the society around them and having identification with their own culture. That is one of the challenges for Indigenous education in an outer metropolitan environment.
Against that background, I want to make three brief points this evening. The first is that there has been significant progress in Indigenous education in Australia over the last 2½ decades. I say 2½ decades because I go back in particular to much of the work that occurred under Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser. That continued through the next government and has continued on in this government. There has been significant progress. But the second point is that there is real distance to travel. There is still significant disadvantage in the Indigenous community, as all Australians know. There is still significant hardship for students from Indigenous backgrounds seeking to learn. There are great success stories. There are tremendous outcomes. There are great steps forward. But there are still significant disadvantages and challenges. 
In that context, this bill seeks to make significant and important reforms. First, it continues the current funding over the 2005-08 quadrennium—or four-year period—for the Indigenous Education Strategic Initiatives Program. Second, it brings the Indigenous Education Direct Assistance Program under the act. Third, it maintains funding for ongoing elements under the Indigenous Education Strategic Initiatives Program and provides additional funding—which is a very important thing—to support new strategic projects and interventions. Finally, what it does is strengthen provisions relating to educational and financial accountability. But importantly there is additional funding.
That leads me to the third point that I want to make this evening—and it is a simple point. Within my electorate of Flinders, one of the challenges is to ensure that we manage to provide for children of Indigenous background sufficient focus on, identification with and the capacity to appreciate their own culture. In that context—and in the presence of the federal Minister for Education, Science and Training in this House tonight—I want to propose and endorse a very simple program.
The Bunnerong Elders Land Council have come to me with a proposal for an Indigenous education schools program to be part of the Indigenous education centre at Point Nepean. It is a simple, small program targeted at fewer than 100 students a year, and there are three parts to it. The plan is that children of Indigenous backgrounds and a small number of other children from non-Indigenous backgrounds would attend the Indigenous studies centre at Point Nepean for a schools based program. That program would teach them about Indigenous culture and history and also give them an understanding of the land on the Mornington Peninsula and the way in which it can be best managed.
I commend the plan and the proposed program and I note that there are important partners in this program. The partners who have already put themselves forward include the Point Nepean Community Trust, the Australian Maritime College and Monash University—all to help in the primary and secondary education of Indigenous students on the Mornington Peninsula. I believe that is a tremendous step forward. It is a small, modest program, and it is one that I will be championing. I am delighted to be able to work with the Bunnerong Elders Land Council from my electorate of Flinders and to be able to put forward that program.
Against that background, I want to endorse the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2004. I particularly commend the program for the Indigenous education schools program at Point Nepean—I will be a champion for it—and I commend those members of the Bunnerong Elders Land Council who have had the foresight and the wisdom to develop such a program and who show such care for their own culture and particularly for the development and maintenance of that culture amongst the primary and secondary school students of Indigenous background on the Mornington Peninsula.",REPS,<title>INDIGENOUS EDUCATION (TARGETED ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Nelson, Dr Brendan, MP",LP,2004-08-09,"—in reply—Firstly, I thank all of the members who contributed to the debate and the consideration of the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2004. The bill amends the Indigenous education funding programs to maintain and enhance the Australian government's effort in improving education outcomes for Indigenous Australians over the 2005-08 funding quadrennium. 
As we have heard during the course of the debate, it provides funding for the Indigenous Education Strategic Initiatives Program, which is otherwise known as IESIP, and the Indigenous Education Direct Assistance Program, otherwise known as IEDA, for the next funding quadrennium. IESIP provides supplementary recurrent funding as well as funding for significant national initiatives and special projects, and IEDA provides funding for the Indigenous Tutorial Assistance Scheme and funding to support a whole of school intervention strategy. The bill also provides for a continuation of the away from base element of Abstudy for the 2005-08 funding quadrennium. This is all part of a $2.1 billion package of measures aimed at improving Indigenous education outcomes over the next four years. It represents a 20.5 per cent increase on funding from the current quadrennium.
The whole reason for the amendment bill is that there is a change of direction in this next quadrennium that we are proposing. In one sense it is relatively modest. In fact, I seriously entertained far more radical changes. One would hesitate to think what some of the members opposite would be saying were we to have proposed those changes. Nonetheless, as the bill says, it is about targeted assistance. The first thing that ought to be said to the average, everyday Australian who may be listening to this debate is that this $2.1 billion for Australia's Indigenous students is in addition to everything that is spent on every Australian child. These particular programs and initiatives from the Australian government are in addition to everything that is currently provided to any Australian child in education, irrespective of their circumstances.
As a person with more than a passing interest in Indigenous affairs—and having the privilege to be Australia's Minister for Education, Science and Training—it seems to me that the challenges that life presents to every Indigenous Australian, no matter where they live or wherever they are born, are far more difficult than the challenges faced by non-Indigenous Australians. It does not matter whether you live in a built-up urban environment, a regional city or remote parts of the country: if you are born as an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander Australian, the challenges for you in life are, in my view, more difficult. That is why the government are providing additional money above and beyond what we would normally provide for the education of any Australian.
Another conclusion I have reached is that the circumstances of remote Indigenous Australians are quite different from the circumstances experienced by those who live in regional centres or on the fringes of those regions and are quite different again from the circumstances of those Indigenous people who live in suburban settings. As members familiar with this would know, many Indigenous Australians migrate from one setting to another. But at least if you are an Indigenous Australian living in a large city, you generally live in a setting where there is a sealed road, you generally have access to reasonable housing and you can turn on a tap from which clean water—which you can be confident of its safety for drinking—will come. There is generally a hospital nearby and there is generally a school pretty much down the road. Less of that is available to Indigenous people who live in regional centres and even less of that is available for those who live in remote parts of the country. 
If we consider Aboriginal education as a fire that needs resources, it occurred to me as we embarked on these reforms that we needed to be targeting the resources where they are most needed. The educational challenges faced by Aboriginal children growing up in east Arnhem Land, in remote parts of the Northern Territory, in the Pilbara, in the Kimberley or in the Cape are, in my opinion, more pressing than those faced by Indigenous people living in suburban settings. For that reason, this quadrennium of funding intends to start shifting the resourcing to where, in my opinion, it is most needed.
The third conclusion I reached was that under this current quadrennium we have funded a lot of initiatives. We have also been doing some research on the outcomes that are being delivered from the Aboriginal-specific education programs that we fund. That we as people of goodwill and commitment feel emotionally attached to a number of things that the government have been funding does not, of itself, mean that they have delivered good outcomes for Indigenous students. For this next quadrennium, we are unashamedly proposing to target resources into programs that we know actually work—so much so that we have an initiative in my portfolio that is described as `what works'.
The fourth priority is to leverage mainstream funding. For the very first time we are going to set specific objectives for state and territory governments in terms of delivering outcomes and acquitting resources that they should be committing to Indigenous-specific education. This legislation will require specific targets to be set by state and territory governments—which, of course, have the primary responsibility for delivering school education to Australian citizens, including Indigenous Australians. We make no apology for the fact that we want to see what school attendance is. We want to know very clearly, for the very first time, what the educational outcomes are for Indigenous students in remote parts of the country, as distinct from in regional and urban settings. In the two days of briefings that I had when I was first appointed to this portfolio, I remember asking the then head of the Indigenous education area in my department, who had presented some year 12 retention data, `What is the breakdown for remote versus urban?' He said, `I can't tell you.' I said, `Why is that?' and he said, `We don't collect the data.' This legislation will require state, territory and non-government education providers to provide us with information so that, if we further target resources in the future, we can do so on the basis of knowing exactly how we are going.
Whilst we have made improvements—and in this regard I agree with all members of the House, including those opposite—obviously we have a long way to go. Year 12 retention is now 39 per cent, up from 29 per cent. Results from five of the six key national benchmark tests were the best ever in 2001, but they were still significantly below those of non-Indigenous Australians. The year 12 retention rate is still only half what it is for non-Indigenous Australians. Only one in 10 students in remote parts of the country complete year 12, and I have to say to the House that I cannot say with confidence that the year 12 standard they actually meet is that of students in suburban settings. Only one in eight year 3 students in the Northern Territory can pass a basic year 3 reading test, and many of those children are in fact the children of the teachers who are teaching these communities.
—The principles of the reforms are as I have just set out. If you want to set any Australian up for failure, then do not teach them how to speak English. Do not test them against the reading benchmarks and the numeracy benchmarks that apply to other students throughout Australia. 
There are a couple of things that I particularly think need to be addressed. One is the review of the Aboriginal Student Support and Parental Awareness committees. A lot has been said about this throughout the course of the debate. It needs to be understood that 3,811 of these committees were funded last year, benefiting about 86,000 Indigenous students in schools and preschools that had ASSPA committees. They were funded to the tune of $16.1 million in the last financial year. The amount of money allocated to those committees ranged from $215 to almost $140,000. In fact, when you look at the figures, 660 committees were funded for less than $500. There were 608 committees that were funded between $500 and $1,000. More than half the committees that were funded were receiving less than $2,000, many of them in built-up suburban settings. The argument that the government puts is that that money ought to unashamedly be redirected to remote Aboriginal children and their families and to regional centres.
 (Mr Jenkins)—Order! The honourable member for Lingiari will desist.
—I would point out to the member for Lingiari that it his very constituents that I am most concerned about. I am trying to get money out of the northern beaches of Sydney and get it to families in remote parts of the Northern Territory.
—No, out of the northern suburbs of Darwin.
—Order! The honourable member for Lingiari will cease interjecting.
—It also ought to be pointed out that one-third of the ASSPA committee funding is currently for parental involvement, 16 per cent is for access to education, 14 per cent is for student participation, 19 per cent is for educational outcomes—less than 20 per cent of the money is committed specifically for educational outcomes—and 15 per cent is for excursions. I have had the parents of non-Indigenous children asking, `Why is it that the Aboriginal kids at the school who live in the same public housing block that we live in are being funded to go to an excursion when my kids aren't?' The argument that we are putting is that we will now move to program based funding. We want the committees to develop educational programs that involve parents, students and the broader community and to apply to the government for that funding. Instead of having principals designing what the ASSPA committees will do and then having a representative of the committee sign off on that and run a barbecue in a suburban setting, we would like to see the funding committed to developing better educational outcomes for Indigenous students.
The other thing that needs to be particularly understood is that of course there was a review of the ASSPA committees done by my department. It was suggested by members opposite that there was not proper consultation. The final discussion paper was sent to 400 ASSPA committees, to all directors-general of education, to Indigenous education consultative bodies and to Indigenous support units. Sixty-two written responses were received. We sent the review to 400 ASSPA committees, and do you know how many replied? Ten. So active and so focused were the ASSPA committees that when invited to contribute to the future of the funding of those committees— 
 (Mr Jenkins)—Order! If the honourable member for Lingiari wants to see the finalisation of this debate, he should sit there quietly.
—only 10, 2½ per cent, replied. That is hardly a reflection of active, focused committees concerned for the educational welfare of Indigenous students. I wrote to all of the ASSPA committees on 5 April to inform them of the changes to the way the government proposed to support them through this quadrennium. I probably stand to be corrected, but I cannot remember a single committee replying.
The target of all of this is that we are determined to make sure that we put hard-earned taxpayers' dollars—which they strongly support being used to improve the educational outcomes of Indigenous students—into areas where they are most needed, particularly for Indigenous students in remote parts of the country. I say to the member for Lingiari: Aboriginal children in Darwin do have significant needs, but I can tell you that they are nothing like the needs of kids up in Arnhem Land and in remote parts of the Territory. Secondly, we want to focus resources on things that actually work, that are evidence based. Thirdly, we want to make absolutely sure that we have real targets set for state and territory governments against which they must deliver and which will be actively monitored, not only by them but—more importantly—by us.
—The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Capricornia has moved as an amendment that all words after `That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words.

"Jenkins, Harry, MP",ALP,2004-08-09,"—On 4 June, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs announced the new arrangements for the Child Care Support program. Included in that announcement was a new program, the Inclusion Support Program, ISP. This was established to replace SUPS, under which children's services resource and development officers were funded. I have had approaches from municipalities and parents of children with special needs about the unintended consequences that it is believed will result from these changes. The ISP will be set up on a regional basis. Previously, SUPS officers and CSRDOs were employed by municipalities, especially in Victoria. One of the concerns is that the local input will be lost because of this new arrangement. If we look at the region that my electorate would come under—which is the northern region—it includes seven municipalities. Those municipalities employ 12 of these officers, and other non-government agencies operating in this region also employ these officers.
In looking at the way in which this model has been put in place at a regional level, people are asking what it will mean to the relationship that these officers will have with the families involved. The CSRDOs have strong local links and they have established good relationships with the families and children involved. If you take the city of Whittlesea, there are 43 child-care services and about 80 children with additional needs that are catered for by the CSRDOs. The real concern is that this local input will be lost. I am told by the municipality that they add in the order of 40 per cent of the funding of these positions and are very concerned about whether, if this went out to tender on a regional basis, they would see the same sort of input by tenderers. Constituents who have contacted me have indicated that without the actions of the CSRDOs they believe that their children would not have progressed as well as they have. One parent has come into the city of Whittlesea from the city of Hobsons Bay. In Hobsons Bay the CSRDO facilitated a six-week program that led to a parent-run support group. She notes that in Whittlesea the CSRDOs are doing a lot more than simply matching people with services; they support the parents in a whole host of ways.
If we look at the type of child-care services and other children's services that the CSRDOs are helping families with, we can see that this is a complex situation. As one constituent has asked, `If the government is really interested in trying to build community and in funding opportunities for community building practices, why don't they set a good example in this particular program?' I am not sure whether this is a problem only in the state of Victoria, because local government has traditionally had a close relationship with these officers. The City of Whittlesea has been involved for up to 15 years. But this gets back to something that I have always said: if we are going to have a national approach to policies, we must not only recognise the national nature of the outcomes that we are wishing to achieve, we must also recognise that these things can be best put in practice by local initiatives. In this case, I believe that it is a retrograde step to say to the people who have been providing services that we are going to change the way in which this is done by moving it to a regional level.
I hope that the minister will reconsider these aspects of his program. I know that he had a great battle with cabinet to get a meagre amount of additional funding, and that is another concern. If these amounts of money are to add up, are we going to see that the same sort of money is going to go under the SUPS program that is available for CSRDOs, or is doing this at a regional level in fact a cost-saving measure? I believe that there needs to be reconsideration. The Howard government has to look at policies that can be delivered at a local level, that can be done in the most efficient way possible, and that give the feeling to the families that are being assisted by these programs that they really are cared for and that they are not each just some meaningless number in an overall program. That has been the characteristic of the previous CSRDO program. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Family Services: Child Care</title>,Adjournment,16,1,speech
