"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2006-05-10,"—I am continuing the remarks I commenced yesterday evening. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation Amendment Bill 2006 is intended to give effect to the abolition of the staff-elected director position as close as possible to the expiry of the term of the current staff-elected director. The abolition of the staff-elected director position has nothing to do with any particular individual—and I want to make that very clear. The fact that the restructure is taking place at the end of the current incumbent’s term and before the commencement of the next elected director’s term is a clear indication that this is not about individuals.
Senators from the other side have stated during this debate that the abolition of the staff-elected director will be likely to impact on the independence of the ABC. This assertion is incorrect. The removal of the staff-elected director will in no way impact on the independence of the ABC. In fact, the independence of the ABC is enshrined in legislation. Section 78(6) of the ABC Act states:
... the Corporation is not subject to direction by or on behalf of the Government of the Commonwealth.
Further, paragraph 8(1)(b) of the ABC Act makes it a duty of the board:
... to maintain the independence and integrity of the Corporation ...
Accordingly, it is the duty of all board members to maintain the ABC’s independence and integrity irrespective of the existence of a staff-elected director position. As I have stated previously, SBS does not have a staff-elected director and I am not aware of any substantial concerns that the SBS board has failed to maintain the independence and integrity of SBS as required by the corresponding provision in paragraph 10(1)(a) of the SBS Act.
One of the arguments raised by opposition senators in favour of retaining the staff-elected director is that previous staff-elected directors have been influential in preventing decisions that would have been damaging to the ABC, such as the sharing of ABC content with Telstra. While it may well be that these individuals played a role in those decisions, I note that the ultimate decisions were decisions of the whole board and that, without detailed knowledge of the workings of the ABC board, it is very difficult to accurately apportion credit for any particular decisions.
Senators on the other side have raised the issue of the consideration of staff issues by the ABC board. The ABC chairman has indicated publicly that the ABC board and management will continue to take staff interests into account, as they do now. Further, the managing director, who is appointed not by the government but by the board, is a full member of the ABC board and a conduit between staff, management and the board. The heads of the ABC divisions also report regularly to the board. Obviously, other than having a staff-elected director, there are ways by which the board can consult with ABC staff about issues that concern them.
During the debate, much has been made of the previous experience of directors on the ABC board. I would like to draw the attention of the Senate to the criteria set out in section 12(5) of the ABC Act regarding the process by which the government appoints ABC directors. One of the criteria is:
... experience in connection with the provision of broadcasting services or in communications or management ...
Several of the current board members have experience in connection with broadcasting. For example, the deputy chair, Mr John Gallagher, was a director of a regional television broadcaster, Mackay Television, for 16 years, from 1971 until 1987. Mr Steven Skala was a director of the Channel 10 group from 1993 to 1998. That being said, there are a number of ways the board can have regard to practical broadcasting experience in making decisions irrespective of the board membership. To say that the ABC board is deficient in broadcasting experience is a tenuous argument at best.
The government seeks to meet the criteria set out in the ABC Act and to ensure that the members of the ABC board have a mix of skills appropriate to the running of a modern corporation. There are suggestions in the submissions to the Senate committee—and this is now the subject, as I understand it, of an amendment moved by the Australian Democrats—that the ABC’s board appointments process be changed to one resembling the method used for appointing governors of the BBC, involving what in substance are called the ‘Nolan rules’. Despite the assertions from the other side, some recent appointments to the BBC have, sadly, not avoided controversy and allegations of political appointments.
The government is committed to an independent, successful ABC that delivers high-quality programming to Australian audiences. This commitment was emphatically illustrated with the government’s announcement last night of an increase to ABC funding of $88.2 million for new initiatives over the next three years. This will bring the ABC’s total government funding for the 2006-09 triennium to more than $2.5 billion.
Specifically, the ABC will receive $45.1 million to purchase new equipment, which of course recognises the march to digital. In addition, $30 million will be spent over three years to boost Australian television content through the establishment of an independent commissioning arm. Also, the very successful regional and local programming initiative, which assists with regional program production on ABC television and radio, will be provided with an additional $13.2 million over the next three years, which brings a total increase in funding for the initiative of $68.7 million over the triennium. That recognises the costs of simply being the ABC.
The increased funding announced is a clear demonstration of the government’s ongoing commitment to the ABC. The removal of the staff-elected director, which was in many respects an anomalous position, in no way compromises this government’s commitment to the organisation. The government has taken a decision to abolish the position of ABC staff-elected director for the sound reasons that I have outlined. I commend the bill to the Senate.
Question agreed to.
Bill read a second time.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2006-05-10,"—The purpose of the National Health and Medical Research Council Amendment Bill 2006 is to amend the National Health and Medical Research Council Act 1992 to introduce new governance arrangements and to clarify accountability and reporting functions for the NHMRC. These new arrangements will establish the NHMRC as a statutory agency. The CEO will be responsible for the primary functions of the agency and will report to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Previously, the council was responsible for both governance matters and expert scientific advice. The new division of responsibility will allow the council to focus on expert scientific advice while the CEO will have day-to-day responsibility for the operation of the agency.
The proposed changes also streamline the reporting lines of the CEO and the council. The NHMRC previously had three concurrent lines of reporting: the Minister for Health and Ageing, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Ageing and the council itself. This bill provides for the CEO to report directly to the minister while keeping the secretary informed.
Labor will support this bill, but we do have some concerns about it and about the willingness of the Howard government to invest in the incredibly important research efforts that are funded by the NHMRC. Our concerns go initially to the membership of the council. Firstly, we oppose the removal of the requirement that membership of the council must include—and this is what occurred previously—an eminent scientist who has knowledge of public health research and medical research issues. Secondly, we oppose the removal of the requirement that membership should include a person with expertise in the trade union movement, a person with expertise in the needs of users of social welfare services and a person with expertise in environmental issues. Given the advice that this expertise is currently found in members who also have expertise in other areas, we recommend that the requirement for expertise remain and that it be made clear in the legislation that multiple categories of expertise may be found in individuals on the council.
Going to those people who were previously required to be represented on the council, we recognise that an eminent scientist with expertise in or knowledge of public health research and medical research issues would most probably appear on the council in its new structure. But a person with expertise in the trade union movement is not necessarily going to be included in the new structure of the council. That reflects the view of this government that people who represent workers in Australia are not terribly important. That is the way this government thinks, and it is reflected in the bill.
We also express concern that the question of equity may not be addressed if someone with expertise in the needs of users of social welfare services is not included. Our concern about the lack of need for a person with expertise in environmental issues, once again, underscores this government’s respect for the environment. Whilst we support the inclusion of someone on the council who has expertise in ethics, particularly in medical research, no argument during the committee hearing was advanced in support of the necessity for this new category of persons with specific expertise in ethics relating to research involving humans. Clarification is required as to whether the chair of the Australian Health Ethics Committee is a member of the new council as is the case at present.
Our concern also goes to the appointment of the AHEC chair. We oppose the removal of the need for the federal minister to consult with the state and territory health ministers before appointing the chair of AHEC in favour of the requirement of consulting appropriately. During the committee hearing, there was some discussion about what ‘appropriately’ means, and I am afraid Labor senators felt uncomfortable that that was not properly clarified. The bill does not contain a definition of what that might mean nor any certainty that it is being done. In our view, this undermines the principle that the NHMRC should be at arm’s length from government and be a body that has broad acceptability and response to national interests rather than those of any particular health minister at the time. Appointments such as this should be made on merit, and there should be a formal process in place to ensure that this is the case.
Our third point of concern is the issue of disclosure of interests. We note that the minister is not required to be advised if a member of the council has disclosed an interest. We consider it the responsibility of the minister to know if a member or members disclose an interest and regard this as an accountability measure not an administrative task as noted in the schedule prepared by the department for this bill. Fourthly, we note the advice of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee concerning the altering reporting arrangements and agree with their recommendation that the bill should be amended to enable expert advice to be provided directly to the minister.
Finally, we acknowledge the inappropriateness of defining particular research priorities for the NHMRC but indicate that we would be concerned if the proposed restructure had a result of diminishing the NHMRC’s capacity to strategically respond to the serious problems of Indigenous health, while we recognise that significant progress has been made in recent times through the involvement of members with Indigenous expertise working across the current committee structure.
The amendments enacted in this bill address the governance issues that have been identified in four major reviews over the last few years. It is interesting to note that all of the reports have been around for some time, so clearly the minister has been in no hurry to make these changes, which are claimed in the second reading speech to:
... strengthen the NHMRC’s independence, promote clear lines of responsibility for governance and financial accountability and allow the Council to focus on issues relating to medical and biological research and advice.
Both the second reading speech and the minister’s media release from September last year highlight the need for the NHMRC to build better links with business to improve investment in research and to explore industry joint ventures. While Labor is truly supportive of the need for more industry support for R&D and more collaboration, any attempt to replace federal research funds with private funds should be strongly resisted.
At the same time that this bill was introduced, the government also introduced the Australian Research Council Amendment Bill 2006 that takes a very heavy handed approach to the ARC abolishing the board and the ARC’s ability to conduct inquiries into national research issues and make decisions about the effective use of research funds. There is concern that this will lead to even more examples than those already known of instances where the Minister for Education, Science and Training has objected to funding for specific projects. Labor is strongly supportive of the ARC’s independence and would be deeply concerned about any similar attempt with respect to the NHMRC.
The NHMRC is Australia’s primary funder of biomedical R&D in Australia. In 2005-06, $447 million for health and medical research was provided through the NHMRC. A recent Access Economics report clearly found that this is one of best investments our nation can make to the wellbeing of our people. The report said:
... returns from health R&D are so extraordinarily high that the payoff from any strategic portfolio of investments is enormous.
                  …         …         …
Health R&D must be seen as an investment in wellness with exceptional returns.
The report also said:
Historically, annual rates of return to Australian health R&D were up to $5 for every $1 spent on R&D.
This can be as high as $8 for cardiovascular R&D and $6 for respiratory R&D. The Access Economics report found that, despite the additional funding flowing as a consequence of the Wills review, continued boosts to investment in health R&D relative to GDP are still warranted given Australia’s poor ranking relative to other OECD countries.
As Australia ages the dependency ratio increases and heath spending naturally will rise. Breakthroughs in R&D are seen as the best way to address the challenge inherent in the cost and impact of chronic disease. Funding in response to the Health and Medical Research Strategic Review, the Wills review, led to the doubling of the NHMRC funding, which was $613.7 million over five years. That five-year period is now complete. I acknowledge that significant funding was allocated in last night’s budget that will pick up the end of that period.
The investment review of health and medical research released by the government in December 2004, the Grant review, recommended that the government continue to invest and build on the Wills funding by increasing federal government investment in health and medical research to $1.8 billion by 2008-09, bringing Australia up to the OECD average level of investment of 0.2 per cent of GDP. I have not had a chance to look at what last night’s funding allocation does in respect of that recommendation. Maybe the minister would like to inform the chamber of whether or not that target has been met. A key finding of the Grant report was that government investment through the Wills funding package had already started to deliver results and that further increases in funding for health and medical research will yield similarly considerable health benefits and economic dividends.
Australian researchers are finding life increasingly difficult. A December 2005 paper in the Medical Journal of Australia highlighted the extent of researcher dissatisfaction with funding and the inadequacy of infrastructure support. It is not surprising that so many of our best scientists are attracted overseas and, unfortunately, stay there. It is truly hoped that last night’s allocation of funds will reduce, if not reverse, the brain drain that is occurring in Australia.
I would like to take the opportunity to recognise that the states have developed their own innovation initiatives and are reaping considerable rewards. Initiatives like my state of Queensland’s Smart State, BioMelbourne, Bio Innovation South Australia and BioFirst New South Wales reflect the recognised importance and economic realities of catching the biotech wave.
While Labor support the proposals in this bill to strengthen the independence of the NHMRC, to clarify reporting lines and to improve appointment processes, we can only wonder why such amendments, seen as good governance and most of them recommended two or more years ago, have taken so long to come forward. It is clear that, despite the wealth of reports around the value of the work of the NHMRC and the ongoing need to support Australia’s health and medical research, this is an issue that up until the passage of this legislation has slipped off the Howard government’s radar screen. Perhaps, given the government’s move to grab control of the Australian Research Council and exercise political control over the peer review processes, we should be grateful for this. But the failure to investment in our research capabilities is yet another example of the Howard government’s squandering of our national resources and failure to build our skills base.
The Australian community supports health and medical research efforts. Research Australia’s annual health and medical research public opinion polls in 2003 and 2004 showed that most Australians wanted to see increased government and industry investment and are prepared to contribute to that investment themselves. In fact, 47 per cent of Australians said that they would rather see surplus government funds invested in health and medical research rather than in tax cuts.
Securing a long-term, enduring, sustainable economic future for Australia does require a long-term view for building on the valuable investment to date. This will be achieved only by a continued focus and leadership by government in partnership with researchers, industry and the community. Government commitment to the recommendations of the Grant report would be a good first step towards showing this leadership. If the additional needed investments in biomedical research come only as a consequence of the sale of Medibank Private, that is simply not good enough, and it demonstrates only too clearly the cynicism of the Howard government, its lack of commitment to biomedical research and its failure to make real investments in Australia’s future.
In May 2004, the Prime Minister announced that the Australian government would establish quality and accessibility frameworks for publicly funded research. The stated aim of this initiative was to develop the basis for improved assessment of the quality and impact of publicly funded research. This report was released by the Minister for Education, Science and Training in March this year, and an advisory group is now working on implementation measures.
While Labor absolutely supports measures to ensure public accountability for how research funds are spent, the crucial question is whether the research quality framework is the most appropriate and cost-effective mechanism to achieve this. If we look at the success of similar schemes overseas, it is not an encouraging story. The UK Research Assessment Exercise was introduced in 1986, but the UK is now set to abandon this process and move to a metrics based system, just like the one Australia is set to jettison through the RQF. The UK RAE is expensive. In 1996 it was estimated to cost between £27 million and £37 million and is widely believed to have downgraded teaching, compromised clinical academic medicine and led to a significant decline in clinical academic staffing levels. It sidetracks researchers and scientists from the core business of research with a dead weight of micromanagement at all levels. A similar system introduced into New Zealand in 2003 has led to reports that many universities have spent more on the exercise than they will gain in funding increases. Australian universities say they need $40 million to begin the implementation of the RQF.
Maybe in his second reading speech the minister will be able to tell us what the state of that is. As I said at the outset, the Labor Party will support the passage of this legislation. We hope that the government recognises the concerns that we have expressed both in this contribution today and also in the additional comments to the report of the inquiry that has been tabled. I take this opportunity to thank those witnesses who appeared at the inquiry and also those people who made submissions to the inquiry process.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL HEALTH AND MEDICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2006-05-10,"—Whilst the Democrats broadly support the restructure of the NHMRC provided for in the National Health and Medical Research Council Amendment Bill, we are concerned about the lack of time that was available for receiving submissions. We are concerned about the lack of advice that was available from the outgoing council on the bill and what we expect to be diminished accountability that might result from these changes.
The central purpose of the bill is said to be to introduce new arrangements to clarify accountability and reporting functions for the NHMRC, giving the NHMRC financial and operational autonomy while maintaining its independent statutory responsibility for expert health and medical research advice to the government. These changes follow reviews of the NHMRC over the last three years. However, in some respects, the Democrats argue that these changes will have the opposite effect, or at least could have the opposite effect. The NHMRC CEO currently reports to the minister, to the secretary of the Department of Health and Ageing and to the National Health and Medical Research Council itself. This was of concern to the Vice-Chancellors Committee, which, although supportive of streamlining of reporting, said there was potential for the expert advice provided by the council to the CEO to be ignored or not considered when making recommendations to the minister, particularly concerning funding decisions. The minister, of course, appoints the CEO and should he appoint a CEO who shares the minister’s own conservative views on some issues such as sexual and reproductive health and embryonic stem cell research, for instance, this may well result in a barrier being established to advancing what might be described as more universal and more scientific views of the world and views more representative of the general population. I will be moving amendments to allow for that expert advice from the council to be provided directly to the minister.
In streamlining and reducing the size of the NHMRC, the bill removes the requirement that membership of the council must include an eminent scientist who has knowledge of public health research and medical research issues, a person with expertise in the trade union movement, a person with expertise in the needs of users of social welfare services and a person with expertise in environmental issues. Given the advice that we received during the inquiry into this bill that this expertise is currently found in members who also have expertise in other areas, we cannot see any argument for dropping those requirements. We recommend that those areas of expertise remain and that the legislation be made clear that multiple categories of expertise may be found in individuals on the council. Again, we see no sound argument for removing those expertise requirements, and I will be moving amendments to the bill to require them to be part of the mix.
Whilst we support the specific inclusion of expertise in ethics, particularly in medical research, no argument was advanced by the department in support of the necessity for the new category of persons with specific expertise in ethics relating to research involving humans. The chair of the Australian ethics committee will also be a member of the new council, which is the case at the present time. This means that there could be two members appointed to the NHMRC for their expertise in ethics. With a council which is much reduced in size, that would not appear to be warranted and might suggest that the balance is not appropriate.
We oppose the removal of the need for the federal health minister to consult with state and territory health ministers before appointing the chair of AHEC in favour of the requirement of consulting appropriately. The bill does not contain any definition of what ‘appropriately’ might mean, nor was the department able to provide that to the committee during the hearing. There is no certainty that appropriate consultation has taken effect, if we do not know who might be consulted in such an appropriate consultation and we are not going to know whether any views at all have been taken on board. That undermines the principle that the NHMRC should be at arm’s length from government and a body that has broad acceptability and responds to the national interest, rather than those of the particular federal health minister in question. The Democrats again argue that appointments such as this should be made on merit and that there should be a formal process in place to ensure that this is the case, and I will be moving standard amendments to that effect. Today will be the 32nd time that we have put up our appointments on merit amendments.
The minister is not required to be advised if a member of the council has disclosed an interest. We again consider it the responsibility of the minister to know if a member or members disclose an interest, and we regard that as an accountability measure, not an administrative task, which is said to be the case in the schedule that was prepared by the department for the bill. We agree that it is inappropriate to define particular research priorities for the NHMRC but, like Labor, we would be concerned if the proposed restructure had the effect of diminishing the NHMRC’s capacity to strategically respond to the serious problems of Indigenous health—an area in which significant progress has been made in recent times through the involvement of members with Indigenous expertise who, as I understand it, are working across the current committee structure.
In submissions to the committee, it was also said that there was an expectation or a hope that there would be an increase in research in the medical field for the NHMRC. We note that in the budget last night a substantial increase in research spending was announced. This is very welcome and we do hope that some of that research funding, without suggesting a particular direction, will find its way to research into this important field.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL HEALTH AND MEDICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2006-05-10,"—I am very pleased to rise and support this National Health and Medical Research Council Amendment Bill 2006, particularly to support the context in which the bill has been presented and is being advanced today through the Senate. That context, as previous speakers have indicated, is that there is to be a very substantial increase for medical and health research investment in Australia, as announced in the budget which was delivered last night by Treasurer Peter Costello. I note that Senator Allison welcomed this particular announcement last night and I thank her for that. I note that Senator McLucas also welcomed it, but went on to comment that the Australian government had failed to make a real investment in Australian research. I find that comment very difficult to understand in light of the evident commitment made last night by the government to this area.
As senators will undoubtedly be aware, there was a package of $905 million announced last night for Australian health and medical research, one of the most significant boosts in this area that I can recall, perhaps the largest. That is made up of a number of important components, most particularly a boost of $500 million to the National Health and Medical Research Council to continue its important work. That is on top of $200 million in the budget before last, so there has been a boost of $700 million for the NHMRC in the last three years alone, above and beyond its ongoing funding. On top of that we have $170 million for new research fellowships, which is long-term funding for between 50 and 65 Australians to undertake five-year research fellowships in important areas of national priority.
Senators will also recall the announcement just a couple of weeks ago by the Minister for Health and Ageing, Tony Abbott, of a new national adult stem cell research centre in Queensland, which I am sure you will welcome, Madam Acting Deputy President Moore. In this budget there is $22 million provided for research in that area. The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research receives an additional $50 million to contribute to its work, and there are particular grants made to a range of medical research facilities, designed to improve their capacity to deliver quality research projects in their particular states and territories. There is, for example, $10 million for the Macfarlane Burnet Institute for Medical Research and Public Health, $10 million for the Heart Research Institute, $15 million for the Westmead Millennium Institute, $14 million for the Garvan Institute and the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute and $37 million for the Howard Florey Institute. On top of that, I am delighted to see $50 million contributed by the federal government to the John Curtin School of Medical Research here in the national capital, which will greatly assist it to be able to deliver on its major expansion currently under way. I encourage senators to go and see that development if they have a chance during Senate sittings.
In that context, it is very hard to understand why anyone would seriously make the comment, as Senator McLucas did a moment ago, that the Australian government has shown a failure to make real investments in Australian research. The commitment that the government has to Australian research is demonstrated by the amendment bill before the Senate right now. The National Health and Medical Research Council Amendment Bill 2006 provides the underpinning for a sound mechanism to deliver quality research. It provides for clearer, better and more contemporary governance arrangements in the NHMRC and it clarifies the function of accountability and reporting to the Australian people which the council has. In doing that, the bill does not impact on the NHMRC’s fundamental role, its mission, nor does it affect the funding basis for the body. In fact, the bill strengthens the independence of the NHMRC and it should be and is welcomed by the key stakeholders in this sector. The bill makes the NHMRC a statutory authority—it has previously been a body corporate—and subject to the provisions of the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997. Those arrangements that apply to other government agencies will now apply to the NHMRC.
The decisions the government has made in respect of this bill are a reflection of key reviews of this area, particularly the The virtuous cycle report by the Australian National Audit Office in 2004 and the Uhrig review in 2003. I note that the changes are broadly supported by all those who made submissions to the inquiry, particularly the Australian Society for Medical Research and the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee. In that context, I found some of the additional comments provided by senators from the Labor Party and the Australian Democrats a little bit puzzling. Senator Allison just referred to a concern expressed in the additional comments about the lack of time available for receiving submissions in this inquiry. I am puzzled about this because I understand that there was no particular dissent or dispute about the time frame for this bill to be referred to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee. There was no challenge to that time frame. It was provided for that there would be a referral at the end of March with report back to the Senate at the beginning of May. My recollection is that that is quite a long period of time for a legislation committee to consider a bill. I cannot recall, in fact, having a bill inquiry with a longer time frame for reporting, except the RU486 bill inquiry, which notoriously took place over the recent summer.
So there was quite a long time in comparison with usual references to legislation committees, certainly the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee. As such, that was a strange comment. But it is perhaps made more understandable by the fact that a number of the additional comments that were made by the Labor and Democrat senators were not in fact made by any of the people who made submissions to the inquiry. For example, the senators concerned say:
We oppose the removal of the requirement that membership of Council must include:
an eminent scientist who has knowledge of public health research and medical research issues
a person with expertise in the trade union movement
a person with expertise in the needs of users of social welfare services
a person with expertise in environmental issues
None of the people making submissions to the inquiry raised those issues. Nobody raised those issues with the inquiry. The closest we got was a comment from the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee that expressed a little bit of concern about reducing the size of the governing council and said:
… the AVCC is concerned that unless attention is placed on the role and function of the Research Committee, the capacity for high quality recommendations to be made concerning funding of research proposals may be put at risk.
But, with respect, that does not really touch on any of issues which have been raised by the additional comments. For that matter, I do not recall much discussion in the course of the hearings about those issues, but perhaps members of the committee will be able to enlighten us about that.
—I will.
—It looks like Senator Webber is going to contribute to that question. I very much look forward to that. It is very hard to understand why the National Health and Medical Research Council needs to have a person with expertise in the trade union movement sitting on it to contribute to its work. This is not an exercise in bashing unions; it is just a reflection on what role trade unions would have in a body of that kind. I cannot think of a less appropriate setting for trade union participation. I suppose it is possible that medical researchers and so on might be unionised to some extent, but there are plenty of them on the council, as researchers, already. They do not necessarily need representation by another body on the council. All of the state and territory governments are represented, I understand, through their chief medical officers. Presumably, they have a role to play there on behalf of those governments.
I find the suggestion that that particular position should be retained a rather strange one, particularly given that nobody, not one submitter, made that suggestion to the committee. We had over a fortnight for submissions to be lodged with the committee and no trade union took advantage of the opportunity to do that. So, as I said, I find the comments strange.
I also note that the senators concerned oppose the removal of the need for the federal health minister to consult with state and territory health ministers before appointing the chair of AHEC in favour of the requirement of consulting appropriately. This was discussed in the committee, and the Department of Health and Ageing made it clear that the federal minister for health does need to consult with state and territory health ministers through the Australian Health Ministers Advisory Council—and of course there is that representation on the NHMRC of the chief health officers from each state and territory—and that the work of the council should proceed on the basis of ‘a large degree of cooperation and consensus’ so that those sorts of issues or problems are avoided. I think that very neatly deals with that issue.
I accept that it is the right of senators on these inquiries to form views which are based on personal experience rather than on anything that witnesses say to them, but I draw the line at being told that somehow either this bill or the announcements in the last 24 hours exhibit a failure by the Australian government to make a real investment in Australian research. Nothing could be further from the truth. Last night the federal government demonstrated an absolutely sterling commitment to medical research in this country. The benefits of that spending will be felt by generations of Australians to come. It was an extraordinarily generous commitment, and it is a pity that we cannot all acknowledge it for what it is—a major investment in the future health of Australians.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL HEALTH AND MEDICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2006-05-10,"—Whilst I do not want to delay the chamber unduly on this issue, I cannot help but respond in the first instance to some of the matters Senator Humphries has raised before going on to my planned contribution to this debate on the National Health and Medical Research Council Amendment Bill. I came to the Senate inquiry a bit late in the process, so I appreciate Senator Humphries’s outline of the timetable. I will make two brief comments in response.
When considering at the inquiry the membership of the council and the removal of specific people with areas of expertise, whilst I will not comment on the submissions the committee received, I know that we did spend some time questioning and debating the need to remove these designated positions. Those appearing before the committee tried to assure us that those areas would be covered anyway. I would say that perhaps those of us that signed off on these additional comments were underwhelmed by the guarantees that we were given. We did not feel that those assurances would match and meet our concerns.
I would also like to place on the record the concern that members of the government seem to have about people that know anything about the trade union movement serving on anything. When you see this in light of the piece of legislation that has just gone through this place—the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Amendment Bill 2006—this seems to be a systematic approach by this government to remove from any board anyone who has ever been a member of a trade union.
There is a trade union that covers researchers and academics—the National Tertiary Education Union. They cover university academics. They would not be seen, I am sure, by Senator Sterle or anyone else as being the most radical and hardline union in our country, but they do bring to bear a certain perspective on the conditions that academics work under that I think is appropriate for people to consider when they are looking at funding models and priorities for research. There is no point in just saying, ‘We’re going to give you a whole lot of money,’ if we do not make sure that that funding ensures that we meet the occupational health and safety standards and the requirements of those conducting the research. So I think there is a legitimate role for people with that kind of background. However, obviously those opposite feel a little uncomfortable about having people who know anything about the union movement on any board or committee these days.
To return to what I was originally going to say: one of the matters that every member of the committee that was at the hearing is in furious agreement on is our support for the role of the NHMRC. It is one of the defining institutions in Australian public life; it is often a world leader and it is something that we should all be very proud of. I too would like to congratulate the government for increasing the funding in areas of research. The funding that was announced last night is a genuinely significant contribution and a very good thing. But, for the people conducting this long-term research, certainty must go hand in hand with funding—certainty of time lines and certainty of process. Probably the main concern I have with this legislation is the fact that we are now removing the legislative requirement for when funding will be announced. Our key scientists and researchers will not have that guaranteed time line by which they know they will get a decision on the future of their projects and their work. That is now in the hands of those working at the NHMRC.
Whilst they sought to give us some assurances about how we do not really need it legislated because they will meet the time line anyway—which I do not really think is a very good reason for wanting to get rid of a time line—I remain to be convinced. When we probed why it needed to go, we were told that it put them all under undue pressure to make decisions and that, in fact, the only time in our history that we failed to meet the time line was when there was a flood. I am sure everyone in this building would accept that there are mitigating circumstances with natural disasters.
I think the removal of that prescribed time line brings a degree of uncertainty. I think it is a bit sad when we get to that point, particularly if you look at it hand in hand with increased funding and increased knowledge and support of the organisation from within this building. So I want to place on record my concerns, particularly given the lead time that a lot of these complex research projects have. If they are going to devote that much of their technical knowledge, expertise and life to making some of these miraculous discoveries, the least we can do as parliamentarians is to give them a guaranteed time line so that they know whether they will continue with their desired research project.
The only other thing I want to briefly place on record is another concern I have with the removal of the prescribed time line. I do not in anyway suggest that the current minister would do this, but it seems to me that, when you decide to remove a prescribed time line for making funding decisions, things can very easily get caught up in political processes and become politicised. When you remove a prescribed legislative time line for decisions and announcements on grant applications and put that hand in hand with increased funding for organisations, the cynics in our community—and that seems to be a growing part of our population—then see how delays in making decisions and announcements can get caught up with things like, say, elections, where governments may want to be seen as innovative and to be fostering developments in medical research and the sciences.
I wanted to take the time in this chamber to place those two concerns on record. We have removed the certainty that our researchers had and, whilst I accept the guarantees we were given at the hearing, I will feel a lot more confident when the certainty is in the legislation. I am underwhelmed by the reasons we were given for removing it. One of the other things that certainty gives us is a politically neutral and, therefore, fair playing field for those trying to pursue research.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL HEALTH AND MEDICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2006-05-10,"—Firstly, I would like to open my remarks by thanking senators for their support of the National Health and Medical Research Council Amendment Bill 2006—sometimes grudgingly, sometimes qualified; nonetheless we always welcome support. In particular I would like to acknowledge the very valuable contribution made by the members of the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee for their consideration and careful scrutiny of this bill. But I have to say that I am disappointed by some of the views expressed by the Australian Democrats and the Australian Labor Party in their additional comments. I would like to take the opportunity to briefly address these comments.
Before turning to the issues raised by the ALP and the Australian Democrats, I would like to congratulate the government for the really huge boost in funding for the NHMRC. Last night, as we all know, in a very popular, successful and responsible budget, the Hon. Peter Costello announced an additional $905 million for Australian health and medical research. This is a major new investment in our future health and one that I believe we should all be very proud of. The benefits of research investment are undisputed. The changes outlined in this bill ensure that the NHMRC is well positioned to ensure that Australia harvests the benefit of this investment.
Australia, I am pleased to say, currently stands as the world leader in health and medical research. On a per capita basis, our research output is twice the OECD average. Access Economics has estimated that since 1960 the consumer benefits arising from Australia’s investment in health and medical research have been in excess of $5 trillion—and I think it is correct to say that that is $5,000 billion. I see Labor senators are nodding, so I clearly got that right. This comprises over $2.9 trillion in longevity gains of eight years, plus an estimated $2.5 trillion in gains in the quality of life and avoided costs. They are very interesting figures. I can see that they have gripped the Labor senators on the other side of the chamber.
It is not surprising that industry has also benefited from investment in health and medical research. Since 1992 it is estimated that commercialisation of health and medical research has created over 350 companies, translating into approximately 3,000 to 4,000 new knowledge-based jobs. The NHMRC has performed a pivotal role in supporting such research and fostering talented researchers in these fields. This bill and the recent current budget commitments ensure that this will continue.
The legislation introduces new governance arrangements to the National Health and Medical Research Council which will ensure that the council can focus on providing the best possible advice. These new arrangements address governance concerns identified in a number of recent reviews, primarily the investment review of health and medical research, or the so-called Grant review, the ANAO review of NHMRC’s governance arrangements and the review of the corporate governance of statutory authorities and office holders, otherwise very well known as the Uhrig review.
The existing legislative framework under which the NHMRC currently operates divides financial responsibility and operational accountability. The proposed new governance arrangements address this issue by clearly aligning accountability and responsibility. Under the new legislation, the NHMRC will remain within the Health and Ageing portfolio, with reporting and accountability frameworks that clearly separate the NHMRC’s roles and functions from those of the department. The proposed governance arrangements establish the NHMRC’s chief executive officer as directly accountable to the Minister for Health and Ageing, while keeping the secretary of the department informed on a ‘no surprises’ basis. The bill’s provisions strengthen the NHMRC’s independence, provide clear lines of responsibility for governance and financial accountability, and allow the council to focus on issues relating to health, medical research and advice.
I now turn to the size and membership of the council—an issue raised by Senator McLucas. I will make some observations about Senator McLucas’s comments. Senator Allison also suggested an amendment in relation to the size of the council. As has been noted by a number of reviews, the current membership of the council is unwieldy and not conducive to strong governance. Under the current legislation, the size of the council is 29 members, which are drawn from 17 prescribed bodies following an eight-month consultation process.
One of the purposes of this bill is to streamline the council membership while ensuring that the most appropriately qualified people can be appointed to the council based on the priorities for a particular triennium. Rather than prescribing the expertise for each and every position, as was the case in the past, the new legislation provides that certain people must be appointed, such as the chief medical officer from each state and territory. It then provides that at least six, but no more than 11, members must be selected with expertise in one of the listed areas or with other appropriate expertise. This means that if, in a particular triennium, there is a particular need for a person with expertise in environmental issues, for example, then such a person could be selected. This is a sensible change that recognises that priorities of the council change over time and that appropriately qualified and experienced people must be able to be appointed to the council. In this way we ensure that the council can respond to emerging issues and can provide expert advice on issues as they arise.
The reduction in the number of people on the council in no way reduces the breadth and depth of the expertise of this eminent body. Council members themselves have acknowledged problems with the current size of the council, and it may be considered testimony to the proposed legislation that no concerns have been forwarded by any council member regarding the proposed new council structure. Senator McLucas will be interested in that. The good senator has also expressed concerns regarding the disclosure of interest provisions. The legislation in no way waters down any disclosure of interest requirements. In fact, the legislation has been strengthened in that respect.
Previously, the legislation required council members to disclose their interests within one month of being appointed. There was no express requirement for interest to be disclosed prior to appointment. Despite this, it was always a matter of practice that members disclosed their interests prior to an appointment. The new legislation expressly provides—Senator McLucas will be delighted to know—that, before starting to hold office, members of the council and of both principal committees and working groups must give the CEO a written statement of any interest the person has that may relate to any activity of the council or committee. Interests must continue to be disclosed on an ongoing basis. This means that more than 500 people—including up to 24 council members, approximately 75 principal committee members and approximately 400 working group members—will be providing the CEO with declarations of interest. It is not appropriate that the minister be responsible for overseeing all of these disclosures. This responsibility has therefore been vested in the CEO.
On the specific issue of the appointment of council members, the CEO will be advising the minister on all relevant matters in relation to all possible candidates, including any possible conflicts of interest. It has always been the case in the past, in the absence of any legislation requiring disclosures to the minister prior to appointment, and this will continue to be the situation in the future. This will also be expressly covered in the agreement between the CEO and the minister.
I will now turn to issues regarding Indigenous matters. In their additional comments, the Australian Democrats and the Australian Labor Party have indicated that they would be concerned if the proposed restructure of the NHMRC were to have the result of diminishing the council’s capacity to respond to serious problems in Indigenous health. The mere suggestion that this might occur is quite scandalous. As my colleagues in this chamber are well aware, there is absolutely nothing in this legislation which even remotely suggests that the capacity of the council to respond to Indigenous issues will be diminished. The NHMRC’s capacity will not be diminished in any respect. Some senators appear to have misunderstood one of the main functions of the amendments, which is precisely to ensure that the NHMRC as a whole is best placed to respond to important issues, including, but not limited to, Indigenous health. The whole point of the changes is to clarify the governance arrangements to ensure that the council can focus on the provision of expert advice and that the CEO can focus on the smooth, transparent and effective management of the NHMRC as a whole.
Let me now turn to the appointment of the CEO. On 27 April this year, the Minister for Health and Ageing announced the appointment of Professor Warwick Anderson AM as the new Chief Executive Officer of the NHMRC. Professor Anderson brings a wealth of experience to this position. Indeed, since 1991, Professor Anderson has contributed extensively to the work of the NHMRC, including chairing the research committee for two triennia.
As Head of the School of Biomedical Sciences at the Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences and Head of the Department of Physiology at Monash University, Professor Anderson’s responsibilities have included management, administration and financial accountability issues. With the responsibilities and accountabilities assigned to the CEO under these new governance arrangements, it is fortunate that the government has been able to secure a person that brings such a wealth of high-level management and scientific expertise to the position as Professor Anderson brings.
I would also like to take this opportunity, on behalf of the minister, to thank Mr Bill Lawrence for acting as the NHMRC’s CEO throughout this transitional period. I am aware, as advised by the minister, that Mr Lawrence’s sensible and calm leadership through this transition has been appreciated by all, stakeholders and staff alike, and his commendable performance has not gone unrecognised. The minister wishes Mr Lawrence every success in his future endeavours.
Finally, it gives me great pleasure and it is an honour to commend this bill to the Senate on behalf of the minister. The bill provides the NHMRC with a sound governance platform on which to build upon its successes to date and to lead Australia’s future strategic direction in health and medical research.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2006-05-10,"—I rise to speak on behalf of the Labor Party in relation to the Student Assistance Legislation Amendment Bill 2005. On the face of it, the major reason for the bill before the Senate today is to enable the government to legislatively close a student loans scheme that it had earlier shut by administrative means. But, in moving to strip from legislation this student income support measure, the Howard government lays bare the absence of any suitable alternatives. This bill is a testament to the bankruptcy of this government’s policies in relation to student income support.
Before I traverse the details of this government’s sad and sorry record in the area of student financial assistance, it would be good for the chamber to consider the circumstances that have led to the Senate considering this bill today. Back in October 2003, the Howard government attempted to shut the Student Financial Supplement Scheme by legislation and it failed—it failed to muster sufficient support from non-government senators. Seeing the writing on the wall, the government chose not to proceed with the bill. However, the saga did not end there. Following the withdrawal of the bill, the government announced that it would close the scheme using administrative means. And so it was in December 2003 that the then minister for education announced that there would be no new loans from the Student Financial Supplement Scheme from 31 December of that year. Effectively, the government thumbed its nose at the parliament, and at the Senate in particular, and simply decreed that this scheme was no longer open for business.
The present bill is yet another attempt by the government to expunge from the statutes all references to the Student Financial Supplement Scheme—a scheme which filled a particular need for students requiring additional income support. This scheme provided extra options for students in ways that could be tailored to suit the individual circumstances of the students.
In 1993, the first year of the operation of the Student Financial Supplement Scheme, some 44,000 students took advantage of the new financial supplement. By 1996, the number of students with a financial supplement loan had grown to some 68,000—around 13 per cent of all Austudy and Abstudy recipients. Although it is correct that most loans were accessed through the scheme between 1995 and 1999, a large number of students were assisted by this flexible facility beyond those years. In fact, in excess of 200,000 loans were made available through the scheme in the last five years of its operation, between 1999 and 2003.
In 2002, just under 40,000 students applied for and accepted these loans. It is worth while considering who these people were when one looks at the impact of the closure of this scheme. Of these students, 15.6 per cent were Indigenous, 1.6 per cent were from remote regions, just over 15 per cent were recorded as single parenting payment recipients, 12.2 per cent were not born in Australia and some 54.7 per cent—the great majority of the applicants who received loans—were women.
These figures reinforce 2003 data provided by the government that disclosed that the largest beneficiaries of these loans were low-income earners—students who were single parents, disabled or Indigenous—who could not access support from other sources such as their parents or who faced other constraints in the labour market. It is clear that the scheme was of greatest assistance to the most financially vulnerable students. Without it they were at grave risk of not being able to complete their studies. It was no great shock that, when the Howard government pulled the rug from beneath the feet of these students in 2003 through the sudden closure of the scheme, many were left in a difficult situation.
Whilst we in opposition accept the reality that the government has effectively closed the Student Financial Supplement Scheme, we are not prepared to meekly accept that a student income support scheme should be jettisoned without anything being put in place to fill the void. That this void has been permitted and in fact created is completely consistent with the track record of the Howard government, its manifest lack of adequate income support for students and its seeming disinterest in the real hardships faced by many students during their studies.
The June 2005 report of the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee on student income support exposed the severe shortcomings of the government in this particular area of public policy. The report’s preface states:
Over the last decade the student income support system has operated in a policy vacuum. It is now showing the signs of this neglect. The government’s preoccupation with program efficiency over policy effectiveness and continuing problems with Centrelink’s delivery of payments have taken their toll on students. The current level of income support does not come close to providing students with a decent living wage to cover the cost of accommodation, food, bills and transport. The level of income support has been falling steadily behind the rising cost of living. This has resulted in many students experiencing severe financial hardship and poverty.
The evidence from the Senate inquiry, from numerous reports on student finances and the experiences of students is clear—more students are working and more students are working more. Student income support policy has simply been neglected by the Howard government.
At the same time, a whole range of other student welfare and support services are set to disappear following the passage last year of the VSU legislation. We have already seen evidence of the ways in which this legislation and the abolition of student unions will make life tougher for students, particularly those who are in dire need of support. The harsh reality on many campuses right now is that these services are already closing down. As we in the opposition and other parties in this chamber predicted, student welfare and support services have been amongst the first to go. I will not canvass in detail here the generally detrimental effects of VSU legislation. They have been well canvassed in many places, not the least of which is this chamber.
The Howard government cannot rely on the excuse that it was not given volumes of credible evidence about the disastrous effects its policies are having on a range of disadvantaged students, such as those from rural areas. A national report by the University of Melbourne’s Centre for the Study of Higher Education released in June last year showed that students from rural backgrounds are twice as likely as their urban counterparts to defer studies at university. The research report was entitled T
he first year experience in Australian universities: findings from a decade of national studies. It showed that nearly one in five rural students deferred university compared to one in 10 students in the broader population. The report found:
The reason for this difference is ... likely to be the greater need for rural students to accumulate savings to meet their additional costs of attending university.
The research concludes that students from rural backgrounds are being forced to delay commencement of their university studies because the Howard government’s income support is nowhere near enough to keep up with the living costs faced by these students. I would welcome some contribution to this debate, and to the issue of access to university by rural students, from the National Party—the great defenders of rural and regional Australia. Evidence has come before the Senate on a number of occasions about the harsh ways in which this government’s higher education policies negatively impact on students from rural and regional Australia. What do we hear from the National Party about access to tertiary education for the constituency they profess to represent?

Senator Stott Despoja interjecting—

—As Senator Stott Despoja points out, we in fact have no National Party senators in the chamber currently for this debate! I will now turn to another recent report, The impact of drought on secondary education access in Australia’s rural and remote areas, by Margaret Alston and Jenny Kent of Charles Sturt University. That study similarly found that rural young people simply cannot afford to go to university anymore. The report said that many families are unable to support their young people away from home and that there is a huge sense of frustration that university education is no longer available on a merit basis. The remedy to this problem is, of course, in the government’s hands, but we in the Labor opposition will not hold our breath. We will not hold our breath waiting for the Howard government to break its long-held habit of 10 years and do the right and decent thing by students of this country.
The Labor Party have demonstrated our commitment to policies which will provide much needed relief from the financial pressures on students in higher education today. For example, at the last election, Labor proposed fully costed and responsible policies to better support struggling students by extending rental assistance to Austudy recipients and by reducing the age of independence for students on Youth Allowance from 25 to 23. We on this side of politics believe that students need better support if they are to get the best out of their studies and we believe that, if Australia is to get the best out of them, we need to do more. In contrast, all we see from the Howard government is a deepening void. We see the cancellation of financial support schemes which could potentially make the difference between continuing to graduation and deferring or dropping out altogether.
This bill also contains a clause that is unrelated to the closure of the Student Financial Supplement Scheme but is potentially of significant moment in relation to two further income support schemes. There is a clause in the bill which would appear to remove the need to make new regulations each time the guidelines for Abstudy and Assistance for Isolated Children schemes are altered. Such revision is described by the government as a ‘minor technical amendment’, but advice received from the Parliamentary Library indicates it is not minor at all and may have major consequences for parliamentary oversight of important elements of these two schemes.
One of the proper roles for any legislature is to ensure sufficient scrutiny of the proposals advanced by the executive in enactments. Appropriate levels of accountability demand that such scrutiny and oversight occur in relation to all instruments of legislative authority. This is particularly the case for non-statutory programs such as Abstudy. In fact, in relation to Abstudy, it seems that the only opportunity for the parliament to be aware of changes to certain important components of the scheme in the past was via the process of notification from time to time of the date of changes to the relevant Abstudy policy manual, which is in effect the compendium of guidelines made under the scheme. I say that this was the case in the past, because the department of education has advised the relevant Senate committee which conducted an inquiry into this bill that references to Abstudy and the Assistance for Isolated Children Scheme have recently been removed altogether from the regulations. Where that particular act leaves parliamentary scrutiny of these schemes is entirely unclear.
I recognise that this issue is legally complex and difficult. We in the opposition are relying on the expertise of the Parliamentary Library’s research service to set out the two competing interpretations of the bill’s provisions in this regard. I would like to quote at some length from the Bills Digest prepared on this bill. It says:
The changes to section 48 of the SAA will modify the way in which notification obligations are to be defined. Under the new regime, the scope of the obligation can be defined by the Executive. These changes have an immediate influence upon the offence provision, section 49. Accordingly, the proposed amendment in Schedule 2, Part 2, item 10 is not without difficulties. In particular, should the broad view be followed, the proposed amendment could:
remove parliamentary scrutiny with respect to the scope of the obligation and, as result, of the offence, and
erode the rule of law because it has the potential to remove certainty from the obligation and the matching offence.
Parliament may want to consider whether the proposed law should be amended to put beyond doubt that the expansion of the regulation-making power does not include the determination of ‘prescribed events’, but is limited to the prescription of the notification process.
I wish to make it clear to the chamber that it is this advice, as contained in the Bills Digest, which has formed the basis for Labor’s amendment which I will move during the committee stage of the bill. For the reasons I have set out, and in particular because of the competing and valid legal interpretations of the consequences of the bill, I urge the government to consider the serious grounds that Labor has for proposing this amendment. Our view is that continued oversight of legislative instruments which can effect changes in access and eligibility criteria is a crucial function of this parliament. They should not be watered down under the cover of a so-called technical amendment. I fear this is yet another example of the way in which this government draws more power to the executive and reduces the power of the legislature.
I also note with interest that the Department of Education, Science and Training has informed the Senate committee that they are prepared to make a recommendation to the minister—and I quote from the department’s evidence—to:
... include an express statement that, to remove doubt, the power in proposed subsection 48(2) is not intended to permit the determination of prescribed events in extrinsic materials and that prescribed events may only be determined expressly in the Regulations.
Immediately prior to consideration of this bill in the House of Representatives, the new Minister for Education, Science and Training tabled an amended explanatory memorandum which contained a statement in precisely those terms. Of course, the statement itself would now constitute extrinsic material for any court considering any case brought under the act as amended by this bill. However, during the debate in the House, the minister was asked to explicitly state whether this statement had exactly the same effect as the substantive amendment moved by the opposition. The minister would not, or could not, provide such an assurance. For this reason, the opposition intends to move the same amendment during the committee stage here in the Senate, and the minister responsible for the bill would be well advised to seek advice from officers on whether the added statement in the explanatory memorandum does indeed fully address the issues of concern raised by the opposition.
I stress that these concerns, while technical and legal in nature, go to fundamental issues of the powers of the parliament to adequately scrutinise legislation which impacts on the entitlement of Australians to income support benefits. In conclusion, this bill as a whole will enshrine a much diminished set of options for student income support, against the backdrop of a government record of unalloyed policy failure in an area that is vital to the success of so many students who are in genuine need of assistance. Other provisions of this bill attack the role of the parliament as a watchdog on untrammelled executive power, and these are utterly unacceptable. For these reasons, the opposition cannot possibly support this bill in its current form.
Debate interrupted.",SENATE,<title>STUDENT ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2006-05-10,"—As the Senate is aware, the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee is currently inquiring into Australia’s naval shipbuilding industry. This inquiry was prompted by a concern on both sides of this chamber about the government’s decision to build three air warfare destroyers in South Australia. The concern of the committee is that both the economic interests of Australia and the strategic needs of our national defence need careful consideration. This is in the context of fears that some of the ships might be built offshore. The consequences of this would be the loss of future ship repair and maintenance capacity within Australia. With that, the stimulus that such projects would provide to Australian industry would clearly be lost.
I think it is fair to say that all members of the committee agree about the need to explore these two very important considerations. The committee wants to make sure that, whatever decision is finally made, it is well founded and defensible in both fact and policy terms. The terms of reference of the committee, which were drafted jointly by the government and me, are therefore very particular. First, we want to know whether our current industry base is capable of constructing large naval vessels over the long term on a sustainable basis. This is important because the worst thing for any economy and for particular industries is stop-and-start development.
Second, the committee wants to benchmark Australia’s industry with comparable overseas industries. The background for this is that often we hear that it is cheaper and more efficient to buy overseas and off the shelf. But, as we also know, it is not that simple. Third, the committee wants to establish the comparative costs of maintaining, repairing and refitting large naval vessels throughout their service lives if constructed here rather than overseas. The reasons for this are defence related during times of war and the need for self-sufficiency within that context. But we also need to establish the real costs of that option, and, if work is going to be sourced here as opposed to overseas, we need to know what realistic premium would need to be paid to locate the work in this country as opposed to sending it offshore for a marginally lower price. Finally, the committee wants to examine the real flow-on benefits and costs for our economy of any decision about where to build ships.
These are highly relevant terms of reference. The indicative cost of the three air warfare destroyers is around $6 billion. From bitter experience in the last 10 years, we know that this cost is guaranteed to double. The cost of two additional large heavy-lift amphibious ships, which could weigh up to 40,000 tonnes, is also considerable. The government has only recently announced the design and tendering process. Putting aside any defence considerations, this will probably be the single largest financial commitment of any government in Australia’s history—the cost of engaging in war aside. Accordingly, we need to get it right.
Might I also add that this inquiry has nothing at all to do with the strategic decision to build these ships. There are indeed many questions to be asked about those two sets of decisions. They go to defence policy, to our long-term view of peace in the world and to our role in maintaining or contributing to the maintenance of that peace. That debate is for another time, but for the committee’s purposes with respect to our defence industries, it is a given. As I have said, our sole focus is to test the short- and long-term capacity of Australian industry to do the job and the real costs and benefits—if any—to the economy throughout the build task. In that way, we hope that the final decision as to how and where to build these ships will be based on the very best available analysis.
Further, and most important, we in the parliament who approve the expenditure of money need to be confident that the money will be spent well. Experience in recent years in the Defence portfolio gives us little confidence that that will be the case. Despite assertions to the contrary, naval shipbuilding has suffered all the cost overruns and delays that have occurred in many other projects in recent years.
Having set out the background, I do not intend to explore the substance of the issues flowing from the terms of reference being examined by the committee. The real issue is the attitude of the Department of Defence—and from this, I suspect, the government policy which might underpin the approach adopted by Defence in this inquiry. Fears have been heightened as a result of the minister’s recent announcement of a review of defence procurement policy and processes. To be very blunt, the Department of Defence submission to this inquiry is living proof of the poverty of defence industry policy. The review announced by the minister is therefore overdue. There has been extensive navel-gazing by the government over the last 10 years in this area, and it continues to be a mess.
The Defence submission, as interesting as it might have been, simply ignored the terms of reference. If its quality is representative of the manner in which the department has approached the whole consideration of the project in its submissions to government then we have a major cause for concern. I would like to think that that is not the case, but there are indications in the submission—borne out by questioning at public hearings—which indicate at least some major confusion in policy. It is easy to think from any literal reading of the submission that the Department of Defence believes that any decision to build these ships can be made only on the basis of a contestable market. There simply are no concerns about any shipbuilding industry beyond maintenance and repair. The bottom line, as clearly stated, is that, once these ships are built, the long-term responsibility for the costs of the inevitable boom-and-bust cycle would fall on industry and the taxpayer. That is the thrust of Defence’s submission in a nutshell. Defence quite simply sees itself as having no responsibility for the future of the shipbuilding industry, whether military or commercial.
Those in industry who struggle day by day with defence industry policy will not be surprised at this. Many of us receive representations from industries dependent on defence for their livelihood. Their concerns are the practices engaged in tendering and the commitment to retaining efficient and productive businesses. The cavalier, pure market approach expressed by the department in its submission is further evidence that something is amiss within Defence. Or is it confusion about government policy? Whichever it is, I must say it is highly unsatisfactory and it needs to be resolved.
Of course, from past experience we all know about the difficulties of defence procurement in a small indigenous domestic market. We know that the defence industry is a monopsony, as it is described—that is, a single-purchaser industry. We know there are significant problems with client capture and the protection of patents in a necessarily secret, or commercial, environment. We also know the history of alleged shady dealing, bias, conflict of interest and all the bitterness that ensues from disappointed tenderers. We also know that the DMO, under Dr Gumley, is on the record as being committed to cleaning up that history. We wish them well.
But these are not the issues for this inquiry. The single issue is the policy of the government with respect to industry development in the long term. Is it really one of a pure contestable market for everything, as Defence would have us believe, or is the government dancing to the tune of the pure market economists in the bureaucracy? Are there other national interests at stake? To what extent has the government, for example, received advice from Defence on the very matters that are the subject of the committee’s terms of reference? What advice did Defence provide in its analysis of the capacity of Australian industry before it made its decision to build a brand new dockyard in South Australia for the three AWDs? What then is the policy with respect to public investment in privately owned infrastructure? What analysis was provided of the relative costs of building overseas, in whole or in part? What consideration was given to overseas experience in naval construction? And what detailed consideration was given to the cost benefits for the Australian economy of doing the work here? From the Defence submission to the committee, the innocent reader would say none. But that cannot be true; in which case one asks: why are we being treated like fools?
I think it is fair to say for the record that most senators on the inquiry expressed the same disappointment in the Defence attitude as I have. In fact, it is quite a contrast to read the excellent submissions by the governments of Western Australia and South Australia, as well as those from Victoria and major players such as the ASC and Tenix. Their interests clearly reflect the substantial nature and seriousness of this inquiry, and we are grateful for that evidence. One can only question why Defence insists on being so recalcitrant. As I mentioned, surely it cannot be because the work has not been done. It beggars belief that any government would make such a momentous decision on the two contracts involved in building those two sets of ships without that sort of advice being sought and received by the appropriate subcommittee of cabinet—the same sort of advice that the Senate committee is seeking. While I do not wish to make a political play of this, is it possible that such laxness has spread to government decision making? There are certainly signs of such adhocery elsewhere at present.
The current state of play is that the Department of Defence has been sent off by the committee to have another go. The committee has put to the department a whole lot of questions on notice derived specifically from the terms of reference. We hope that, at its next appearance, the department will at least come prepared to be more expansive on the relevant issues, notwithstanding that many decisions are yet to be made. Some clarification on industry policy would be a good start. Representation of the department by those actually responsible for this area would also be appreciated. We are making no criticism of the department’s witnesses at the committee’s first hearing but are criticising the fact that so many questions were deferred to others who either chose not to attend or were simply not present. Whether this is indicative of broader and more contemptuous attitudes towards the Senate is difficult to say. But, as I have indicated on other occasions, the department is often inclined to flick Senate interests into the ‘too hard’ bin. That is not the accountability or the responsibility that we seek.
In conclusion, I repeat that this is a most important inquiry. It is fundamental to the future of our defence industry, and our concern, on current indications, is that that policy is a mess.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2006-05-10,"—My question is to Senator Kemp, representing the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. Can the minister confirm that under the budget’s tax and family payment changes announced last night single parents with one or two children will receive no extra benefit at all from those changes? Given that the tax cuts to high-income earners and others are deemed to be affordable, why has there been no assistance whatsoever to those raising children on income support? What is the logic or the rationale of denying any extra assistance to the poorest families in our community who are struggling to raise children on income support?

I ask the minister why those people—two million people relying entirely on income support—did not get a visit from Santa Claus. In fact, they did not get a visit at all. Why have they been totally denied any improved benefits as a result of the budget? These are people raising children in the poorest circumstances in our community.

—You can’t answer the question.
—Senator Penny Wong is complaining too, but can I point out to you that this budget has delivered very big benefits for families. This government has paid great attention over many years to those on pensions, to carers and to disability pensioners and they, of course, are the ones the government has given a very high priority to. So, Senator, you may quibble and complain, but the fact is that this budget has been very much welcomed by Australian families. It enjoys very strong community support.
—What about those two million?
—Well, Senator O’Brien, you complain about the issue of two million pensioners. The truth is this government has been the great friend of pensioners and carers. I am sorry that we are seeing some critical comments coming from the Labor Party on this budget. It is a good budget. It is one which has been widely welcomed and, if you have any doubts about it, listen to Wayne Swan’s comments last night and the praise he gave the budget.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Budget 2006-07</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,answer

It was not this government which referred to the Santa Claus budget—it was actually the Labor Party which referred to the Santa Claus budget. We have given, as you are well aware, Senator, very considerable help to pensioners, carers and people on other pensions and benefits over the years.
—Where?
—Well, Senator Carr, I think the figures speak for themselves. This budget has been very widely welcomed in the Australian community. It is one which the Labor Party will be very vexed about because it enjoys such strong support.
—We’ll see.

I am sure that he and all senators will join me in wishing Sergeant Les Cooper, who was shot three times in Tasmania yesterday, a speedy recovery. Minister, in the wake of allegations that a hand gun may have been used in this callous crime, is the government going to review the increasing loss through crime of hand guns in Australia for illegal use and the increasing importation of hand guns, including rapid fire semiautomatic hand guns, with a view to ensuring that they do not fall into criminal hands or are potentially available for criminal use and use against authorised police and security officers?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Firearms</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,question
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2006-05-10,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question about semiautomatic hand guns. The minister will recollect that it was one of those weapons that was used to shoot 16 children in Scotland a little over a decade ago, at Dunblane. The minister mentioned the stealing from private premises of hand guns. Can the minister say how many automatic hand guns there are in Australia and what legitimate use there can be for these hand guns outside those used for security purposes and for a very limited number of sports shooters?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Firearms</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,question
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2006-05-10,"—Senator Brown raises a matter which is of great concern to the Commonwealth government and, I think, to state and territory governments around the country—that is, the diversion of firearms from the legal sector into the illegal sector. I note that the Australian Institute of Criminology has a report which indicates that the diversion has dropped—we had a figure a few years ago of around 4,000 thefts a year, and I think that has dropped quite markedly. However, having said that, it is still an issue of concern that there is theft of legal firearms diverted for criminal usage, particularly in relation to concealable weapons such as a hand gun. The Australian Crime Commission is conducting a national operation in relation to the illegal use of firearms and that deals with the illegal trafficking of firearms. This is something which has been addressed at several police ministers councils and will continue to be.
In relation to the regulation of firearms, we have brought in great reforms under the Howard government to restrict ownership of hand guns. It has been a restriction which has seen the buyback of over 60,000 hand guns, but the diversion of legal firearms into the criminal sector is still a matter of major concern and we continue to address it. Whilst the majority of thefts are from residential premises, we still remain concerned that there has been in isolated cases the involvement of some dealers—one in particular in Western Australia was jailed in relation to offences in relation to that. There is an ongoing inquiry into the security industry generally in New South Wales, and that is something we are following closely. It covers a range of areas, not just theft from residential premises although that is the majority of the thefts that have been reported. It is something we are keenly aware of and something we are addressing with the states and territories.
Finally, we are pushing with the states and territories a national firearms management system. We have committed $1 million to that, and it is based roughly on the register in Victoria, which we believe is very good practice in identifying a firearm, distinguishing features, its ownership, its whereabouts, and photographic detail of the firearm. We believe that with a national firearms management system we can keep track of firearms across the board, because you have people in today’s environment moving from state to state. It also assists those people who are legitimately involved in sporting and shooting events who can travel from one state to another and engage quite legitimately in their sport. That is something that we are urging the states to participate in.

It goes down to semiautomatic, length of barrel, magazine capacity and calibre. In relation to this issue, this is something which is ongoing and, in relation to the thefts that are mentioned, I think the report by the AIC—I will check the report—covers the types of firearms which have been stolen.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2006-05-10,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for the Arts and Sport (Senator Kemp) to questions without notice asked by Senators Evans, Moore and Lundy today relating to the 2006-07 Budget.
Labor has welcomed and will support the changes to tax and family payments in the budget, because this year the government has finally looked to help those low- and middle-income earners, whereas last year the budget reforms were very much directed to the top end of town. They do well out of this package as well, but Labor recognises that at least there is something in it for middle-income earners on this occasion. You can argue about whether it is properly directed, and we will have those arguments.
Most middle-income earners know that this is getting a bit of their own money back for the taxes they paid over the last year, and it might help them meet the increasing costs of petrol and their mortgages. I think a lot of them will realise that even the compensation in the budget will not allow them to meet those extra costs, given how the price of petrol and interest rates are going up. Of course, there is the question of how much this budget will add to the pressure on interest rates, which we will obviously debate in coming months.
The focus of the questions to Senator Kemp today was on the forgotten people, the people not mentioned in the budget who received no assistance. It is interesting that most of those are the people doing it toughest in our community. The government produced scales which showed the impact on people who were earning private income of over $10,000—great! There was no coverage of those earning less than $10,000 in private income. There was no mention of pensioners, those on disability support pensions or single parents. Most of them do not have any private income. They rely on income support payments to support themselves. Many of them rely on those payments to raise children. Single parents and their children are families too. If you want to have a family friendly budget, you should not ignore the millions of families who rely on income support, but this budget has done so.
I know it is not sexy or trendy to talk about the poor or those on income support. The government has been very good at demonising those people. But there is nothing in this budget for them. At a time of great prosperity, when the government is able to find $39 billion in tax cuts, you would think they would have found them something. You would think at least one measure would have been directed to those most in need. But, if you are a single parent on income support with one or two children, there is absolutely nothing in this for you. You are forgotten completely by this budget.
So, while the government says, ‘You should be focusing on the winners,’ quite frankly, part of our job today is to focus on those who have been forgotten. It is not good enough, it reflects badly on the government and it reflects badly on our society that we so easily dismiss those families who are doing it tough. It is true that families on low private incomes are doing it tough and that there are some measures, including the improvements to the threshold for family payments, that help them. I welcome them. Labor has been arguing for that for some time. A number of the measures are things that we advocated at the last election and that we advocated in response to the last budget.
But, at a time when the government can find $39 billion for tax cuts, the fact that it can find nothing for those on income support—the single pensioners and people on the disability support pension—is I think an indictment of the government and the budget. I would normally include aged care pensioners—because effectively they found nothing—but the aged care pensioners did get something. They got a $102 utilities allowance payment. If you compare that to the largesse to all the others, it is a very small amount indeed. But the aged care pensioners did get that. I concede that.
—Carers?
—I am talking about the people on income support, Senator. Those aged care pensioners also providing care did not receive the full $1,000 payment. They were excluded. That is another question I have received no explanation for today from the minister, who clearly has not read the budget. He is the minister responsible in this chamber and he could not answer any of the questions about why the pensioners missed out. He could not answer any of the questions about the inequities in the measures being proposed. These are genuine questions that have not been answered. I think it is an indictment of this government when, from 1 July, high-income earners and many others are going to get a big whack in their pockets while those people relying on a disability support pension and single parent pensions will have their income reduced. The rates will be lower at the same time— (Time expired)

"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2006-05-10,"—I feel honoured and privileged to stand here today to respond to Senator Evans’s and the Labor Party’s motion to take note of the responses from Senator Kemp, and indeed others on this side of the chamber today, because we have in fact delivered a remarkable outcome for Australian families. This whole allegation from the Labor Party is an attack on Australian families, on older Australians and indeed on younger Australians. Labor have a blind spot. They have forgotten about the record low inflation, the record low interest rates and the record low unemployment in this country. They have forgotten about the above three per cent growth since 1996. They have forgotten about the 1.7 million new jobs in the last 10 years. They have forgotten about the 16.8 per cent increase in real wages. That is what they have forgotten. These are real wages. This is money in the pockets of Australian men and women and their families, and that benefits the whole community.
In my home state of Tasmania the figure is actually 15.9 per cent. I am very proud of that fact. Senator Minchin mentioned today government debt. It is interesting that Senator Evans did not mention or even refer to it. There was no mention of it. When Labor left office it was $96 billion. Do you know how much we were paying in interest at that time?

Senator Wong interjecting—

—Senator Wong, what was the interest we were paying at that time? It was $8 billion. Senator Wong does not know that fact. Let us remind Senator Wong and the Labor members on the other side that that is how much it was. What we are doing with that money now is spending it on essential services. We are spending it on health, education, security and defence—on things that are important to everyday Australians. And that $8 billion was going into a big black hole under Labor 10 years ago.
Here we are, we have delivered a budget and the Labor Party are accusing us of spending too much and putting pressure on interest rates. We have delivered a $10 billion surplus—not only this year but next year, the year after and the year after that. That is about one per cent of GDP. What do the experts say about the impact on Australian families? Do they say that it will put upward pressure on interest rates? I want to quote to you from Terry McCrann and what he had to say. He said:
One big question: will the tax cuts put pressure on interest rates? Answer, an emphatic no.
Alan Wood, in today’s Australian, had this to say:
... the question du jour yesterday was: wouldn’t all this tax cutting and spending force the Reserve Bank to put up interest rates again?
The answer is an unequivocal no.
So you can see that Labor have missed the point. They are chasing a red herring. The Labor Party talk about petrol prices and interest rates going up and, of course, these so-called extreme industrial relations changes. That is all they can come up with. But, when you talk to the experts, they say: ‘No, Labor Party, you’re wrong. The government’s actually got it right. They’ve got the balance right.’ It is in fact a remarkable result for Australian families, for working men and women.
Let us look at some of the benefits for older Australians. I am particularly proud of the initiative for carers of people with disabilities. That is tremendous: an additional one-off $1,000 payment prior to 30 June this year and a one-off $600 payment for recipients of the carer allowance. On top of that, Senator Evans talked about what we were doing for the aged care pensioners. Of course, you have the $100 utilities allowance. What does that cost the taxpayer? It is $173 million paid by 30 June this year. This is something that people were not planning for. This is good news—to pay the power bill, to help with miscellaneous expenses in and around the home. That is what we are doing. We are caring for older Australians. We are caring for families. There was an attack on the government from the Tasmanian Treasurer, who said that we are not spending enough on hospitals. Goodness gracious me! It is in the budget. It is a $220 million increase in Tasmania, and he has denied that that is— (Time expired)

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2006-05-10,"—I rise to speak on Senator Evans’s motion—which was, for Senator Barnett’s information, in relation to answers given by Senator Kemp. I would be happy to have a discussion about the current account deficit if he wanted to do so on another occasion. The current account deficit has, of course, ballooned under this government, which has no plan to enhance Australia’s export performance. But I will leave that for another day.
—Have you heard of the mineral boom?
—I will take that interjection, Senator McGauran. Yes, I have; and that is why Labor says that we should be investing in those things which will drive Australia’s future prosperity and future productivity. Yet we have instead a government that continues to fail to invest in skills but rides the commodities boom without any plan for the future. That is the reality, Senator McGauran.
I want to go back to the questions that were answered—or not answered—by Senator Kemp, about the people who were forgotten in this budget. It is not very fashionable to talk about those who are in poverty. It is not very fashionable to talk about poor people in this country. The reality is that those people on income support—the many parents who are struggling to bring up children on income support, people on disability support pensions and the like—get nothing out of this budget. Senator Kemp knows that, and that is why he would not answer the questions. Those people have been forgotten. They are the poorest people in Australia.
It appears that this government does have a habit of forgetting some of the poorest people in Australia. Senators will recall, despite protestations to the contrary, that on the occasion of the last budget, 80 per cent of Australian taxpayers missed out. At least now the government has got tax cuts going to 50 per cent of taxpayers. But the fact is that people with a disability, people on the parenting payment and parents on income support who are struggling to bring up children have been forgotten. Judging by some of the answers that Senator Kemp gave, perhaps they have been forgotten so much that Senator Kemp did not even know that they had been forgotten. Around two million Australians rely on income support and they do not really share in any of the real benefits provided in the budget.
What is perhaps worse is that this is the same group of people who will receive a substantial reduction in income support payments on 1 July, as Senator Evans outlined. We know from statistics that the type of family most likely to live in poverty in this country is a family headed by a single woman. That is the case. Those are the people who, as a result of last year’s budget, face a reduction in their income support payments on 1 July—at the same time as the rest of Australia receives from this budget very substantial tax benefits. We on this side of the parliament do want to make a point about the vulnerable and poorer people in the Australian community who are not going to share in the benefits that are provided in the budget.
I want to talk very briefly about some of the challenges that have been forgotten in this budget. There were four things which were not mentioned in the Treasurer’s speech: productivity, education, participation and the current account deficit. I want to talk about participation, because one of the answers given by Senator Kemp in relation to child care really demonstrated this government’s failure to grasp the challenge of participation.
There are three things that need to be addressed if we want to tackle participation in this country. The first is the disincentives in the taxation system through the effective marginal tax rate, the second is skills and the third is child care. The disincentives which are faced by people moving off welfare into work, the program which the government has in place, have not been substantially altered at all by this budget. There will be people with a disability or parents moving off welfare into work who will face effective marginal tax rates of 64c in the dollar. They will actually be paying more back to the government for the privilege of working than they will receive in their own pocket.
Perhaps one of the worst cons in this budget is the con on child care. We heard a great deal of fanfare prior to this budget that child care was going to be a priority and that parents were going to get some relief from the fact that child care is either not affordable or not accessible for too many families in this country. The fact is that this budget does not guarantee a single extra place, it does not take a single dollar off their bills, and it does not save a single minute for parents who drive children to and from child care. Uncapping the out-of-school-hours places in the context of the government already sitting on almost 100,000 unallocated child-care places is clearly not the sort of systemic change that parents in Australia were hoping for. The fact is, if you do not have a child-care system that is working, if you do not have a child-care system that is affordable and, perhaps more importantly, if you do not have a child-care system that is accessible, you are not going to deal with the participation challenges that our economy and our society face.

"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2006-05-10,"—I am happy to stand up today and comment on this motion. You have to feel a little bit sorry for the Australian Labor Party in these circumstances. Here they are, presented with a budget which has been extremely widely acknowledged and welcomed by the Australian community. The Labor Party’s job as politicians is to identify those people who might not be happy or who might not be considered to be winners with this budget, hunt those people down and advocate on their behalf. It is not a very easy job to do, because there are lots and lots of winners in the community today as a result of what Treasurer Peter Costello announced last night.
The Labor Party have got to push aside people like taxpayers and families who need support and pay taxes. They need to push aside those who are approaching retirement. They need to ignore those who use child care in our community. They need to ignore those who are physically ill. They need to ignore those who are mentally ill. They need to ignore those who drive cars. They need to ignore those who work in the private sector. They need to ignore those who live in rural and regional Australia. They need to plough through all these countless Australians—each of whom can clearly point to a benefit from this budget—and identify those who apparently are not winners this time around. When you look at it from that point of view, you see that it is so totally fatuous as to not be worth wasting the time of the Senate on.
The fact is that this budget is one of a succession of budgets delivered by this government which has looked at the fundamentals of Australian society and has, over the years, put money where it needs to go. We have put money into infrastructure. We have put money into reducing debt. We have put money into supporting the incomes of Australians on low incomes. If you look at the position of those Australians today compared with 10 years ago, you can see that they are infinitely better off as a result of what we have done.
We have lifted real wages. We have provided for stronger community services through better funding and greater support by the states through the GST. We have attended to all the fundamentals of Australian society. If there are individuals for whom no particular benefit can be identified in this budget, that is a short-sighted and narrow-minded approach. The fact is that, no matter what we had done in this budget, we would not have won using that philosophy. If we had not looked at that longstanding problem in Australian society of people on high tax rates paying higher amounts than people in comparable countries in the OECD are paying, we would have criticism from, among others, key figures in the ALP because we had not addressed that problem.
It was only last week, I think, that former Prime Minister Paul Keating criticised this government for not having faced the issue of high marginal tax rates before—and, incidentally, for issues like bracket creep. We had Mr Beazley, not that many years ago, making exactly the same point. We have addressed that in this budget, so where are the plaudits? If we were to spread the benefits of this budget across all income groups at all levels of society, those cuts would necessarily be spread very thin. What would we get then? A milkshake and hamburger type of comment from the opposition such as, ‘You’re spreading your largesse too thinly.’ Of course, if we had made substantial cuts to everybody’s income tax, we would have had more comments, but they would have been along the lines of: ‘You’re spending too much in this area. You’re outlaying far too much. Interest rates are going to go up.’
The fact of the matter is that this mob opposite is looking for any pretext to criticise this budget. We are providing the things that matter to Australians. Every Australian, including those on low incomes that you refer to, will benefit from the outlays on spending that this budget contains such as the extra spending on medical research, on road and rail infrastructure—poor people use roads and trains as well—and on child care. People like that use child-care services. Those things are important and they are provided for in this budget. This budget takes care of the fundamentals of Australia’s economic and social experience, and I am very proud to stand behind it. I think Australians have identified those facts, and they will also stand behind and support this budget when they see the benefits it brings them.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Budget 2006-07</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,7,1,speech
"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2006-05-10,"—I also rise to take note of answers on the budget. It seems that, when you claim a budget is for all, it is very difficult for anyone to accept even direct questions about how people will be affected by it. Amidst the hyperbole, it seems that it is impossible for people anywhere—but in particular for people on this side of the chamber—to ask any question about the budget without being accused by government members of quibbling, complaining or being desperate. Basically, we have had the delivery of the budget and we have heard that there are certain values in this budget that people do celebrate; indeed, last night various groups did say that there were things in this budget that they applauded. When that was done, instead of the government actually acknowledging that there is this common ground that this is a good thing, they are throwing back at us any kind of positive comment that people have made about the budget, claiming that these militate against any questions we might have about people who may not have received generous benefits or in fact any benefits from the budget.
I reject the allegation that there is desperation in questioning any government decision; that is our job. The questions that we have will emerge, as the different information comes forward, because all we have now is the original process and the inches of paper, as we all know, where we hope to find the details that back up the wide promises that have been made. In the questions we asked today—not attacks but simple direct questions about information we had—we looked at how different groups in our society would be affected by the decisions that have come out of the budget. We asked questions about the degree of payment that came out in various things, such as the utilities payments, which we talked about, and also about those groups of carers, groups that we all value and celebrate. When we specifically asked whether the benefits that were announced apply equally to all people who provide care, the minister, instead of responding to those direct questions, decided to turn the argument around and made the usual longstanding statement about how we are complaining and seeking to find the losers in the budget.
Minister, no-one is seeking to find losers in the budget. What we are trying to do is investigate the claim that has been made by the government, which is that it is a budget for all. If it is a budget for all, there should be expectations from all in the community that they will receive something out of the budget. Also, it should be open to all to investigate whether they have in fact been forgotten in this budget process. Increasingly, the government seems to reject any kind of questioning of its decisions.
On the issue of poverty, we know that when there was an inquiry into poverty in this country the government rejected the notion that there was poverty in the community. They rejected the majority report of the Senate Community Affairs Committee’s poverty inquiry and came back with pages of documentation from numerous government agencies on programs that had operated in the time since the inquiry had been completed. I am not quite sure how that was relevant to the investigations at the time of the inquiry. But the statement that there are people in our community who suffer disadvantage is not accepted by this government; it is rejected, and people who ask questions are in some way demonised for having the gall to question whether the hyperbole is in fact warranted.
There are people who are currently disadvantaged because of their income, particularly those who are in receipt of various payments through the social welfare system, and we need to know: where is the benefit to them from this particular budget? If it is not there, accept that and look at where we should go in the future. Don’t colour the argument by trying to attack those who are asking questions. Don’t try to divide the community by saying that asking whether one group is getting more out of this budget than another is somehow divisive. Either it is a fact or it is not. So, please, engage in the discussion. It is only through discussion that we will be able to effect real change.
There has been no attempt by people on this side of the chamber to devalue the good things that came out of this budget. However, we are not claiming that it is automatically a budget for all. That would seem to be an obvious response. But, if you make the claim, make sure you can stand by it, and do not attack those who are asking questions about it. Let us see what is in the budget for every single Australian. Let us see if every Australian will benefit. Don’t just throw stupid comments back at us—and I will respond in kind: it is not short sighted and narrow minded to ask questions; we actually see where the answers are. (Time expired)

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2006-05-10,"—The Student Assistance Legislation Amendment Bill 2005 legislates for something that has already been done—that is, the closure of the Student Financial Supplement Scheme, the SFSS. As honourable senators may be aware, the government first moved to close this scheme in 2003. The rationale that was offered at that point included a reduction in the number of people taking up the scheme and the level of debt as a consequence of taking up the scheme if you were a student.
I do not think the declining demand for the scheme should take anyone by surprise. As the Democrats consistently noted—in fact, from when this particular scheme began—the scheme was fraught with difficulty. It was first established in 1993. We found it a punitive and miserly measure that targeted vulnerable people in particular—that is, people from lower socioeconomic groups or rural and regional students; those who were already in financial straits. Without income support, those groups of people would have had little opportunity for pursuing further study, so it became an important crutch, if you like, for people who wanted to study and were therefore prepared to incur unreasonable levels of debt.
With the SFSS, students found themselves trading in $1 of their student income support for $2 of loan. The entitlement that was traded became part of the loan, leading to quick debt accumulation. Many students were not aware that they were actually trading their entitlement for a loan. A number of student representative groups, peak groups, in Australia rejoiced at the closure of the scheme because it unfairly penalised people already struggling with university costs, debts and, of course, university fees, and they felt that this was luring students to forgo income support to which they were entitled.
So the Democrats are not unhappy to see this scheme closed. When this was first announced in 2003, I was very up front about the fact that we did not think that this was an appropriate scheme and that it was not a fair one. Mind you, we were strongly arguing for other support measures to replace it. Nonetheless, my main concern was how we were going to look after the students who were already in the scheme—students who had those loans and required those loans for the duration of their degree.
The Democrats did not simply plan to introduce amendments, but, as I recall, I did introduce amendments. As I recall, I circulated amendments in this place in 2003. The intent of those amendments was to grandfather the students who were already in the scheme. As senators may be aware, the government saw the writing on the wall. Of course, this is pre the coalition-run Senate. That means that those of us on the crossbenches and in the non-government parties could have succeeded in passing the amendments to grandfather the students who were in that scheme. In fact, I remember having discussions with the Independents at the time, particularly Senator Harris, as I recall, who was also particularly keen to ensure the protection of the students and the families who were already affected by the loan scheme.
I am sure that many senators, like my office, had many phone calls, faxes, pleas, letters et cetera from families and individual students, pleading with us to ensure that this scheme, upon which they relied, would not be shut down. But the government saw the writing on the wall and decided to do what we are probably seeing a lot of these days, but, nonetheless, it still surprises me. In fact, the last time that I can recall it happening while I have had this portfolio, which is almost 11 years, was for the closure of NBEET, the National Board of Employment, Education and Training. Senators may remember how that was closed down in an administrative way—the board ceased to exist—before the legislation was passed.
So what did the government do this time? They closed it down administratively and now we are dealing with the legislation. I do not know whether it has escaped people’s notice but it is actually 2006 now—just a couple of years later. I am glad that the government have got around to it, because I was really looking forward to this democratic opportunity to debate, weigh up the methods and the process, and determine whether or not it is an appropriate thing to do. We lobbied the relevant minister. We made very clear to ministers, their advisers and others that we wanted to install a sunset clause in the legislation to protect the students in the scheme who, let us face it, effectively just had the rug pulled out from underneath them, but unfortunately that was to no avail. Although we recognised that the scheme was inequitable—I remember that one student financial adviser described it as ‘insufficient, mean and tricky’; that might be applied, too, to the process with which it was closed down—many students relied on the scheme to fund their study. To shut it down without offering anything in its place was a mean solution.
Senator Wong made reference to some of the statistics. They are pretty alarming, but they are worth putting on record so that government members understand what they did. In the last year of its operation, nearly 40,000 students applied for and accepted an SFSS loan. Many of those students were from traditionally disadvantaged groups, more than half were woman and 15.2 per cent were listed as recipients of the single parenting payment. Those are the types of people who were being disadvantaged by the sudden closure of the scheme, without any replacement, grandfathering or other forms of support.
The abolition of this scheme without the grandfathering of those already relying on it to facilitate their study had, I think, such a mean impact. It did affect the ability of some students to finish their degrees and courses. People told us that it put their study in complete doubt. So the bill now officially brings to a close a scheme that has already been ditched. Still we hear nothing about potential replacements for this measure. Look at the budget last night. Where is student income support? I should not be so naive as to even ask that question. In the last decade it has not been there. There has been nothing on student income support. It is bad enough that the skills shortage was not addressed and education was not really invested in. There was nothing for schools. Higher education—what a joke! As for raising the FEE-HELP cap—please—that is just more debt for students! There was no student income support, although we know that it is one of the key measures to facilitate participation in higher education for lower socioeconomic and other disadvantaged groups. This is just another example.
I think that student income support in this country is in an appalling state of neglect. That has been caused by successive governments, but at least the Labor Party in the nineties was trying to achieve some changes, albeit not enough. But the last decade has just been absolutely appalling. In fact, if senators are interested or if they have any doubts about the appalling state of neglect, just look at the Senate inquiry that the Democrats initiated—the first income support inquiry that looked solely at student income support. Look at some of the statistics contained in that Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee report and listen to the stories that students, advisers and others told. Probably we heard most of the extremes, whether it is students being forced to work in the sex industry or, as I heard at the committee hearing in Adelaide, students being used as guinea pigs for medical experiments in order to earn some money.
We listed the anomalies and punitive measures that actually exist within the current system, such as Austudy recipients not being eligible for rent assistance. This is one that still staggers me. Why on earth is it that if you are on the common youth allowance you can access it, but you cannot if you are on Austudy? When I have put this to people, including people high up in government, no-one has come up with a rationale. Even at the committee hearings, no-one gave me or the committee a convincing reason for it. I still hope that maybe in next year’s pre-election budget we might see some action on this. Another issue is the part-time postgraduate scholarships in relation to taxation.
It was reported that students who are single and over the age of 25 who are ineligible for rent assistance are eking out an existence on a payment that is effectively 49 per cent below the poverty line. Economic survival has usurped academic success as the main object of many students. The committee report says:
The result is that many students find themselves in a precarious financial situation, struggling to provide themselves with the basic necessities of life.
What does the government think—that living below the poverty line for students is somehow a rite of passage? Is it some sort of outdated romantic notion of students studying at university today—that it is about eking out an existence? Do they think that is what you have to do to earn your degree?
The vice-chancellors do not agree with that archaic image. The vice-chancellors—and, as I often remind people, they are not the most radical organisation—have been at the forefront of the arguments for reform of student income support in this country. They are worried about the statistics that show how many students are missing classes, tutorials, lectures and study time as they have to work to support themselves because of the lack of income support, the paltry amount of income support and the inaccessibility of income support in Australia today. Many students are spending hours off campus working in part-time jobs. The committee found:
They are working longer hours than before to the detriment of their studies and their overall experience of university.
I would add that the National Union of Students recently found that almost one-third of part-time students work more than 16 hours per week. It condemned the state of student income support under the current government. The report goes on to say:
The committee believes the financial situation of many students under the policies of the Howard Government is grim, and that the evidence presented to the committee during the inquiry shows that it has deteriorated even further over the past few years.
In addition, the potential impact of the introduction of so-called voluntary student unionism is going to have a hugely deleterious effect. What did we see in the budget last night? We saw the cheap, sell-out, transitional fund—$81 million or whatever it is. Well done, Family First! That is great. That is putting families first. What a cheap sell-out! I think there was also a $10 million scheme for small businesses to encourage them to set up on regional campuses that may be adversely affected by the impact of voluntary student unionism. Mr Acting Deputy President, I misled the Senate. Remember, that transitional fund relates mostly to sporting and recreational facilities on campus. It is not about other issues. So students are in for it yet again. I start to think it is about a rite of passage now. I do not believe that those government ministers who got their education publicly funded necessarily believe that that is what the next generation should have or deserves.
Severe rules on eligibility for student income support have prevented many students from accessing it at all. The inquiry found that the parental income test threshold is too low. It is not keeping pace with wage increases and, indeed, the cost of living. This valuable report comprehensively and thoroughly examined the sector. It examined the issues, particularly the shortcomings of student income support. Despite the fact that the government had representatives on the committee who concurred with the recommendations—remember, there was a majority signing-off on these recommendations—and despite the fact that the government members signed off on the recommendation that rent assistance be extended to Austudy recipients, the government has done nothing. The committee recommended that a costing on this measure should be undertaken and completed before the end of 2005. Well, we missed that deadline. Then again, if you look at the rate of progress, it has only taken 2½ years to close down a scheme that has already been closed down. Maybe we are working in dog years.
—No, they have the numbers!
—They have the numbers now, says Senator Wong. It is true. But, even with the numbers, is there any consideration left for process and convention in this place? My goodness! In the last round of estimates I asked the government what they were doing about the inquiry recommendations, only to be met with pretty much a non-response. What a difference extending rent assistance to Austudy recipients would make! A recent study found that more than half the part-time students surveyed would prefer to be in full-time study if their finances permitted, and a third believe a lack of government support is preventing them from studying full time. The study also revealed that part-time students were more likely to come from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and tended to have attended public schools. Current measures of student income support are clearly inadequate to overcome seemingly more entrenched inequities in the higher education sector.
I remember, back in 1990, that the then education minister published A fair chance for all, as part of an overview of the higher education sector. It contained the principle:
The overall objective for equity in higher education is to ensure that Australians from all groups in society have the opportunity to participate successfully in higher education.
Well, let us look at the participation rates in the last decade. Equity groups have seen a decline in their participation rates. They have either declined or remained stagnant. For example, participation of students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds has fallen slightly, as has that of Indigenous Australians. That is understandable given the many cuts that have taken place, particularly to Abstudy since 2000. So much for this equity. Higher education has endured a barrage of attacks, funding cuts, cost shifting and cost increases. Everyone knows the litany of what has happened to education funding and support.
The National Union of Students released a report this year on the past 10 years in higher education, which contained a number of concerning findings. Accumulated HECS debts have risen from $3.9 billion to $13.2 billion during the decade. I mean, this is huge. The average student contribution to university operating costs increased from 14 per cent to 42 per cent, while the Commonwealth’s contribution has decreased from 61 per cent to 41 per cent. The student to staff ratios have increased from 15.6 to 20.7.
So, while this bill does very little that has not been already achieved administratively, it does once again highlight these issues and the government’s response to them, particularly to student income support. This bill contains, as has been acknowledged in the previous contribution, a potentially risky subsection that requires clarification. The proposed subsection 48(2) seeks:
... to eliminate the need to make new regulations whenever the Guide to Commonwealth Government Payments is altered.
However, this subsection may have the unintended effect of limiting the parliamentary scrutiny of changes to guidelines for Abstudy and the Assistance for Isolated Children schemes. Of issue here is the proposed new subsection 48(2), which relates to notifying Centrelink of a change in circumstances, for instance a change of course enrolment. It has been pointed out that the proposed change is unclear whether the term ‘notifying’ includes or excludes prescribed events, where ‘prescribed events’ refers to the reasons for notifying Centrelink, such as a change in circumstances. If ‘notifying’ does include prescribed events, then DEST may have the power to prescribe when, under which circumstances and how a person notifies Centrelink of a change of details. If ‘notifying’ does not include prescribed events, it is restricted to how a person may notify Centrelink. So there is concern that the department can change when or under what circumstances a person must notify Centrelink without this decision being subject to parliamentary scrutiny.
Given the possible punishment for those failing to meet these obligation—up to one year in prison—it is imperative that ‘prescribed events’ cannot be changed without parliamentary scrutiny. I notice that the government was concerned enough about this clause to issue a replacement explanatory memorandum to shed light on what the subsection does and does not do. However, the bill itself has not been changed to this effect. Unlike the actual legislation, the explanatory memorandum and the clarification made in it is not binding. So we believe the clarification should be included in the bill to make this explicit.
I understand that Senator Wong made a similar comment, and I note the amendment which she has circulated. I draw the Senate’s and the Labor Party’s attention to an amendment, which they may be aware of, which I circulated in this place on 2 March 2006, which seeks to do the same thing. I think we are both after the same objective. I have not worded my amendment—on behalf of the Democrats—the same as the Labor Party amendment because the advice that we received after initially considering drafting it in the same format was that it was still ambiguous and that this was the better way to draft it. Having said that, we can probably read the numbers. I am not confident that either one will be successful. We considered drafting it in a similar fashion but we had advice, mulled over it for a long period of time and decided that this is the amendment that we are proceeding with today. But I think we are pretty keen to achieve exactly the same outcome, and there may be some on the coalition side who have similar views—yes, crazy—about process, parliamentary scrutiny and clarifying things that may actually need clarification in law. I do not know—call me crazy, but we will see—if anyone will actually consider that. Nonetheless, this legislation will of course be passed. It is a travesty that it has taken this long. It is appalling how undemocratic the process has been. For it to take from 2003 to 2006 is pretty pathetic. We are moving an amendment; I foreshadow the amendment moved in my name on behalf of the Democrats to at least try and clarify what could be quite a deleterious aspect of this bill.",SENATE,<title>STUDENT ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,26,1,speech
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2006-05-10,"—I would like to thank senators for their contributions, and there are a few points I think should be put on record. Senator Wong has apparently stated for the Labor Party that the most important issue is to ensure parliamentary oversight of eligibility and access criteria for student assistance. In response to that, it is important to say that the government has continued commitment to student income support. However, in this case, the concerns she has raised about this bill are based on a misunderstanding. The only instrument or other writing in question here is A guide to Australian Government payments. It sets out a statement of benefits and basic eligibility criteria. However, this instrument merely reflects details which are set out in the regulations. It is published quarterly for the information of the Australian public.
At present, every time A guide to Australian Government payments changes the department is required to amend regulation 5 in part 2 of the Student Assistance Regulations 2003. The current reference to the guide in those regulations is 20 September 2004. Right now, the reference is wrong and out of date. The current guide to Australian government payments—the one that applies to the Australian public—is in fact dated 20 March 2006 to 30 June 2006. Rather than amending the regulations every time a new version of A guide to Australian Government payments is issued, which is every quarter, the department seeks the flexibility to refer to any instrument or other writing as ‘in force or existing from time to time’ to save the requirement of this quarterly regulation change. That is the whole purpose of the government’s amendment: to avoid the obligation to amend the regulations every three months. You can clearly see that this obligation is now not fulfilled as punctually as required and this can therefore mislead the public as to the correct version of the guide in operation.
The purpose of the government’s amendment is not to hide new eligibility or access criteria. The government’s amendment has no impact on parliamentary scrutiny. As indicated clearly in the revised explanatory memoranda, prescribed events are all set out in the regulations. That is the principal purpose of the regulations and it is clear that there is no intention to depart from those arrangements—none at all. The government’s amendment is intended to avoid wasting departmental time and avoid any prospect of misleading the Australian public as to the most up-to-date version of the guide.
Labor’s amendment does not provide any assistance to the department; on the contrary, if it were accepted, Labor’s amendment would require the department to make a whole new second set of regulations. One set would relate to the procedures for notifying the department of a change of circumstances, which could refer to the other documents, like A guide to Australian Government payments, and a second set of regulations, which could refer to eligibility criteria and prescribed events. Quite the opposite of making it easier and simpler, it would get worse. There is no gain here for the Labor Party. There is no additional scrutiny of eligibility criteria and prescribed events. As is the case now, eligibility criteria and prescribed events would be set out in the student assistance regulations. There is no gain to the department, which wishes not to have to amend the regulation every three months. There is no gain for the public, who can be and are being misled by the reference to an old version of A guide to Australian Government payments.
The Australian Democrats amendment is similarly misdirected. Again, they do nothing to assist the waste of departmental time in amending the regulations every three months. Instead, they require that there be a second set of regulations. In this case, one set can relate to anything but prescribed events and can refer to or adopt other instruments or documents. Another set can relate to prescribed events. There is no gain for the Australian Democrats and, for the sake of clarity, let me go through it again. There is no additional scrutiny of eligibility criteria and prescribed events. As is the case now, the specific eligibility criteria and prescribed events would be set out in the regulations. There is no gain for the department because it still has the three-monthly problem and there is no gain for the public, who are currently being misled. It is just bureaucratic time wasting. We therefore do not accept either the Labor or Democrats amendments to the bill.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2006-05-10,"—Am I correct in understanding that we are dealing with these bills concurrently?
 (Senator Lightfoot)—Yes.
—Thank you. Firstly, I will comment on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Trustee Board and Other Measures) Bill 2006. This is a bill to consolidate and revise the governance arrangements for the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme, commonly known as CSS, the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme, PSS, and the Public Sector Superannuation Accumulation Plan, commonly known as PSSAP, with effect from 1 July 2006. The bill’s introduction is in response to the Review of the Corporate Governance of Statutory Authorities and Office Holders, commonly known as the Uhrig review, which reported in mid-2002.
The Uhrig review was appointed to review the governance practices of statutory authorities and office holders. Of particular interest to the review were those agencies which impact on the business community. The objective of the review was to identify issues in relation to existing governance arrangements and to provide policy options for government to gain the best from statutory authorities and office holders and their accountability framework. The review found the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 should be applied to statutory authorities and recommended that these organisations should be governed by a CEO. The review also found the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 should be applied to statutory authorities and these organisations should be governed by a board. In general, agencies which exclusively manage Commonwealth appropriations should be represented and governed by a CEO, and a board structure is favoured if there is a strong commercial focus to the organisation or if the agency is intergovernmental.
The main recommendation of the Uhrig review was on the optimal size of a statutory authority board. The review recommended a public sector board size of between six and nine members. Currently, the boards overseeing the Commonwealth superannuation schemes are of different sizes: the CSS board has seven members, the PSS board has five members and the PSS board is responsible for the operation of the PSSAP. Following the release of the Uhrig report, the Department of Finance and Administration recommended that the PSS board be increased from five to seven and consideration be given to the establishment of a single board for the CSS, the PSS and PSSAP. So the proposed merger of the CSS and PSS boards has several advantages, including reducing complexity, simplifying administration and bringing the Commonwealth superannuation investments into line with best practice principles identified in the Uhrig review.
Concerns were raised in relation to the assets of the three schemes being joined together and managed as one trust, but the government has given assurances that despite the merger of the boards the management of the funds will continue as separate investment trust organisations. It is important that the investment management of the three schemes are separately managed as the profiles and the rates at which members of the varying schemes retire result in different needs for the different schemes. There has been consultation in respect of the members of the boards. In fact, I think that there is some overlapping membership of some members of the boards at the present time. It is good efficient management practice, in Labor’s view. The bill has no financial implications and we do not regard it as controversial, and Labor will support the change.
Turning now to the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 2004, the purpose of the bill is to amend the Superannuation Act 1976—the CSS act—in respect of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme and the rules of the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme, the PSS, in relation to the superannuation salary for departmental secretaries and certain other statutory office holders who are members of the CSS and PSS. The bill was originally introduced into the House of Representatives on 11 August 2004 but lapsed when parliament was prorogued for the general election. The bill as reintroduced is substantially similar to the lapsed bill. However, it now extends all determinations made under the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973.
A condition of employment for the majority of employees of the Commonwealth government is membership of the Commonwealth superannuation schemes. Employees of the Commonwealth other than Defence Force personnel are either members of the CSS—closed to new members from 1 July 1990—or the PSS. The defined benefit at least is closed to new members. These schemes are generous to their members by community standards. They are defined benefit by formula as part of the PSS trust deed and the relevant legislation governing the CSS. The formulas are dependent on the length of service of members, a salary component for the CSS final salary, and for the PSS, final average salary based on the average of their salary at the three previous birthdays and the reason for ceasing their Commonwealth employment—for example, retirement, resignation, involuntary redundancy or invalidity.
Generally for the CSS the annual rate of salary used to calculate a member’s benefit is defined in subsection 5(2) of the Superannuation Act 1976. The annual rate of salary is used to determine the contributions made to the CSS by members and some of the types of benefits a member is entitled to, including when they retire from the workforce. Subsection 5(1) in the 1976 act defines salary for the definition of annual rate of salary as:
... salary means salary or wages and includes any allowance, or the value of any allowance, or any fee, that is an allowance or fee of a kind that, under the regulations, is to be treated as salary for the purposes of this Act, but does not include any part of any salary or wages that, under the regulations, is not to be treated as salary for the purposes of this Act.
For the PSS a member’s benefit is determined in accordance with the PSS rules. A member’s average salary is calculated using a member’s basic salary and recognised allowances. Both schemes—the CSS and the PSS—allow the superannuation salary for some Australian government office holders to be determined by the Remuneration Tribunal. The purpose of this bill is to provide the superannuation salary and the use of the remuneration of secretaries and certain Australian government office holders as made by determinations of ministers and presiding officers of the parliamentary departments. Labor does not regard this bill as controversial and it also has our support.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TRUSTEE BOARD AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-05-10,"—Before I commence my remarks on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Trustee Board and Other Measures) Bill 2006 and the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 2004, which are being dealt with cognately here, I do want to ask the Senate to accept the withdrawal of amendment 4425 circulated under former Senator Greig’s name many months ago. I do not know whether that is necessary—
 (Senator Lightfoot)—It is not necessary, Senator Murray, thank you.
—Thank you. The Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Trustee Board and Other Measures) Bill 2006 contains two schedules which implement a number of recommendations of the Review of corporate governance of statutory authorities and office holders, otherwise known as the Uhrig report. Specifically, the intent behind this bill is to consolidate the governance arrangements for civilian public sector employee superannuation schemes. This includes funds managed through the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme and controlled by the CSS board, funds managed through the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme and controlled by the PSS board and funds managed through the Public Sector Accumulation Plan that is also controlled by the PSS board. As the Bills Digest correctly says in its concluding comments:
The main provisions of the bill will lead to streamlined administration of the Commonwealth’s civilian superannuation schemes. As the intention of the bill is for these schemes’ assets to continue to be managed separately, in the light of the unique characteristics of each scheme, there will be little impact upon the members’ account balances.
The bill proposes abolishing the CSS board and incorporating the trusteeship of the CSS into the PSS board, which also governs the PSSAP, and renaming the single entity as the Australian Reward Investment Alliance. Additionally, the bill proposes increasing the number of directors on the PSS board by two to seven, with the two new positions to be filled by the remaining two CSS board members not already represented on the PSS board.
As I have stated, the provisions in this bill are in response to the recommendations of the Uhrig report, which, among other things, recommended increasing the number of directors on public boards to between six and nine members and the establishment of a single board for the CSS, PSS and PSSAP. These proposals require a number of changes to legislation, consequential and otherwise, including amendments to the Superannuation Acts 1976, 1990 and 2005 and amendments to the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Superannuation Safety and Other Measures) Bill 2005.
The amendments contained in this bill should be supported as a step in the right direction towards better governance standards. However, the step can also be described as a shuffle, for in reality these changes do little more than streamline some of the bureaucratic structures seen throughout the civil service, rather than implement new, improved or innovative changes in corporate governance. While I agree that a single board should rightly oversee the activities of the CSS, PSS and PSSAP, to all intents and purposes this is already the case, since all five members of the CSS board are also members of the PSS and PSSAP boards. Moreover, all three funds also share the same chief executive officer. In fact, the only discernible difference is that the CSS board has an additional two members, and this bill proposes that those two members be included in the unitary board for all three funds. Thus, a more accurate description of the government’s proposed advancement of governance ideals is the inclusion of an additional two board members on the PSS board—a provision already in place for the CSS board. Is that an achievement? I suppose it is.
Will this change make any material difference to the present governance of the three funds? I doubt it. The Democrats and I have long sought to implement real and effective change in the governance principles for public boards. One such example is my proposal for specific principles and criteria for appointments to public boards, authorities and agencies. In stark contrast to the government’s, these proposals are examples of tangible governance improvements. They address pressing issues of independence and appointments on merit and, if implemented, they would undoubtedly improve the governance standards of public boards as they currently exist.
An area that this bill does address is a streamlining of the two governance boards. On this basis there are obvious efficiency gains, since both boards share the same membership but have separate costs. I wonder, though, how this new single board structure will manage the legal discrepancies and inconsistencies that currently exist between each fund. One such inconsistency is the varied treatment of same-sex partnership rights and obligations for each fund. Will board members be able to put their PSSAP hat on and say, ‘Hold on; that’s sexual discrimination,’ and then put their CSS or PSS hat on and say, ‘Homosexuals shouldn’t receive the same superannuation rights as heterosexuals’? Discrepancies such as this do exist between each fund. For example, consider the ridiculous state of affairs that exists for public sector employees who are members of the PSSAP. According to correspondence received from Senator Minchin, all new employees who commenced employment on or after 1 July 2005 who are members of the scheme and who are in a same-sex partnership may be entitled to death benefits—that is, no retrospective application exists for the PSSAP. Likewise, these rules also do not apply to CSS and PSS members.
For a minister who is lauding his and his government’s efforts in addressing inconsistencies within these three funds, the situation remains a farcical one. To withhold retrospective and comprehensive application of interdependency relationship rights to all public sector employees is by definition discriminatory. In effect, the minister is asserting that the only legitimate interdependent relationships that exist are those of new members who began employment on or after 1 July 2005. For all other same-sex partners the partnership arrangement remains illegitimate from a superannuation point of view. There is no ethical, legal or financial reason why one group of public sector employees should be treated differently from another on the basis of differing partnership arrangements under differing superannuation arrangements. This is the stimulus for the amendment to the bill that I will move later—to yet again seek to rectify a gross inequality that the government has previously committed itself to address.
For several years now, the Democrats have sought often—but not always in vain, I should acknowledge—to amend superannuation legislation to harmonise the treatment of the variety of partnerships and relationships that exist in Australia. On this point the Prime Minister apparently agrees with us. He recently stated:
... I am strongly in favour—as my Government has demonstrated—strongly in favour of removing any property and other discrimination that exists against people who have same-sex relationships.
Why, then, does the Minister for Finance and Administration, Senator Minchin, still fail to correct the disparities which exist? Why do we have a situation whereby some public sector employees in same-sex relationships benefit from the rights accorded to them by this government, through the acknowledgment of an interdependency relationship, while others are not yet afforded this right? I know this is a matter which concerns many members of the coalition. I put it to Senator Minchin and the government once again, for the record, that they need to act to rectify the inconsistent treatment of superannuation for interdependent partnerships.
One final issue I will be seeking clarification from the minister on is that there is no intention by the government to streamline the funds under management in line with a single board structure. In making that remark I must comment favourably on the very cooperative and helpful stance adopted by the minister, through his office and his advisers. That is an extremely important issue for members of the PSS and PSSAP funds, since the CSS is a closed defined benefit fund and pooling the trust assets under management by the single board could in effect lead to a dilution of equity away from PSS and PSSAP members to CSS members. I support the proposed legislative changes contained within the bill but I will be moving amendments which I hope the government will see its way to support. All Australians, not just heterosexual Australians, deserve the peace of mind of knowing that their hard-earned retirement savings are being managed on a consistent and common basis within a secure superannuation system.
The Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 2004, the second bill we are considering here, amends the Superannuation Act 1976, which addresses the provisions for superannuation salary for secretaries of departments and certain persons who are appointed to Australian government offices and are members of either the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme or the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme. The bill contains two schedules. Schedule 1 more accurately defines salary for superannuation purposes. It also extends the authority to determine superannuation benefits for secretaries and other office holders—currently an authority held only by the Remuneration Tribunal—to ministers and presiding officers of parliamentary departments. Schedule 2 amends the administrative rules of the PSS to allow for schedule 1.
This bill clearly defines salary for the purposes of ascertaining applicable superannuation benefits. This is important to avoid a potential windfall in favour of an individual, which was not the original intent of the legislation. By providing legal authority it also protects recipients against challenges to the validity of such payments, including payments and arrangements informally made in the past. The bill does not increase public servants’ remuneration, nor does it decrease the entitlements of office holders, but it does increase the power of ministers and presiding officers of parliamentary departments, we think in an appropriate manner.
There is another matter that pertains to superannuation that I would like to raise today. In a Perth Sunday Times article on 30 April 2006, senior radio, TV and press journalist, Liam Bartlett, wrote an article entitled ‘Shame—it’s not super news for all’. He wrote that last year alone the Australian Taxation Office raised no less than $270 million from employers who had, for one reason or another, failed to cough up their workers’ proper superannuation entitlements. Mr Bartlett gave some specific examples. No doubt he also had in his mind the saga of a former Western Australian Labor minister who has been the subject of recent media comment for allegedly failing to pay superannuation on time to workers in his business.
Mr Bartlett identified a number of problems. Firstly, that the ATO admits to limited resources for chasing nonpayments; secondly, that the ATO admits that getting the number of complaints through the system takes at least three months to process; and, thirdly, the ATO admits employers simply stonewall their efforts. Liam Bartlett was rightly enraged and rightly suspects that the number of rogue, crooked and opportunistic employers either not paying or underpaying workers’ superannuation entitlements is very high. It is theft—nothing more and nothing less. These crooks are probably the same wonderful business men and women who the government thinks will deal with their employees fairly when it comes to hiring and firing. This is not just a problem for workers; it is also a problem for future taxpayers and future governments, because every dollar of superannuation guarantee that is not paid or is underpaid is a dollar that taxpayers will later have to pay to help look after those workers in their old age.
Most Australians would be shocked to learn that their superannuation guarantee payments, compulsory payments that must be paid by an employer to an employee’s nominated superannuation fund, are threatened by a lack of supervision and auditing by government agencies. More shocking still will be the news that this can occur so simply and that it could indeed be widespread. We simply do not know the scale of the problem, because auditing in this area is so poor.
In his article, Mr Liam Bartlett made two proposals: to include the declaration of an employer’s payment of their superannuation guarantee payments in their quarterly business activity statement and to reintroduce the quarterly employers advice to their individual employees regarding an employer’s superannuation guarantee payments made on behalf of that employee. The key question is whether the adoption of either or both of these proposals would raise the level of employers’ compliance with their obligation to make the relevant superannuation guarantee payments.
Taxpayers who are registered for the goods and services tax must report their periodic tax obligations and entitlements to the ATO on a single tax compliance form, known as the business activity statement or BAS. There is a separate form, an instalment activity statement, for taxpayers who are not registered for the GST. The following obligations and entitlements are reported on the BAS: GST; wine equalisation tax; luxury car tax; PAYG amounts withheld from payment; PAYG instalments; FBT, fringe benefits tax, instalments; and deferred company instalments. Would the inclusion of superannuation guarantee payments on the BAS ensure that these payments are made?
It would be a relatively simple matter for the BAS to include the obligation to report all superannuation guarantee payments made. However, such an obligation most likely could not separately identify the particular guarantee payments made in respect of individuals or the obligations incurred in respect of those individuals. Further, the arrangements for ensuring compliance with the reporting obligations for the BAS appear to be relatively light compared with the existing penalties on an employer, where the ATO actually enforces those rules, for not meeting their superannuation guarantee payments. So, again—as is frequently the case in Australia—the problem is not the penalty; it is the detection and enforcement of the matter concerned.
The requirement for an employer to pay superannuation guarantee payments on behalf of employees arises under the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992. If the employer does not make the required guarantee payments on behalf of the employees by the due date—which is 28 days after the end of the relevant calendar year quarter—they are liable to pay the charge. That charge is made up of several components. There is an administration fee of $20 for each employee for whom there has been an underpayment or late payment of contributions plus nine per cent of the salary and wages of each employee for whom an underpayment or late payment is made. Actual salary and wages are the basis of the calculation of the penalty, rather than the generally lower ordinary time earnings or notional earnings base normally used as the basis for calculating the employer’s guarantee obligations. There is also a 10 per cent per annum interest rate calculated from the start of the relevant quarter, rather than from the date the contribution should have been made. The above penalties are not tax deductible to the employer, whereas the superannuation contributions made on or before the due date would have been. The first three penalties, individually known as the superannuation guarantee shortfalls, are automatic and apply even if the contributions are made shortly after the due date. Together with penalties for not keeping proper records, the first three of the penalties listed above make up the charge.
I have spent some time outlining that to indicate that the penalties are strict and powerful, but the auditing and enforcement are not. It is the self-assessment nature of an employer’s compliance with the superannuation guarantee scheme that is its essential weakness. An employer’s noncompliance may well be discovered if that employer is subject to an ATO audit. However, such audits are infrequent and unlikely and therefore many employers decide that the risk of facing the above penalties for noncompliance with their superannuation guarantee obligations is small and the financial benefit of such noncompliance is great. So the problem is audit and enforcement.
The obligation of employers to report to employees on the amount of their superannuation guarantee contributions was contained in section 23A of the SGAA. The provision was inserted into that act by the Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Act 2002 and became effective on 1 July 2003. It was removed by the Tax Laws Amendment (Superannuation Reporting) Act 2004. The Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia strongly opposed that repeal; the Investment and Financial Services Association also believed Australians should know where their super is paid and be in control of that process; the Australian Consumers Association was concerned about the reduction of the flow of information to the employee; and the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees considered the proposed removal of the reporting requirement to be regrettable and retrograde.
The main argument against the repeal of section 23A of the SGAA was that it lessens the flow of timely information to members and thereby reduces the opportunity for appropriate action to enforce compliance with the requirements of that act by the member or the ATO. Further, it is argued that this reduced flow of information will increase public disengagement from superannuation and lead to a greater amount of superannuation being placed in the lost category, especially for casual employees.
Mr Bartlett’s article noted that the ATO was aware of 12,000 official complaints regarding unpaid superannuation contributions. A case study featured in the article highlighted the length of time and apparent ineffectiveness of the ATO’s activity in following up these complaints. Any restoration of quarterly reporting by employers to employees of superannuation contributions made on their behalf would only increase the number of outstanding complaints. Of itself, this would not achieve higher employer compliance with their superannuation obligations. This would only come about if the ATO were given additional resources to follow up the increasing number of outstanding complaints about unpaid superannuation contributions and if it were given the additional resources to do the audit and enforcement that are necessary. If the coalition really had the interests of the battlers in mind, that would have been announced in the budget yesterday, and it was not. I think that is regrettable. But it is a matter the coalition can address and it is a matter they can deal with.
The situation arises because of the voluntary nature of reporting superannuation guarantee payment errors or deliberate underpayment or nonpayment and the fact that it is very hard to chase these up and to find out about them. The government must do something to secure the superannuation rights of employees. In my opinion, section 23A of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992, which was abolished on 1 July 2005, should be reinstated and there should be regulation forcing employers to report their superannuation payments to the ATO. But if the government does not want to do that, it should investigate a bounty system whereby the super funds would be licensed to audit employer contributions where there is a suspected breach and be paid a bounty for every crooked employer caught out. The government must act and must find a means to ensure that the superannuation entitlements of Australians are properly paid on time by all employers.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TRUSTEE BOARD AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2006-05-10,"—The Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Trustee Board and Other Measures) Bill 2006 will consolidate and revise the government’s arrangements for the superannuation schemes for Australian government employees with effect from 1 July 2006. From that date, the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme, the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme and the Public Sector Superannuation Accumulation Plan will be managed by a single board, to be named the Australian Reward Investment Alliance. This will replace the governance arrangements where the CSS board manages the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme, while the smaller PSS board manages both the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme and the Public Sector Superannuation Accumulation Plan.
The consolidation of the governance arrangements for these schemes is consistent with the governance principles of the review of the corporate governance of statutory authorities and officeholders that was undertaken by Mr John Uhrig AC. This includes providing that the Australian Reward Investment Alliance will comprise seven members, consistent with the Uhrig principle that boards should comprise between six and nine members. The consolidation of the governance arrangements for the three schemes under one board will provide significant opportunities for efficiencies in the management of the schemes. It will also offer an opportunity for the new board to adopt one investment mechanism for the ongoing management and investment of the three funds. This is particularly significant for the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme, which has been closed to new members since 1990 and has a decreasing contribution base.
The changes to be made by the bill are supported by the CSS and PSS boards because the changes will allow for more effective administration of the three schemes and the investment of their funds. This will strengthen their ability to focus on the needs of the members of the schemes. Senator Murray raised the matter of funds under management for the three schemes. I should point out that the responsibility for the management of the funds under these schemes lies with the trustee board, not the government. However, I can confirm that separate funds will be maintained for the three schemes.
The Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 2004 proposes amendments to the Superannuation Act 1976 in respect of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme, the CSS, and rules for the administration of the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme, the PSS. The purpose of the bill is to make specific provision for the superannuation salary of departmental secretaries and certain Australian government officeholders who are members of the CSS or the PSS. For most scheme members, superannuation salary is provided for in the rules of the relevant superannuation scheme, although where the Remuneration Tribunal determines an officeholder’s remuneration it is also authorised to determine superannuation salary.
The amendments included in the bill are designed to allow superannuation salary to be set in a broader range of determinations made by ministers and the Presiding Officers of the Senate and the House of Representatives, as well as all determinations made under the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973. The bill also validates some past determinations of superannuation salary that were not authorised by the scheme rules when made, while also ensuring that no benefit that has been paid or is continuing to be paid will be reduced because of the amendments in the bill. I commend the bills to the Senate.
Question agreed to.

"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2006-05-10,"—The Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Amendment (Maritime Security Guards and Other Measures) Bill 2005 [2006] amends the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003 to clarify and define the role of maritime security guards. This bill gives maritime security guards additional powers necessary for improving the security regime on and around vessels and ports. This includes, firstly, empowering a maritime security guard—
Government senators interjecting—
 (Senator Murray)—Order! Sorry, Senator O’Brien. Senators, would you please either resume your seats or move outside to converse.
—As I was saying, firstly, the bill empowers a maritime security guard to request that a person found within a maritime security zone provide identification and a reason for being in the zone. Secondly, it empowers a maritime security guard to request that an unauthorised person in a maritime security zone move out of that zone and, if that request is not complied with, to remove the person from the zone. Thirdly, it empowers a maritime security guard to remove or have removed unauthorised vehicles and vessels found in maritime security zones. The Australian Labor Party supports this bill. It is important that the exercise of these powers, however, is balanced with safeguards. Accordingly, the bill requires maritime security guards to identify themselves when confronting a person to exercise their authority. They must advise the person of their authority and tell the person that noncompliance is an offence. When removing a person from a maritime security zone, a maritime security guard may not use greater force or subject the person to greater indignity than is necessary and, in removing a vehicle or vessel, a guard must not cause unreasonable damage and must notify the owner.
The operation of this bill relies upon regulations. Typically, the government did not provide draft regulations to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee for its consideration when it examined this bill. As I have noted before, this has been an ongoing issue with legislation before this committee. It is unreasonable to expect the Australian parliament to pass important legislation with no reference to regulations. It was therefore difficult for the committee to assess legislation in isolation from the regulations. For example, regulations will be critical to the removal, storage and disposal of vehicles and vessels from maritime security zones. These regulations need to be developed in consultation with industry, with unions and with state governments. The successful day-to-day work of maritime security guards will be heavily influenced by the standard of training they undertake. Evidence presented to the Senate committee suggests that the current mandatory qualification level for maritime security guards is not sufficient. The qualification standard and training regime should be developed as a matter of priority in consultation with industry, unions and state governments, and should allow for portability of qualifications between jurisdictions.
While Labor welcome this bill, we remain critical of the Howard government’s failure to adequately address the issue of maritime security. Hundreds of thousands of apparently empty cargo containers are shipped into Australian ports without being screened and in some cases, as is the case in Sydney, stored adjacent to a major international airport. What is worse, 90 per cent of containers are still not X-rayed or inspected. The careless and widespread use of single and continuing voyage permits with foreign vessels and foreign crew who do not undergo appropriate security checks is also a huge problem. The use of these permits becomes more serious when foreign flag of convenience ships carry dangerous goods in Australian waters. These crews do not have their crew security vetted.
I asked a question of the Minister for Transport and Regional Services on 27 February this year about the foreign vessels which are granted permits under Australian laws for single and continuing voyage purposes. I asked which of those ships carry ammonium nitrate, and I was given the information that one of the ships in the period I requested since 1 September last year carried ammonium nitrate but that it was too hard—or perhaps the department might not even have the information, from all I can tell from the answer—to identify which ships were carrying high-consequence dangerous goods, as identified in UN model regulations. The minister believed it was too hard to supply that information. If the information is not clearly available, one wonders how our maritime security task can be adequately conducted, with vessels carrying crews who are not properly security checked visiting our ports in circumstances where perhaps the nature of the cargo is not fully known. Certainly, if the government is not prepared to supply that to the parliament, how can the parliament know the nature of the problem that we are trying to remedy with the legislation the government is putting before the parliament?
I make the point that if we are to properly assess the government’s legislation then the government should be prepared to properly answer questions put to the executive about the nature of the cargoes carried in these foreign vessels with crews that are not properly security checked, so we can understand the nature of the problem. Because of the nature of the checks on foreign crews—and I understand that 200,000 foreign seamen come into Australian ports each year—it is a major problem, and the Howard government does appear to be lax in this area.
In September last year I joined Labor’s homeland security spokesperson, Mr Arch Bevis, in putting the spotlight on a particular flag of convenience vessel, the Thor Hawk, which travelled between Newcastle and Gladstone carrying more than 1,000 tonnes of ammonium nitrate. Ammonium nitrate has been the explosive of choice for some terrorists. It was clear that the minister for transport had no idea that this unsafe foreign ship had been in Australian waters carrying such a dangerous cargo. The government was forced to acknowledge that its background checking of the crews is done simply by checking the names of the crew supplied to the government by the ship’s master. But the Howard government has no way of being sure that the names provided match the real identities of the crew members concerned on the ships coming into Australian ports.
In the case of this voyage of the Thor Hawk, the threat to the Australian people was more from the unseaworthy state of the vessel and ineffective inspection by the minister’s department than from terrorist intent. When the potentially explosive ammonium nitrate was being loaded in Newcastle, the crane broke and this volatile cargo fell into the ship’s hatch and, by the nature of the fall, endangered the lives of seamen working on the vessel. This is despite the fact that the vessel was inspected three times by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority during its presence in Australia. No action was taken until the ship arrived in its last Australian port. It will not always be the case that unseaworthiness is the main danger. A dedicated single national security command structure under a homeland security department is long overdue. Despite the government’s endless talk, in its arrogance it continues to resist the adoption of best practice in national security reform.
What should the parliament do in these circumstances? Labor believes that the Senate should condemn the government for its failure to provide necessary maritime security and protect Australians, including its careless and widespread use of single and continuing voyage permits for foreign vessels with foreign crew who do not undergo appropriate security checks; for permitting foreign flag of convenience ships to carry dangerous good on coastal shipping routes; for failing to ensure that ships provide details of crew and cargo 48 hours before arrival; for failing to X-ray or inspect 90 per cent of containers; for failing to establish and properly fund an Australian coastguard; and for failing to establish a department of homeland security to better coordinate security. To that effect, I move:
At the end of the motion, add “but the Senate condemns the Government for its failure to provide necessary maritime security and protect Australians, including:
      (a)     its careless and widespread use of single and continuing voyage permits for foreign vessels with foreign crew who do not undergo appropriate security checks;
      (b)     permitting foreign flag of convenience ships to carry dangerous goods on coastal shipping routes; and
      (c)     failing to:
                    (i)    ensure ships provide details of crew and cargo 48 hours before arrival,
                   (ii)    x-ray or inspect 90 per cent of containers,
                  (iii)    establish and properly fund an Australian coastguard, and
                  (iv)    establish a Department of Homeland Security to better coordinate security in Australia”.",SENATE,<title>MARITIME TRANSPORT AND OFFSHORE FACILITIES SECURITY AMENDMENT (MARITIME SECURITY GUARDS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2005 [2006]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2006-05-10,"—Perhaps it will assist if I sum up the second reading debate on the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Amendment (Maritime Security Guards and Other Measures) Bill 2005 [2006]. I think a number of senators have followed this debate very closely. As senators know, the bill strengthens the maritime transport and offshore arrangements and empowers maritime security guards to respond to unauthorised incursions into maritime security zones by persons, vehicles or vessels. It authorises maritime security guards to seek information from persons found in maritime security zones, while placing safeguards on the exercise of these information-seeking powers. It provides an appropriate offence regime to encourage compliance with maritime security guards’ requests and also provides new arrangements for directing a regulated Australian ship to operate at a higher security level when it is in waters identified as at higher risk.
The need for additional powers for maritime security guards to move unauthorised persons, vehicles and vessels from maritime security zones was identified during the comprehensive assessment of Australia’s maritime security policy settings by the Secretaries Committee on National Security last year, which involved key industry leaders. Further consultation, as senators would know, was undertaken by the Department of Transport and Regional Services with the maritime industry, security companies, state and territory police, maritime unions and relevant Australian government agencies. This helped refine and strengthen the framework for the move-on power.
The Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee has conducted an inquiry into the bill, accepted the need for the bill and recommended that it be passed. The government has noted the comments by Labor and Greens senators that draft regulations were not provided to the committee. In relation to that, let me say that the regulations are currently being developed in consultation with the maritime industry, unions and security guard providers.
The government looks forward to the passage of this bill within the current sitting period of the parliament. This will enable the maritime industry to draw upon these new powers as soon as possible to enhance the safeguarding of Australian ports and ships. It is in everyone’s interest that we ensure the speedy passage of this bill. I commend the bill to the Senate.
Question negatived.

"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2006-05-10,"—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President Murray. You would have noted that after the consideration of the last bill I departed not knowing that the Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment (Mutual Recognition with New Zealand) Bill 2005 [2006] was to come on next, because it is not even on the red today. I arrived back at my office to find that we are now to deal with a piece of legislation that the government had not thought a priority when the red was constructed this morning.
—Why would you be surprised?
—I will take that interjection from the senator even though he is not sitting in his place. I would not be surprised that the government does not know what it is doing from time to time. I would not be surprised that the Manager of Government Business has got things so wrong that we are dealing with a bill that was not on the red. The difficulty is, apparently, that there is nothing else that the government wishes to do. So we are dealing with the Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment (Mutual Recognition with New Zealand) Bill 2005 [2006], which is a bill that the Labor Party does not support and will not be giving its support to in this chamber.
We oppose the introduction of a new aviation regulatory regime in the absence of an assessment of the likely safety and economic outcomes. This is a foolhardy measure that may have serious consequences for safety in our skies and may cost Australian jobs. Labor’s principal objection to this bill is that we believe it has the potential to undermine aviation safety standards in this country.
The bill would permit the holder of an air operator’s certificate issued in New Zealand for the operation of an aircraft of more than 30 seats or 15,000 kilograms to conduct operations in Australia, without having to obtain an Australian issued air operating certificate; and vice versa, for that matter. It is a matter of great concern to Labor that the Howard government has pursued the mutual recognition of Australian and New Zealand aviation safety certification without first establishing that aviation safety regulations in our countries are in fact equivalent. It is because the government has not done that work that Labor is so firmly opposed to this bill.
The Howard government first attempted to legislate for mutual recognition of air operating certificates through the Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment (Mutual Recognition with New Zealand and Other Matters) Bill 2003, which was introduced into the parliament in June 2003. At the time, the government claimed that mutual recognition was consistent with the open skies air services agreement between Australia and New Zealand, signed in August 2002. The provisions in the current bill comprise the first phase of such mutual recognition.
Labor referred the original legislation to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee for inquiry and report. What the committee established in the course of its inquiry spoke volumes about the Howard government’s mishandling of the move to mutual recognition. First, the committee established that Australian and New Zealand regulators have entirely contradictory views on the impact of mutual recognition. The Civil Aviation Safety Authority of New Zealand gave evidence that mutual recognition would lead to the harmonisation of safety standards; the Department of Transport and Regional Services firmly repudiated that view. This left the committee questioning, not unreasonably, the inconsistency between Australia and New Zealand on this critical issue.
Second, the committee established that Australian and New Zealand aviation safety standards are not directly comparable. A number of submissions to the committee highlighted this issue, including the Australian and International Pilots Association submission, which said:
New Zealand’s aviation safety system may well comply with the standards required by ICAO and still offer a lesser standard of aviation safety than Australia’s system.
Mr Guy Maclean made a submissions that stated:
... compliance with ICAO benchmark standards does not comparatively rank the Australian and New Zealand aviation systems against each other. Rather, such audit findings only indicate that both systems meet or exceed a minimum required ICAO standard.
One of the key differences between the Australian and New Zealand aviation safety regimes considered by the committee related to flight attendant to passenger ratios being one to 36 passengers—that is, actual passengers—in Australia and one to 50 seats—that is, the seats available in the aircraft—in New Zealand. A number of submissions made to the committee expressed concern, with respect to safety standards and security, about New Zealand’s lower ratios.
We all know the important role flight attendants have played in past incidents involving passengers who present a risk to other passengers or, in some cases, pose a risk to the flight itself. None of us in the parliament are strangers to the inside of an aircraft. Like other air travellers, we have reason to be grateful for the role that flight attendants play in keeping our skies safe. That the Howard government should be prepared to so blithely accept a lower flight attendant ratio on aircraft operating in Australia is surprising.
A related matter considered by the committee was the impact of the competitive advantage to be enjoyed by airlines operating with a New Zealand issued air operating certificate. According to the Flight Attendants Association of Australia International Division this competitive advantage favouring New Zealand registered aircraft would create pressure to reduce operational standards applying to aircraft registered in Australia. This is the sort of harmonisation forecast by the New Zealand regulator—a harmonisation that could see Australian standards reduced.
Anecdotally, some airline operators expect that upon the implementation of this legislation there will be a review of Australian standards that exceed New Zealand standards, particularly cabin crew standards, for the purpose of harmonisation. That is an industry expectation; it is not a statement from CASA. But I will not be surprised if that occurs. We shall see in the course of time. Of course, in the event that a harmonisation of standards does not occur, the bill provides the airlines with, in the words of the FAAA, ‘an economic incentive to register aircraft in New Zealand’. Either way, the bill has the potential to deliver Australia lower safety standards.
The wider issue of whether the bill would permit airlines to operate domestically in Australia on a regular basis while remaining on a New Zealand issued AOC was also considered by the committee. The committee found that there may be some hurdles preventing an Australian airline transferring its whole operation to New Zealand while continuing to operate domestically in this country. However, no such prohibition would be imposed on the subsidiary of an Australian airline based across the Tasman.
In its submission to the inquiry, Virgin Blue suggested that carriers may take an opportunistic approach that will result in ‘a race towards the cheapest regulatory option’. That is not what a government that cares about aviation safety should be encouraging or, in terms of the bill before us, actively facilitating. Of course, it is not just about safety; it is also about jobs. This bill would facilitate the movement of some jobs across the Tasman.
Let me now return to the committee inquiry into the first incarnation of this bill. Not surprisingly, government members recommended the passage of the bill, albeit with two important caveats. The first was that a comparative safety assessment should be undertaken after the introduction of the new rules, and the second was that mutual recognition should not be extended without further legislative amendment—that is, the government should abandon its plan to extend mutual recognition by regulation. Labor senators delivered a dissenting report that recommended that the bill be opposed in the absence of a comparative assessment of safety systems, a full regulatory analysis of the two systems and a detailed analysis of the costs and benefits of the proposed regime. The dissenting report supported the minority report’s opposition to an extension of mutual recognition by regulation.
The government could not win the support of this chamber when it operated as a genuine house of review, and the 2003 bill lapsed with the last parliament. The Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment (Mutual Recognition with New Zealand) Bill 2005 was introduced into the Senate in June last year. It substantially replicates its precursor bill, with the exception that it does not contain a provision for the extension of mutual recognition, beyond AOCs, by way of regulation. This is a welcome concession by the government, but it does not ameliorate the substantive damage likely to be wrought overall.
This bill was also referred to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee for inquiry and report. In the report, tabled on 5 September 2005, the government dominated committee again recommended passage of the bill, notwithstanding ongoing concerns about the movement of Australian aviation operations to New Zealand and the government’s continuing failure to undertake a comparative safety assessment. Labor senators again opposed the passage of the bill on these same grounds. We said:
It defies logic to undertake this basic research after the change has been made.
Labor’s key objection to this bill is our concern that it will serve to diminish Australia’s rigorous aviation safety standards. Despite the passage of three years and two Senate inquiries, the government has failed to acknowledge concerns about the safety implications of the proposed mutual recognition regime. The government has ignored the opposition of pilots and flight attendants, and today we again urge the government to think again and do the work that must be done before we head down the proposed path.
One would have thought that by now the government could have at least initiated a comparative assessment of the safety systems in a public inquiry. A full regulatory analysis of the two systems should have been able to have been completed by now. No such information has been conveyed to the opposition. A detailed analysis of the costs and benefits of the proposed regime should have been done by now and ought to be available. As I said, this bill was introduced in June last year. We are now in May, almost 12 months later, but the government has no intention of commissioning such work because it has no concern about the impact of this bill on aviation safety, on the industry, on jobs in the industry or on anything other than a compliance with what it has agreed to do with New Zealand. So much for the national interest.
Labor’s key objection to this bill is our concern that it will serve to diminish Australia’s rigorous aviation safety standards. We say again that the government has failed to acknowledge that concern and has ignored other concerns. I do not understand why the government has not already done the work which I believe is necessary in relation to the passage of this bill. We believe that this legislation will have a dramatic effect on aviation operations in this country.
The government has taken a decision in relation to other air routes and international operations to decline the carrier Singapore Airlines access to the Pacific route, and as a result may well have damaged Australia’s relationship with Singapore. I wonder what the impact would be if one of the carriers operating in Australia now, Virgin Blue, were to establish operations in New Zealand as an international carrier. They already have Pacific Blue as one of their operators in New Zealand. It flies certain routes in the near Pacific region. If they were to seek to base such an operation in New Zealand, would the government give consideration to such a New Zealand based carrier having access to the Pacific route if it was a subsidiary of the Virgin Blue operation in Australia? What if it was also flying on certain domestic routes in this country? What would the government do in those circumstances? These are questions that I have asked myself in relation to the possibilities for aviation operation in this country.
Particularly given the current state of the majority owner of Virgin Blue, Patrick, and the takeover discussions which now seem to be coming to a conclusion—and I understand that Friday is the final day for shareholders in Patrick to accept the offer of Toll and to transfer their shares to Toll for the arrangements currently on the table—one wonders what may happen with that carrier. I would not want to make any reflection on Virgin Blue in terms of its operation here in Australia. It is a very professional operation. I regularly fly in their aircraft from Launceston and from other parts of the country as their service from time to time provides the best option. I merely highlight the circumstances of Virgin Blue, their arrangements with Pacific Blue, the Pacific route arrangements and what might occur there, and the possibility that airlines based in New Zealand and connected with Australian based airlines will take advantage of these arrangements and of what the government has suggested they might do—give a Virgin Blue owned operation access to the Pacific route when they have refused access by the Singapore Airlines operation. The Pacific route is Australia to Los Angeles from one of the eastern Australian ports. Sydney was the port of preference rather than the port of Adelaide—it was certainly not Perth.
I wonder what would occur were the government confronted with that option after the passage of this legislation and what impact that would have on the nature of aviation operations in this country. How many jobs that the government expects to remain here would actually migrate to New Zealand if it cost less for a carrier to operate in New Zealand? Who knows what airlines will seek to operate in this country in the future? More importantly, who knows what airlines will seek to register in New Zealand and then seek under these arrangements to be able to operate in Australia?
If we pass this legislation, what we are saying is that the awarding of an air operation certificate to an airline in New Zealand will be accepted as effectively the awarding of the same certificate by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority in Australia and that the airline will be able to fly here. That potentially will mean that certain aircraft based in New Zealand will be able to operate in Australia without having gone through any of the regulatory checks that we require. I do not know that there is anything in this legislation that requires New Zealand to harmonise its operations with Australia, despite what the New Zealand Civil Aviation Safety Authority had to say. That will be a matter for their parliament and for their executive government.
It also does not, as I understand it, oblige the New Zealand government to not change the existing arrangement. I suspect that if there were a change and we wanted to modify the arrangements with New Zealand then that would require us to change this legislation, although there may be some regulation under this legislation that would allow us to do so without changing the legislation. Those matters are also matters of concern which this parliament should give consideration to when it is considering passing this legislation. We are very concerned about this legislation. We believe that this is legislation which should not pass this parliament. If it does, we are very concerned about the impact on Australia’s aviation safety regime for the future.",SENATE,<title>CIVIL AVIATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MUTUAL RECOGNITION WITH NEW ZEALAND) BILL 2005 [2006]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2006-05-10,"—I rise to speak on the Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment (Mutual Recognition with New Zealand) Bill 2005 [2006]. This is an important piece of legislation that deals with the safety of the aviation industry, the safety of those working in the industry and the safety of the travelling public in general. Because of Australia’s geographic size and its distance from many countries, Australians are heavily dependent on having a safe and efficient aviation industry. The safety of air travel has become even more of a focus in the wake of the tragic events of 11 September 2001.
This is the second time the government has attempted to bring in mutual recognition provisions for the aviation industry and the second time that the sector has raised concerns about what is being proposed. It is also the second time that this government has decided to ignore those concerns. In broad terms, mutual recognition will mean that aviation safety certificates issued to eligible aviation organisations in one country will be recognised for use in the other. On the face of it, this seems like a sensible decision to reduce administrative costs but in reality what this legislation will do is make airlines compete on safety costs, and that means that we will see a race to the bottom in terms of safety standards, in our view. It will be a race in which the travelling public and those working on planes will be the losers as their lives are put at higher risk due to cost-cutting measures.
The government has argued that the New Zealand and Australian safety legislation is equivalent and therefore there is no risk in allowing mutual recognition. The government has suggested that because both countries have consistently met the International Civil Aviation Organisation safety standards there is no difference in safety standards. But, as the Australian Federation of Air Pilots points out:
ICAO provides a minimum position—in effect, the lowest common safety benchmark on a global basis. Aviation safety in Australia traditionally has been about establishing and maintaining margins of safety over and above the minimum standards.
What the government is implicitly suggesting is that Australia no longer has to maintain these higher standards, that the lower standards, the minimum standards, are in fact good enough.
As was pointed out during the inquiry into this bill, Australia and New Zealand have different standards in some very important areas. One that has been highlighted is the very different requirements in the area of the required ratio of cabin crew to passengers, and this is a very important element of aircraft safety. Research undertaken by Professor Galea at the Fire Safety Research Faculty at Greenwich University’s School of Numerical Modelling has shown a clear correlation between higher crew ratios and more effective—that is, safer—aircraft evacuations. As was pointed out by the Flight Attendants Association of Australia, airline operators go to great lengths to compare Australia’s one to 36 crew to passenger ratio with that of America, Europe and New Zealand, which is one to 50 crew to seat ratio, to suggest that Australia’s ratio is too high.
Apart from the fact that they are actually comparing fundamentally different ratios, it is clear that airline management feel that a ratio of one to 36 crew to passengers is not necessary. In evidence presented to the inquiry, the head of safety systems from Virgin Blue airlines indicated that as far as the airline management was concerned, four flight attendants on all of its aircraft was all that was necessary for safety. He went on to say:
The presence of extra flight attendants carried to meet the required ratio of one to 36 is not considered from a safety perspective.
Once airlines are operating in Australia that are able to carry fewer staff, how long will it be before other airlines with attitudes like that start pushing for fewer staff on their flights? When a New Zealand company can operate an identical aircraft to an Australian company but have one fewer cabin crew member, why would the Australian company not push to be able to do the same? The acting manager of corporate relations at CASA told the committee looking into the bill:
We have received word from the airlines that at some time they will be looking to come to CASA with a safety case to demonstrate whether changes—
in relation to cabin crew to passenger ratios—
are required. CASA has responded by saying that, while at this stage we have not made any moves to change the 1:36 ratio, we will look at safety cases if they are presented to us.
How long after this legislation comes in will it be before the airlines are bringing forward their calls for changes, and how long will the government resist the argument that will inevitably be put by Australian companies that New Zealand companies have a commercial advantage so Australian standards should be lowered to allow us to compete on an equal playing field? Virgin Blue acknowledges that the difference in cabin crew ratios between the two countries:
... does result, potentially, in a less than level playing field in both countries, with operators in Australia exposed to a significant cost penalty.
Cabin to crew ratios are not the only difference between the two countries that has the potential to impact on safety. The Flight Attendants Association noted that New Zealand does not have cabin safety specialists within the standards division of their equivalent of CASA—CAANZ—or specialist cabin safety auditors within the CAANZ compliance division. Surely this diminishes the New Zealand regulator’s ability to provide an equivalent level of oversight to that currently undertaken in Australia by CASA.
In the short term we will have a two-tiered safety system. Those people who can afford the higher prices that will be associated with the airlines with the higher safety standards will get the high standards, and those who can only afford the cheaper tickets will have to accept the higher level of risk. In the words of the flight attendants:
What we could have ... is an institutionalised system with one level of safety for lower cost foreign operators operating within our country ... Secondly, you would have a higher level of safety if you chose to fly with a main line Australian carrier operating to Australian standards.
But in the long term, all Australians will have to accept a high level of risk within the Australian aviation industry because of the downward pressure on standards in order to save costs.
The explanatory memorandum estimates the value of mutual recognition to be $1,000 for every average Australian family. Given the choice, I think that these families would prefer to maintain the higher levels of safety. It is not only safety that will be compromised under the new system, however. This legislation simplifies the ability of airline operators to transfer aircraft operations between Australia and New Zealand and this may well encourage operators to shift business to whichever country provides greater cost-saving measures, with a potential job loss from the Australian airline industry.
The aviation market is highly competitive. There have been dramatic changes in the nature of the industry since September 11, with a range of companies going bankrupt, collapsing—such as occurred with Ansett—or merging. That means that airlines now operate in a very tough competitive environment not only domestically but also internationally. Of course, airlines have experienced additional costs as a result of new regulations governing airline security since September 11. It is not surprising then that airlines will look for ways to reduce costs and save money. The flight attendants pointed out that this legislation may act to encourage operators to shift businesses to the country that has more viable cost-saving measures. They said:
The airlines now have started employing overseas. Qantas has a base in New Zealand of international flight attendants who operate under vastly lower conditions than their Australian counterparts. They have set up subsidiary airlines in New Zealand, such as Jetconnect, and there is evidence that jobs that would normally have gone to young Australians are now moving overseas and particularly to New Zealand.
The Australian Federation of Air Pilots also pointed out that Virgin Blue established its own company within New Zealand called Pacific Blue. Pacific Blue engages its pilots through a contractor at a substantially lower rate of pay than Virgin Blue. So this bill will not only risk the flying public’s safety but also risk jobs. The report by the committee itself recognises this. The report says:
... it is inevitable that the proposed legislation will encourage Australian operators to either reduce standards of employment or employment opportunities for cabin crew and pilots or encourage operators to move offshore. The Committee believes that this may not be in the best interests of the industry or the travelling public, particularly if it results in the reduction of standards of safety Australian passengers enjoy.
So I think that it is not enough for the government to say, as they did in the report into the earlier version of this bill, that after 12 months of operation of the new system an assessment of the safety standards of airlines operating in Australia should be conducted. The Democrats say that the government has a duty of care to prove that the new system will not reduce safety levels before they introduce change, not wait and see how it all goes. If a privately owned company said that they were going to introduce a new safety system without investigating impacts on safety prior to introducing it, the Australian community would be rightly outraged. Yet that is exactly what the government is proposing to do with this legislation. The explanatory memorandum for the bill states:
CASA has advised that an analysis of the safety systems has been conducted and both sides are confident that aviation can inter-operate safely in the form being considered.
It goes on to say:
There has been no detailed analysis of accidents or incidents, however as noted above, the two countries are considered to have comparable records, particularly in relation to larger capacity aircraft.
Unfortunately, details of CASA’s analysis have not been made publicly available so it is not possible for anyone to examine their processes or conclusions to determine whether this is a reliable assessment of the situation. All we know about that examination is that it did not look at accidents or incidents. I would ask: how can any examination of the safety impact of mutual recognition not look at airline accidents and incidents? How can the public possibly be confident that CASA’s assessment is reliable when it is not open to evaluation or critique? And, of course, there has been no examination of the possible job losses that might result from the introduction of the legislation despite calls for this in the dissenting report when the earlier version of the bill was considered by the committee in 2004.
We have now had two inquiries that have heard evidence from the aviation industry professionals that there are serious concerns about the impact of this legislation. But the government is powering ahead regardless without undertaking any research into the likely outcomes of introducing the new regime. The government botched the National Airspace System back in 2004. That was another example where the government ignored industry warnings about the inadequacies of the system from the start and it is a great pity that the government has not learned from that mistake. The Democrats will not be supporting the bill but we will be moving an amendment that delays the bill coming into effect until the government has conducted a comparative assessment of the airline safety systems operating in Australia and in New Zealand.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2006-05-10,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I commend the Australia-Indonesia Institute annual report 2004-05 to the Senate. As some honourable senators would be aware, the Australia-Indonesia Institute is an important part of our bilateral relationship. It was the subject of examination and received support during the deliberations of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade in its inquiry on Indonesia. Near neighbours—good neighbours: an inquiry into Australia’s relations with Indonesia was the title of the inquiry report, back in 2004. I commend that report, similarly, to the chamber. I again place on record my strong interest in and fascination with Indonesia.
Having said that, I think that, as with all good friends and neighbours, it is really important that we have very open, frank and constructive discussions as neighbours and friends. That means that sometimes we have to talk about things that might be a bit difficult or uncomfortable. I suppose it is not news to anybody at the moment that there are some issues between Australia and Indonesia over our relationship. A lot of that centres on the recent debate about human rights in West Papua, the asylum seekers who have come to Australia from West Papua and the government’s decision—one that I strongly support—to grant temporary protection visas to those asylum seekers.
It is on that note that I wish to make the point that I see as important organisations such as the Australia-Indonesia Institute and other significant education, cultural and trade institutions that ensure that we have positive, strong and growing ties between our countries. In fact, they are imperative to our relationship so that we understand each other well and we maintain good relations. So I was little concerned, as I think my colleague Senator Bartlett, from Queensland, was as well, to discover that the two of us have found ourselves on a list of what the media have coined ‘enemies of Indonesia’ simply because we have been up front about the issues affecting our region and Indonesia in particular.
I have been to Indonesia a couple of times. I have never quite got to Bali, and at the moment that might be looking a little difficult. I am making an appeal to the Indonesian government here. On the two trips that I have been on, on parliamentary business, I found the country fascinating. I worked with my colleagues towards coming up with a consensus report that sought only to further our relationship. I do not think the idea of listing individual politicians or organisations as somehow being ‘enemies’ or any other term is the best way to progress our relationship; I really don’t. I think I speak for Senator Bartlett as well when I describe us as friends and supporters of what Indonesia is trying to achieve, or certainly what I have seen in relation to furthering democracy. Indonesia has gone to quite extraordinary lengths and has taken great strides in its democratic progress. Observing its elections was one of the most mind-blowing things I have ever seen. They were conducted in a really harmonious, peaceful and impressive way, especially given the logistical issues with which they had to deal.
I do not want my support for human rights, or that of colleagues, whatever party they may belong to, to be misinterpreted. I have written to the Indonesian ambassador and to the foreign affairs minister of that country to outline my position. This is not because I want to kowtow to that government—far from it. I just want to make clear that when countries are responsible for acts in the past or even currently that are bad then they should be cognisant of those acts and acknowledge them and deal with them. That is what we expect of Indonesia, in the same way that I would expect it of our own country. On that note, I want to make clear that the Australia-Indonesia Institute and other bodies that further our relationship in that constructive way are integral to us understanding our countries better in the future. I once again ask the Indonesian government to look closely at the statements that I and my colleagues have made and to understand them in the context in which they were made. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2006-05-10,"—I stand tonight to speak to the merits of selling Medibank Private. I refer to the recent government decision to progress towards a sale of Medibank Private. I am advised that a sale could take place prior to 30 June 2007 by a share float, trade sale or other means. In his media release of 25 April, my colleague the Minister for Finance and Administration, Senator the Hon. Nick Minchin, said, ‘The government has yet to decide whether Medibank Private will be sold through share market float, trade sale’ or by other means and said that this would, in part, depend on whether the government proceeded with the sale of Telstra in 2006-07—although I note that the minister has said that the government plans to proceed with the sale of Medibank Private notwithstanding.
The minister went on to say, ‘The government will shortly call for tenders for advisers to the sale, although the sale cannot take place until the parliament passes the sale legislation,’ which, I am advised, will be introduced in the winter session of parliament this year. It is legislation which I intend to strongly support. I believe it is in the best interests of this country and members of the community. I commend the minister and the Howard government for pursuing a sale which I believe to be entirely appropriate and one which I am sure my colleagues opposite in the Labor Party would also happily embrace if they were in government. Such is the nature of politics, they have so far to date poured scorn on the government’s decision.
It makes no sense for the Australian government to own Australia’s largest private health fund. Why would the government want to own a billion dollar-plus business enterprise with a $2.8 billion annual turnover that performs no universal service obligation to taxpayers, trades in the black, has never returned a dividend and occasionally requires a taxpayer contribution to bolster its capital backing? I believe the government has no business being a player in the private health insurance market, while being the regulator of private health funds and their premiums. This ensures either a perceived or a real conflict of interest. For this reason alone, I find Labor’s opposition to the policy puzzling. Truly, I believe the party opposite has adopted a policy of seeking relevance by blanket opposition to any significant proposal.
There has been much comment on how a sale would reduce competition, but I say a sale can strengthen the market and boost competition. For Labor to oppose the sale is pure ideological autopilot and opposing for opposing’s sake. Since 1988 both major parties have sold or share floated $50 billion worth of public assets, with the Labor Party being responsible for the Commonwealth Bank, Australian Airlines and part of Qantas. In addition, state governments in the past 20 years or so have sold off their government business enterprises, including their own insurance companies. What reason is there for Medibank Private to remain in public ownership? How is it that such a large government funded asset is able to draw on taxpayers’ funds to bolster its own dominant position, while being of no benefit to a large number of taxpayers who, I might add, either have no private health insurance or have membership with other private health insurers? Such a distortion of the market cannot be and should not be tolerated. It is entirely unfair on other health funds and their members.
Established in 1976 and made an autonomous government business enterprise in 1998, Medibank Private made an operating profit of $130.8 million in 2004-05—a massive 192 per cent turnaround on the profit level in 2002. In 2003-04 the company made a profit of $44.8 million, following a special taxpayer injection of $85 million in the form of 85 million $1 shares. The fund operates on a not-for-profit basis and has a membership base covering three million people, or thereabouts, or just under one-third of Australians who have private health insurance cover. Government ownership of Medibank Private, in my view, is one humongous distortion of the market.
Amazingly, this dominant player in the private health insurance industry has not returned one cracker in dividends to taxpayers—ever. The fact that from time to time taxpayers are asked to contribute funds to Medibank Private creates an unfair playing field for other private health insurers, given that this fund is the country’s biggest player. To sell it would strengthen the private health insurance market, not weaken it. A privately owned entity could reduce management and administration expenses and also expand into new areas of doing business. For example, the privately owned BUPA has a management expense ratio of 7.7 per cent compared to 9.3 per cent for Medibank Private and 10 per cent for the mutualised MBF.
The Australian government’s ownership of Medibank Private has no positive influence or bearing on private health insurance premiums or the increasing take-up of private health insurance. It provides no identifiable universal service obligation. All health funds are strictly regulated, no matter who owns them. The government’s 30 per cent private health insurance rebate benefits more than 10 million Australians—or well over 40 per cent of the population—and this includes both hospital and ancillary cover. Medibank Private members receive this rebate, and the additional rebate of up to 35 per cent for those aged 65 or 40 per cent for those aged 70 and over. In theory, government policy could be designed to provide particular benefits for Medibank Private members. This possibility, of course, can be avoided altogether by its sale.
According to its annual report, Medibank Private’s profit has improved by more than $306 million over the past three years, while it says that 88.4 per cent of contributions by members are returned as benefits paid. The insurer matches this return on membership equity against what it says is an industry average of 87.2 per cent. However, as a government owned and funded asset with no requirement to pay a dividend, it is no wonder that Medibank Private holds a dominant market position. It should be sold in order to free up the marketplace not constrain and hinder it. It is one of 38 private health insurance funds, and consumers have many choices about whom they insure with. Also, the government is retaining the ministerial premium approval process, so any unjustifiable increase can be rejected.
The method of sale of Medibank Private via the stock market, by tender, trade sale or other means is very important to ensure the maximum return for taxpayers and to maintain competition. Using some of the sale proceeds to increase funding for medical research is an excellent decision. The government’s decision in the federal budget last night to substantially increase funding for medical research is certainly applauded by me and, I know, by many others.
I want to add that the current board, CEO George Savvides and the management of Medibank Private have done an excellent job turning around the company’s finances and putting it in a position where there is significant interest from potential buyers. The industry generally will benefit from the largest health fund being privately owned and competing on a level playing field. Competition for members between funds is the best way to limit premium increases.
Studies have shown that a privately owned fund would be able to be more efficient through lower management expenses and through scope for expansion into new business areas. It is the latter part that has been missed or misunderstood by the opposition and, indeed, some in the public arena. If it is privately owned the options are there, in the spirit of entrepreneurialism that is fundamental to the success of our economy and particularly the small business community in Australia. These greater efficiencies mean a privately owned fund does not put upward pressure on premiums. There are already five for-profit private health insurance funds, and there is no evidence that these for-profit insurers charge higher premiums than any other health funds. History supports the decision to sell Medibank Private. The evidence is there to support its sale.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Medibank Private</title>,Adjournment,33,1,speech
