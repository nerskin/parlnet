"Charles, Bob, MP",LP,1999-08-09,"—On behalf of the Joint Select Committee on the Republic Referendum I present the committee's advisory report, incorporating dissenting reports, on the Constitution Alteration (Establishment of Republic) Bill 1999  and the Presidential Nominations Committee Bill 1999  together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—Mr Acting Speaker, I am delighted to present the report of the Joint Select Committee on the Republic Referendum on our inquiry into two bills which, if they become law, will alter our constitution to take Australia from a monarchical form of constitutional democracy to a republic.
The first bill, the Constitution Alteration (Establishment of Republic) Bill 1999, proposes changes to the Australian Constitution itself. The proposals in this bill contain the constitutional changes necessary to establish Australia as a republic. The long title of this bill will be the question put to Australian voters at a referendum later this year and 
 presently scheduled for Saturday, 6 November. The second bill considered by the committee, the Presidential Nominations Committee Bill 1999, would become an ordinary act of parliament. This bill sets out provisions for the operation of a committee to consider public nominations for an Australian President. Together the two bills give effect to decisions taken at the 1998 Constitutional Convention held at Old Parliament House, Canberra.
The committee considered that it had three responsibilities with respect to its inquiry: firstly, to determine that the bills to the largest practical extent accurately reflected the outcomes of the Constitutional Convention; secondly, that if the bills were enacted and the referendum successful that the republican model introduced would work as intended; and, thirdly, to give the Australian people the opportunity to comment on this historic and important legislation.
The committee concluded that the legislation does accurately reflect the recommendations of the Constitutional Convention. I compliment the Attorney-General and the referendum task force for producing legislation that should work in the manner intended. While there were many dissenting views both on the form of the republican model and various detailed and separate technical and legal issues, the bills represent a competent response to the chosen model. The committee agreed that these two important bills should proceed, and today's report contains 14 recommendations that the committee believes will improve the operation of the proposed laws.
In order to give the community the opportunity to comment on the legislation, public hearings were held in Sydney, Adelaide, Brisbane, Broome, Canberra, Darwin, Hobart, Melbourne, Newcastle, Perth and Townsville. The committee inquiry was well supported by expert and non-expert witnesses alike. We were pleased that a wide range of Australians came forward to meet and talk with us. The committee agrees this inquiry was, as one witness in regional Australia observed, an example of democracy in action.
The first of our 14 recommendations addresses the long title of the bill to amend the Constitution. This was, and is, a highly charged political issue, as the words themselves will form the question to be asked at the referendum, and some believe they will have an influence on the outcome of the vote. The committee agreed that the long title of the bill should describe in concise and simple terms the essential purpose and outcome of the proposed amendments to the Constitution. The long title proposed by the committee is:
A Bill for an Act to alter the Constitution to establish the Commonwealth of Australia as a republic, with the Queen and Governor-General being replaced by an Australian President.
The committee believes that this proposed long title represents a substantial improvement on that of the bill currently before the parliament. While none of the committee members thinks it is perfect, for an all-party committee this proposal represents a collegiate decision reached in the spirit of consensus and compromise. In the circumstances the committee concluded that its long title was more than reasonable.
Mr Acting Speaker, I say to you there was not one dissenting voice when the final form of words of proposed recommendation No. 1 was put to the committee. Even after written dissents were taken into account, only one member of this committee has formally dissented from the agreed long title. Other recommendations of our report address variously the appointment of the President, the powers of the President, the removal of the President and other issues related to the bill.
The other recommendation on which I will briefly comment is recommendation 3, which would effectively provide that a Prime Minister who nominated for President a person other than a candidate selected by the nominations committee would be required to table a statement in writing justifying such action. The committee received a great deal of input regarding the nomination process because many people felt strongly that it was the nomination process itself which gave legitimacy to allowing the parliament to be the ultimate approver of a Prime Minister's choice of the person to be President. Accord 
 ingly, the committee felt that the nominations committee process should be given absolute legitimacy so that, while not denying the Prime Minister the opportunity to select a person not so nominated, if he and the Leader of the Opposition were unable to otherwise agree, any such decision should effectively be reported to the nation in writing.
The committee travelled across Australia taking evidence for this inquiry and on 9 July took evidence in Broome. That day was a noteworthy anniversary in Australia's constitutional history. The 9th of July this year was the 99th anniversary of a certain enactment of the British parliament—63 and 64 Victoria, chapter 12—which contains the Australian Constitution. I reflected on that British enactment at the beginning of the committee's meeting in Broome. I thought how appropriate it was that on this anniversary the Joint Select Committee on the Republic Referendum was reviewing the bills that could lead the way for Australia to become a republic.
In the first half of the 1990s when the republic debate was beginning to achieve some national profile, I considered the issues and declared my personal position. I said that by birth, heritage and inheritance I was a republican. But I believed that our monarchical form of constitutional democracy had served Australia well and I was unconvinced that any change to this successful democratic system could be justified on grounds other than improvement to democracy itself. I also rejected the views of those who stated that a change of Australia's head of state to give effect to a republic was inevitable.
In 1996 when the President of the United States, Bill Clinton, and his wife Hillary visited Australia, the Prime Minister hosted a state luncheon in the Great Hall of Parliament House, Canberra. At the beginning of that auspicious occasion, the Prime Minister rose and proposed a toast to the President of the United States of America. We toasted and resumed our seats. Then the President of the United States rose and proposed a toast to the Queen. We toasted, but in a room of over 600 people you could literally hear the proverbial pin drop. Since that time I have listened carefully to the debate about our head of state 
 and constitutional reform. I attended day 1 of the Constitutional Convention and followed its activities avidly.
 At the beginning of this inquiry I said that I was, and would remain, neutral on the question until I tabled the committee's report. I have read the written submissions and  listened carefully to the Australians who appeared before the committee to give evidence and I have considered carefully the legislation itself and its likely effect on our particular form of constitutional democracy. I hold strongly to the view that our unique model incorporating pieces of Westminster and the United States and Switzerland examples is probably the most successful of any constitutional democratic system in all of the world.
Notwithstanding that the monarchy has given us stability and non-partisan convention, I believe that any form of monarchy has for the 21st century finally outlived its usefulness. The idea that in 2000 or 2001 inherited privilege and power has any place in a democratic institution is at total variance with my belief in people based politics and equality of opportunity. I believe the model proposed by these bills is a good model and will allow us to move from a constitution based on the Crown to one based on the people in a smooth seamless transition. I applaud the Constitutional Convention for its sensible compromise outcomes. I support these bills. I will vote yes at the referendum and I will serve any public role which might assist any of the groups supporting the yes campaign.
I want to record my thanks to the committee secretariat—Claressa Surtees, Rose Verspaandonk, Hilary Manson, Anna Gadzinski and Robert Horne—for an outstanding job in a very tight time schedule under often very difficult circumstances. I would also like to thank the ever-reliable staff of our parliamentary reporting staff. To my colleagues on the committee and particularly the deputy chairman, the member for Barton, who is at the table, I say: it was a long winter of no holidays and hard work and I thank you for your cooperation, your sensibilities and for a positive outcome. I say to the executive that the 14 recommendations of this report repre 
 sent a largely unanimous outcome. I ask the executive to take serious consideration of what my committee and I believe are sensible recommendations. I commend the report to the House.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Republic Referendum Joint Committee</title>,Committees,2,1
"McClelland, Robert, MP",ALP,1999-08-09,"—I have pleasure in endorsing the report of the Joint Select Committee on the Republic Referendum. I also thank the secretariat for their tremendous work: it really was outstanding. Opposition members are very grateful for that. In terms of the position of the chairman, I can honestly say that not one member of the committee was aware of his personal views on this issue, and that is to his credit. He approached the matter as a chairman should, with objectivity and balance, and I think that approach flowed through to the sincerity of the other members of the committee. The report is a sensible and balanced one. Overall, it gives the government's proposals, which will be put to the Australian people in November this year, a clean bill of health and, indeed, a strong endorsement.
Regarding the most controversial issue, the long title, it is true, as the chairman of the committee said, that the desire of committee members was to have a concise and simple question. Indeed, we found that the wording proposed in the bill is misleading. It is misleading because it talks about only one aspect of the presidential nominations procedure. It says that the President will be chosen by a two-thirds majority of both houses of parliament. For a start, the role of the parliament is not to choose; it is only to approve two earlier steps that are a necessary precondition to that third, final check occurring.
The first step is recommendation by a nominations committee, of which more than half will be community members. A short list of nominees is put to the Prime Minister. For the first time in the selection of our head of state there will be community input in the nomination process. For the first time, any member of the community will be able to nominate someone for the position of head of state and, for the first time, there will be community involvement in the vetting of those nominations. That is a significant advance on the current situation where, 
 effectively, the Governor-General is appointed by one man, namely, the Prime Minister. That is the first precondition.
The second precondition is a joint nomination, moved by the Prime Minister but, importantly, seconded by the Leader of the Opposition. This nomination procedure—if the bill is approved at the November referendum—will ensure that our head of state is not a politician but, to the contrary, is above politics, someone who is acceptable to both sides of parliament. Only after those two essential preconditions occur—the community committee nomination recommendation and the joint motion by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition—can the third and final step occur where the parliament has the final check on the procedure, as it were. Those elected directly and those elected by proportional representation in the Senate come together in a joint sitting, major and minor parties all reflected, and two-thirds of those representatives of the people of Australia must approve the choice. Again, that will ensure that the person put before the parliament is above politics, is an Australian that we will all be proud of, is an Australian that will unify the nation and is someone who represents Australia on the international stage with stature and is effectively one of our own.
That is the important three-step procedure in the nomination process. We actually found that to refer to only one of those steps occurring was misleading because it enabled people to erroneously and misleadingly say that the outcome of this procedure would be a politician's President. It will be anything else. It will be of the community and it will be a part of the community, as the President must be under the system that is proposed.
For that reason, we said that there were two options. One option was to avoid the misleading indication in the current question and to include the whole procedure that I have outlined. It was agreed that if we did that the question would be far too long and perhaps an impediment to people considering the issues when they vote on the question. We thought it better to have a concise and simple question. Instead of talking about the procedures, we said: what are the outcomes that we 
 are talking about? That outcome was establishing a republic with the Queen and Governor-General being replaced by an Australian President. For the first time, our Australian head of state must be an Australian citizen. That is the essential outcome of the procedure that we have endorsed. It is impossible for anyone to sensibly cavil with that brief, short and concise description of what the outcome will be.
That outcome was arrived at in the spirit of consensus and compromise. At the deliberations there was not one dissenting voice and, as the chairman has pointed out, those who were not in attendance at that time have since had the opportunity to put in dissenting reports, and there has been only one dissent on that question. I know a number of people regrettably locked themselves into a corner before they had considered the report's recommendations. I would ask them to now step out of that corner, have regard to these very solid, very balanced recommendations and reassess the issue. The Australian people are entitled to have a fair and honest proposition put to them in November and we have proposed one that we think achieves that goal.
A number of other issues are canvassed in the report and other members will have the opportunity of speaking on those. One of the other more significant areas of controversy was in respect of the dismissal procedure. We have found that currently there is effectively no restriction on the Prime Minister deciding to dismiss the Governor-General. The only restriction is one of time; that is, the time it would take the Prime Minister to obtain the consent of the Queen to that process. But we note that, in this day of electronic communication, that is effectively no impediment at all; that that request for approval, and approval, could be effectively instantaneous. There is in fact under our current system no accountability for the Prime Minister dismissing the Governor-General. This bill proposes for the first time that accountability be brought into the procedure. We have recommended that the Prime Minister, as soon as practicable but certainly, as the current bill provides, within 30 days, must relate his or her decision to dismiss the President to the House of 
 Representatives, and the House of Representatives then deliberates on whether it approves or does not approve.
We note that the House is the master of its own procedures and the House could be expected to afford procedural fairness to the President who was dismissed. We also note that the political reality is that, if the Prime Minister's action in dismissing the Governor-General was disapproved of, it would effectively end the career of the Prime Minister, either by way of a motion of no confidence in the Prime Minister as an individual or, if the House chose, as master of its own destiny, to move a motion of no confidence in the government of the day. That would also be available. To suggest that there is no accountability in the proposed bill is false. In fact, there is effectively no accountability in the current system and accountability will be introduced for the first time. So the committee has given approval to that process of accountability as an appropriate check in the overall system.
We have noted that the powers of the President will be the same as the Governor-General. The best advice is to that effect. So, again, any suggestion that our system of government will be changed by this bill in November is wrong. It will preserve the Westminster system that we have all come to cherish, but it will give Australians an Australian citizen as our head of state for the first time.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Republic Referendum Joint Committee</title>,Committees,2,1
"Bishop, Julie, MP",LP,1999-08-09,"—In accordance with usual parliamentary practice, the terms of reference of the Joint Select Committee on the Republic Referendum were narrow and specific. As a member of that committee I saw our task as twofold: first, to consider whether the provisions of the bills effectively implemented the republic model that emerged from the Constitutional Convention and, secondly, to consider whether, if the bills were passed, they would operate effectively or, to put it another way, whether there were flaws in the drafting or in the intended operation of those bills.
It was a narrow brief and one for which I put aside personal views. In my deliberations on the committee I sought to remain as 
 objective as possible, given the specific terms of reference. There was neither the opportunity nor the ability for committee members to push alternative models for a republic.
The issue which seems to have created most interest is that of the long title. It is apparent from reading previous questions posed in previous referenda that there is some art to drafting a short and concise question which may, in fact, cover deeply complex, constitutionally difficult or even procedurally difficult proposals. Previous referenda questions have been short, concise, not cumbersome and go to the basis of the change, not to the procedures by which the change is to be effected.
The constitutional change being sought in this instance is the change from one system to another. However one looks at it, whether we describe it as a change from a constitutional monarchy to a republic or a change from a crowned head of state to an appointed head of state, it comes down to asking: what will be the fundamental difference when Australians wake up on the morning of 7 November 1999, assuming for the moment that the referendum succeeds? The fundamental change is that the Queen and the Governor-General would be replaced by an Australian President—an Australian head of state who the convention recommended be called President. That is the basic proposal.
It is hard to please everyone, for essentially seven different elements of constitutional change were put forward by various witnesses as being necessary inclusions, in their view, in the long title. Some thought the inclusion of a nominations committee was the most significant change; others thought it was the selection by the Prime Minister of a nominee. Others thought it was the approval by a two-thirds majority of both houses of parliament, while others thought it was the dismissal procedure. Others believed that it would be appropriate to mention the 30-day ratification by the House. I, for one, believed that the most significant matter for consideration was the powers to be given to the head of state. Appointment and dismissal are procedural matters, the process by which the head of state enters or departs the scene. At the heart 
 of it all must be the powers that the head of state holds.
Section 4 of this report deals in some detail with the issues of the powers and the views that were expressed. We were concerned to ensure that the Constitutional Convention resolution, that the powers of the President shall be the same as those currently exercised by the Governor-General, was adhered to. Given the weight of the expert constitutional evidence before the committee to the effect that the President would have the same powers as those which the Governor-General has at present—and that was a majority view, not an absolute view—and given the uncertainty that already exists as to whether an exercise of the reserve powers or the content of the conventions are presently justiciable, I believe that the committee's recommendations in chapter 4 show the committee has gone as far as it is able to give effect to the recommendation of the Constitutional Convention that the powers of the President should be the same as those currently exercised by the Governor-General.
Having dealt with the question of non-reserve and reserve powers and the conventions as best as we were able, I was able to support a proposed long title that the Queen and the Governor-General be replaced by a President, as inherent in that is the issue of the powers of the President. I commend the report to the House.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Republic Referendum Joint Committee</title>,Committees,2,1
"Roxon, Nicola, MP",ALP,1999-08-09,"—The tabling today of the report of the Joint Select Committee on the Republic Referendum is a vital step in a long but cautious process of recognising our maturity and independence as a nation. It is part of making sure that our institutions of government actually match our strong sense of identity and our capacity as a nation to stand on our own two feet.
It is on the record that I am a committed republican. I, like many Australians, particularly those of my generation, have always had a strong sense of pride in being Australian and in the unique freedom and strength and security that our country gives us. There was a jolt for me, however, when I became a solicitor in Victoria and again when I was 
 elected to this place, because I was twice required to swear allegiance to the Queen—a queen who, despite her personal good works, holds an office which arouses in me no sense of shared identity. I cannot automatically respect a title that she has not earned but simply inherited, and I cannot respect her wealth of immense proportions or the religiously exclusive nature of her office. Such ideas are in fundamental opposition to the Australian values of equality, openness and opportunity.
But the committee's work and recommendations were not about whether committee members were republicans, monarchists or otherwise. Our job, as other speakers have indicated, was to assess the working capacity of the bills. The committee has been able to conclude that the bills will ensure that our democratic system of great stability will continue, but with an Australian head of state who can be a symbol of our shared aspirations as a nation. A fair question must include this fundamental change. It is a change of personnel, if you like, not a change of the system itself.
On the issues of the appointment and dismissal of the President and the powers of the President, one must, to measure the proposal fairly, compare it to the total lack of process and accountability currently involved in appointing a Governor-General. The Prime Minister currently has total power to do this. The Queen does not play any role and has no independent discretion in supporting the Prime Minister's recommendations. People are largely unaware of this because the power to dismiss a Governor-General by the Prime Minister has not been exercised. The political reality and other checks within our system ensure that this is the case.  
In my view, the great strength of the proposal examined by the committee is that it is a very conservative proposal—and for a good reason. It maintains our system of government—one of the most stable and vibrant democracies in the world. All the scaremongering in the campaign to come will not detract from the fact that the experts told the committee that the powers of the President will be the same as those of the Queen and 
 the Governor-General. The bills go to great lengths to give some added protection to the position of the President and to add accountability in the process of a Prime Minister appointing a new President. Even on the question of dismissal, the checks and balances in our system come from the Westminster system of responsible government, combined with our bicameral system where the Senate is usually not controlled by the government of the day. These valuable protections remain unchanged and will ensure the stability of our democracy.
As the member for Barton has briefly touched upon, the open and participatory nomination process is a great advance on the current system of nomination. However, I would like to briefly address recommendation No. 2 of the committee, which is an important recommendation which would improve that public nomination process. Specific reference could be made to the diversity of our Australian community so that, when the Prime Minister appoints community members to a nomination committee, we make sure that those on the selection committee truly do represent the diversity of our nation. I draw attention to that important recommendation.
However, a fair question cannot refer to the nominations process unless it includes all that process. To refer to only a part, as the bills currently do and as the Prime Minister is reported as supporting, distorts that process. All or nothing might be sensible but including all the detail was regarded as far too cumbersome, confusing and difficult and therefore was decided against by the committee.
I commend the report to the House and to the Prime Minister. He might not like the recommendations, but they are fair and thorough and they give Australians a chance to make an informed choice about our future on 6 November. This is a choice about our identity and our independence. I will be urging people to vote yes. Australians do not need to be wedded for life to this particular model of the republic, but they do need to be able to respect themselves in the morning. I hope that, on the morning of 7 November, we will be able to respect ourselves and be proud to call ourselves a truly independent nation.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Republic Referendum Joint Committee</title>,Committees,2,1
"Baird, Bruce, MP",LP,1999-08-09,"—I rise to endorse the report of the Joint Select Committee on the Republic Referendum which was presented by the chairman of the committee, the member for La Trobe. I commend him on his skill and great objectivity in chairing the committee. I also commend the secretariat of the committee who had a difficult task and did an outstanding job in a very short space of time. I commend them.
The report represents almost the unanimous agreement of those involved in the committee. It is a reflection of the views reported to the committee at the public hearing on the analysis of the  Constitution Alteration (Establishment of Republic) Bill 1999  and the  Presidential Nominations Committee Bill 1999 . It is clear that the key questions to be resolved were, firstly, the powers of an Australian President and whether they would be equal to those of the Governor-General; secondly, the composition of the committee selected to choose the President; thirdly, the relative powers of the Governor-General and the Prime Minister in the event of one wishing to dismiss the other; fourthly, reporting to parliament on the grounds for dismissal of the President; fifthly, the subsequent impact if the Parliament does not approve the sacking; and, finally, the text of the question to be put to the Australian people in the referendum on 6 November 1999.
On the issue of the long title of the bill to be put at the referendum, I strongly support the recommendation of the committee. Surely the key question to be asked is whether the Australian nation believes that it is time to replace the Queen as head of state and her representative, the Governor-General, with an Australian head of state. It is important that the Australian public recognise what is taking place in terms of the transfer of powers of the head of state. To add that the President should be chosen by two-thirds of the parliament is superfluous, as the `bipartisan appointment of the President' model was the one chosen by the Constitutional Convention when it met in early February last year.
Obviously, there is much debate over whether the President should be popularly elected or elected by a two-thirds majority of 
 parliament. The decision has been made by the Constitutional Convention as to the preferred model. The convention decided that the direct election option would open the new republic to the situation where, in the event of a conflict between the head of state and the head of government, it would not be clear whose power would prevail.
It seems appropriate to put a simple question to the public in November asking them to decide between retaining the monarchy as the head of state or moving to a republican system of government. It is apparent from the input of the constitutional lawyers who appeared as expert witnesses before the committee that there was a division of opinion amongst them as to the legal impact of the proposed legislation. However, it would appear that in general the powers of the President would be the same as those of the Governor-General. Firstly, the checks on the choice of the President by the Prime Minister will be far greater than currently apply to the choice of Governor-General. Secondly, the recommendation for President will come from a diversely comprised committee and the Prime Minister will be required to report to the House if he decides not to accept the recommendation of the committee. Currently, the Prime Minister, with the endorsement of the cabinet, decides who to recommend to the Queen for instalment as Governor-General.
Thirdly, in the event of dismissal of the President by the Prime Minister, the Prime Minister must explain within 30 days the reason for the dismissal. Currently, the Prime Minister can effectively dismiss the Governor-General without any formal mechanism to justify the action. With these main areas sorted out and, indeed, near unanimous support for all recommendations, the committee has achieved its primary objectives.
It has long been on the public record that I support this country moving towards a republican system of government. I think this country is extraordinarily fortunate to have been colonised by Britain and to have retained its main religion, language, legal system and cultural heritage. It is clear that these continue to serve the Commonwealth well. I do not see that the choice between the 
 monarchy and an Australian republic is what Henry Lawson referred to as people having to decide between `the old dead tree and the young tree green'. However, he was spot on when he said that it is a choice between `the land that belongs to the Lord and Queen and the land that belongs to you'.
As a trade commissioner in Germany, I found that people constantly asked why we had a Queen in the UK who lived 12,000 kilometres away. The importance of becoming a republic was crystallised for me during the Olympic bid—and I was also interested to hear the chairman's reasons. As part of a lobbying team, we often found ourselves in one corner of a restaurant lobbying for Sydney while, in the other corner, the daughter of the Australian head of state, Princess Anne, lobbied IOC officials for Manchester. This experience shows that, where our interests no longer overlap, we have to establish our own national identity as a mature country with our own place in the world but one with special links to Britain.
The monarchy stands for privilege and the establishment, whereas Australia has been built on strong egalitarian principles and our own mateship. That is the basis on which the recommendations contained in this report have been put together and I heartily endorse them. I recommend the report to the House.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Republic Referendum Joint Committee</title>,Committees,2,1
"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,1999-08-09,"—I rise to support the report of the Joint Select Committee on the Republic Referendum and its recommendations. The Prime Minister authorised the formation of the committee, and it has taken detailed submissions both in writing and at public hearings. The purpose of the committee being formed and receiving those submissions was to listen to the opinion of the Australian people and, once hearing the evidence, to make recommendations to the parliament in the hope that the Prime Minister would in turn listen to the opinion of the Australian people and attempt to present them with an honest, unbiased referendum question on 6 November. I believe that was foremost in the minds of practically all the members of the committee. We worked hard to see whether we could come up with a question that 
 would be unbiased and which would be put to the Australian people on 6 November.
The current long title of the legislation is both misleading and inaccurate. It was supported by all constitutional monarchists who addressed the committee at its public hearings, and it was rejected by all people who supported the republic. If you have a situation where one group supports it 100 per cent and another group rejects it, then it is obviously not a fair question—it is biased. The fact that the long title currently says `chosen by a two-thirds majority of parliament' is misleading and not a true and accurate portrayal of the appointment process. The process, as other speakers have mentioned, is that a short list be prepared by the Presidential Nominations Committee and from that the Prime Minister would choose a person to be nominated. That person would be nominated by the Prime Minister and that nomination would be seconded by the Leader of the Opposition. That is how the person would be chosen. It would then be put to the parliament and a two-thirds majority of the parliament would be needed to ratify that choice. The choice is not made by the two-thirds majority of the parliament; the choice is, in effect, made by the Prime Minister after a long period of public consultation. The proposed long title selected by the joint select committee is accurate: it does not seek to mislead people and it does not seek to give a biased view.
Other issues canvassed quite extensively and considered in detail by the committee were the appointment and dismissal process and the reserve powers of the President. The committee concluded that the proposed legislation broadly mirrored the current position, although there would be greater accountability in the appointment and dismissal process.
One issue I would like to spend a little time addressing is recommendation 14. It is quite an important issue that was brought to the attention of the committee. This recommendation identified the need to have a relevant community education campaign. Written education is not appropriate for all people. Indigenous Australians find it difficult, and are unable in a number of cases, to read 
 written information sent to them. They need to have that information disseminated to them in a meaningful way. I would like to suggest that perhaps Aboriginal medical services, land councils, ATSIC or special groups of the Australian Electoral Commission could be involved in the dissemination of that information by going out to those communities to give them that information.
The information must be in a format that is relevant to young people. It must be something that they can identify with and there must be an acknowledgment of the fact that there are a number of people in our community who have poor literacy skills. I urge the Prime Minister to accept the recommendations of the committee and to ensure that the Australian people are presented with an honest question on 6 November and that that question is the long title recommended by the committee:
A Bill for an Act to alter the Constitution to establish the Commonwealth of Australia as a republic, with the Queen and Governor-General being replaced by an Australian President.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Republic Referendum Joint Committee</title>,Committees,2,1
"Danby, Michael, MP",ALP,1999-08-09,"—Without appearing to be an idealist, this report of the Joint Select Committee on the Republic Referendum shows this parliament at its best. Despite an unfair schedule set by those who are perhaps half-hearted about public and parliamentary consideration of this issue, I believe we, together with the dedicated analytical staff, produced a refinement of the deliberations of the Constitutional Convention. As the member for Gellibrand outlined, the 14 recommendations of this committee are quite conservative. I endorse them and I will return to them and some of the minority reports at a later time.
As our chair, the member for La Trobe, and the member for Barton have elaborated, the committee's report on both the question to be put to the voters and the details of the operation of the minimalist republic reflects the weight of testimony given to the committee by members of the public and experts alike. The denigration of the chair and his coalition colleagues by the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business says more about him than the report. All members 
 of this committee were impressed by the chair's neutrality and indeed inscrutability on the republic during the committee's hearings.
For the Australian public, only one recommendation of this committee is crucial. Do we focus, as the weight of testimony suggested, on the outcome of this referendum or do we focus on all the important but secondary mechanics? On this issue, and particularly the Prime Minister's attitude to this issue, the republic will stand or fall. It is clear that, ever since the issue was raised years ago by his archnemesis the former Prime Minister Paul Keating, the current Prime Minister wants two things from this process. First, he wants the Australian public to think he is even-handed in his approach to this issue—hence the importance of keeping his word to the Australian people on the Constitutional Convention, due consideration by our select committee and a vote where both sides have a chance to campaign evenly and where people are allowed to make a choice. Second, he wants the Queen to remain as our head of state.
The Prime Minister insists that these two ends are not mutually exclusive and that he will accept the verdict of the Australian people with equanimity whether they agree with him or not. Yet, at the first real point of conflict between John Howard `the fair broker of the republic referendum' and John Howard `no closet could hold him Queen's man', it is not difficult to see which is the real John Howard. Of course, the Prime Minister is entitled to be a constitutional monarchist. Members of this committee, however, would ask him to allow the essence of the change proposed for a republic to be considered.
The wording of this referendum question is crucial. As the government's pollsters are undoubtedly telling them, many Australians will look at the ballot paper on the day of the referendum and decide there and then how to vote. The government and this Prime Minister want the last thoughts in the minds of the people to be, `This is giving more power to politicians,' for this is exactly the effect of the wording preferred by the government. The wording they would prefer focuses on one aspect of the process of the new system—as many people here who have spoken on the 
 report have outlined—and that is the formal appointment by parliament of the new head of state.
The Joint Select Committee on the Republican Referendum on which I served suggested a formulation which focused on the essence of the change. We do not do this just because we consider ourselves better wordsmiths than the Prime Minister—the man who can meet, and has met, Les Murray at the drafting table on equal terms. We do not uncritically parrot an Australian Republican Movement formulation either, nor do we include every variation lobbied for: the nomination process, the power of the Prime Minister to dismiss and the seconding by the Leader of the Opposition in the long title. We look at the substance of the two variations. That is really the difference between the two long titles. The committee's proposed wording deals with the outcome, whereas the government's preferred wording deals with one aspect of the new process—the final aspect—for appointment of a President by a two-thirds majority of parliament. Coincidentally, if you can believe that, the aspect of the process highlighted by the government's proposal is one of the least popular aspects of the new model.
This is not a time for games. The members of the committee with whom I served put the interests of the nation above their own political imperatives. We worked together—Liberal, Labor, Democrat, National, republican and monarchist alike. We proposed a form of words to put the question to the Australian people which fairly and in a balanced way reflects the nature of the issue at hand. As the chair, the member for La Trobe, said, only one person dissented from the essence of the long title of this report. I commend this report and the work of the chair and the staff of the committee to this House.

"Charles, Bob, MP",LP,1999-08-09,"—On behalf of the Joint Select Committee on the Republic Referendum I present the committee's advisory report, incorporating dissenting reports, on the Constitution Alteration (Establishment of Republic) Bill 1999  and the Presidential Nominations Committee Bill 1999  together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—Mr Acting Speaker, I am delighted to present the report of the Joint Select Committee on the Republic Referendum on our inquiry into two bills which, if they become law, will alter our constitution to take Australia from a monarchical form of constitutional democracy to a republic.
The first bill, the Constitution Alteration (Establishment of Republic) Bill 1999, proposes changes to the Australian Constitution itself. The proposals in this bill contain the constitutional changes necessary to establish Australia as a republic. The long title of this bill will be the question put to Australian voters at a referendum later this year and 
 presently scheduled for Saturday, 6 November. The second bill considered by the committee, the Presidential Nominations Committee Bill 1999, would become an ordinary act of parliament. This bill sets out provisions for the operation of a committee to consider public nominations for an Australian President. Together the two bills give effect to decisions taken at the 1998 Constitutional Convention held at Old Parliament House, Canberra.
The committee considered that it had three responsibilities with respect to its inquiry: firstly, to determine that the bills to the largest practical extent accurately reflected the outcomes of the Constitutional Convention; secondly, that if the bills were enacted and the referendum successful that the republican model introduced would work as intended; and, thirdly, to give the Australian people the opportunity to comment on this historic and important legislation.
The committee concluded that the legislation does accurately reflect the recommendations of the Constitutional Convention. I compliment the Attorney-General and the referendum task force for producing legislation that should work in the manner intended. While there were many dissenting views both on the form of the republican model and various detailed and separate technical and legal issues, the bills represent a competent response to the chosen model. The committee agreed that these two important bills should proceed, and today's report contains 14 recommendations that the committee believes will improve the operation of the proposed laws.
In order to give the community the opportunity to comment on the legislation, public hearings were held in Sydney, Adelaide, Brisbane, Broome, Canberra, Darwin, Hobart, Melbourne, Newcastle, Perth and Townsville. The committee inquiry was well supported by expert and non-expert witnesses alike. We were pleased that a wide range of Australians came forward to meet and talk with us. The committee agrees this inquiry was, as one witness in regional Australia observed, an example of democracy in action.
The first of our 14 recommendations addresses the long title of the bill to amend the Constitution. This was, and is, a highly charged political issue, as the words themselves will form the question to be asked at the referendum, and some believe they will have an influence on the outcome of the vote. The committee agreed that the long title of the bill should describe in concise and simple terms the essential purpose and outcome of the proposed amendments to the Constitution. The long title proposed by the committee is:
A Bill for an Act to alter the Constitution to establish the Commonwealth of Australia as a republic, with the Queen and Governor-General being replaced by an Australian President.
The committee believes that this proposed long title represents a substantial improvement on that of the bill currently before the parliament. While none of the committee members thinks it is perfect, for an all-party committee this proposal represents a collegiate decision reached in the spirit of consensus and compromise. In the circumstances the committee concluded that its long title was more than reasonable.
Mr Acting Speaker, I say to you there was not one dissenting voice when the final form of words of proposed recommendation No. 1 was put to the committee. Even after written dissents were taken into account, only one member of this committee has formally dissented from the agreed long title. Other recommendations of our report address variously the appointment of the President, the powers of the President, the removal of the President and other issues related to the bill.
The other recommendation on which I will briefly comment is recommendation 3, which would effectively provide that a Prime Minister who nominated for President a person other than a candidate selected by the nominations committee would be required to table a statement in writing justifying such action. The committee received a great deal of input regarding the nomination process because many people felt strongly that it was the nomination process itself which gave legitimacy to allowing the parliament to be the ultimate approver of a Prime Minister's choice of the person to be President. Accord 
 ingly, the committee felt that the nominations committee process should be given absolute legitimacy so that, while not denying the Prime Minister the opportunity to select a person not so nominated, if he and the Leader of the Opposition were unable to otherwise agree, any such decision should effectively be reported to the nation in writing.
The committee travelled across Australia taking evidence for this inquiry and on 9 July took evidence in Broome. That day was a noteworthy anniversary in Australia's constitutional history. The 9th of July this year was the 99th anniversary of a certain enactment of the British parliament—63 and 64 Victoria, chapter 12—which contains the Australian Constitution. I reflected on that British enactment at the beginning of the committee's meeting in Broome. I thought how appropriate it was that on this anniversary the Joint Select Committee on the Republic Referendum was reviewing the bills that could lead the way for Australia to become a republic.
In the first half of the 1990s when the republic debate was beginning to achieve some national profile, I considered the issues and declared my personal position. I said that by birth, heritage and inheritance I was a republican. But I believed that our monarchical form of constitutional democracy had served Australia well and I was unconvinced that any change to this successful democratic system could be justified on grounds other than improvement to democracy itself. I also rejected the views of those who stated that a change of Australia's head of state to give effect to a republic was inevitable.
In 1996 when the President of the United States, Bill Clinton, and his wife Hillary visited Australia, the Prime Minister hosted a state luncheon in the Great Hall of Parliament House, Canberra. At the beginning of that auspicious occasion, the Prime Minister rose and proposed a toast to the President of the United States of America. We toasted and resumed our seats. Then the President of the United States rose and proposed a toast to the Queen. We toasted, but in a room of over 600 people you could literally hear the proverbial pin drop. Since that time I have listened carefully to the debate about our head of state 
 and constitutional reform. I attended day 1 of the Constitutional Convention and followed its activities avidly.
 At the beginning of this inquiry I said that I was, and would remain, neutral on the question until I tabled the committee's report. I have read the written submissions and  listened carefully to the Australians who appeared before the committee to give evidence and I have considered carefully the legislation itself and its likely effect on our particular form of constitutional democracy. I hold strongly to the view that our unique model incorporating pieces of Westminster and the United States and Switzerland examples is probably the most successful of any constitutional democratic system in all of the world.
Notwithstanding that the monarchy has given us stability and non-partisan convention, I believe that any form of monarchy has for the 21st century finally outlived its usefulness. The idea that in 2000 or 2001 inherited privilege and power has any place in a democratic institution is at total variance with my belief in people based politics and equality of opportunity. I believe the model proposed by these bills is a good model and will allow us to move from a constitution based on the Crown to one based on the people in a smooth seamless transition. I applaud the Constitutional Convention for its sensible compromise outcomes. I support these bills. I will vote yes at the referendum and I will serve any public role which might assist any of the groups supporting the yes campaign.
I want to record my thanks to the committee secretariat—Claressa Surtees, Rose Verspaandonk, Hilary Manson, Anna Gadzinski and Robert Horne—for an outstanding job in a very tight time schedule under often very difficult circumstances. I would also like to thank the ever-reliable staff of our parliamentary reporting staff. To my colleagues on the committee and particularly the deputy chairman, the member for Barton, who is at the table, I say: it was a long winter of no holidays and hard work and I thank you for your cooperation, your sensibilities and for a positive outcome. I say to the executive that the 14 recommendations of this report repre 
 sent a largely unanimous outcome. I ask the executive to take serious consideration of what my committee and I believe are sensible recommendations. I commend the report to the House.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,2,2
"McClelland, Robert, MP",ALP,1999-08-09,"—I have pleasure in endorsing the report of the Joint Select Committee on the Republic Referendum. I also thank the secretariat for their tremendous work: it really was outstanding. Opposition members are very grateful for that. In terms of the position of the chairman, I can honestly say that not one member of the committee was aware of his personal views on this issue, and that is to his credit. He approached the matter as a chairman should, with objectivity and balance, and I think that approach flowed through to the sincerity of the other members of the committee. The report is a sensible and balanced one. Overall, it gives the government's proposals, which will be put to the Australian people in November this year, a clean bill of health and, indeed, a strong endorsement.
Regarding the most controversial issue, the long title, it is true, as the chairman of the committee said, that the desire of committee members was to have a concise and simple question. Indeed, we found that the wording proposed in the bill is misleading. It is misleading because it talks about only one aspect of the presidential nominations procedure. It says that the President will be chosen by a two-thirds majority of both houses of parliament. For a start, the role of the parliament is not to choose; it is only to approve two earlier steps that are a necessary precondition to that third, final check occurring.
The first step is recommendation by a nominations committee, of which more than half will be community members. A short list of nominees is put to the Prime Minister. For the first time in the selection of our head of state there will be community input in the nomination process. For the first time, any member of the community will be able to nominate someone for the position of head of state and, for the first time, there will be community involvement in the vetting of those nominations. That is a significant advance on the current situation where, 
 effectively, the Governor-General is appointed by one man, namely, the Prime Minister. That is the first precondition.
The second precondition is a joint nomination, moved by the Prime Minister but, importantly, seconded by the Leader of the Opposition. This nomination procedure—if the bill is approved at the November referendum—will ensure that our head of state is not a politician but, to the contrary, is above politics, someone who is acceptable to both sides of parliament. Only after those two essential preconditions occur—the community committee nomination recommendation and the joint motion by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition—can the third and final step occur where the parliament has the final check on the procedure, as it were. Those elected directly and those elected by proportional representation in the Senate come together in a joint sitting, major and minor parties all reflected, and two-thirds of those representatives of the people of Australia must approve the choice. Again, that will ensure that the person put before the parliament is above politics, is an Australian that we will all be proud of, is an Australian that will unify the nation and is someone who represents Australia on the international stage with stature and is effectively one of our own.
That is the important three-step procedure in the nomination process. We actually found that to refer to only one of those steps occurring was misleading because it enabled people to erroneously and misleadingly say that the outcome of this procedure would be a politician's President. It will be anything else. It will be of the community and it will be a part of the community, as the President must be under the system that is proposed.
For that reason, we said that there were two options. One option was to avoid the misleading indication in the current question and to include the whole procedure that I have outlined. It was agreed that if we did that the question would be far too long and perhaps an impediment to people considering the issues when they vote on the question. We thought it better to have a concise and simple question. Instead of talking about the procedures, we said: what are the outcomes that we 
 are talking about? That outcome was establishing a republic with the Queen and Governor-General being replaced by an Australian President. For the first time, our Australian head of state must be an Australian citizen. That is the essential outcome of the procedure that we have endorsed. It is impossible for anyone to sensibly cavil with that brief, short and concise description of what the outcome will be.
That outcome was arrived at in the spirit of consensus and compromise. At the deliberations there was not one dissenting voice and, as the chairman has pointed out, those who were not in attendance at that time have since had the opportunity to put in dissenting reports, and there has been only one dissent on that question. I know a number of people regrettably locked themselves into a corner before they had considered the report's recommendations. I would ask them to now step out of that corner, have regard to these very solid, very balanced recommendations and reassess the issue. The Australian people are entitled to have a fair and honest proposition put to them in November and we have proposed one that we think achieves that goal.
A number of other issues are canvassed in the report and other members will have the opportunity of speaking on those. One of the other more significant areas of controversy was in respect of the dismissal procedure. We have found that currently there is effectively no restriction on the Prime Minister deciding to dismiss the Governor-General. The only restriction is one of time; that is, the time it would take the Prime Minister to obtain the consent of the Queen to that process. But we note that, in this day of electronic communication, that is effectively no impediment at all; that that request for approval, and approval, could be effectively instantaneous. There is in fact under our current system no accountability for the Prime Minister dismissing the Governor-General. This bill proposes for the first time that accountability be brought into the procedure. We have recommended that the Prime Minister, as soon as practicable but certainly, as the current bill provides, within 30 days, must relate his or her decision to dismiss the President to the House of 
 Representatives, and the House of Representatives then deliberates on whether it approves or does not approve.
We note that the House is the master of its own procedures and the House could be expected to afford procedural fairness to the President who was dismissed. We also note that the political reality is that, if the Prime Minister's action in dismissing the Governor-General was disapproved of, it would effectively end the career of the Prime Minister, either by way of a motion of no confidence in the Prime Minister as an individual or, if the House chose, as master of its own destiny, to move a motion of no confidence in the government of the day. That would also be available. To suggest that there is no accountability in the proposed bill is false. In fact, there is effectively no accountability in the current system and accountability will be introduced for the first time. So the committee has given approval to that process of accountability as an appropriate check in the overall system.
We have noted that the powers of the President will be the same as the Governor-General. The best advice is to that effect. So, again, any suggestion that our system of government will be changed by this bill in November is wrong. It will preserve the Westminster system that we have all come to cherish, but it will give Australians an Australian citizen as our head of state for the first time.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,2,2
"Bishop, Julie, MP",LP,1999-08-09,"—In accordance with usual parliamentary practice, the terms of reference of the Joint Select Committee on the Republic Referendum were narrow and specific. As a member of that committee I saw our task as twofold: first, to consider whether the provisions of the bills effectively implemented the republic model that emerged from the Constitutional Convention and, secondly, to consider whether, if the bills were passed, they would operate effectively or, to put it another way, whether there were flaws in the drafting or in the intended operation of those bills.
It was a narrow brief and one for which I put aside personal views. In my deliberations on the committee I sought to remain as 
 objective as possible, given the specific terms of reference. There was neither the opportunity nor the ability for committee members to push alternative models for a republic.
The issue which seems to have created most interest is that of the long title. It is apparent from reading previous questions posed in previous referenda that there is some art to drafting a short and concise question which may, in fact, cover deeply complex, constitutionally difficult or even procedurally difficult proposals. Previous referenda questions have been short, concise, not cumbersome and go to the basis of the change, not to the procedures by which the change is to be effected.
The constitutional change being sought in this instance is the change from one system to another. However one looks at it, whether we describe it as a change from a constitutional monarchy to a republic or a change from a crowned head of state to an appointed head of state, it comes down to asking: what will be the fundamental difference when Australians wake up on the morning of 7 November 1999, assuming for the moment that the referendum succeeds? The fundamental change is that the Queen and the Governor-General would be replaced by an Australian President—an Australian head of state who the convention recommended be called President. That is the basic proposal.
It is hard to please everyone, for essentially seven different elements of constitutional change were put forward by various witnesses as being necessary inclusions, in their view, in the long title. Some thought the inclusion of a nominations committee was the most significant change; others thought it was the selection by the Prime Minister of a nominee. Others thought it was the approval by a two-thirds majority of both houses of parliament, while others thought it was the dismissal procedure. Others believed that it would be appropriate to mention the 30-day ratification by the House. I, for one, believed that the most significant matter for consideration was the powers to be given to the head of state. Appointment and dismissal are procedural matters, the process by which the head of state enters or departs the scene. At the heart 
 of it all must be the powers that the head of state holds.
Section 4 of this report deals in some detail with the issues of the powers and the views that were expressed. We were concerned to ensure that the Constitutional Convention resolution, that the powers of the President shall be the same as those currently exercised by the Governor-General, was adhered to. Given the weight of the expert constitutional evidence before the committee to the effect that the President would have the same powers as those which the Governor-General has at present—and that was a majority view, not an absolute view—and given the uncertainty that already exists as to whether an exercise of the reserve powers or the content of the conventions are presently justiciable, I believe that the committee's recommendations in chapter 4 show the committee has gone as far as it is able to give effect to the recommendation of the Constitutional Convention that the powers of the President should be the same as those currently exercised by the Governor-General.
Having dealt with the question of non-reserve and reserve powers and the conventions as best as we were able, I was able to support a proposed long title that the Queen and the Governor-General be replaced by a President, as inherent in that is the issue of the powers of the President. I commend the report to the House.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,2,2
"Roxon, Nicola, MP",ALP,1999-08-09,"—The tabling today of the report of the Joint Select Committee on the Republic Referendum is a vital step in a long but cautious process of recognising our maturity and independence as a nation. It is part of making sure that our institutions of government actually match our strong sense of identity and our capacity as a nation to stand on our own two feet.
It is on the record that I am a committed republican. I, like many Australians, particularly those of my generation, have always had a strong sense of pride in being Australian and in the unique freedom and strength and security that our country gives us. There was a jolt for me, however, when I became a solicitor in Victoria and again when I was 
 elected to this place, because I was twice required to swear allegiance to the Queen—a queen who, despite her personal good works, holds an office which arouses in me no sense of shared identity. I cannot automatically respect a title that she has not earned but simply inherited, and I cannot respect her wealth of immense proportions or the religiously exclusive nature of her office. Such ideas are in fundamental opposition to the Australian values of equality, openness and opportunity.
But the committee's work and recommendations were not about whether committee members were republicans, monarchists or otherwise. Our job, as other speakers have indicated, was to assess the working capacity of the bills. The committee has been able to conclude that the bills will ensure that our democratic system of great stability will continue, but with an Australian head of state who can be a symbol of our shared aspirations as a nation. A fair question must include this fundamental change. It is a change of personnel, if you like, not a change of the system itself.
On the issues of the appointment and dismissal of the President and the powers of the President, one must, to measure the proposal fairly, compare it to the total lack of process and accountability currently involved in appointing a Governor-General. The Prime Minister currently has total power to do this. The Queen does not play any role and has no independent discretion in supporting the Prime Minister's recommendations. People are largely unaware of this because the power to dismiss a Governor-General by the Prime Minister has not been exercised. The political reality and other checks within our system ensure that this is the case.  
In my view, the great strength of the proposal examined by the committee is that it is a very conservative proposal—and for a good reason. It maintains our system of government—one of the most stable and vibrant democracies in the world. All the scaremongering in the campaign to come will not detract from the fact that the experts told the committee that the powers of the President will be the same as those of the Queen and 
 the Governor-General. The bills go to great lengths to give some added protection to the position of the President and to add accountability in the process of a Prime Minister appointing a new President. Even on the question of dismissal, the checks and balances in our system come from the Westminster system of responsible government, combined with our bicameral system where the Senate is usually not controlled by the government of the day. These valuable protections remain unchanged and will ensure the stability of our democracy.
As the member for Barton has briefly touched upon, the open and participatory nomination process is a great advance on the current system of nomination. However, I would like to briefly address recommendation No. 2 of the committee, which is an important recommendation which would improve that public nomination process. Specific reference could be made to the diversity of our Australian community so that, when the Prime Minister appoints community members to a nomination committee, we make sure that those on the selection committee truly do represent the diversity of our nation. I draw attention to that important recommendation.
However, a fair question cannot refer to the nominations process unless it includes all that process. To refer to only a part, as the bills currently do and as the Prime Minister is reported as supporting, distorts that process. All or nothing might be sensible but including all the detail was regarded as far too cumbersome, confusing and difficult and therefore was decided against by the committee.
I commend the report to the House and to the Prime Minister. He might not like the recommendations, but they are fair and thorough and they give Australians a chance to make an informed choice about our future on 6 November. This is a choice about our identity and our independence. I will be urging people to vote yes. Australians do not need to be wedded for life to this particular model of the republic, but they do need to be able to respect themselves in the morning. I hope that, on the morning of 7 November, we will be able to respect ourselves and be proud to call ourselves a truly independent nation.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,2,2
"Baird, Bruce, MP",LP,1999-08-09,"—I rise to endorse the report of the Joint Select Committee on the Republic Referendum which was presented by the chairman of the committee, the member for La Trobe. I commend him on his skill and great objectivity in chairing the committee. I also commend the secretariat of the committee who had a difficult task and did an outstanding job in a very short space of time. I commend them.
The report represents almost the unanimous agreement of those involved in the committee. It is a reflection of the views reported to the committee at the public hearing on the analysis of the  Constitution Alteration (Establishment of Republic) Bill 1999  and the  Presidential Nominations Committee Bill 1999 . It is clear that the key questions to be resolved were, firstly, the powers of an Australian President and whether they would be equal to those of the Governor-General; secondly, the composition of the committee selected to choose the President; thirdly, the relative powers of the Governor-General and the Prime Minister in the event of one wishing to dismiss the other; fourthly, reporting to parliament on the grounds for dismissal of the President; fifthly, the subsequent impact if the Parliament does not approve the sacking; and, finally, the text of the question to be put to the Australian people in the referendum on 6 November 1999.
On the issue of the long title of the bill to be put at the referendum, I strongly support the recommendation of the committee. Surely the key question to be asked is whether the Australian nation believes that it is time to replace the Queen as head of state and her representative, the Governor-General, with an Australian head of state. It is important that the Australian public recognise what is taking place in terms of the transfer of powers of the head of state. To add that the President should be chosen by two-thirds of the parliament is superfluous, as the `bipartisan appointment of the President' model was the one chosen by the Constitutional Convention when it met in early February last year.
Obviously, there is much debate over whether the President should be popularly elected or elected by a two-thirds majority of 
 parliament. The decision has been made by the Constitutional Convention as to the preferred model. The convention decided that the direct election option would open the new republic to the situation where, in the event of a conflict between the head of state and the head of government, it would not be clear whose power would prevail.
It seems appropriate to put a simple question to the public in November asking them to decide between retaining the monarchy as the head of state or moving to a republican system of government. It is apparent from the input of the constitutional lawyers who appeared as expert witnesses before the committee that there was a division of opinion amongst them as to the legal impact of the proposed legislation. However, it would appear that in general the powers of the President would be the same as those of the Governor-General. Firstly, the checks on the choice of the President by the Prime Minister will be far greater than currently apply to the choice of Governor-General. Secondly, the recommendation for President will come from a diversely comprised committee and the Prime Minister will be required to report to the House if he decides not to accept the recommendation of the committee. Currently, the Prime Minister, with the endorsement of the cabinet, decides who to recommend to the Queen for instalment as Governor-General.
Thirdly, in the event of dismissal of the President by the Prime Minister, the Prime Minister must explain within 30 days the reason for the dismissal. Currently, the Prime Minister can effectively dismiss the Governor-General without any formal mechanism to justify the action. With these main areas sorted out and, indeed, near unanimous support for all recommendations, the committee has achieved its primary objectives.
It has long been on the public record that I support this country moving towards a republican system of government. I think this country is extraordinarily fortunate to have been colonised by Britain and to have retained its main religion, language, legal system and cultural heritage. It is clear that these continue to serve the Commonwealth well. I do not see that the choice between the 
 monarchy and an Australian republic is what Henry Lawson referred to as people having to decide between `the old dead tree and the young tree green'. However, he was spot on when he said that it is a choice between `the land that belongs to the Lord and Queen and the land that belongs to you'.
As a trade commissioner in Germany, I found that people constantly asked why we had a Queen in the UK who lived 12,000 kilometres away. The importance of becoming a republic was crystallised for me during the Olympic bid—and I was also interested to hear the chairman's reasons. As part of a lobbying team, we often found ourselves in one corner of a restaurant lobbying for Sydney while, in the other corner, the daughter of the Australian head of state, Princess Anne, lobbied IOC officials for Manchester. This experience shows that, where our interests no longer overlap, we have to establish our own national identity as a mature country with our own place in the world but one with special links to Britain.
The monarchy stands for privilege and the establishment, whereas Australia has been built on strong egalitarian principles and our own mateship. That is the basis on which the recommendations contained in this report have been put together and I heartily endorse them. I recommend the report to the House.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,2,2
"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,1999-08-09,"—I rise to support the report of the Joint Select Committee on the Republic Referendum and its recommendations. The Prime Minister authorised the formation of the committee, and it has taken detailed submissions both in writing and at public hearings. The purpose of the committee being formed and receiving those submissions was to listen to the opinion of the Australian people and, once hearing the evidence, to make recommendations to the parliament in the hope that the Prime Minister would in turn listen to the opinion of the Australian people and attempt to present them with an honest, unbiased referendum question on 6 November. I believe that was foremost in the minds of practically all the members of the committee. We worked hard to see whether we could come up with a question that 
 would be unbiased and which would be put to the Australian people on 6 November.
The current long title of the legislation is both misleading and inaccurate. It was supported by all constitutional monarchists who addressed the committee at its public hearings, and it was rejected by all people who supported the republic. If you have a situation where one group supports it 100 per cent and another group rejects it, then it is obviously not a fair question—it is biased. The fact that the long title currently says `chosen by a two-thirds majority of parliament' is misleading and not a true and accurate portrayal of the appointment process. The process, as other speakers have mentioned, is that a short list be prepared by the Presidential Nominations Committee and from that the Prime Minister would choose a person to be nominated. That person would be nominated by the Prime Minister and that nomination would be seconded by the Leader of the Opposition. That is how the person would be chosen. It would then be put to the parliament and a two-thirds majority of the parliament would be needed to ratify that choice. The choice is not made by the two-thirds majority of the parliament; the choice is, in effect, made by the Prime Minister after a long period of public consultation. The proposed long title selected by the joint select committee is accurate: it does not seek to mislead people and it does not seek to give a biased view.
Other issues canvassed quite extensively and considered in detail by the committee were the appointment and dismissal process and the reserve powers of the President. The committee concluded that the proposed legislation broadly mirrored the current position, although there would be greater accountability in the appointment and dismissal process.
One issue I would like to spend a little time addressing is recommendation 14. It is quite an important issue that was brought to the attention of the committee. This recommendation identified the need to have a relevant community education campaign. Written education is not appropriate for all people. Indigenous Australians find it difficult, and are unable in a number of cases, to read 
 written information sent to them. They need to have that information disseminated to them in a meaningful way. I would like to suggest that perhaps Aboriginal medical services, land councils, ATSIC or special groups of the Australian Electoral Commission could be involved in the dissemination of that information by going out to those communities to give them that information.
The information must be in a format that is relevant to young people. It must be something that they can identify with and there must be an acknowledgment of the fact that there are a number of people in our community who have poor literacy skills. I urge the Prime Minister to accept the recommendations of the committee and to ensure that the Australian people are presented with an honest question on 6 November and that that question is the long title recommended by the committee:
A Bill for an Act to alter the Constitution to establish the Commonwealth of Australia as a republic, with the Queen and Governor-General being replaced by an Australian President.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,2,2
"Danby, Michael, MP",ALP,1999-08-09,"—Without appearing to be an idealist, this report of the Joint Select Committee on the Republic Referendum shows this parliament at its best. Despite an unfair schedule set by those who are perhaps half-hearted about public and parliamentary consideration of this issue, I believe we, together with the dedicated analytical staff, produced a refinement of the deliberations of the Constitutional Convention. As the member for Gellibrand outlined, the 14 recommendations of this committee are quite conservative. I endorse them and I will return to them and some of the minority reports at a later time.
As our chair, the member for La Trobe, and the member for Barton have elaborated, the committee's report on both the question to be put to the voters and the details of the operation of the minimalist republic reflects the weight of testimony given to the committee by members of the public and experts alike. The denigration of the chair and his coalition colleagues by the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business says more about him than the report. All members 
 of this committee were impressed by the chair's neutrality and indeed inscrutability on the republic during the committee's hearings.
For the Australian public, only one recommendation of this committee is crucial. Do we focus, as the weight of testimony suggested, on the outcome of this referendum or do we focus on all the important but secondary mechanics? On this issue, and particularly the Prime Minister's attitude to this issue, the republic will stand or fall. It is clear that, ever since the issue was raised years ago by his archnemesis the former Prime Minister Paul Keating, the current Prime Minister wants two things from this process. First, he wants the Australian public to think he is even-handed in his approach to this issue—hence the importance of keeping his word to the Australian people on the Constitutional Convention, due consideration by our select committee and a vote where both sides have a chance to campaign evenly and where people are allowed to make a choice. Second, he wants the Queen to remain as our head of state.
The Prime Minister insists that these two ends are not mutually exclusive and that he will accept the verdict of the Australian people with equanimity whether they agree with him or not. Yet, at the first real point of conflict between John Howard `the fair broker of the republic referendum' and John Howard `no closet could hold him Queen's man', it is not difficult to see which is the real John Howard. Of course, the Prime Minister is entitled to be a constitutional monarchist. Members of this committee, however, would ask him to allow the essence of the change proposed for a republic to be considered.
The wording of this referendum question is crucial. As the government's pollsters are undoubtedly telling them, many Australians will look at the ballot paper on the day of the referendum and decide there and then how to vote. The government and this Prime Minister want the last thoughts in the minds of the people to be, `This is giving more power to politicians,' for this is exactly the effect of the wording preferred by the government. The wording they would prefer focuses on one aspect of the process of the new system—as many people here who have spoken on the 
 report have outlined—and that is the formal appointment by parliament of the new head of state.
The Joint Select Committee on the Republican Referendum on which I served suggested a formulation which focused on the essence of the change. We do not do this just because we consider ourselves better wordsmiths than the Prime Minister—the man who can meet, and has met, Les Murray at the drafting table on equal terms. We do not uncritically parrot an Australian Republican Movement formulation either, nor do we include every variation lobbied for: the nomination process, the power of the Prime Minister to dismiss and the seconding by the Leader of the Opposition in the long title. We look at the substance of the two variations. That is really the difference between the two long titles. The committee's proposed wording deals with the outcome, whereas the government's preferred wording deals with one aspect of the new process—the final aspect—for appointment of a President by a two-thirds majority of parliament. Coincidentally, if you can believe that, the aspect of the process highlighted by the government's proposal is one of the least popular aspects of the new model.
This is not a time for games. The members of the committee with whom I served put the interests of the nation above their own political imperatives. We worked together—Liberal, Labor, Democrat, National, republican and monarchist alike. We proposed a form of words to put the question to the Australian people which fairly and in a balanced way reflects the nature of the issue at hand. As the chair, the member for La Trobe, said, only one person dissented from the essence of the long title of this report. I commend this report and the work of the chair and the staff of the committee to this House.

"Rudd, Kevin, MP",ALP,1999-08-09,"—I move:
That this House calls on the Government to:
(1)	 note mounting customer dissatisfaction across Australia at the deterioration of Telstra's 013 directory assistance services;
(2)	 note, in particular, (a) customer irritation at increasing delays in operator response times, (b) operators cutting off customers before being able to provide further clarifying information on inquiries, (c) the intrusion of Telstra advertising of its 12456 `75 cents plus call costs' service in addition to (d) the plethora of other Telstra advertising forced on Telstra customers before finally being given access to the telephone numbers they are seeking;
(3)	 acknowledge the impact of Telstra staff reductions on the quality of 013 services; and
(4)	 direct the Australian Communications Authority to amend its performance standards for Telstra to require Telstra to provide a simple 013 directory service with proper staffing levels and without audio advertisements for other services.
Every now and then in this parliament we come across issues which may not feature at the top of the headlines of the 6 o'clock news, which may not be on the front pages of our metropolitan newspapers and which may not form a large part of the great debates we have in this chamber on tax policy, on health policy or on Australia's place in the region or in the world. But the fact that such issues may not appear in the headlines does not make them unimportant, because such issues often go to the very heart of what makes life convenient and bearable for average members of the community as they go about their daily lives and their daily business. It is in this context that I refer to the declining standards 
 of Telstra's 013 directory assistance services on which many Australians depend.
I initiated this private member's motion because I believe that something needs to be done about the corporate arrogance of Telstra in its management of its 013 directory assistance service. I initiated this motion because something needs to be done about the impact which this depleted service is having on ordinary citizens and on ordinary business people trying to earn a dollar. Once upon a time—perhaps in a golden age, in a quieter, more gentle time—you would dial  013 and you would actually obtain the information that you wanted from a polite operator within a reasonable period of time. If you did not have all the information that you needed, then a discussion would ensue between you and the operator until you got to the heart of the question: which street, which suburb, `It could be spelt this way' or `It could be spelt that way', and then you would finally get the number.
However, that kinder, gentler age appears to have passed because, since the Gordon Geckos took over Telstra management, we have in fact a much more rugged and rigorous pursuit of the bottom line. What you find now when you dial 013 directory assistance services is any of the following. First, you could be very lucky to get through in the first place, because the first of the, shall we say, anti-Pavlovian responses which Telstra management have engineered in their 013 directory assistance service is to effectively prevent you from getting through at all. I have noticed of late that that has improved, but for the first six months of this year and much of last year it was actually very hard to get through.
Second, when you actually get through these days, if you do not provide the operator with all the accurate information that is necessary to get the telephone number which you are searching for in the first place, you are then placed automatically onto the automatic response system of prerecorded messages which tell you, with all the emotion and warmth of Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, `We are very sorry but the information you have provided is inadequate,' and you are 
 then cut off and left somewhere in the electronic abyss.
But what has really annoyed people the length and breadth of this country is the third device employed by Telstra management, and that is the proliferation of this plethora of audio advertisements which now pollute 013 directory assistance services as we use them today. When you dial 013 today, it is virtually impossible simply to obtain the information. Before you get it, you are confronted with any one of a number of ads, of which the common theme tends to be, `Why are you using 013? You could be using 12456 and, for just 75c plus call costs, we will put you through straightaway.'
In fact, if your blood pressure is already under some challenge, the worst thing you can do when dialling 013 is to be confronted by that ad which says, in a very soft voice, `Are you in a hurry?' Pause. `Well, if you would like to get through really quickly, what you should be doing is using 12456 and pay 75c plus call cost.' Pause. Then you hear the revving of an engine in the background. The voice continues, `And we will put you through straightaway.' If your blood pressure was sitting at 120 over 80, it has at that stage risen to 150 over 80 and a consultation with a physician needs probably to ensue.
These are just some of the ads which now pollute the service. It raises the very basic question as to why Telstra's management are doing this. Under the performance standards determined by the Australian Communications Authority, Telstra are required to provide a free directory assistance service to the consumers of Australia. The bottom line is that Telstra hate it. Telstra management hate having to provide that service free of charge. So what do they do instead? They reduce the staff employed in this service so that it becomes a much less efficient service. If you speak to Telstra staff, you often find that those staffing the directory assistance services are under enormous pressure because many of their number, hundreds of their number, have been removed from Telstra's employ.
The second strategy which Telstra management have employed is to introduce the ads to which I have just referred. The object is 
 plain: to discourage people from continuing to use the service—fewer staff, less efficient service, plus this temptation of the waving of the attraction of a 12456 75c plus call cost ad in order to get you off the 013 hook and put you onto the 75c charge service, which goes to contribute to Telstra's bottom line.
That of itself raises a further interesting point. When we speak of Telstra, we are not speaking of one of our more impoverished public corporations. If we read the 1997-98 annual report of Telstra, we find that in that year alone Telstra were able to provide a $1.8 billion dividend. I would suggest that this company are not in dire straits. I would suggest that their financial capacity to still provide a reasonable 013 directory assistance service free of charge to the community exists. They are not financially challenged. What they are doing is sailing very close to the wind. They are required by law to provide this service free of charge, yet they are trying, using every trick in the book, to wriggle out from under.
What is the impact which all this has on the community and the economy? Many of us are, shall we say, a captive market. If you are using a mobile telephone, there is no possibility at all of using the White Pages. Try using the White Pages while you are driving across the Sydney Harbour Bridge. I would suggest if you do that you are likely to get into considerable difficulty with the constabulary. When you are seeking to obtain a telephone number from out of your city or interstate, again you are entirely dependent on 013 directory assistance services.
Going to the economic cost and not just the inconvenience, according to the Australian Communications Authority there were 443 million directory assistance calls in 1998-99. According to my watch, the time of each of the audio ads on Telstra's new 013 service is about 11 seconds, which means that each year we are now subjected to 4,873,000,000 seconds of unsolicited ads from Telstra. That is 81 million minutes or 1,350,000 hours. What is that actually costing the economy? If you were to average out that, for example, babysitters are remunerated at about $10 an hour and corporate lawyers and accountants 
 about $300 an hour, let us hit an average and just say it is $25 an hour in terms of cost to the economy. What we are looking at in one year alone is a loss to the economy of $33,750,000. Again I would suggest that a company which has got $1.8 billion in its back pocket in the last dividend which it delivered to its shareholders is not exactly stretched.
Beyond all of these arguments, it also comes down to this basic point. What Telstra are doing is irritating the hell out of consumers right across this country, both business consumers and private individuals. The number of telephone calls I have had to my office from people right across this country since first raising this issue in the Main Committee in late June has been quite surprising. This is really getting to people in a very fundamental way. Telstra said they would like to come and talk to me about it. They made an appointment for their national corporate affairs manager to come and visit me in Brisbane. Unfortunately, he cancelled. I have not heard back from him since. I gather that I have been put onto call waiting.
The community are angry about this. They want action, and that is why we have this private member's motion before us today. It is not for entertainment purposes; it is for a substantial end, and that is to attract bipartisan support—I look forward to those opposite contributing to this debate—which will enable us to put a common resolve to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts so that he can in turn provide an instruction to the Australian Communications Authority to fundamentally vary the performance standard which currently governs Telstra's 013 directory assistance services so that change can be delivered.

"Neville, Paul, MP",NP,1999-08-09,"—In speaking to this motion today, I recognise the contribution of my colleague the member for Griffith to this debate, but I do not agree with everything he said in every aspect of this motion. I do not agree that the government 
 should direct the ACA to amend the performance standard in relation to the 013 service, certainly not at this stage. I think there is a need for some balance in this debate. The authority does not in fact have a standard in place for the service and, while the government intends to continue to urge Telstra to improve the level of the service that is offered, it does not consider the level of service as unacceptable. On the evidence that I have seen, neither do I.
The nature of the service has changed with the introduction of voice recorded announcements, advertisements and the like, but there is no ground in the service itself for government intervention. The government already urges Telstra and other telecommunications companies to offer directory assistance, and I think my colleague may have confused the provision of the basic 013 service with the irritants within it. I agree with him about the irritants, but I think you have got to look objectively at what the performance standard of Telstra has been.
In a recent survey by Telstra itself, it was found that 80 per cent of customers rated the 013 service as good and 90 per cent of customers expressed satisfaction with Telstra's operator assisted services on the whole over the past 18 months, so you could hardly say that the basic service was at fault. I think there are more fundamental issues here. My colleague also said that in law—and it was interesting to hear him say this because I do not think he might have researched this as thoroughly as he normally researches things—
—My heart wasn't in it.
—I suspect his heart was not in it because if he had scraped below the surface he may have found that his colleagues in the 1993-96 parliament did not mandate that calls should be free. In fact, it is worth noting that charges for directory assistance are not prohibited under the Telstra Corporation Act 1991, introduced by the previous government.
Mr Rudd interjecting—
—No, I am not—quite the contrary—and my basic premise would be that we should not. Because of the signifi 
 cance of this service to the community, possible directory assistance charges are subject to notification and disallowance under this act. This means that Telstra would be required to formally notify the minister of any proposed changes to directory assistance and what those charges might be. The minister has the power to disallow the proposed charges. The minister may also, after receiving a report, put it to the independent regulator, the ACCC. If the minister forms the opinion that charges are not in the public interest, he may reject them. The legislation—and this is the Labor Party's legislation—does not allow a proposal to be rejected without the ACCC first reporting on it, so it is not a clear-cut case of these things being stopped in law. But I think there is a much stronger case for ensuring that the 013 service be improved and, of course, that it not be charged for.
The current cost to Telstra and how it manages the service are more important aspects than just concentrating on the irritants, which my colleague has spoken about. As recently as 19 November, Telstra's Frank Blount said that cross-subsidies for funding the 000 emergency service and providing directory assistance free of charge cost the company and its shareholders $240 million a year. I think this is justified because, if you have a look at what the various services that Telstra provides bring in to Telstra, it is of the order of a billion dollars. So I do not think there is any case whatsoever for charging for these services. Obviously, the advertising on the 013 service goes some way to ameliorating this, but I think that a charge would be excessive and I agree with many of the aspects of what my colleague the member for Griffith said.
The utilisation of the service is very interesting, with 440 million users a year or 20 calls on the 013 service for each Australian. That is a fair number. But, when you take that against the billions of calls that are provided by the public—paid calls—the number of 013 services as a percentage of Telstra's overall performance is only four per cent. The ACA, in measuring Telstra's performance, found that over the last two years 57 to 73 per cent of the calls were answered within 10 seconds. 
 That part is not an irritant but it is an irritant when, as my colleague said, you get on an 013 line and you get a plethora of advertisements. However, they have said in their examination of the performance standards of Telstra that most of these calls have now been reduced to under 10 seconds in answering.
Sometimes I wonder whether in this whole thing Telstra may not have been its own worst enemy. I think too that commercial considerations have taken precedence over service in another very interesting area and that is the phone books. We are getting more and more phone books, especially in provincial areas. I suppose you cannot alter this much in the capital cities because the Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide phone books are precisely that and they have beside them the Yellow Pages. But what I find very irritating in the country—and I use my own phone book, which is 3½ centimetres thick, as an example—is that only 1.1 centimetres of that is the White Pages. The Gatton phone book is 1½ centimetres thick and only half a centimetre is taken up by the White Pages. The Dalby phone book is similarly a thin volume. But you can bet there are plenty of businesses in Toowoomba with advertisements in both Yellow Pages—in both the Dalby book and the Toowoomba book.
I think that, for example, the division of the Darling Downs book into two sections like that is more to generate Yellow Pages revenue than to make the White Pages readily available to people in the region who might conceivably use those numbers. A lot of people in Warwick and Toowoomba would have business to transact in places like Dalby. They are all Darling Downs centres with similar crops and similar economic backgrounds; firms would service the Darling Downs. To divide that into two phone books would be part of the problem why people rely on an 013 service. While some would argue that it would be convenient to have the Yellow Pages in one regional phone book, it would be preferable to have larger regions with individual Yellow Pages and more people having access to the phone book than to have them incorporated in one copy. In this way we could reduce to a large extent un 
 necessary utilisation of the 013 service. So, broadly speaking, I agree with many aspects of my colleague's proposal but an element of balance should be taken into account when we are talking about this rather sensitive issue.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Telstra: Directory Assistance Services</title>,Private Members' Business,3,1
"Ripoll, Bernie, MP",ALP,1999-08-09,"—It is no coincidence that the decline of the Telstra 013 directory assistance service can be traced back to the introduction of the Telstra 12456 Call Connect service. The Call Connect service is similar to directory assistance. Both services assist people who do not have the number they need. Directory assistance gives you the number required, and a few things you do not require, whereas Call Connect puts the customer directly through to the number without delay.
But this is not the important distinction between these two services. The important distinction is cost and service level. Directory assistance is a community service provided to customers by Telstra at no charge. Call Connect, however, is a value added service that Telstra charges for at a rate of 75c plus call costs. Directory assistance competes directly with the new Call Connect service and, given that Call Connect makes money for Telstra and that directory assistance costs Telstra money, it is not unreasonable to question whether Telstra would prefer that a greater number of their customers use the profit making Call Connect service.
Whilst the convenience of Call Connect will inevitably be measured against the more traditional services, directory assistance must not be degraded simply to provide Call Connect customers with a greater comparative advantage. But, unfortunately, services have been degraded, so much so that the most cynical of us might suspect that Telstra has nobbled 013 directory assistance. We may assume that Telstra, which quite naturally and quite openly supports the greater use of Call Connect, is driving people away from directory assistance to the use of the more expensive alternative.
Telstra is driving people away from directory assistance by reducing the overall service provided. By shifting resources away from directory assistance, response times to calls 
 have increased, service levels have decreased and the whole process is further delayed with intrusive advertising. Most offensive is the advertising of the 12456 service on the 013 line. Is this what we are to expect of other Telstra services in the future, particularly with the government's view that it should be completely privatised? The 013 directory assistance service is not a marketing opportunity for Telstra and should not be used as such. It is a community service and should be kept as that.
We can all do without the jingles and, if the evidence is now that more people are using the 12456 service, it is probably because they are tired of listening to advertisements that tell them how silly they are for using such a slow service on 013 when they could go to the much quicker new 12456 service. Will Telstra now be advertising on the 000 emergency number? I certainly hope not. But maybe they see it as just another marketing opportunity and a captive audience. The increase in response times for directory assistance indicates that staffing levels are not matching demand levels. The important fact here is not that directory assistance callers wait longer for an operator than Call Connect customers—although that certainly is the case—but that directory assistance customers wait longer for an operator than they did in the past, before the introduction of 12456.
The provision of an alternative service is no excuse for declining resource levels in the 013 service and is no excuse for declining service levels right across Telstra. The emphasis on getting each call over with quickly means that callers are now put through to a recorded voice when the operator cannot locate the number from the information provided. No longer is there any attempt to seek alternative information and to get the person through; you either call back or you dial 12456 as suggested in the earlier message. Yet those who pay the premium rates for Call Connect services are receiving the patient human assistance that we all once received on the 013 line.
The adverts, which are not featured on the Call Connect service, make the entire call last substantially longer than historically provided 
 by the other service. Delays through advertising and increased response times, along with decreasing service levels and human contact, increase the frustration customers feel with the old service and, henceforth, they probably should go to 12456, although I do not advocate it. Doesn't this make customers who use Call Connect see that they are getting a much better, faster and more efficient service? The creation of user-pays services such as Call Connect should not be funded or enhanced by cost cutting of other Telstra services.

"Barresi, Phil, MP",LP,1999-08-09,"—I am pleased to be able to speak on this motion. The member for Griffith stated in his address that in the golden old days he could be connected to the operator who was a real live human being. Of course, in the golden old days you also had an operator to connect you to your neighbour's telephone next door. The humble telephone has been with us since Federation, but today we do not need an operator to connect us or a rotary dial to finger the number or even a cord to plug into the wall. The PMG has gone, Telecom has gone and Telstra no longer has a monopoly in this country. Instead, we have greater access to phones, greater choice about telephone products and services and, not least, better connections and cheaper rates for local and long-distance calls. We still have telephone books and now we have Internet access to the White Pages  and Yellow Pages  for most cities around the world. We still have 013, and it is still free.
The use of the 12456 number is a consumer choice; it is up to the callers as to whether or not they use it. Like many who use this service, I am sometimes annoyed by Telstra's direct connect and other promotions that are often heard down the line, but maybe we should all take a powder over this issue. What have we come to that we cannot wait 10 seconds for the information we seek? A call to any other business seeking information would result in our being placed on hold for that time, and sometimes for a lot longer. If you question that, try calling Comcar to get a reservation. All businesses have dispensed with dead air time for calls on hold, so we 
 hear the radio and often commercial and even corporate promotions. Why should Telstra be any different? It provides a free directory service which fields over 440 million calls a year, and that figure is rising by around 20 million calls a year. Indeed, the vast majority of customers have expressed satisfaction.

"Theophanous, Andrew, MP",ALP,1999-08-09,"—I want to bring to the attention of the House a very serious matter, and that is a rebellion by detainees at the Maribyrnong Detention Centre on 22 July this year. I have raised this matter with the department, with the Ombudsman, and in the media. I am very concerned because the issue has been kept under wraps and the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs has attempted, in my opinion, to cover up what has happened.
I have raised this matter with the Ombudsman because, on 22 July, about 35 people rebelled in that centre and wrecked furniture, computers, videos and other things in the centre. You might want to ask: why did that happen? The reason, from what I have been able to determine, is that there had been a series of protests and grievances by the detainees over a long period of time. In fact, 55 of them had signed a letter to Amnesty International the week before, protesting about the conditions in the centre. Unfortunately, all of that was ignored and the rebellion resulted.

"Howard, John, MP",LP,1999-08-09,"—I move:
That this House expresses its deep regret at the death on Saturday, 3 July 1999, of Reginald Bishop, AO, Senator for the State of South Australia from 1962 to 1981, Postmaster-General from 1974 until 1975, Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence from 1972 until 1974 and again from June until November 1975 and Minister for Repatriation from 1972 until 1974, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.
Reg Bishop, as he was well known by all his parliamentary colleagues and many other friends, was born in Adelaide in February 1913. As was the case with so many of his generation, he left school at the age of 15 and began work with the South Australian Railways as a clerk at the Islington workshops. At the age of 24 he was appointed a full-time organiser for the Australian Railways Union. During World War II he served for three years, from February 1943 until his discharge in January 1946, with the Royal Australian Air Force, including postings to Darwin and Borneo. 
After the war he returned to the union. He was defeated in a ballot for the South Australian state secretary's job in 1956, a loss described by him at the time as his greatest disappointment. However, the same year he was elected secretary of the South Australian Trades and Labour Council, a position he held until entering federal parliament as a senator from South Australia in 1962. He also served as a commissioner of the South Australian Board of Industry and as an executive member of the Australian Council of Trade Unions between 1956 and 1962. He was elected to the Senate in 1961. His term began in 1962, and his career lasted for 19 years until his retirement in June 1981.
In his maiden speech Reg Bishop spoke of his commitment to the old Labor principles of standing up for the workers, the problems of unemployment and the need for rail standardisation. Throughout his parliamentary career Reg Bishop took considerable interest in committee service as well as, of course, stints as a minister in the Whitlam government. He served as Minister for Repatriation for two years and as Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence for two periods, but he will best be remembered as the last Postmaster-General of Australia between 1974 and 1975. It was under the ministerial stewardship of Reg Bishop that Telecom and Australia Post were first created. He also oversaw the abolition of television and radio licence fees and participated in the introduction of public broadcasting and FM radio. After leaving politics, Reg Bishop was appointed an officer in the General Division of the Order of Australia for his service to politics and government.
Can I say on a personal level that I saw a good deal of Reg Bishop during the years that we served together in this parliament. I found him on all occasions and without exception to be possessed of unfailing courtesy and decency in the dealings that I had with him. He was a man who was very true to his orthodox Labor Party beliefs. He served his country with great commitment in war. He retained a very close link with those of his colleagues in the Senate from both sides of the parliament who had served in World War II.
I well remember speaking to him briefly at the funeral of the late Senator Ken Anderson who, like Reg Bishop, was a digger returned from service in World War II. He was a man who all of us liked and respected. We may have disagreed with him on political issues, but he was possessed of unfailing basic courtesy and decency. He made a long and very praiseworthy contribution to the Australian Labor Party and to the trade union movement. I know he will be long remembered and very sadly missed by his former colleagues.
Reg lost his wife, Connie, only in 1997 after more than 60 years of marriage. He died in Adelaide on 3 July at the age of 86. On behalf of the government, I extend to his children, Romola and Phillip, and to their families the sincere sympathy and condolences of the government and the members of this parliament.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Bishop, Hon.

"Beazley, Kim, MP",ALP,1999-08-09,"—I join the Prime Minister in his kind remarks about the late Reg Bishop, former senator and long-time stalwart of the Australian Labor Party. I particularly appreciated the Prime Minister's personal references and I am sure that his son and daughter will appreciate them too. I think his remarks will also be appreciated, particularly in South Australia, by the many people in the Labor Party who knew and loved him. As the Prime Minister said, Reg Bishop was born in Adelaide in 1913 and he died on 3 July in Adelaide at the age of 86.
As my colleague Chris Schacht, who worked for him for a period, put it in his recent obituary, Reg Bishop was the personification of the term `the cream of the working class'. He spent a considerable amount of his life, before he became a member of the Senate—apart from the period when he served in the RAAF in Darwin and Borneo from 1943 to 1946—as an active and senior trade unionist. He experienced bitterness in his defeat in a ballot for secretary of the railway union but immediately sought for himself an even grander recompense, if you like, by becoming Secretary of the Trades and Labour Council. He was, during that period, senior not only in the councils of the trade union movement in 
 South Australia but also in the labour movement generally at the national level.
Reg Bishop's interests were reflected immediately in the maiden speech he made when he entered the Senate in 1962. As you would expect, his maiden speech demonstrated the preoccupations that he had had over the years with the management of the economy, the life of the average Australian worker and, given his railways experience, his views about the standardisation of railway gauges. He started in parliament by honouring the contribution he had assisted in making to that point in time.
Having entered parliament, however, he broadened out his interests very considerably. During the 1960s, as well as being prominent in debates in the parliament and in the party on economic and industrial matters, he was also a most active participant in what were the dominating debates of the day—debates about foreign affairs and defence. He was a very strong participant in those debates. His contribution reflected the experience he had in World War II. He had a very deep commitment both to veterans who had served in that war and the defence of Australia. His argument in those debates, in a period of often considerable difficulty for the Australian Labor Party, lent weight and authority to the view that his political party could be trusted with government and the defence of the nation.
Those commitments were rewarded and they were reflected in the appointments he enjoyed when he was elected to the frontbench by the Labor Party after the victory of Gough Whitlam at the 1972 elections. He served as Minister for Repatriation and, for most of that period, as Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence. He was a most active Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, using his position to maintain contact with his successors serving in the armed forces. He was in many ways a very human face of the government to those serving personnel when he held that office.
Probably the ministerial achievements with which Reg Bishop will be most associated in the long term came with his short appointment as the last Postmaster-General of the 
 nation and his initiatives in that portfolio. He presided over what was arguably the largest administrative reform in Australia's history when his portfolio was carved out into separate statutory authorities in the form of Telecom and Australia Post. The Postmaster-General's Department was an enormous bureaucracy, and very large bureaucracies were created in those statutory authorities. But his hands-on attitude was much reflected in an anecdote which Chris Schacht revealed in the obituary he wrote in the Australian of 14 July. For those devotees of the Yes, Minister program it is quite a nice little anecdote. It reads:
On one occasion, the PMG's department proposed to put up public phone charges by three cents a call to 13 cents. This meant that two and one cent coins would have to be used. Reg queried what the conversion cost would be—the department officers said it would not be costly at all. He insisted on being taken to the nearest PMG workshop for a demonstration. Once there, a young technician pointed out how complex the adjustment would be. The proposal was dismissed with a curt `I thought it was a
expletive deleted—
idea—and so it is.' The Department was thereafter more wary about trying to `Yes, Minister' Reg.
Reg was a very ordinary soul but a very bright soul. He served until his retirement from the Senate in 1981 and he was able then to look back on some very strong support that he had given to two great Australian political reformers—Gough Whitlam and Don Dunstan—in the context of the affairs of the South Australian branch. Reg Bishop was a very active member of the South Australian branch.
I met Reg when I was a youngster and used to come to Canberra because he was a friend of my father's, but I guess I best remember Reg in the 1980s when he ran a most constructive dining club in South Australia on a Friday afternoon. He did so for many years. If you ever wanted a decent feed of fish and some really decent Labor conversation, you could go to the dining club that Reg Bishop, among others, presided over. Mick Young always made absolutely certain that when you visited Adelaide you had the opportunity to avail yourself of the wisdom of various old 
 retired colleagues from the South Australian branch, and much wisdom there was to be had. Though those particular affairs stopped their regularity in recent times, he was always a cheerful and informative companion to spend some time with.
As the Prime Minister said, our condolences go to his son Phillip, his daughter Romola and the rest of the Bishop family.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Bishop, Hon. Reginald, AO</title>",Condolences,7,1
"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,1999-08-09,"—I too would like to join the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in the condolence motion for Reg Bishop. Reg was a friend of mine, he was a very good friend of my father's and of course he was a great servant of the labour movement. His credentials as a union official and representative of Australian working people stand as second to none and he devoted his life to the public service of those people. Descriptions of him have been made, but I think the humble one was by Joan Rydon in her book, A biographical register of the Commonwealth Parliament , where she referred to him simply as a railwayman and a union official. Reg of course was much more than that, because underneath it he was the servant of the labour movement that elected him to so many important positions, not only within the Australian Railways Union and his ability to represent through the South Australian Trades and Labor Council but also as a member of the ACTU executive from 1956 to 1962.
Reg entered the parliament and for the period 1962 to 1981 served it and the South Australian electorate with distinction for that 19 years. His capacity in terms of representation was recognised in that he served in both Whitlam governments, first of all as Minister for Repatriation, where his service in the RAAF during World War II in both Darwin and Borneo gave him great understanding of the needs of the people whom he represented in his ministerial capacity. As Australia's last Postmaster-General he presided over significant changes, which the Leader of the Opposition has referred to. I think it is significant that Gough Whitlam referred to those achievements, in terms of Australia Post and 
 Telecom, as the largest administrative reform in Australia's history.
I want to place on record my appreciation of the service Reg gave to the country and to the labour movement. His contribution was essential to the underpinning of both the Whitlam and the Dunstan governments. He will be remembered as a tremendous servant of the movement but as a great family man as well. I join with the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in extending our condolences to his children, Romola and Phillip, to his grandchildren, and his great-grandchildren and to the rest of the Bishop family.

"Nelson, Dr Brendan, MP",LP,1999-08-09,"—I move:
That the House:
(1)	 recognises the very high and entrenched levels of unemployment that exist within indigenous communities throughout Australia;
(2)	 recognises that fewer indigenous Australians actively participate in the labour market and have lower skill levels compared to the rest of the general population;
(3)	 welcomes the federal Government's specific commitment of $115 million towards tackling unemployment within indigenous communities in Australia; and
(4)	 calls on governments at all levels to work in cooperation with indigenous communities and employers in addressing these critical problems.
When Graham Richardson was the health minister in the Keating Labor government, late in January 1994 he went with the 60 Minutes  television crew to remote parts of Northern Australia specifically to visit and speak about the problems in indigenous Australia. When he was asked by the 60 Minutes  journalist Charles Woolley why after 11 years in government the situation was still so bad, Mr Richardson replied: `I have spent a lifetime reading polls, and concern for Aboriginal people is not in the top million issues worrying the voters.' Therein lies an insightful and significant clue. So often political leaders follow, rather than lead, public opinion. At that time, when I was President of the Australian Medical Association, I endeavoured to do whatever I could with the organisation that I led to make it a political issue.
This entire policy area has been characterised by a number of things: by divided re 
 sponsibility, by buck-passing, by limited expertise in policy development, by limited consultation with indigenous Australians and, as a consequence, by poor compliance with programs that were subsequently delivered to them. Indigenous Australians have also seen their culture substantially destroyed, children forcibly removed from parents through at least three, if not four, generations of indigenous Australians and so-called communities artificially created in areas distant from traditional areas, services and regional foci of economic activity.
Why then should we have an indigenous employment initiative? When I had the privilege of meeting with the Minister for Employment, Education, Workplace Relations and Small Business in Melbourne with approximately 50 chief executives of some of Australia's largest companies, the CEO of Anglicare said to the assembled meeting in a light-hearted manner: `At some point all of you might need our services, that is, nursing home care, in particular.' I made the point to the meeting in response to his comment that, were it to be a meeting of indigenous Australians, only one in three would live long enough to even be likely to be in need of aged care services, let alone be receiving them.
The reason why there needs to be an indigenous employment initiative, as I reminded that meeting and as I remind this House today, is that indigenous Australians born today still have less than a one in three chance of living to the age of 65. If Mrs Hanson and her acolytes are listening to this, I challenge them to go to these places where Aboriginal people live and ask themselves if they would like to change places with them. Aboriginal people today enjoy, if you could describe it as that, life expectancies 15 to 20 years less than will be enjoyed by non-indigenous Australians. That is the same as countries like Haiti, Ghana, India and Papua New Guinea, countries to which we send substantial amounts of aid.
We live in a country where we define ourselves through our work. If you do not have a job in Australia you feel that you are of less value to your family and to society than someone who does. Yet indigenous 
 Australians live in an environment in many cases that I would describe as existential despair. Added to that are the problems associated with not having a job. What this country needs, and desperately so, is a deficit reduction strategy on Aboriginal death, intolerance and prejudice. Whatever else we achieve as a nation, if we make no progress in these areas we will have achieved nothing.
In 1996 indigenous Australians had an unemployment rate of 23 per cent. If you remove from those figures the Community Development Employment Program and the Work for the Dole program, which 34,000 indigenous Australians work under, the unemployment rate would be closer to 40 per cent. Twenty-eight per cent of indigenous employment is directly in the public sector, compared with 18 per cent for the rest of the work force. One-quarter of those Aboriginal people who work work as labourers and unskilled workers compared with 10 per cent of the rest of the population.
Labour market growth is concentrated in the private sector, and it is here where jobs for indigenous people need to be created. I went to one far northern New South Wales town with a population of approximately 12,000 people and not one indigenous Australian was employed in a business in the private sector. Any of those indigenous people who were employed in this town were employed in some kind of government or government related agency. That is an indictment of all of us, not just the business people of this community.
The government and, in particular, the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, are to be congratulated for the first substantial instalment in addressing this untenable situation. The minister—along with the Minister for Employment Services, the member for Herbert, some of my colleagues and I—quietly visited remote and regional indigenous communities. We also met with some of Australia's largest employer organisations. I saw the minister listening, looking and asking, as well as feeling the tension in some of the things put to us. He then developed a policy package 
 with his department and indigenous representatives. 
The policy has three main elements and represents $115 million as a first instalment on a comprehensive employment strategy for indigenous people. It has three essential strands. The first is an Indigenous Employment Program which involves a new program to replace the Indigenous Training Program, otherwise known as TAP. It effectively doubles indigenous specific program funding from $25 million to $50 million.
The second strand of the employment initiative is an indigenous small business fund. I am reminded of the recent remarks by Mr Noel Pearson—a prominent and, in my view, a highly respected indigenous leader—who described the parasitic effect of welfare on indigenous Australians. This speech is probably not the place to say it, but I would say that in the end it is welfare that is killing indigenous people.
This initiative involves a fund to improve access to business preparation and support. Some $6 million is set aside from the Regional Assistance Program and the Office of Small Business over three years and also another $5 million is to be contributed to ATSIC. In other words, it is trying to assist indigenous people by giving them access to things that many of us take for granted such as the opportunity to establish and develop a small business if you are so inclined.
The third part of the strategy is enhancements to the Job Network. These new measures are specific to indigenous job seekers. Job Network for indigenous people will involve smaller catchments. It will also establish indigenous employment specialists—people who specifically find jobs for indigenous people—and will require more providers to include indigenous servicing strategies. The program also includes wage assistance of up to $4,000 for an employer for 26 weeks of full-time employment and eligibility cards are now being issued to indigenous people.
It also includes a bonus of $2,000 for each CDEP participant who is placed in a full-time job. Chief executives of a substantial number of organisations have now committed themselves in writing to specific indigenous 
 employment. The CEO of one of Australia's leading banks, whom I spoke to recently about a completely unrelated matter, said, `It was interesting that when I was meeting with the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations he actually asked me how many indigenous people I employ.' In other words, the government and the minister are trying to stimulate the corporate conscience of Australia to see what they are prepared to do to specifically address the indigenous employment situation.
We also have structured training and a voluntary service to the Indigenous Communities Foundation which shows teachers, engineers or professional persons of any sort who want to volunteer where to go, how to get there and how to most appropriately volunteer. It is a program which actually provides a means by which the beneficence of people can be applied. (Time expired)

"Zahra, Christian, MP",ALP,1999-08-09,"—In addressing the private member's motion moved by the honourable member for Bradfield, I think it is important to place in context the opposition's response to the indigenous employment initiative. To do that, I will draw on the remarks of the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs, the member for Banks. On 25 May, the member for Banks, Daryl Melham, said of the Indigenous Employment Program:
Can I just say at the outset that Labor welcomes the initiative announced by Peter Reith today. Those initiatives are an acknowledgment that we have had three wasted years from this government on indigenous employment. It is recognition by Peter Reith himself. In his speech today he had this to say. He said that there have been some good things that we can build on. Most of the good things were Labor initiatives.
Today's announcement has two initiatives by the government which we welcome—the CDEP initiative and also the voluntary service to Indigenous Communities Foundation. Everything else is a rebadging of Labor programs that we introduced when we were in office. Peter Reith said that he has learned a bit recently, and I think he has. That is why we welcome all of these initiatives today 
 and we welcome a return to a bipartisan approach to Aboriginal unemployment and a bipartisan approach to trying to obtain real full-time employment for indigenous Australians. I think that what we have seen today is a wet Peter Reith and a Peter Reith who has gone out there listening to the community and to indigenous communities.
The good thing about today as well is that Aboriginal people were at the table and they have all been involved in this. It is a partnership. That is where the government has failed up until now. That is where the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs deserves condemnation and so does the Prime Minister. Their missionary approach to indigenous affairs for the last three years, their attempt to mainstream everything and to cut and burn and slash ATSIC has been a failure. Minister Reith today basically belled the cat. That is why Labor applauds all the initiatives that he has announced today—all of the initiatives.
I stress that we have no criticism of anything that Peter Reith announced today because most of it is a rebadging of what we did. But bear this in mind: it is an admission by Peter Reith that we have had three wasted years under this government.
That is what the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs, Daryl Melham, had to say about the indigenous employment initiative. For my own part, as a new member of this parliament I particularly applaud the role that the member for Bradfield has played in this important issue. I think he has played an important role behind the scenes, quietly listening and supporting the government in the introduction of this employment initiative which we believe so strongly in.
Most people in Australia do not understand the significance or the depth of the problem facing Aboriginal Australians with regard to employment. In 1991, indigenous people in work only constituted 37 per cent of all indigenous people in Australia. In 1996, this had increased to only 41 per cent. Indigenous unemployment in Australia is 23 per cent and constitutes a giant 41 per cent of all Aboriginal people if you exclude CDEP participants. This is against a general rate of unemployment of 7.4 per cent in Australia.
The problem is enormous and we should not understate or try to diminish how significant the problem we face is. This is why we need a bipartisan, non-political approach to this significant issue. That is why I praise the efforts of the government in this particular 
 regard. As I mentioned, I also applaud the efforts of the member for Bradfield to be bipartisan in his personal approach to dealing with this issue.
We owe it to Aboriginal people in our community in Australia to make sure that we put politics to one side and focus on the issue of getting Aboriginal people into work. As everyone would understand, it is only by reducing the gap between the living standards of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people that we can truly achieve reconciliation in this country.
As significant a problem as Aboriginal unemployment is, it is not insurmountable. We in this parliament need to understand that a little better. In my own electorate, I have had the good fortune of being involved with the Aboriginal people—the Gunai or Kurnai people—in the Gippsland region. For about 18 months I served as the Chief Executive Officer of the Central Gippsland Aboriginal Health and Housing Cooperative, so I have had a good deal of experience in relation to these issues. It is important to try to place in local context the scale of Aboriginal unemployment. In the Latrobe Valley, if we were able to put some 20 or 30 Aboriginal people into work, nearly every Aboriginal family in the Aboriginal community in the district would benefit. The benefit of those people being in work would be felt by nearly every family in that community. This is significant. If you look at the thousands of people who are in work in the Latrobe Valley or the district, you realise how small a step this would be for us to achieve a significant step in reconciliation with Aboriginal people.
We must ensure that every opportunity to lower Aboriginal unemployment is taken up. This is a profoundly important issue that Australia as a nation needs to face up to. The gap between the living standards of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians is enormous. We need to recognise that, in the past, when there has been a great deal of wealth in the Australian community, Aboriginal people have not benefited from that wealth. Looking at my own electorate again, I reflect on the days when the Latrobe Valley was a very wealthy region, that is, when we had a lot of 
 jobs in the Latrobe Valley. But the Aboriginal community in the Latrobe Valley was still impoverished. There was still a very high and significant level of unemployment in the Aboriginal community in the Latrobe Valley. When mainstream Australia and the Latrobe Valley were rich, the Aboriginal community was poor. Now that we in the Latrobe Valley have suffered from a high unemployment rate of 17 per cent for some years, the Aboriginal community is still poor. As a fundamental principle for the development of our region, we need to recognise and accept that, when we improve, when we do get jobs created in the Latrobe Valley, we make sure that we bring the Aboriginal community with us to make sure they benefit from the fruits of employment.
Most people recognise that true empowerment comes primarily from employment and from being a part of the mainstream of Australian society. For too long Aboriginal people have been placed at the margins—to one side—of mainstream Australia. It is only by placing Aboriginal people at the centre of our society that we will see significant gains made in reducing the gap in living standards which exists between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians.
For my own part, this is something which I am enormously committed to. In the months to come I intend to initiate an Aboriginal employment conference in my electorate to try to alert some of the larger employers in my electorate to some of the opportunities which exist in assistance from government and other training units—such as the good work of the Koorie units at the Central Gippsland Institute of TAFE and the Gippsland campus of Monash University, and the Aboriginal cooperative in Morwell—which can support Aboriginal employees in their various workplaces. Long before this initiative was announced, this was something that we intended to proceed with. Now that this initiative has been announced it is probably even more appropriate that we proceed to bring in the big business sector—and, for that matter, small and medium employers—and set a challenge for them in terms of targets which can be achieved and which will make a 
 significant dent in Aboriginal unemployment in our region.
Looking at it on a localised scale, if we brought 40 employers together in Gippsland and set them the target of, over the next six or 12 months, creating jobs for or employing only 40 or 50 people, this would significantly impact on Aboriginal unemployment in our region. This is something which would profoundly change the make-up of Aboriginal employment in the Latrobe Valley. This is what my constituents want to see. They do not want to see Aboriginal people in despair or suffering from poverty and disempowerment. They want to see Aboriginal people given the opportunity to play a constructive role in our community and to be participants in our society.
The indigenous employment initiative which the government has announced is the type of initiative which the Labor Party in office would be proud to call its own. It is something which we on this side of the House are profoundly supportive of. This is an issue which must be dealt with in a bipartisan manner. It is important to reflect on this: if the government deals with this issue in a bipartisan manner and puts forward programs which support Aboriginal people, then it can look forward to a great deal of support from me and from every member on this side of the House. That has been shown by the maturity and the support that has been provided by the shadow minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, Daryl Melham, which I applaud.

"Wakelin, Barry, MP",LP,1999-08-09,"—I am pleased to support this motion moved by the member for Bradfield, Dr Nelson, today. I congratulate the member on his commitment to the issues of Aboriginal people throughout Australia. I can well recall the Minister for Health and Aged Care, Dr Wooldridge, shortly after the 1996 election talking about the issues of Aboriginal health in Australia and referring to it as a generational problem. By that he meant that the problems had become so entrenched for so long that we are facing a very long haul to turn the state of health or the quality of physical and mental life of indigenous Australians around. I 
 believe that is the case with unemployment for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities throughout Australia.
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island communities throughout Australia take many forms. They can be in regional centres, remote centres and in isolated communities right out in the middle of Australia that most Australians could only ever imagine. The statistics have been well documented: the 1996 census indicates an unemployment rate for indigenous Australians of 23 per cent. Once you take the Community Development Employment Program into account, you have an unemployment rate of 40 per cent plus.
At this point I acknowledge the contribution of the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, Peter Reith, in terms of his Aboriginal employment program. I have had personal experience working with the minister in my own electorate at Port Augusta where there is a significant Aboriginal unemployment issue. He spent a full day working with the community listening, watching—as was indicated earlier—and showing his fully-fledged commitment to this blight on our national economic and social scene. So Peter Reith's commitment and the government's backing of $115 million to specifically address the Aboriginal employment problem are a very welcome contribution.
As stated earlier, it is effectively a three-pronged policy: the employment policy, the small business fund and a more focused Job Network. The employment policy itself has seven elements: wage assistance for employers; a placement incentive for community development employment projects; a package involving major private sector companies wishing to recruit; projects providing structured training and employment opportunities for Aboriginal people in the private sector and with Aboriginal community organisations; a voluntary service; a national indigenous cadet program; and a public awareness project aimed specifically at Aboriginal communities, employers and the broader Australian community. The small business fund will be jointly funded by ATSIC to assist new in 
 digenous businesses and to help further develop existing businesses.
I share an experience that the member for Herbert, Mr Lindsay, mentioned regarding the visit of the minister, Mr Reith, to Palm Island recently. Palm Island apparently has so much potential and yet so many entrenched problems. The opportunities for employment on Palm Island are extremely limited. Answers to the community's problem have to come from within the community. The Palm Island Council recognises this. Along with the member for Herbert, I welcome Mr Reith's commitment in this area.
In terms of a model for the future, the Shalom Christian College is where the students come from very disadvantaged backgrounds and are taught the fundamentals of reading and writing. Every building at the college has been constructed by the young people of the community. It is now at a stage where the construction crews are tendering for contacts out in the private sector. So there is a community that is just starting out and showing great promise as to what can be achieved. That is a basis on which the parliament, beginning with this motion today, can further develop the proposition.

"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,1999-08-09,"—I stand today to wholeheartedly support the sentiments put before the House today in the motion moved by the member for Bradfield, Dr Brendan Nelson. Having examined the government's indigenous employment policy that was released recently, it was pleasing to find that some of its initiatives echo previous Australian Labor Party policy.
It is heartening to learn that when the government was looking for unemployment solutions and employment strategies it did not just not take the attitude that it knew what was best. Indigenous Australians were involved at the highest levels in advising the government as to what would work and what would not work.
The 1996 figures show that the rate of unemployment for indigenous Australians was 23 per cent compared with nine per cent for all Australians. According to the Chairman of ATSIC, Gatjil Djerrkura, it would take around 
 7,000 new jobs each year for Aboriginal Australians to reach employment equity. And when you have 70 per cent of indigenous employees in the public sector, it is important to ensure private sector jobs are created for indigenous employees.
Wage subsidies were originally introduced under Labor's Working Nation program and have been resurrected as part of our indigenous employment policy. I congratulate the government for taking wage subsidies on board as an employment incentive that really works. I believe that the provision of these wage subsidies will certainly improve the employment prospects of indigenous Australians.
I now move to the Indigenous Small Business Fund, which I support because it not only assists indigenous Australians in setting up businesses but also encourages these small business owners to employ other indigenous people. It will also support skills development and business prospects by providing services such as mentoring, networking and market development.
I particularly commend the government's interest in negotiating links with private companies through the chief executive officers for Indigenous Employment Project. I believe that this project, which aims to create viable, commercially based employment opportunities, has the capacity to be extremely successful. Further, the major companies who are prepared to become involved in the project will be assisted by flexible funding. It is heartening to see that a number of companies are prepared to employ Aboriginal people, who are our nation's most disadvantaged group.
The issue of structured training is important, particularly when it is considered that around a quarter of indigenous employees are employed in unskilled labour. We need to ensure that our Aboriginal community has access to skills training so that indigenous Australians can improve their employment prospects. The Training for Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders program is focused on achieving this, particularly in organising indigenous apprenticeships and traineeships.
In my electorate of Lowe there are only about 450 indigenous Australians. However, I am committed to ensuring that my constituents have access to these programs.
Indigenous Australians have a high susceptibility to disease and a shockingly low life expectancy. Giving indigenous Australians access to wage subsidies and labour market programs, as well as other employment initiatives, is one way to address some of the problems faced by the indigenous community, such as poor health and lack of employment opportunities.
In concluding, I would like to take the opportunity to mention national reconciliation, an issue very dear to my heart. It is a fact that more than one million Australians signed the sorry books. We as a nation must be prepared to apologise for the injustices indigenous people have suffered at the hands of earlier generations. I would like to recognise a sorry time in Australia's history and apologise unreservedly for the shameful way Aboriginal people have been treated since white settlement. It is long overdue for the government to do likewise.
As the member for McMillan has just said in this House a few moments ago, the ALP would be very proud to call this policy its own. In a spirit of bipartisanship, I commend the motion to the House.

(2)	 condemns the Prime Minister for his continued support of the immoral practice by which employers use employee entitlements for day-to-day cash flow and investments as if these workers funds were an unsecured interest free loan to their employers;
(3)	 notes in particular the Prime Minister's defence of this practice in a radio interview with Alan Jones in which he said: `But the point I am making is that in reality, because of cash flow needs, many firms actually use this money for the day-to-day operation'; and
(4)	 calls for orders of the day, private members' business, Nos. 19 and 27, standing in the names of the member for Brisbane and the member for Prospect respectively, to be brought on forthwith, with a view to dealing with the issue of protecting employees' accrued entitlements without further delay.

"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,1999-08-09,"—I speak today on the issue of Australian broadcasting regulation. During the adjournment debate on 21 June 1999 I expressed my grave concern for the future of our great national public broadcaster, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. I also mentioned the enormous financial pressure the ABC is under at the moment, with the government's $55 million cut to its annual appropriation since 1997 and the further pressure for the ABC to sell off its Gore Hill television site to fund the cost of conversion to digital broadcasting. Moreover, I said that, if the ABC is further marginalised by this government and media ownership rules are changed through the Productivity Commission inquiry, great damage will be done to media diversity.
Today I again stand up for the ABC and salute the great work of its without fear or favour programs, including the Media Watch revelations regarding money for comment or indeed opinion within the commercial radio industry. Not only did these revelations highlight the lack of ethics in the media; they raised genuine concerns regarding the corporate world—the other party to these shameful business deals. It was and is in the public interest that these deals were and continue to be exposed and that we are all made aware of how naive many of us have been. In other words, it raises the question: who is in bed with whom?
The recent exposure of the Laws affair by the ABC's Media Watch program must surely rank as one of the greatest victories for the public interest over commercial interests. Moreover, these revelations, which have flowed since the exposure of the Laws' deal with the banks, raise very serious ethical issues. For example, how do you draw the distinction between advertising and editorialising? Suffice to say, those who have leapt to the defence of Mr Laws and attacked the ABC have proved themselves to be blinded by error.
In the ongoing saga a reasonable person may ask: what other commercial deals have been struck to influence and manipulate public opinion? This raises the fundamental 
 issue of business ethics, in particular the role of the banking industry in this scandal. At a time when the banks' customers are being punished by reduced services, slugged by increased bank fees and charges, disadvantaged by branch closures and massive staff retrenchments, the bank executives reward themselves with huge salary packages and post record profits, to the delight of the shareholders. Meanwhile, the banking industry's $1.2 million deal with Mr Laws mocks the community. It is a flagrant violation of every ethical standard. It is, however, shamefully consistent with their prior conduct in other matters.
Let us look at their deal with the Law Society of New South Wales. The Australian Financial Review of July 1999 notes that `since 1984 the banks have paid an estimated $300 million to the society as ""interest"" or ""gratuitous payments"".' Little wonder the Australian Bankers Association is only now reviewing its policy as a lobby group and seeking new options to repair the banking industry's tattered reputation following the cancellation of the $1.2 million contract with the radio identity. I fully endorse the Australian Broadcasting Authority's announcement to broaden its inquiry to include Radio 5AD Broadcasting Pty Ltd and Radio 6PR Southern State Broadcasters Pty Ltd. I must quote part of the terms of reference of Professor David Flint's ABA hearing, for it is of critical importance to the public interest:
The Broadcasting Services Act 1992 includes, within its objects, to encourage providers of commercial broadcasting services to be responsive to the need for fair and accurate coverage of matters of public interest and to encourage providers of broadcasting services to respect community standards in the provision of program material.
That is what the ABA hearing is all about—protecting the public interest. That is not to say that the ethics violated here are defined merely in the act itself. But even the act has specifically identified the fundamental necessity for fair and accurate coverage of matters of public interest.
This is the banking industry's most public crisis. However, it is not merely banks that fall into the trap. This fiasco, I suspect, is also operating in other industries and with other 
 high profile media broadcasters. The Americans call it payola; we call it pay for comment. A secret arrangement involving the Australian Bankers Association and Mr Laws is now exposed. The banks wanted to buy editorial comment in their favour. Mr Laws appeared to have wanted cash. Both entered into the agreement privately. This is a contemptible arrangement. I fully agree with my leader, the Hon. Kim Beazley, calling on corporations to come clean on their involvement with advertising or sponsorship schemes that could be unethical and urging them to disclose their interests now.
This banking dishonour is now an obvious example of a much wider scandalous practice. The banks' credit rating is zero. The major insurance houses and other corporations from the big business world have been courting and buying off the media for years. Not a day goes by without startling revelations of more deals, scandals and controversy. I fully agree with the comments of Dr Simon Longstaff, the Executive Director of the St James Ethics Centre, who is quoted in the Australian on 27 July 1999 as follows:
Walk into any organisation where a serious ethical breach has occurred and ask people to explain why things happen the way they do, and you will almost certainly encounter two dominant responses, `Well, everybody does it—don't they?' or `That's just the way we do things around here'.
Dr Longstaff sends this chilling warning:
Unthinking custom and practice is a recipe for disaster—not least because it means that people tend to operate on automatic pilot, failing to recognise or respond to the changing world around them. The antidote is to create an environment where people reflect on their conduct and act according to a well informed conscience.
The banks and the business world as a whole have lost the plot. So, too, have the media. They have fallen into the error of invincible ignorance. They do not know that they do not know. They are so blinded by error that they can no longer even see how disastrous—to use Dr Longstaff's description—their `policies' are. The banks have manipulated public interest, they have bought favours and they have disguised their commercial interests under a cloak of media independence. They 
 are liars, they are cheats, they are dishonest and they must be made accountable.
If a member of parliament has a pecuniary interest, he or she must declare it. A legal practitioner in New South Wales must abide by strict statutory and other rules or face professional misconduct proceedings. The same goes for doctors. In light of the recent revelations, public broadcasters and the corporate world should be made to fully disclose their financial deals. What a time for these revelations to occur in light of the Productivity Commission's inquiry. I will conclude by saying something about this inquiry, which is expected to bring down its findings on broadcasting legislation next month.
I refer to the Productivity Commission Act 1998 and the Treasurer's terms of reference in relation to the Productivity Commission's inquiry into broadcasting legislation. I urge every member of this House to read section 6 of the Productivity Commission Act 1998, which deals with the functions of the commission. I also urge every member to read paragraphs 4 and 5 of the Treasurer's terms of reference for the inquiry into broadcasting legislation. When you read section 6 of the Productivity Commission Act 1998, clearly you have to ask why the Treasurer has chosen this body to conduct this very important inquiry. The concept of productivity just seems to get wider by the minute.
Broadcast and Hansard reports from this parliament reach a very small audience. Most people are dependent on media reports for information about what goes on in this House and about the actions and policies of the government. The media play a crucial role in fairly and accurately reporting the work of the parliament in conformance with the Broadcasting Services Act. The media are central to our democracy and to the public interest.
Let us look at the facts. We enter the new decade with two dominating media forces, Mr Packer and Mr Murdoch. The Treasurer's terms of reference sound good until we face the grim reality that there are no real competitors in the race for digital broadcasting. Realistically, who could afford the infrastructure investment necessary to set up a digital 
 grid of television, Internet and cable television to compete against the existing media forces? Who has that sort of money? It has taken the current players, with their enormous financial resources and clout, years to prepare for this phase of broadcasting.
The Productivity Commission has been issued with terms of reference by the Treasurer which have wrongly set it up as a Star Chamber to hang the public interest. In the Treasurer's press release No. 12 of 4 March 1999, he says:
This review does not signal any change to the government's media policies including those regarding cross-media ownership and Australia's digital transition.
What sophistry. The Treasurer must think we are all fools. The Treasurer's press release flies in the face of his own terms of reference to the Productivity Commission's inquiry on broadcasting legislation. The Productivity Commission is directed to do the following:
. . . determine a preferred option for regulation, if any, in light of objectives set out in the terms of reference, which includes, inter alia , practical courses of action to improve competition efficiency and the interests of consumers in broadcasting services.
What are we hearing about that inquiry from the submissions of the commercial interests? I will tell you. In a climate of obfuscation they want to change the rules to increase their power, their control over us, the parliament, and maintain profits—all at great cost to media diversity and, thus, to the public interest. The Productivity Commission is plainly being manipulated in a way that will guarantee a two-airline policy for the broadcasting industry, locking other potential significant players out of the market. The inquiry should be looking at what we can do to increase media diversity, not ensuring greater concentration of effective duopolistic control. In light of the failure of self-regulation, I urge this parliament to support a policy of co-regulation of the media, thus ensuring adequate protection of the public interest.",REPS,<title>GRIEVANCE DEBATE</title>,<title>Broadcasting Regulations</title>,Grievance Debate,12,1
"Andren, Peter, MP",IND,1999-08-09,"—This is a truly historic piece of legislation. The pity is by how much it falls short of the democratic ideals with which our Constitution was first framed at the end of last century. If this Constitution Alteration (Establishment of Republic) Bill passes, and no doubt it will, we are setting the groundwork for a referendum that offers the vast majority of people no choice at all. It is based on a model that does not represent public opinion, nor does it represent any expression of majority will. Polls consistently show that 70 per cent of the electorate want a directly elected President. They want a model that makes that possible. This model does not make that possible. Rather than strengthen the separation of powers, this model destroys the separation of powers. It neuters the role of the President and leaves the dominant party of the day in total control of the political processes, while major party support in the electorate continues to erode.
There is just no-one or nothing to check on executive government in this model. While painted as minimalist, the model is in fact radical. It does change the current system dramatically by embodying the right of instant dismissal of the President by the Prime Minister of the day. The Prime Minister need pay no attention at all to the President under this political establishment model. If Gough Whitlam could have dismissed Governor-General John Kerr he would have. This model will ensure the PM of the day will be able to take such a course of action. The Prime Minister becomes not only de facto but also essentially the head of state. The President should have the power to call for a general election at a time of constitutional crisis or when a government lacks support.
It is interesting to note the publication entitled Discovering democracy distributed 
 recently by the government. How ironic that we are debating this undemocratic model as the government, no doubt with Labor endorsement, peddles information about our wonderful democratic model. On page 45 there are details about how important American founders regarded the separate election of the President. It says:
The American founders believed all governments tended to threaten liberty.
It goes on to say how the American constitutional drafters believed that `power must be dispersed. No one group or individual could then capture all the centres of power and each power centre would keep the others in check'. The American founding fathers were right when fearing that the placing of the executive and legislature together would threaten democracy.	 According to our founding fathers, by placing the executive in parliament the ministers were responsible to parliament and if ever they threatened citizens' rights, the parliament, elected by the people, would control them. Unfortunately, the founding fathers did not count on the discipline, the arrogance and the undemocratic nature of the political party process, with its adversarial two-sided debate and its one-sided executive dominance, reinforced by the winner-take-all, illegitimate, mandate argument. It is interesting that Manning Clark described our very first constitutional convention thus:
It was for the most part the big men of the established political and economic order, the men of property or their trusted allies who moulded the Federal Constitution Bill.
Not much has changed. That 1890s process can well describe the setting up of this most recent Constitutional Convention, with one addition: half the delegates to the 1998 Convention were appointed, to all intents and purposes, by the government. We did correct the absence of youth, Aborigines and women, but the appointed delegates succeeded in swinging the Convention towards the conservative model favoured by the Prime Minister and away from the people's choice. Let us not forget just 73 delegates, less than half the 1998 Convention, voted yes to the so-called bipartisan appointment model. Bipartisan says it all. The Oxford Dictionary  defines bipartisan as `of or involving two (esp. political) 
 parties'. We had 73 yes votes, 57 no votes and 22 abstentions. Despite the model not gaining support of an absolute majority, or 77 of the delegates, the question was declared carried as more people had voted yes than no—more people from a Convention deliberately designed to achieve an outcome contrary to public will.
That will represents the greatest challenge yet to the power of the parties and the power of the executive. The Labor Party, bruised by history as it is, knowing that it might get back into power one day, has supported that model, knowing that it isolates the President from any role in the political process. The High Court recently ruled that we are independent. But to enshrine that independence we must have a republic model that is truly democratic and representative. Should this referendum be lost—and I hope that is the case—then the will of 70 per cent of people will cry out to be properly represented by a proper model. This cleverly camouflaged republic model will, I hope, fool no-one. Those nervous nellies who say, `You must vote for this imperfect model. It is the only chance we have,' are falling into this major party-establishment trap. There is absolutely no imperative to reach republic status by the year 2001 save for the symbolism of doing it for the start of the new millennium.
A former eminent member of this place, Sir James Killen, who does not support any republican model, says that this proposed legislation means the President `would be very much a tool in the hands of the Prime Minister of the day'. ARM Chairman Malcolm Turnbull said in the same debate in which Sir James spoke that this model was a `minor and substantial' change. In saying that, he inadvertently gave the game away. The substantial changes are being camouflaged by the minimalist rhetoric. True democrats are not fooled.
The public participation in this republic model is illusory. While it allows any Australian to nominate someone for President, it is a Clayton's nomination process, something which exists in name only. The committee of 32 which nominates the eventual candidate is appointed by the Prime Minister of the day. 
 The report of that committee, containing the short list of nominees, need not be tabled in parliament and thus would not be open to public scrutiny.
Former conservative Attorney-General Bob Ellicott believes that the consultative committee process will throw up compromise candidates. Tellingly, he says that if they represent the people's choice it will be by accident, because the committee, with a large component of government nominees and politicians, is unlikely to be representative of ordinary Australians. Mr Ellicott is spot-on when he derides the Republican Movement members who say, `Support this model and change it later.' He quite rightly points out that `this is a reckless and irresponsible approach to basic constitutional reform'. He says that `the likelihood of it being changed, if adopted, is quite remote as anybody who has any experience or in-depth knowledge of constitutional amendments in this country should know'. But if we introduce the kinds of amendments we know the people want—that is, direct election of a President—then people will be far more likely to support it, knowing that it is about lessening rather than strengthening executive power.
Those who argue how unlikely is the passage of referenda in this country should look closely at the reasons why. I would suggest it is all about the well-founded suspicion and fear of government and executive dominance. The direct election presidential model would in fact appease those suspicions and fears.
This bill will almost certainly be passed. On 6 November, a referendum will be held posing a question that will be rejected if public opinion polling accurately reflects the mood of the Australian people. Those people know that this model is not about shifting the portrait of Sir William Deane from one place on the wall to another and simply rebadging the brass plaque. They know it is about reducing that portrait by more than half and that the title `President' will always be embraced by inverted commas. It would be a republic in name only. If the Prime Minister's motion for appointment of a President were not approved, the Prime Minister of the day 
 could leave the position vacant. The Prime Minister could keep a compliant President in office and ensure compliance by offers of continuation in office.
No grounds are specified for removal of a President by the Prime Minister. There is no provision for the grounds for dismissal to be made public. There is no provision for both houses to be recalled should a dismissal occur. There are no provisions to cover any lack of support from the House of Representatives for the dismissal of a President. Any acting presidents could be dismissed by serial dismissal notices. The Prime Minister would be sole judge of any incapacity on the part of a President. The royal prerogative would be fixed in the Constitution and monarchical powers would in effect transfer to the Prime Minister, the people nowhere to be seen.
 Under the  Presidential Nominations Committee Bill 1999  to be introduced in parallel to this bill, the Prime Minister would have exclusive control over nominations to the Nominations Committee, apart from party or state nominees who would effectively be controlled by the majority parties in the state lower houses. The Prime Minister would in fact have the numbers on the committee, even without his or her own party supporters, by appointing the non-politician members who would make up half the membership and by appointing the convenor who would have a casting vote. Only lower houses of state parliaments would nominate state members, thus ensuring state governments controlled nominations and excluded minority parties and independents represented largely in upper houses but in both houses.
The Prime Minister would have virtually complete control over the terms and conditions of appointment to the Nominations Committee. Under clauses 13 and 15 the Prime Minister could manipulate vacancies and dispose of unfavourable members of the committee. Under part 5 the nomination process would be entirely secret, with the public—remember them?—having absolutely no way of judging whether the best nominee has been chosen by the Prime Minister.
 This  Constitution Alteration (Establishment of Republic) Bill 1999  should be opposed 
 because it sets up a referendum that is inherently undemocratic in not posing the question people want. Ian Ireland and Joanna Longley of the research services of this parliament have quite clearly stated in their paper how the dismissal process alone in this bill is `the only model which does not provide a ground or grounds for dismissal or require that reasons be given. Moreover, there is no other precedent among republic dismissal models for prime ministerial removal of the President'. The Clerk of the Senate, Harry Evans, quite firmly believes that this model, the offspring of a non-democratic process, would increase the unhealthy concentration of power in the Prime Minister. He says that the `provision of constitutional safeguards is quintessentially republican. A country without safeguards is no republic'.
 In a republic the power of the monarchy must be substituted by the power of the people. The head of state must be the representative of the people, not the representative of one or either side. As most of those in this debate keep saying, there are not two sides, there are many sides now representing the increasing plurality of the Australian electorate.
The real debate we should be having is one leading to a plebiscite or referendum—and I would prefer the plebiscite option—of whether or not people wish to break our links with the monarchy. We should have had such a plebiscite before any convention. Only after such an indication from the people can we have a proper debate—without the current divisiveness, the obfuscation and the complete hiding of the true germ and kernel of what people want—on constitutional reform, not this attempt to graft an unwanted and far inferior substitution for the Governor-General onto a rickety Constitution in need of wholesale reform.
 The Leader of the Opposition in his contribution urged direct election advocates to not oppose this model. He spoke of the reluctance of the parties to put this matter on the agenda again if this referendum fails. What if the people out there want it on the agenda? And they will. It will not go away. He spoke of national humiliation if this referendum is lost. 
 He spoke of how infinitely harder it would be to bring about constitutional change should the people say no. In all of this, there was very little, if any, mention of the express will of the people for a directly elected President. If we do have in our parliamentary ranks direct election advocates on both sides of the House, then it will take but a properly constituted convention to design a model approved by the people—one that codifies the power of the President and one that codifies the proper powers of any Prime Minister.
 Under the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act, only those members who oppose the legislation setting up such a referendum can contribute to the official no case against the question distributed by the Australian Electoral Commission. I call on the member for Flinders, who has been so vocal on the direct election model, to join me in voting against this bill so that his arguments can be included in the official no case. I also call on those direct election supporters hidden in the ranks of both government and opposition to throw off their party shackles and begin the process towards a true republic by voting against this flawed and inherently deceitful referendum bill.",REPS,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1
"Williams, Daryl, MP",LP,1999-08-09,"—in reply—The government has put before the parliament two bills: the Constitution Alteration (Establishment of Republic) Bill 1999  and the Presidential Nominations Committee Bill 1999 . They give expression to the Constitutional Convention's model for an Australian republic. In drafting the bills, the government's aim has been to present the people of Australia with a safe, workable proposal for a republic that continues our tradition of stable parliamentary democracy. This proposal would not dramatically change the way our system of national government operates. The object of the bills is to give Australia an Australian President who can fit effectively into our current arrangements in place of the Queen and her representative in Australia, the Governor-General.
I thank members in the debate so far who have considered the government's referendum proposal on its merits and contributed accord 
 ingly. We should remember that the tone of the debate in the Commonwealth parliament will affect the tone—perhaps even set the tone—of the ensuing debate in the broader community. A constructive debate is essential if we want to produce the best possible legislation and the best possible proposal to put to the Australian people at the referendum.
The proposal set out in the republic bill must be one that can be supported by those who support change, but it must also be one that those who do not support change—both within the government and elsewhere—can support as a reasonable proposal to put to the Australian people at a referendum. The statement by the Leader of the Opposition that his party will cooperate with the government in producing the best possible bill is very welcome, as are the acknowledgments by the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Barton that the republic bill is a faithful reflection of the outcome of the recommendations of the Constitutional Convention. It is an indication of the constructive approach that has been adopted that members such as those for Bradfield, Calwell, Chifley, Kooyong and the Northern Territory, who represent a diverse range of views on the question of a republic, can all support the passage of the republic bill and its presentation to the people at a referendum.
The bills have been the subject of close scrutiny by the Joint Select Committee on the Republic Referendum. The government welcomes the committee's report. On behalf of the government, I congratulate the chairman, deputy chairman and other members of the committee for completing a challenging inquiry in such a short time. At the outset, the chairman identified three broad objectives. The first was to determine whether the bills reflected the recommendations of the Constitutional Convention. The second was to determine whether, if a republic were approved at the referendum, the proposals set out in the bills would be effective and safe. The third objective was to give the Australian people the opportunity to have a say on the bills. With this third objective clearly in mind, the committee engaged in an extended series 
 of public hearings to collect evidence on the bills.
The committee did not limit itself to the capital cities. As the chairman indicated in the final hearing in Canberra at the end of July, the committee well and truly covered Australia. It took evidence in Canberra, Adelaide, Brisbane, Broome, Darwin, Hobart, Melbourne, Newcastle, Perth, Sydney and Townsville. Between the government's own extensive consultation through the exposure draft process and the officials committee of the Council of Australian Governments and the joint select committee's wide consultation, the government and the parliament have ensured that the referendum legislation has been subject to rigorous scrutiny at many different levels across Australia.
The government welcomes the findings of the majority of the joint select committee. The majority found that generally the bills faithfully reflect the resolutions of the Constitutional Convention. The government has also noted the brief dissenting reports which addressed particular elements of the majority report or aspects of the convention model. The fact is that the bills have together attracted strong support from a range of eminent commentators as a fair and effective legislative expression of the convention model.
However, the majority of the committee has recommended that consideration be given to some modifications. The committee's recommendation on the long title has been noted and the Prime Minister has announced that the government will move to replace the current long title with one which represents clearly and simply the essential purpose and outcome of the referendum proposal. The government believes that it has taken account of the committee's recommendation. Accordingly, I will be moving a motion to amend the long title in the consideration in detail stage of the bill. The government will consider the committee's other recommendations and any related proposals for amendment of the bills and will provide its response to these recommendations shortly. Any further amendments that are proposed by the government will be moved in the Senate.
The  Presidential Nominations Committee Bill 1999  is not a bill for a constitutional amendment but a bill for an ordinary Commonwealth act. As has been discussed, it provides in more detail for the establishment and role of the nominations committee and, in doing so, it fleshes out the very broad outline provided by the Constitutional Convention for the process of community consultation and evaluation of nominations. This bill does not have to be approved at the referendum and the government does not propose that this bill be passed before the outcome of the referendum is known. Accordingly, the government proposes that the bill not go forward to a third reading or to the Senate at this stage. Of course, this would not prevent the government, in the light of the joint select committee's report, giving undertakings to amend the nominations committee bill in the event that the republic bill is approved at the referendum. The government would propose that the nominations committee bill, with any amendments, go forward to a third reading and then to the Senate only if the republic bill is approved.
This referendum will be unusual in that government members will not necessarily support the referendum proposal once it has been passed by the parliament. It is a matter of public record that government members will be allowed a conscience vote in the referendum. Some members are likely to vote for change and others against it. This means that government members must be given an opportunity to participate in the formulation of the official or parliamentary no case as well as the official yes case.
Under the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984, only those members who vote for the republic bill as it goes through the parliament can participate in the formulation of the official 2,000-word yes case. Only those who vote against the bill can participate in the formulation of the official 2,000-word no case. In order that government members may participate in the no case, the government will be making arrangements to ensure that some of its members vote against the republic bill at the relevant time. These arrangements are simply part of the 
 government's broader plan to ensure that government members may participate in the debate as their conscience dictates and to ensure that both sides of the debate are put to the people when they vote on the referendum proposal in November.
The government has not wavered in its commitment to put the convention model for a republic to the people. The republic bill sets out a model which, unlike others such as the direct election model, is not designed to fundamentally alter the balance of our constitutional arrangements. It is, as I have said, intended to present the people of Australia with a safe and workable proposal for a republic that continues our tradition of stable parliamentary democracy. Government members will be allowed a conscience vote in the referendum. As I have indicated, some members are likely to vote for change and others against it, but the government is united in its commitment to let the Australian people decide whether Australia is to be a republic.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Downer, Alexander, MP",LP,1999-08-09,"—I seek indulgence to add to an answer to a question I gave at question time today.
—The Minister for Foreign Affairs may proceed.
—During question time today I told the House that I was unaware of any United States request for Australia to participate in a United States peace enforcement force in East Timor. That statement was of course true. I am advised by my department that no formal United States government request to Australia to participate in such a force has ever been made.
The House would be aware that a range of contingency plans have been discussed by United States and Australian military officials for a possible military presence in East Timor in the future. I made this quite clear on the Sunday program on 1 August. After question time, I asked my department to double-check its records. This evening, my department informed me that apparently at one meeting of military officials in June the issue of peace enforcement was informally raised by American military officials who asked hypothetically whether we would participate in a peace enforcement force. Australian military officials apparently gave a noncommittal response.
This was not a formal United States government request, nor did it reflect United States government policy. I have been advised that this was never subsequently raised with the Australian government nor, as far as I know, with the United States government itself by the military officials. I want to confirm to the House that this could in no way be construed as an indication of United States government policy to send in a peace enforcement force, and I underline that there is no substantive difference in Australian and United States government policy on East Timor.
