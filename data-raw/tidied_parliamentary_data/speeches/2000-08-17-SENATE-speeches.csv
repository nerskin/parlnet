"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2000-08-17,"—On behalf of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, I give notice that 15 days after today I shall move:
1.	That the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Amendment Regulations 2000 (No.2) as contained in Statutory Rules 2000 No.77 and made under the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999, be disallowed. 
2.	That the Australian Postal Corporation Amendment Regulations 2000 (No.1) as contained in Statutory Rules 2000 No.76 and made under the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989, be disallowed.
3.	That the Child Support (Assessment)(Overseas-related Maintenance Obligations) Regulations 2000 as contained in Statutory Rules 2000 No.79 and made under the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989, be disallowed.
4.	That the Child Support (Registration and Collection)(Overseas-related Maintenance Obligations) Regulations 2000 as contained in Statutory Rules 2000 No.80 and made under the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988, be disallowed.
5.	That the Family Law Amendment Regulations 2000 (No.2) as contained in Statutory Rules 2000 No.81 and made under the Family Law Act 1975, be disallowed.
6.	That the Instrument No.CASA 06/00 made under regulation 152 of the Civil Aviation Regulations 1988, be disallowed.
—I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a short summary of the matters raised by the committee.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Amendment Regulations 2000 (No.2), Statutory Rules 2000 No.77 
The Regulations make a variety of amendments to the Principal Regulations relating to the rounding of monetary amounts in tax invoices, financial supplies, GST joint ventures, reduced credit acquisitions and insurance.
New Part 3-1 of the Principal Regulations, inserted by item 3 of the Schedule to these Regulations, appears to be largely a re-writing of the previous Part 3-1, which was made on 20 October 1999. The only apparent difference between the two versions is the inclusion in the new version of subregulations 40-5.09(3) and (4), which provide further details as to what constitutes a “financial supply” for the purpose of the enabling legislation. The provisions within the new Part 3-1 have also been renumbered, the purpose of that being, in the words of the Explanatory Statement, to “more closely align with the numbering used in” the enabling legislation. The renumbering of these provisions may cause additional confusion to this area of the law.
Australian Postal Corporation Amendment Regulations 2000 (No.1), Statutory Rules 2000 No.76
The Regulations prescribe the details which must be recorded when a Customs officer removes a postal article from the normal course of the post for the purpose of its contents being inspected.
Although the details required to be maintained by these Regulations appear to be extensive, there is no requirement that a record be kept of the names of the Customs officers who withdraw an article from the ordinary course of the post for the purpose of inspecting its contents. Also, paragraph 3B(b) provides that, if the article is referred to an agency other than Customs, there be recorded “details of that referral”, but the paragraph is silent as to the extent of the details required to be recorded.
Child Support (Assessment)(Overseas-related Maintenance Obligations) Regulations 2000, Statutory Rules 2000 No.79
These Regulations prescribe, in relation to those countries with which Australia has maintenance enforcement arrangements, matters relevant to the recognition and enforcement of child support and spousal maintenance liabilities.
The enabling Act for these Regulations - the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 - is modified, to a greater of lesser extent, by regulations 6, 7, 10, 11 and 15 of these Regulations. While this is permitted by paragraph 163B(3)(b) of the enabling Act - a fact which is recorded in a Note to regulation 3 of these Regulations - the modifications made to the Act by this instrument are so extensive as to suggest that the relevant changes ought to be made by primary legislation.
Subregulation 25(2) limits the discretion of the Registrar, in making an administrative assessment of the child support payable by a person, to assuming that the person's income is no more than 2.5 times a figure based on average weekly earnings in Australia for that period. Although it appears from the enabling Act that this formula is used as a basis for assessing child support liability for persons in Australia, the Explanatory Statement does not indicate why it is considered still relevant for persons living overseas.
Child Support (Registration and Collection)(Overseas-related Maintenance Obligations) Regulations 2000, Statutory Rules 2000 No.80
These Regulations prescribe, in relation to those countries with which Australia has maintenance enforcement arrangements, matters relevant to the recognition and enforcement of child support and spousal maintenance liabilities. 
The enabling Act for these Regulations - the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988 - is modified, to a greater of lesser extent, by regulations 24, 25, 26 and 29 of these Regulations. The modifications made to the Act by this instrument are so extensive as to suggest that the relevant changes ought to be made by primary legislation.
It is difficult to see how subsection 24A(1) of the enabling Act, subregulation 10(4) of these Regulations, and subregulation 10(3), are to be read consistently with one another. Subsection 24A(1) provides that 
where the Registrar makes a child support assessment under which a registrable maintenance liability arises, the Registrar must immediately register the liability ...
However, subregulation 24(4) appears to require the Registrar merely to fulfil his or her obligation of registration as soon as practicable after it arose. While subregulation 10(3), when read with paragraph 10(1)(a), provides that if the Registrar fails to fulfil the obligations imposed by subsection 24(1) of the Act within 90 days after the obligation arose, he or she is taken to have refused to comply with it.
It is also difficult to understand how subsection 25(2) of the enabling Act is to be read with subregulation 12(1). Subsection 25(2) obliges the Registrar to register a registrable maintenance liability within 28 days of receiving a duly completed approved form, whereas subregulation 12(1) requires the Registrar to register a registrable maintenance liability within 90 days of receiving an application for registration.
Family Law Amendment Regulations 2000 (No.2), Statutory Rules 2000 No.81
The Regulations allow Australian courts to enforce overseas maintenance orders, or to make maintenance orders for the benefit of persons living in countries with which Australia is entering new international spousal maintenance agreements.
The new definition of Secretary substituted by item 2 of the Schedule to these Regulations permits the Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department to authorise “a person” to carry out functions under the Regulations. There appears to be no limit to the width of this power of delegation, by reference to such matters as qualifications, or the holding of a particular office or employment in the Public Service. 
Subregulation 28(2) - inserted by item 10 of the Schedule - and subregulation 28C(2) - inserted by item 11 of the Schedule - oblige the Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department to make an application calling on a respondent to a petition to show cause why various orders should not be confirmed. However, neither subregulation puts any time limit either on the Secretary's obligation to make the application, or within which the respondent to the notice must show cause.
New regulation 30, substituted by item 13 of the Schedule, deals with proceedings for the enforcement of some types of overseas maintenance liabilities. Subregulation 30(3) provides
The Act, these Regulations and the Rules of Court, so far as they are applicable, and with such modifications as are necessary, apply in relation to the proceedings.
It is not clear from the context whether it is intended that modifications may be made to the Act and to the Regulations, as well to the Rules of Court. If the purpose of this subregulation is to permit, inter alia, the modification of the Act, it is suggested that this is beyond the regulation-making power in section 125 of the Family Law Act 1975. Even if the intention of the subregulation is to permit modification of the Rules of Court only, it does not specify by whom the modification may be made, nor who is to decide whether such modification is necessary.
New subregulation 39(2), substituted by item 22 of the Schedule, requires the Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department to apply to a court for confirmation of any provisional order made overseas and transmitted to the Secretary. Subregulation 39(3) obliges the Secretary to serve a copy of that application on the respondent to the order. However, neither subregulations imposes any time limit within which the Secretary must carry out these obligations.
Instrument No.CASA 06/00 made under regulation 152 of the Civil Aviation Regulations 1988
The Instrument sets out the specifications in accordance with which members of the Australian Parachute Federation may conduct parachute descents.
Paragraph 4.8.13(a) lists three factors, which cumulatively will render a tandem endorsement not to be current. This appears to be inconsistent with paragraph 4.10(c), under which an APF member who has made fewer than 50 tandem descents may make a tandem descent with a student parachutist.
Senator Vanstone to move, on 30 August 2000: 
That the Senate—
	(a)	notes that 30 August 2000 marks the first anniversary of the United Nations run ballot in East Timor;
	(b)	recalls the role played by the 50 unarmed Australian Federal Police (AFP) and six Australian Defence Force (ADF) military observers, as members of the United Nations mission in East Timor during the lead-up to the ballot, in ensuring security for the people of East Timor and providing confidence in the integrity of the ballot;
	(c)	commends the courage displayed by the men and women of the AFP and ADF in the face of violence and intimidation in the lead-up to the poll and the outburst of destruction and killing that followed the announcement of the ballot results; and
	(d)	recognises that their continued presence in East Timor at the height of the post-ballot violence was crucial to preserving the United Nations role in East Timor.",SENATE,<title>NOTICES</title>,<title>Presentation</title>,Notices,1,1,speech

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2000-08-17,"—As the government knows, the opposition were not in agreement with the date which the government proposes in this resolution. We did agree, as this matter was not attended to when the Selection of Bills Committee report was presented this morning, to grant leave to the government to move this motion. We did not indicate that we would be supporting it and we will not. It is our view that the committee ought to have some additional time to consider this important matter, given the interest in the bill now for consideration, particularly from state governments and from private businesses which are claiming that the retrospective application of this legislation will have a dramatic effect on investments already made. That is how they see it.  
We have suggested to the government that the appropriate date for reporting should not be 4 September but should be 4 October. That is in fact the next week of sitting, given the break between sitting weeks occasioned by the Olympic Games. So, although we are talking about a one-month delay, we are in fact talking about a one sitting week delay for the purpose of allowing the committee the opportunity to properly consider the views of Australians about this legislation without occasioning undue delay in the consideration of the matter at the same time. I stress that it is one sitting week. 
I can recall other inquiries where the government has asked for an earlier reporting date and then the bill has languished on the Notice Paper. The RFA legislation is a case in point. Without wanting to trail through the numerous examples where the government has had legislation sitting on the Notice Paper for excessive periods, I simply say that it is the opposition's view that it would be better that this committee be allowed until 4 October to report, and I stress that that is the next week of sitting of the Senate. I therefore move an amendment to the motion moved by Senator Ellison:
Omit “September”, substitute “October”.
That would have the effect we desire, which is to delay the reporting date until 4 October this year. That is, in essence, the difference between the parties. 
I understand that the Democrats have considered this matter and will support the government. We will not seek to divide on this matter. However, we wish to put on the record that it is in these cases, generally speaking, the opposition that provides the quorum—with the government, of course—for these committees. I think it is beholden on the Democrats, if they support this proposition, to support the program of the committee so that they can do their work if the Senate does ultimately, as I expect it will, require the committee to report by 4 September. Perhaps the Democrats' view is that they want this matter out of the way as quickly as possible and they are not really supportive of the reference. I stress that this reference is a reference by the government of the legislation. This is another reference, the second in two days, where the appendix 1 form, the form headed `Selection of Bills Committee: Proposal to refer a bill to a committee', has no details filled in. Under the subheading `Reasons for referral/principal issues for consideration' the form is blank and under the subheading `Possible submissions or evidence from' the form is also blank. Then there is the name of the committee to which the bill is being referred, the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee.
The government has insisted that this matter be referred. It is insisting that the shortest possible time be given for the committee to consider the matter and report to the Senate, ostensibly so that the bill can be debated in the week commencing 4 September. The Interactive Gambling (Moratorium) Bill has great ramifications for a number of businesses and certainly state governments around the country and this is the sort of timetable in which the committee is being asked to consider the matter. We propose that the motion be amended. We have no objection to the reference, as should be clear. Labor members of the committee will attempt to work in whatever timetable the Senate establishes for the committee, but we think it is unreasonable. In fact, it is in undue haste to require the committee to consider these matters properly and report by 4 September, particularly given the nature of the material under consideration in the bill, which will be before the Senate at the conclusion of the committee's report.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee</title>",Committees,13,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-08-17,"—I support the opposition amendment. As the opposition has said, this is not only a complex issue but also one of great public and business interest and has very big social as well as economic ramifications. We need to make sure that the community that is involved in this has good time in which to submit its opinion to both the committee and then the Senate. I am concerned that the whole process is being truncated. I have great alarm about the impact of gambling on society. In fact, you will remember that I first raised the matter of interactive gambling in this chamber.

While I acknowledge Senator Brown's suggestion that this is a complex debate for legislative, technical and other reasons, it is a debate that has largely been entered into over many months through the processes of the Senate Select Committee on Information Technology. While I do not think for a minute that community thoughts or input would be disregarded in any way in this process, I do believe that a lot of the issues, including the technical complexities and the IT aspect of the debate, have been explored quite thoroughly, as many of the members on the select committee would understand.

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-08-17,"—We now turn to the dry but increasingly complex area of copyright law. Copyright law requires a delicate balance to be struck between the interests of those people who create material for use by others and those people who use that material. Provision must also be made for the interests of copyright communicators. Creators of copyright material and the collecting societies that represent their interests such as the Copyright Agency Limited and Screenrights argue that copyright law must ensure that creators receive full and proper remuneration for their work. Users of copyright materials such as students, researchers, members of the public, universities, libraries and the cultural institutions that cater for them argue that copyright law must ensure that people can obtain fair access to copyright material and, in some instances, for that access to be provided free of charge where that person makes copies an insubstantial portion of a work. Copyright communicators, on the other hand, such as Internet service providers and telecommunications companies argue that copyright law must ensure that they are not improperly exposed to actions in breach of copyright by virtue of their activities.  
Copyright law is not an issue that regularly inspires great public awareness or prominent public debate, but it is certainly a subject that arouses considerable and often passionate interest amongst those people who stand to gain the most from the balance that is struck between the competing interests which are involved and, of course, those people who may lose from that balance.
I turn therefore to the Copyright Amendment (Digital Agenda) Bill 2000. The central aim of this legislation is to ensure that copyright law continues to promote creative endeavour and, at the same time, to allow reasonable access to copyright material through new technologies. The opposition supports this objective and we are satisfied that this bill, as it has been amended subsequent to the report of the House of Representatives Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, generally strikes that balance. Technology has left the parliament behind in many instances, and this is one of those. The law with respect to the protection of copyright and intellectual property has lagged a long way behind technological developments in the information economy. Nevertheless, in a process which was commenced by the former Labor government reform in this area has been considered over a number of years and has been hastened, in fact, by international treaties which were concluded in 1996. 
The centrepiece of this legislation is the introduction of a broadly based technology neutral right of communication to the public. It will replace, and indeed extend, existing technology specific broadcasting rights which are limited to wireless transmissions. It will also replace the limited cable diffusion right. Further, the new right will make available copyright material online through on-demand interactive services. The right of communication will subsist as an exclusive right in all protected subject matter except for published editions. The bill includes an important package of exceptions to the new right of communication, along with new exceptions to existing rights to ensure reasonable access to copyright material online. As far as possible, the exceptions replicate the balance struck between the rights of owners and the rights of users that has applied in the print environment.
The existing fair dealing exceptions will apply to the new right of communication to the public. The reasonable portion test has been extended to apply to the reproduction for the purposes of research or study of literary and dramatic works in electronic form. The bill also extends the existing exceptions for libraries and archives to the reproduction and communication of copyright material in electronic form. The existing statutory licence scheme for copying by educational institutions has also been extended to the reproduction and communication of copyright material in electronic form. The extended scheme for the electronic use of copyright material has indeed been drafted broadly. The key to the new scheme is flexibility based on agreement between institutions and the relevant collecting societies. The bill establishes a similar statutory licence for the electronic use of copyright material by institutions assisting persons with print and intellectual disabilities. There is a new exception in the bill for temporary copies made in the course of the technical process of making or receiving communication. This includes the browsing of copyright material online. The exception does not apply in relation to temporary copies made as a result of an unauthorised communication. 
The bill introduces three new enforcement measures in response to the problems posed by new technologies. The first will put in place civil remedies and criminal sanctions against the manufacture and dealing in devices for the circumvention of technological protection measures, that is, software to break password protected copyright material. The second new enforcement regime provides civil remedies and criminal sanctions against the intentional removal or alteration of electronic rights management information, or RMI, such as digital watermarks. The bill also proscribes certain activities in relation to copyright material from which the attached RMI has been removed or altered. The third new enforcement regime provides both civil and criminal sanctions against the manufacture and dealing in devices for the unauthorised reception of encoded subscription broadcasts, such as decoders to allow unauthorised reception of pay TV signals. Anyone who has spent any time on the Internet would appreciate how difficult it may very well be to make some of these enforcement regimes stick, but the bill does carry these three new enforcement regimes.
 The bill also clarifies and limits the liability of carriers and carriage service providers, such as ISPs, in relation to copyright infringement by others using their facilities. Under the amendments in the legislation, carriers and ISPs will not be directly liable for communicating material to the public if they are not responsible for actively determining the content of the material communicated. Typically, the person responsible for determining the content of copyright material online would be a web site proprietor and not a carrier or an ISP.
The bill also provides that a carrier or an ISP will not be taken to have authorised an infringement of copyright merely by providing the facilities on which the infringement occurs. Further, the amendments provide an inclusive list of factors to assist in determining whether the authorisation of infringement has indeed occurred. These factors include the consideration of whether a person has complied with any relevant industry codes of practice. The bill further provides a statutory licence scheme for the payment of equitable remuneration to the underlying rights holders whose works are contained in retransmitted free-to-air broadcasts. One or more collecting societies will collect and distribute payments under the new scheme. If an agreement cannot be reached between the relevant collecting society and the retransmitter, such as a cable pay TV operator, the rate of equitable remuneration will be determined by the Copyright Tribunal.
The bill includes amendments to adopt some outstanding recommendations contained in the copyright law review committee's 1995 report entitled Computer Software Protection in order to finetune the existing protection of computer software. The bill contains some transitional provisions and consequential amendments. In respect of these, we anticipate that the government will be moving further amendments of a technical nature, and we will also move one further technical amendment developed in discussion with the government.
The bill has been considered by the House of Representatives Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, as I mentioned earlier, and that committee recommended a number of amendments. As a result of that report, the government moved amendments in the House of Representatives with the support of the opposition to implement many of the recommendations made by the committee. The opposition also moved amendments to pick up three recommendations of the committee, to which the government did not initially respond favourably. But, ultimately it did see the logic of Labor's position. One of those amendments clarifies the circumstances in which works can be displayed online in public libraries and another strengthens the precondition for obtaining circumvention devices. As a result of further discussions with the affected parties, we were to move today further amendments to the circumvention devices provisions of the bill to tighten the provisions to ensure that only those people who are authorised to use circumvention devices are entitled to obtain one. 
We also moved an amendment in the House of Representatives that would recognise directors' copyright interests where their works are retransmitted. The House of Representatives committee also recommended that directors should be recognised as rights holders for the purposes of the retransmission scheme under the bill. Under the scheme, there is provision for the owners of copyright in literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works, and of sound recordings and cinematographic films included in the broadcast, to be remunerated. However, the bill operates on the basis that ownership of copyright belongs to a producer or a production company and that directors have no underlying rights, and therefore they have no avenue to pursue equitable remuneration.
We moved an amendment in the House of Representatives to provide directors with retransmission rights. However, the government opposed that amendment and did not support amending the copyright regime to allow for the equitable remuneration of directors, claiming that this bill was not the appropriate vehicle. We believe in the importance of ensuring that the contribution of directors to the making of films is acknowledged. We were therefore prepared to move the amendment again today to provide directors with retransmission rights. I understand that, as a result of Labor's continual pressing of this particular position, the government has now committed itself to introducing legislation this year that will address the exact issue that Labor were pursuing through our amendments in the House. I understand further that the government has committed itself to a three-month review process to consider copyright issues for directors, at the conclusion of which legislation will be introduced. On this basis, we will no longer be moving amendments related to directors' copyright entitlements as part of the process. Amendments resulting from this review are to be introduced into the parliament by the end of the year, and we look forward to the outcomes of that review.
In conclusion, the opposition does support the objectives of this bill and has taken a constructive approach in negotiations with the government over amendments to the legislation. While there are certainly some areas in this legislation to which Labor would have taken a different approach in government, we recognise—as indeed do those interest groups who have participated in this long process of consultation and lobbying on various aspects of the bill—that it is now most appropriate that the bill be passed expeditiously so that all parties can move forward and start to work with the new regime. The government has announced that it will review the operation of the bill within three years. We also have committed to commencing a review of the new regime within 12 months of returning to government. I must admit that I think the latter time frame is the most appropriate. I commend the bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>COPYRIGHT AMENDMENT (DIGITAL AGENDA) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1,speech
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2000-08-17,"—The Copyright Amendment (Digital Agenda) Bill 2000 is part of the overall framework of legislation that goes to protect civil rights. The civil right protected here is that right that we all have to get the benefits—and I will not say `to get the profits'—of a person's mind. It is not simply money; it is also the ability to have the credit and to be recognised for a great creation that a person produces. No doubt, Mr Acting Deputy President, you know the story of Charles Dickens, who went to America on a tour and gave many a reading from his books. I think his most famous reading was that from the book Oliver Twist, where Bill Sykes murders Nancy. The tour put a terrible strain on Charles Dickens, and I think he died of a stroke at the age of about 56. I am not necessarily saying that it was the readings, although the intensity of them might have contributed to that. The point of the story is that he addressed a meeting of people, Americans, who were all gathered one night to listen to this great man speak—this great man who had written all these great novels and works and who had been giving very successful readings both in England and in the United States. He got up and addressed the assembled throng in terms of the then laws regarding copyright, because what would happen was that he would produce these great works and people would, in effect, steal from them. That is what a breach of copyright really is. So he addressed the throng on the need to have protection for people who produced great works of literature and great works of the mind. 
Like all things these days, technology makes the law inadequate to meet the situation, and this legislation seeks to give the rights that Charles Dickens was talking about to people who produce great works of art, literature and so on. It is good to see that specifically mentioned in the bill, but I think the objects of the act are rather crudely expressed. There is no soul in it.
—There is no soul in the government.
—I will just read what the bill says, Senator Bolkus. Under `Object of the Act', it says: 
The object of this Act is to amend the Copyright Act 1968 so as to:
(a) ensure the efficient operation of relevant industries in the online environment by:
(i) promoting the creation of copyright material and the exploitation of new online technologies by allowing financial rewards for creators and investors;
You would have hoped that there would also be wording to ensure that a person's pride in their great creation and what it has done for the spirit and soul would also be recognised, but this just talks about the financial rewards. The bill goes on: 
(ii) providing a practical enforcement regime for copyright owners;
A practical enforcement regime for copyright owners should not simply be expressed in legislation; it has to be carried out. A lot of the legislation we pass in this chamber is set up with enforcement regimes which are never carried out adequately. Last year we passed legislation that allowed parallel importing into Australia. I am not sure how well that has been enforced, but one has to have suspicions about it.
This is a bill that seeks to protect—and everybody agrees that this is correct—the property not only of a person's mind but of his soul and heart. In future, I would like to see objects of an act set out something a little more spiritual. Senator Schacht objects to the use of the word `spiritual', but I think even Senator Schacht has some sort of heart and soul underneath that exterior. But you know what I am talking about, Mr Acting Deputy President. You are a person who has done great things in this chamber over the years in terms of the spirit of the place, and I think there should be some sort of recognition of spiritual aspects in this legislation. 
In any event, the proposition remains that this is a very important piece of legislation in establishing that people in the community have civil rights, that the products of their mind should be protected, and that they should get the true rewards for those products. That is what I am looking for: not only economic rewards but also true rewards for the products of their mind. It is a very nasty thing for somebody to have created something that is magic, profitable—or both, hopefully—and to have that stolen away from him or her. 
With respect to the developments in technology, we are going to hear a great description of how this technology works from the next speaker, Senator Lundy. I deal more with matters of the soul and matters of civil rights; the technicality of the whole matter will be dealt with by Senator Lundy. Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President, for listening to this speech. I think this is a matter that we should talk about in terms of the overall structure of our society.",SENATE,<title>COPYRIGHT AMENDMENT (DIGITAL AGENDA) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1,speech
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2000-08-17,"—The Copyright Amend-ment (Digital Agenda) Bill 2000 is a fascinating piece of legislation. It represents, in so many ways, a bridge between the old and the new. As we confront the challenges of an information society and a digital age, all of the laws and traditions that have been built up over the years relating to the protection of intellectual property are being challenged. This bill attempts to build a bridge between the world as we knew it and the world of the future: a digital age. In doing that, the bill seeks to acknowledge the intellectual property rights of not just creators but producers and distributors of intellectual property. It also attempts to acknowledge that we are in a new era of this digital age, when new technologies are allowing the transference and distribution of intellectual property in ways that were only conceptualised not that long ago. 
In reflecting on the substance of this bill, I would like to look at the social trends that are taking place. With the Internet sitting central to a digital era, it is very clear that what is happening on the Internet is the mark for where we are headed in the future. The social trends that are occurring on the Internet are very diverse and very challenging.
The distribution of digitised product or digitised content in the form of both music and movies is at the forefront of public debate about how these challenges, in the transference from the old to the new and the management of intellectual property, will be played out. In particular, recent innovations that have allowed compression technologies to distribute that material, combined with digital know-how of those outside of the corporate establishment, have challenged the very business models that whole industries, involving creators and their producers—whether it be their record companies or movie companies—have sought to build over many years. In this environment of change, it is those established interests that have sought to find remedies in the courts for the outbreak of technologies that have enabled replication and transfer of music and movie digital product, as we have seen recently with the Napster case.
Let us look at the social trend. Over the last few years, young innovators out there working on the Internet have found ways to replicate the digitised product that is the property of the copyright owner. Using CDs as an example, it was none other than Napster that led the charge to provide a methodology through which people could access and download digital CDs for their own use. The challenge came from the owners of the copyright, who argued that this was a breach of copyright and sought a remedy. Only recently, they were successful in obtaining that injunction in the United States. Since then, other technologies have continued, particularly Nutella, which has the capacity not to have a single owner or host that distributes the digitised material that comes in the form of music. Indeed, Nutella has a structure whereby all participants in that digital network share amongst themselves for their private use the digital product that the established interests—the record companies—are claiming they are the owners of the copyright of.
Metallica attempted to sue fans for distributing their music in this way, and yet we see almost on a monthly basis new technologies that continue to be able to avoid being captured by litigation by the established interests. What is the meaning of all of this? Why is it relevant to this particular legislation? It is relevant because we are seeing a definite social trend. A skill set has developed in the digital age that has allowed for the transference of information in this way, in defiance of the established laws and claims by the owners of the existing copyright that they have the right to derive their wealth—derive their profit and earn their money—from the managed distribution of that product. It means that jurisdictions all around the world are being actively challenged to build legislation that acknowledges this particular social trend. It is interesting to see some parts of the industry referring now to the move industry with the recent presence of Divex—which has a smiley face after it and is a new compression technology that allows the same sort of digital download of movies over higher bandwidth to a very high quality, allegedly close to that of DVD—and the industry itself saying that there is no way to beat these people. We have to create an incentive for consumers to come to the original product so those traditional industries can preserve their income streams.
I think one of the most challenging issues for artists is the creation of copyright laws. The principal position from which many of them stem historically is about allowing the creators of intellectual property to derive wealth from it. It has been through many years of tradition and distribution and business models developing that artists have been disempowered to a large degree in how they own and manage their copyright or their intellectual property. This raises the question of how in a digital age those production and distribution models are challenged by not just the consumers who seek to distribute and copy digitised product amongst themselves—challenging the establishment's distribution systems—but alternatively the position it leaves the artist or the creator in. There have certainly been some incredibly compelling arguments from artists and creators—whether they be written, artistic, musical or video creations—as to why this bill needs to specifically enhance and protect their interests in response to that threat. 
Another issue is to find the fine line between protecting the interests of the artists and the creators of intellectual property versus the interests of the consumers who want to circulate it and the new business models that could allow new relationships to develop with the creators of intellectual property and consumers in a digital environment. Whilst this is not news, there are many business models out there that demonstrate how that direct relationship can be built. The release of Stephen King's latest novel demonstrates an innovative use of how consumers, effectively on a trust basis, are asked to have a direct relationship with the producer of that intellectual property. The model that Stephen King deployed through that is apparently delivering some 75 per cent or 78 per cent return on people voluntarily paying for the downloads of his new book, without any specific obligation being placed upon them to do so. So evidence is starting to emerge that the trust model works. To finish that point, in essence this bill to some degree starts to recognise that there is some scope for the development of new business models in that relationship to directly protect the interests of the creators and how they manage and derive wealth from their intellectual property but also place in the hands of consumers a large degree of responsibility to respect the intellectual property produced by those creators and to reward them by virtue of this trust model of payment if they choose to download that particular material.
There is the other issue, of course, of those who sit in between that chain—between the producer or the creator of intellectual property and the consumer. They are the mass producers and distributors of this content that is currently characterised, for example, by the music industry, the producers of CDs, the movie industry and the production of digital video discs, DVDs. We have seen a number of cases over the last couple of years where the producers and distributors have actively challenged the new models of distribution and sharing of a digital product on the Internet. When these cases have gone to law, it is very clear that the law has sided in favour of tradition and protecting those interests of the established networks that produce and distribute CDs and DVDs—to use the most pertinent examples. I think this is where the real challenge comes to legislators. In deliberating over this it is how we actually manage a transitory period—a genuine period of transition. I do not believe it is actually possible to come up with all of the answers with this piece of legislation, but it is possible, as I said before, to build a bridge between the old and the new—putting those distributors and producers on notice that they are going to have to find new methods of conducting their business and earning their money as corporations and, at the same time, leave open the opportunity for development for new relationships to be created between artists and consumers. 
I think this bill goes some way to acknowledging and reflecting that everyone over the next period of time during the operation of this bill will need to work really hard to start building those changes into the way they conduct themselves. I am very optimistic. Certainly, some quarters of the music industry and the movie industry are being very innovative in their thinking about how they can protect their interests and acknowledge the social trend that I mentioned before, which is how technologies are really overtaking their ability to control a given marketplace and a given distribution model. In characterising this bill as a transitory bill, it probably does not keep all of those interested parties happy. In many respects, in the debating of this bill, I think a lot of effort has gone into actually trying to address the needs of very disparate interests. It has actually been quite fascinating to look at the various interests—those who are seeking to protect and enhance their ability to control their copyright and intellectual property versus, pitted head to head against, those who seek to use the opportunity for this transference to a digital age to open up and build on the principles of open and shared information. Whilst these various interests seem to lie at polar ends of the debate, there is actually a lot of middle ground interwoven which I think a lot of the negotiations and the inquiry into this bill have actively sought to acknowledge but they have also sought to create an environment in which at least some of the transitory uncertainties are dealt with—albeit that, as I said, I do not think this bill should be considered as the end point but merely just another stage as the social trends and business models develop over a period of time. 
I would just like to reflect a little on the positions at those polar ends. It is very clear that this process of moving into a digital age is seen as an opportunity and a threat at the same time. In seeing it as an opportunity there has been an active tendency for both ends of the debate to actually claw as much ground towards them as conceivably possible. For example, the owners of copyright, artists and creators and, indeed, those who control the distribution models of those created works and that intellectual property have sought to use this bill and the transition to actually enhance their ability to protect and manage their copyright, and they have done so with some vigour—and, in recognition, particularly of the artists and the creators in the midst of that debate, deservedly so. If we are to become a knowledge nation, if we are to be genuinely committed to acknowledging the human value of input and the intellectual input of people in society, we need to find to find genuine mechanisms to reward people for that input and not just dispel, without thinking, their ability to derive wealth from their input in that way. On the other side, principles of an open information society are very sound in their advocacy.
I would particularly like to acknowledge the role that ALIA have played in presenting the case for why it is important to use a digital and information society as a way of actually promulgating access to information—not locking it down, but actually building on the principles of having more information available to people on the Internet, which means that people can empower themselves through accessing that information. There are very compelling arguments as to why a transference from a paper based society to a digital society, and the freedom that that provides with the distribution of information and digital content, should actually be an enhancement and acknowledged as an enhancement in the eyes of the law. So you can see that there is no black and white in who is right or wrong on this bill; it is very much a combination of serving the interests of those who we say we value—that human capital that arrives into society in the form of intellectual property—and the need for wealth to be able to be derived from that so that people who contribute in these ways can earn a living. On the other side, there is the need to actually make sure that there is a collective benefit from this proliferation of information to society and that it is not hunkered down, captured and protected in an unreasonable way.
As I said, I think some of the negotiated outcomes of this bill as it has developed through the committee—and, I am sure, as it will continue to develop through the amendment stages—will see the bill actually lend itself to providing at least a rickety path, perhaps in the first instance, across this bridge between what was before and this new digital age that we are actually immersed in now; it is not something that is coming. I am hoping that this bill will just anchor this bridge to what will be required in the future in terms of effective legislation managing intellectual property in a digital age in an information society.
Finally, I would like to reflect on the social trends and cultural issues that I mentioned before. It is really, I guess, in honour and in deference to those innovators who are out there, who work with the Internet every day and continually push the boundaries of what is possible. Whilst large corporations around the world live in fear of being Amazon-ed out of business, it is fascinating for me to observe that, indeed, despite those significant threats being derived from the captains of industry seeking to protect their own structures, this culture of innovators out there will not stop. It will continue to change the environment. It will continue to push the outer boundaries of what is conceivably possible and to shape society on a daily basis as it does so. 
More often than not, it is these innovators that are the bringers of social change in our lives. Whilst they are certainly celebrated within their own culture, it is very necessary for this place and other parliaments, not only in Australia but around the world, to acknowledge that this input is in fact a positive thing and needs to be recognised, acknowledged and built actively into our considerations. What we are experiencing here is very much about a cultural change. It is about, in some ways, a clash of generations as young technologists push the boundaries of what is conceivably possible through the Internet and the digital environment. It is the captains of industry who are finding it difficult to adapt to the Internet and all of the ramifications and who use the law in the courts and use parliaments to attempt to block that change and put a lid on it. More than anything else, it is with regret that I note that this attitude, about putting a lid on change, is one that has characterised the coalition through so many of the issues in relation to the Internet.

Government senators interjecting—
—Order!
—I rise on behalf of the Democrats today to indicate our support for the Copyright Amendment (Digital Agenda) Bill 2000. Unlike much copyright law which struggles to inspire the imagination, this legislation is of particular interest and significance as it aims to set the ground rules, the rights, for our emerging knowledge economy, a central tenet of current political discourse and, I hope, a common vision for Australia. It is the potential of these rights, coupled with the ubiquity of the application of these new rights with technological innovations, which has captured the attention of so many interests. Of course, it was only recently that digital issues were debated in this place in the form of the digital television debate. It was a quite hotly contested debate. I am happy to be speaking about digital issues again today in the chamber but, I guess, rather in the general electronic sense of the word rather than comparing two analog spectrums and, say, the possibilities of multichannelling.
The bill's central aim is to ensure that copyright law continues to promote creative endeavour while allowing reasonable access to copyright material on the Internet and through new communication technologies. The bill introduces a new right of communication to replace the broadcasting right of the 1968 act. This right is intended to be technologically neutral, thereby providing copyright to all interactive transmissions—datacasting, Internet services and similar emerging technologies as well as technologies with which we are more familiar, such as standard broadcasting technologies. The bill introduces three new enforcement measures. These concern the manufacture of and dealing in devices for the circumvention of technological projection measures, that is in certain cases; the intentional removal or alteration of electronic rights management information, like digital watermarks; and the manufacture of and dealing in devices for the unauthorised reception of encoded subscription broadcasts, like decoders, to allow the unauthorised reception of pay TV signals. 
The bill's objects reflect the aim of trying to strike a balance between access and copyright protection. The Australian Democrats, as we have said a number of times in the parliament, support a strong and enforceable intellectual property scheme which encourages creativity and innovation. However, we also recognise that a balance between encouraging creativity and the commercialisation of that creativity is required. This means that in every circumstance the benefits to the creator and the broader community must be weighted for the benefit of all Australians. We believe that individual, community and broader Australian interests should be examined and exclusive rights granted where they will benefit. The Democrats support the pursuit of such a balance under this scheme, though the extent to which this balance has been appropriately struck can only be assessed comprehensively after the system has been in operation for a period of time. This bill has undergone a long gestation and drafting process—I do not think anyone would disagree with that. Its inception was under the last Labor government, though the need to extend copyright to the digital age was also recognised after the formation of the coalition government. I am not sure if I am being too kind to you, Senator Kemp, but feel free to interject at any stage. From these beginnings the Copyright Amendment (Digital Agenda) Bill was drafted and, of course, made its gradual progression to the Senate. I also acknowledge the extensive revision of the bill since it was released as an exposure draft for public comment back in February last year.
The Democrats also recognise the need for balanced copyright legislation for the emerging digital age and the pace at which digital technologies are developing and being applied. As all contributors to this debate have emphasised so far, it is a complex debate, but it is obviously an important one and a reasonably interesting one. As we know, Australians are great users of technology; we take on and we adopt technology at a greater pace than almost any other nation. Australians love the potential of the digital age, and I believe that our legislation should reflect this and incorporate the flexibility and balance that this technological change requires. For these reasons, the Democrats support the speedy passage of this legislation through the Senate.
The Democrats recognise that, while this process has produced a bill with sufficient middle ground among interested parties, it has also skewed the focus of interest in this bill, which should really be about the recognition and the promotion of creative endeavour—foremostly, Australian creative endeavour. Whether you are a creator, a communicator, a collecting society or a user of copyright material, creative endeavour is of common interest and value to all. Innovative endeavour is a commodity recognised in both the `knowledge nation' statements—and we have heard a bit about those again today—and the `can-do country' outlook, so I think both old parties have some recognition of innovative endeavour. This bill sets out the rights surrounding this commodity, though its significance has been somewhat camouflaged in the bill's negotiation processes.
Some of these concepts were debated and highlighted at the National Innovation Summit this year. I was fortunate to attend that summit in February, and I have put on record a number of times that the Democrats were grateful for the invitation from Senator Minchin. However, we do believe that invitations to those kinds of forums should be cross-party invitations. At the innovation summit, the interrelation of commercial and basic research was emphasised. Libraries play an integral role in this process and must facilitate the connection between those two areas of growth for Australia's knowledge economy. Australia's copyright deficit is a pressing concern. The Australian Libraries Copyright Committee estimates that three out of every four dollars made by copyright in Australia goes directly overseas. Additionally, 95 per cent of the software that Australia uses is from overseas. While it is true that Australia's economy should specialise and should not necessarily excel in too many emerging markets, we must focus on those areas where we hold a natural advantage and international expertise. Once we have the rights in place, we must put promotion of Australian copyright at the top of the priority list. Whether it is software applications for bioinformatics applications or copyright for Australian music, we must undertake a multifaceted approach to legislation, with, of course, industry cooperation. I hope that once this bill is passed the interested parties and the government will focus on the issue of Australia's copyright deficit and will work towards promoting more Australian content and work. 
As I stated in my opening comments, the bill establishes the rights which will set the foundation for transactions in our knowledge economy of the future. I do not believe we can expect to get it 100 per cent right the first time; translating the copyright system for the demands of the emerging digital economy is, of course, a large task. I commend the recognition of this by both the old parties and their commitments regarding it. Both parties have given an undertaking to review this copyright regime—in the case of Labor, after about 12 months if they are in office; and three years after the introduction of this bill under a coalition government.
While the Democrats acknowledge that the task of extending copyright to the digital age involves balancing numerous public interests in specific areas of copyright, which has been attempted by striving towards what has been touted as a technologically neutral system that focuses on generalist rights, the Democrats also acknowledge that some communities require specific reference and perhaps specific assistance. My concern has been raised regarding the treatment of indigenous cultural and intellectual property under the bill. There is no doubt that the digital communication medium increases access exponentially—I think that is something that Senator Lundy was referring to in her address. This is not a problem; access should be promoted, and I do not think that anyone denies that. However, it must be noted that this increased access does have a specific impact on certain communities and could exacerbate current inequalities in some cases if it is not properly addressed. One such community, of course, is our indigenous population in relation to their cultural and intellectual property. The appropriation of traditional cultural and intellectual property by non owner-users over the last 200 years of Australia's history has meant eroded indigenous management and control of intellectual property and sensitive cultural information. This situation will be exacerbated with the extension of digitalisation, as holders and non owner-users of such resources may make available such material without the knowledge, let alone the permission, of the indigenous owners. Approval or disapproval of the use of copying or digitalisation of indigenous IP— whether it be genealogical data, ethnographic data, biological intellectual property, recordings or other types of knowledge and information—should be at the discretion of the appropriate individuals, communities, custodians and organisations, and they should have the discretion to apply laws and cultural protocols which are determined by customary law and practice.
The Democrats are not pursuing specific amendments to the Copyright Amendment (Digital Agenda) Bill 2000 to address these issues. However, we do recommend that these issues are comprehensively dealt with in the near future in close negotiations with indigenous communities to make sure that we address their very deep and long-standing concerns regarding cultural appropriation. I would also stress that the operation of the copyright bill must be monitored to assess what impact it is having on the protection of indigenous cultural and intellectual property rights. The integrity of these fundamental rights must form a fundamental part of the review process that the old parties have pledged to undertake, under varying time lines, after the introduction of the bill. The Democrats will be looking to address these issues in upcoming copyright legislation.
On balance, this bill is a first step in the establishment of true e-commerce. To harness the full economic capacity of new interactive communications and to move beyond simple Net catalogue shopping, we must establish the basic currency for digital knowledge transactions. This bill is a step towards appropriate recognition of the source of such works and appropriate remuneration for such endeavours. While questions still remain regarding the enforcement of copyright on the Net, policing of the new digital environment and the effectiveness of translating some traditional products and transactions directly onto the Net, it is generally believed that this legislation is needed now and will provide an effective framework in the new digital environment, which of course will continue to expand over the coming years. I would suggest that, while this bill does deal with works of traditional authors—and I think Senator Cooney referred to the author Charles Dickens—I believe the real potential of this legislation is in aiding the redefinition of how knowledge is packaged and marketed in the digital environment. 
Finally, I note Senator Bolkus's comments in relation to his party's pursuit of an amendment dealing with retransmission rights for directors. As he knows, the Democrats are very keen to pursue that issue as well. We are sympathetic for what the Labor Party's amendment would have achieved and would have quite happily voted for the amendment they pursued in the lower house except that there were clearly defects in that amendment which would not have resulted in what we believe would have been appropriate or good law. For that reason we have chosen to pursue the attainment of that issue through different means. I commend the minister, his office and other officers for pursuing this matter that has now been outlined.
I think it was perhaps a little cheeky of Senator Bolkus to suggest that, if it were not for the Labor Party pursuing this issue, we would not be investigating the issue through an inquiry and hopefully having some resolution to the issue of directors' rights before the end of the year. Having said that, I do acknowledge that the Labor Party moved that amendment in the lower house. I do not believe it was necessarily the best amendment to achieve the ends that they hoped to achieve. Commendations to everyone who has been involved in that process. I am glad we were able to achieve an outcome that I think is more appropriate and satisfying.",SENATE,<title>COPYRIGHT AMENDMENT (DIGITAL AGENDA) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-08-17,"—There are problems with this Copy- right Amendment (Digital Agenda) Bill 2000. The Australian Copyright Council has very clearly outlined a number of those problems. I will read from its submission on this matter in a moment. The digital age is different when it comes to copyright, but we have to remember that for most of the last century authors of the old forms of communication and distribution—that is, books, magazines and so on—got nothing when their works were distributed through libraries, for example. It was very late in the piece that we came to public lending rights. We are moving long after we should have to ensure that the creators of work that is used for entertainment, business or whatever are paid when their work is republished, copied or used beyond the production of the first item. With the digital age the Internet has opened all sorts of possibilities for quick, cheap and easy reproduction of material that just was not possible in times gone by with a printer and a photocopier, let alone in the bookmaking process.
I support public libraries and educational institutions—everybody does—but libraries should be more narrowly defined than they are in this legislation. With the legislation we have before us, corporate libraries for example—that is, those in the private domain—may well be set to be able to turn the business of reproduction of material without remuneration into a lucrative one at the expense of the originators of that material. Corporate libraries and libraries of private institutions are able to disperse material just as easily as our public libraries and public institutions can, but they are very different entities. We ought to be very well aware of that and make sure that the originators of material are getting a just return for their efforts and have some control over what happens with their efforts when it comes to the private sector.
The Australian Copyright Council is a non-profit company. It receives substantial funding from the Australia Council and other federal government entities. Its functions are to give information and legal advice freely about copyright, research and advocatingchanges to copyright law and practice which will benefit the creators and other copyright owners. The Australian Copyright Council has put to us as legislators that it is disappointed with this legislation in that the amendments to the bill which was passed on 28 June in another place did not implement the central unanimous recommendation of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs relating to first digitisation. The council says: 
That recommendation—based on the Committee's recognition of the far-reaching consequences of first digitisation (particularly for enforcement)—was that, in general, exceptions to infringement should not allow the first digitisation of a work.
The council goes on to say:
We are also disappointed that the Government has amended the Bill so that libraries in profit-making organisations would be able to acquire material for their collections, and make material available to the organisation's staff and clients, without any payment to the copyright owners.
The end result is that the “balance” between protection and access, referred to by the Government as an objective of the Bill, has been tipped even further against the interests of copyright owners.
The council set out a number of issues where it submits the bill does not give effect to the government's policy. The main issues are: first digitisation, the balance between protection and access, library copying and communication, educational copying and communication of what is called `insubstantial portions', rights management information as well as circumvention of technical protection measures. The council says:
We urge the Government to give high priority to addressing these issues, and to the early passage of the Bill in the Senate.
Those are effectively, I submit, the issues that the Senate should be giving attention to and fixing up as far as this legislation is concerned.
I want to acquaint the Senate with the Copyright Council's further discussion of a couple of important matters, not least digitisation. On that, they say:
We are very surprised by the Government's statement that its amendments to the Bill partially implement the recommendations of the LACA Committee on first digitisation. We cannot see how they do so.
Copyright owners already have the right to first digitise under the current law, as part of their right to reproduce or copy; the Digital Agenda Bill would merely confirm that this is the case. The LACA Committee's concern was that exceptions to copyright infringement should not allow first digitisation without the copyright owner's consent.
The Committee's recommendations were based on its recognition of the important differences between the non-digital and the digital environments—including the “enormous potential of unauthorised use of digital material”—and that copyright owners should thus be able to determine when their material is first digitised.
The council says:
The Government's amendments do not implement the Committee's recommendations. On the contrary, the Bill would allow first digitisation in a vast range of cases—without the copyright owner's consent, without payment, without technological protection measures and without rights management information.
On the matter of libraries, the Australian Copyright Council says, under the heading `Access to material in libraries not “free”':
The Government appears to be of the view that the operation of the library exceptions means that library users get “free access” to copyright material. They do not. Libraries are (and would continue to be) entitled to charge their clients for supply of material. The charge must “not exceed the cost of making and supplying the copy”, but we understand that libraries take a range of direct and indirect costs into account when determining charges for supplying copied material. In 1997, the Australian Council of Library and Information Services recommended that the minimum fee for copying and supply of an article of up to 30 pages by one library for another was $12.
No proportion of these charges is paid to the copyright owner.
Surely that is something that we should be putting to rights in this legislation. 
The council goes on to say that emerging commercial markets are not protected and that library provisions in this legislation are not consistent with international developments. Then, under the heading `Corporate libraries', the council says: 
The Government has said that it “has decided to further consider the impact of the changed definition [of “library”] on the ability of private libraries to participate in the inter-library loan system and to provide material to public libraries”.
The council says:
The Government thus appears to have accepted the concern raised by libraries—for example by the Australian Library and Information Association which, in a letter to the Attorney-General of 31 March 2000, expressed concern about the effect of the proposed definition of “library” on “valuable resource sharing arrangements between libraries and community access to highly specialised private sector collections”. This concern was repeated by libraries in the inquiry by the LACA Committee.
The Government's amendments in fact have a much wider effect. They not only allow access to corporate library collections by public libraries and their clients, but also allow corporate libraries, without any payment to copyright owners:
to add to their collections material supplied by other libraries (corporate and public), and
to supply copies of material to the corporation's employees.
The council says:
The Government has made no reference—let alone attempted justification—of these additional applications. We thus submit that Government should further amend the bill so that it:
would allow access by clients of public libraries to material in corporations, but
would not allow corporate libraries to add to their collections or supply copies to staff without fair payment to copyright owners.
Does anyone here disagree with that? If not, then is this not the time to fix it? The council finally says on that matter:
We note that the Government has indicated it will review the issue in connection with its consideration of the recommendations of the Copyright Law Review Committee in its report on simplification of the Copyright Act. However, it has given no indication of its time frame for doing so and we understand that it is a relatively low priority.
Do we have to wait till a similar late quarter of this century to see this matter put to rights and to ensure that those who own copyright are paid when their material is used? I think the best opportunity for this—we do not know when another opportunity is going to come before the Senate—is to amend this legislation right now to cover that concern.

"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2000-08-17,"—I rise to conclude the second reading stage of the debate. I am very pleased that all parties now seem to recognise the validity of the recent comments of both the Goldman Sachs and the OECD reports indicating that Australia is certainly a high-tech economy. We are very computer literate and have enormous opportunities which have been identified most recently in the report of the National Office of the Information Economy entitled E-commerce Beyond 2000, which predicts that by the year 2007 we should have a 2.7 per cent increase in GDP as a result of the increasingly speedy adoption of e-commerce opportunities. Today is a very historic moment because this is the really big item in terms of the government's copyright reform agenda.
In 1996, we came to the election promising to make copyright reform a high priority. It had been in the too-hard basket for some years. It was quite clear that the Labor Party simply did not have the stomach to tackle it. Probably the best example of that was the way they caved in on parallel importation of CDs. They were in favour of it until the heat got too much. A couple of artists came out and told them to back off and they duly did. No doubt the unions told them as well. We watched all of that with interest. It certainly hardened my resolve to pursue copyright law reform. Over the last few years, we have indeed introduced decompilation of computer software. We successfully achieved the relaxation on the parallel imports of CDs. We extended copyright for photographers and we have a very major piece of legislation in the moral rights bill currently before the parliament. We have another two agenda items coming up shortly in relation to parallel importation of books and software, but by and large this is a major new initiative. I am delighted that all parties have effectively signed off. Hopefully, it will allow Australia to adjust seamlessly to the new digital environment with the information age well and truly upon us. I think it identifies the right balance between ensuring that copyright owners' legitimate interests are protected and at the same time ensuring the users have the same protections that have been available to them in the offline environment. 
The Copyright Amendment (Digital Agenda) Bill implements the most comprehensive package of reforms to Australian copyright law since the enactment of the Copyright Act in 1968. In developing the legislation, the government has given all relevant interests extensive opportunities to put their views and comment on the proposed reforms. The bill represents the culmination of that exhaustive consultation process. The reforms will update Australia's copyright standards to meet the challenges and harness the opportunities presented by rapid developments in communications technology, in particular the expansion of the Internet. They have been designed to provide the copyright framework to successfully take our communications, IT, R&D, education and arts sectors into the 21st century.
The unifying theme that connects these sectors is the production of content and its delivery to end users. Content is the key commodity of the information economy and our copyright laws regulate both its commercial exploitation and its accessibility. The government is committed to maintaining the balance between copyright owners and users so that the new economy will encourage research, innovation and the production of new material. The bill also recognises the key role of carriers and Internet service providers who are facilitating the delivery of content over the Internet.
This bill is an integral component in the government's strategy to develop a legal framework that encourages online activity and promotes the growth of the information economy. Importantly, the bill provides copyright owners with the tools they need for the commercial exploitation of their intellectual property in the digital age. The centrepiece of the reforms is a new, broadly based, technology neutral right of communication to the public. New enforcement measures in the bill will also provide copyright owners with effective tools to combat online piracy. The bill also enhances copyright enforcement for broadcasters by providing sanctions and remedies against the manufacture and commercial dealing in decoding devices for the unauthorised reception of encoded signals.
The right of copyright owners such as film producers whose material is included in free-to-air broadcasts has also been augmented by the introduction of a statutory licence scheme to remunerate them when their work is retransmitted. Having provided new rights and enforcement measures for copyright owners, the bill also provides users with an important package of exceptions to copyright and allows exemptions for the supply of decoding devices and services in closely defined circumstances. These exceptions in the area of research and education are vital to promoting innovation in the information economy. The government recognises that a robust research sector is essential to encourage the innovation necessary for competitive Australian industries.
New technologies also provide great opportunities for users in remote and regional Australia to access the educational and cultural material more readily available in metropolitan areas. The bill sets the framework to allow the education sector to work with copyright owners to deliver new innovative online educational services both in Australia and overseas. The government has also been mindful of the particular perspective of the carriers and ISPs who are facilitating the delivery of content over the Internet. Accordingly, the bill limits and clarifies their liability and makes it plain that we do not adopt the strict liability approach that some other regimes have applied in this and other contexts. 
I should also say in passing in relation to some concerns that Senator Brown expressed about the report of the Andrews committee that the government has accepted in principle the principal recommendation in relation to the right of first digitisation. The bill will explicitly recognise that right as a subset of the right of reproduction. The Andrews committee highlighted that it was unclear whether the bill specifically recognised the right of first digitisation. This has now been clarified through the addition of a legislative note, to the satisfaction of the members of the Andrews committee. It is also important to make clear that there are very strict limits on the charging regime, that the overwhelming bulk of library users will still have free access but that it will be important to ensure that the further consideration of this matter in response to the simplification of the Copyright Act 1968 is an important agenda item and we do not intend simply to allow it to languish.
The amendments provided by this bill are at the cutting edge of online copyright reform. They clearly place Australia among the leaders in international developments in this area. New technologies in business models are rapidly evolving. As a result, in certain areas of the bill we are entering uncharted waters. The bill will commence six months after it receives royal assent, allowing affected parties to renegotiate current arrangements in light of the comprehensive amendments provided by the bill. The government also proposes that the operation of the legislation be reviewed within three years of the commencement of the legislation. Before that time, however, as a matter of priority in September the government will be calling for submissions on the issue of film directors' copyright. It is hoped that any amendments arising from the review will be ready to be introduced by the end of this year. A press release that will be going out shortly makes it clear that the government intends to begin work on the important question of reforming copyright to recognise the crucial role that directors play in film production. I acknowledge Senator Stott Despoja's keen interest in this area and I hope that that will assuage the concerns of those in the community who thought that this matter ought to have been finally addressed now. We intend to look at it very thoroughly but expeditiously. The Copyright (Digital Agenda) Bill 2000 will update Australian copyright law for the 21st century and its passage will be a key milestone in the successful development of our information economy. I thank and congratulate all those who have contributed to what I think has been a very good outcome for Australia.

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-08-17,"—This bill basically contains three fundamental issues: (1) it extends the reach of the limited tenure promotions scheme currently at and above the rank of colonel down to that of lieutenant colonel; (2) it enables a serving member to convert an open-ended enlistment or appointment to a fixed term one; and (3) it clarifies where a service chief can reject the resignation of an officer, mainly where they have not served the agreed minimum term under the return of service obligations. The first two we agree to, but we had some queries about the third one. A number of questions were raised by shadow minister Laurie Ferguson with the office of the minister, Mr Scott. I would like to put on record the question and the response to it, which I think is important for clarification of the debate and the legislation. The question was:
Will every officer have the same initial or minimum period of service or will different determinations apply to particular officers or categories of officers?
The answer supplied by the minister's office was:
The standard requirement will be for most officers to complete a minimum period of four years service. Officers who attend ADFA, the Australian Defence Force Academy, will be required to complete a longer period of service to reflect the greater investment by the ADF in their training. For most ADF entrants, this will be nine years; however, for engineers and honours graduates, this period will be 11 years. These periods also reflect current ADF policy on the use of return of service obligations. 
We are asked to `please note that resignations submitted for compelling reasons within these periods may still be accepted'. A further answer is:
... in the case of specialist or direct entry officers, such as doctors and dentists, the minimum period of service may be much shorter. If a long period of service were imposed upon these officers they may be discouraged from entering the ADF. For these officers, who are laterally recruited, the length of the initial period of service will be determined by the services on a case by case basis.
That clarification is important for us to support that aspect of the legislation.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (FLEXIBLE CAREER PRACTICES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1,speech
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2000-08-17,"—The Australian Defence Force commits significant resources to training its personnel and therefore has a responsibility to retain them in the service. On the other hand, it must also ensure that personnel are not retained in the service simply because of their seniority. In order to manage these sometimes competing requirements, the ADF uses a number of flexible employment practices, including limited tenure promotion, enlistment of personnel for an initial minimum period of service in order to recover investments in the entry level training of personnel and, finally, the Defence Force now makes greater use of fixed periods of service rather than permanent appointments for personnel in some occupations.
Taken together, these provisions assist the Australian Defence Force in balancing the need to retain personnel in some occupations while maintaining healthy rates of turnover in others. These provisions are already used sparingly but with good effect in the ADF. This bill amends the Defence Act and the Naval Defence Act in order to extend or facilitate the application of these provisions. The bill proposes minor changes which address only some of the personnel issues that confront the ADF. These changes are, however, sensible and useful enhancements to the way the Defence Force does business. I thank honourable senators for their cooperation and support for the bill, and I commend the bill to the Senate.

Why did the Minister for Health and Aged Care order the scrapping of the $300,000 grant previously given to the Public Health Association of Australia for the provision of independent policy advice to the department on public health issues?

"West, Sen Sue",ALP,2000-08-17,"—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. If the Howard government attacks the Friends of Medicare in this way, aren't the public entitled to agree with Stephen Doe in the Melbourne Age, where he described the government's agenda as being nothing short of the destruction of Medicare as we know it? Isn't this standard operating procedure for a government headed by someone who has long boasted that he would `take the scalpel to Medicare'?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Public Health Association of Australia: Funding</title>,Questions Without Notice,20,1,question
"Herron, Sen John",LP,2000-08-17,"—It would be totally unlike Minister Wooldridge to scrap any program that was of any benefit to the continuation of Medicare because, as Senator West would know, the coalition is the best friend that Medicare ever had. The implication in that question—that somehow or other some program was scrapped—is something Minister Wooldridge would be unlikely to do. I am quite confident that what Minister Wooldridge has put in place has revived Medicare to the stage where it is viable because of the changes to private health insurance.
—You're undermining it!
—Senator Cook may be interested to know that the numbers have almost doubled since we came into office. That is the best thing that could have been done for Medicare. The reality is that it was supported by the overwhelming majority of Australians, because at last we will get balance into the Medicare system of public and private hospitals. We are approaching  50 per cent of the public voluntarily—and not by any form of coercion—taking up private health insurance. They have been assisted to take up private health insurance and have been given freedom of choice. What the Labor Party did when they were in power for 13 years was run down private health insurance to the stage where it became almost enviable.
I had the opportunity to look at my maiden speech today, and in that speech I related how private health insurance in Queensland was down to 30 per cent—that 70 per cent of the population was totally reliant on the public health system, that it had become overcrowded and was almost at breakdown stage. I will take on notice Senator West's question in relation to the association. I will see what the truth is and, if funding was changed, the reasons for it.

I am proud to say that, after 4½ years of the Howard government, we have reached the stage now where the rate of private health insurance is rapidly rising and we have an increase of more than 1.7 million people who have taken out private health insurance as a result of the incentives that we provided through the rebate system.

The answer read as follows—
Senator Stott Despoja asked the Minister representing the Attorney-General, Senator Vanstone, the following questions:
Is the Minister aware of a survey released today by the New South Wales Genetics Education Program Unit that shows 54 cases of people who feel that they have been discriminated against on the basis of genetic tests? Are these the real, practical examples that a government spokeswoman last week said did not exist? Can the Minister inform the Senate what protection these citizens have from genetic discrimination while the Government is pondering the issue? Will the Government introduce an interim moratorium on the use and disclosure of genetic information for any purposes besides personal, medical and positive employment discrimination cases? 
Is the Minister aware of documented cases of genetic discrimination which were made available to the public last month? If the Minister is aware of those cases, can she explain to the Senate what protection we can offer those Australians now to ensure that they are not discriminated against on the basis of their genetic information?
Senator Vanstone-I am advised that the answer to the honourable Senator's questions are as follows:
The Attorney-General is aware of media reports of a recently released survey on uses of genetic information. The Attorney-General is also aware of media reports of a number of instances of discriminatory use of genetic information.
Gene technology and genetic information involve complex issues that affect a wide range of sectors of the Australian community. The Government believes it would not be appropriate to act hastily before all the issues raised by advances in gene technology have been carefully considered.
It is for this reason that the Attorney-General and the Minister for Health and Aged Care have announced that they will refer the complex issues raised by developments in gene technology to a joint inquiry of the Australian Law Reform Commission and the Australian Health Ethics Committee of the National Health and Medical Research Council.
The terms of reference for the joint inquiry will be announced shortly. The wide ranging inquiry will give the Australian community and all those with an interest in human genetic information and technology an opportunity to put forward their views on this important issue.
The Government shares the community's concerns that genetic information should be treated sensitively to prevent the potential for abuse or discrimination on the basis of actual or imputed genetic characteristics. The Government also notes that genetic information has many important scientific and medical applications which are of benefit to the community as a whole.
The joint inquiry into this difficult and complex issue is the appropriate context in which to consider the findings of the survey to which the honourable Senator refers.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Genetic Information: Legislation</title>,Questions Without Notice,21,1,speech

Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON TREATIES
REPORT 23. Amendments proposed to the International Whaling Convention. August 1999
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE.  August 2000
On 23 August 1999 the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties (the Committee) tabled in Federal Parliament its 23rd Report, on “Amendments proposed to the International Whaling Convention”.
The report relates to proposed amendments to the Schedule to the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, 1946 (the Convention), which were tabled in Parliament on 23 June 1999. 
The first set of amendments arises from a decision taken by the 51st Annual Meeting of the International Whaling Commission (IWC), which met in Grenada from 24 to 28 May 1999.  These amendments involve revisions to Paragraph 13(b)(4), in order to renew the annual quota for the Bequian people of St Vincent and the Grenadines, in the Eastern Caribbean, to take two humpback whales per annum for three years from 2000 to 2002. 
The second set of amendments arises from the annual requirement to make current the dates in Paragraphs 11 and 12 and Tables 1, 2 and 3 of the Schedule to the Convention, in order to maintain the moratorium on commercial whaling (zero catch limits).  The dates will be changed from 1998/1999 pelagic season to 1999/2000 pelagic season, from 1999 coastal season to 2000 coastal season, from 1999 season to 2000 season, and from 1999 to 2000 respectively.
The Committee recommended that no formal objection be lodged to either set of the proposed amendments.  The Government has noted the recommendation, and did not lodge any objection within the 90 days provided under the Convention.  No other Contracting Government lodged objections within the 90 days, and the amendments therefore came into force on 9 September 1999.
The Committee discussed in some detail the first set of amendments, which renewed the quota for the Bequian people to take two humpback whales annually from 2000 to 2002.  The Committee recommended that Australia lodge an “expression of concern”, seek to have the quota reconsidered at the 52nd annual meeting of the IWC, and request the IWC to obtain a detailed needs statement from the Bequian people for consideration at the meeting.
The Government shares the concerns expressed by the Committee about the justification for the Bequian quota and the manner of the hunt.  Australia voiced these concerns clearly both before and at the 51st annual meeting of the International Whaling Commission.  By negotiating at length with other IWC members, Australia was instrumental in ensuring that the IWC placed more stringent conditions upon the Bequian hunt.  While sharing the Committee's concerns, the Government considers alternative action is more appropriate than the three specific actions recommended by the Committee in relation to the Bequian quota.
There is no specific mechanism within IWC procedures for lodging an “expression of concern”, as recommended by the Committee.  The Australian Government made its concerns known to the IWC and to the Government of St Vincent and the Grenadines by letter prior to the last meeting, during negotiations over the quota, and again in a statement following the IWC decision.  A further expression of concern would not alter the quota.  The Australian Government will however write to the Government of St Vincent and the Grenadines, prior to the 52nd meeting in 2000, requesting that a full report on any take of whales in 2000 be lodged with the IWC before the annual meeting, as required under the Convention.
It is also not considered practical for Australia to seek to have the quota reconsidered at the 52nd annual meeting of the IWC.  The decision of the 51st annual meeting of the IWC notes that the Government of St Vincent and the Grenadines has given a commitment that it will “submit a detailed needs statement when the quota is next considered for renewal”, i.e. in 2002.  There is no mechanism for the IWC as a whole to request a needs statement before the meeting in 2000 and it is most unlikely that the Government of St Vincent and the Grenadines would submit such a statement in 2000 without such a request.  In the absence of a detailed needs statement, it would not be feasible for the IWC to consider the Bequian quota in any more informed way in 2000 than was possible at the meeting in 1999. 
In addition to making recommendations relating directly to the amendments, the Committee made a more general recommendation that the Australian Government should prepare a proposal for the next annual meeting of the IWC to revise the Convention and its Schedule.
The Australian Government shares the view of the Committee that revision of the Convention and its Schedule would be highly desirable.  Nevertheless, as the Committee noted in its report, the current membership of the IWC makes it most unlikely that the required three-fourths majority could be obtained for any significant amendment of the Schedule. 
At the 52nd annual meeting of the IWC, which will be held in Adelaide from 3 to 6 July 2000, Australia will again negotiate actively with all Contracting Governments in pursuit of Australia's whale conservation objectives.  Australia must be judicious in selecting which issues to pursue most actively at the meeting.  The highest priorities for Australia will be: to continue the current moratorium on commercial whaling; to support existing whale sanctuaries; to pursue the establishment of further whale sanctuaries including the South Pacific Whale Sanctuary; and to continue to seek an end to so-called “scientific” whaling and to commercial whaling carried out under reservations. 
Recognising the time and resources required to pursue any international initiative successfully, the Australian Government considers that its efforts in the lead-up to the 52nd meeting of the IWC are best focused on these highest priorities.  The potential for longer term changes to the Convention and its Schedule will become more apparent after the 52nd meeting, and it may be timely to begin work later in 2000 on a multi-lateral proposal for revisions.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2000-08-17,"—I present the government's response to the 23rd report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, on amendments proposed to the International Whaling Convention, and I seek leave to incorporate the document in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON TREATIES
REPORT 23. Amendments proposed to the International Whaling Convention. August 1999
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE.  August 2000
On 23 August 1999 the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties (the Committee) tabled in Federal Parliament its 23rd Report, on “Amendments proposed to the International Whaling Convention”.
The report relates to proposed amendments to the Schedule to the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, 1946 (the Convention), which were tabled in Parliament on 23 June 1999. 
The first set of amendments arises from a decision taken by the 51st Annual Meeting of the International Whaling Commission (IWC), which met in Grenada from 24 to 28 May 1999.  These amendments involve revisions to Paragraph 13(b)(4), in order to renew the annual quota for the Bequian people of St Vincent and the Grenadines, in the Eastern Caribbean, to take two humpback whales per annum for three years from 2000 to 2002. 
The second set of amendments arises from the annual requirement to make current the dates in Paragraphs 11 and 12 and Tables 1, 2 and 3 of the Schedule to the Convention, in order to maintain the moratorium on commercial whaling (zero catch limits).  The dates will be changed from 1998/1999 pelagic season to 1999/2000 pelagic season, from 1999 coastal season to 2000 coastal season, from 1999 season to 2000 season, and from 1999 to 2000 respectively.
The Committee recommended that no formal objection be lodged to either set of the proposed amendments.  The Government has noted the recommendation, and did not lodge any objection within the 90 days provided under the Convention.  No other Contracting Government lodged objections within the 90 days, and the amendments therefore came into force on 9 September 1999.
The Committee discussed in some detail the first set of amendments, which renewed the quota for the Bequian people to take two humpback whales annually from 2000 to 2002.  The Committee recommended that Australia lodge an “expression of concern”, seek to have the quota reconsidered at the 52nd annual meeting of the IWC, and request the IWC to obtain a detailed needs statement from the Bequian people for consideration at the meeting.
The Government shares the concerns expressed by the Committee about the justification for the Bequian quota and the manner of the hunt.  Australia voiced these concerns clearly both before and at the 51st annual meeting of the International Whaling Commission.  By negotiating at length with other IWC members, Australia was instrumental in ensuring that the IWC placed more stringent conditions upon the Bequian hunt.  While sharing the Committee's concerns, the Government considers alternative action is more appropriate than the three specific actions recommended by the Committee in relation to the Bequian quota.
There is no specific mechanism within IWC procedures for lodging an “expression of concern”, as recommended by the Committee.  The Australian Government made its concerns known to the IWC and to the Government of St Vincent and the Grenadines by letter prior to the last meeting, during negotiations over the quota, and again in a statement following the IWC decision.  A further expression of concern would not alter the quota.  The Australian Government will however write to the Government of St Vincent and the Grenadines, prior to the 52nd meeting in 2000, requesting that a full report on any take of whales in 2000 be lodged with the IWC before the annual meeting, as required under the Convention.
It is also not considered practical for Australia to seek to have the quota reconsidered at the 52nd annual meeting of the IWC.  The decision of the 51st annual meeting of the IWC notes that the Government of St Vincent and the Grenadines has given a commitment that it will “submit a detailed needs statement when the quota is next considered for renewal”, i.e. in 2002.  There is no mechanism for the IWC as a whole to request a needs statement before the meeting in 2000 and it is most unlikely that the Government of St Vincent and the Grenadines would submit such a statement in 2000 without such a request.  In the absence of a detailed needs statement, it would not be feasible for the IWC to consider the Bequian quota in any more informed way in 2000 than was possible at the meeting in 1999. 
In addition to making recommendations relating directly to the amendments, the Committee made a more general recommendation that the Australian Government should prepare a proposal for the next annual meeting of the IWC to revise the Convention and its Schedule.
The Australian Government shares the view of the Committee that revision of the Convention and its Schedule would be highly desirable.  Nevertheless, as the Committee noted in its report, the current membership of the IWC makes it most unlikely that the required three-fourths majority could be obtained for any significant amendment of the Schedule. 
At the 52nd annual meeting of the IWC, which will be held in Adelaide from 3 to 6 July 2000, Australia will again negotiate actively with all Contracting Governments in pursuit of Australia's whale conservation objectives.  Australia must be judicious in selecting which issues to pursue most actively at the meeting.  The highest priorities for Australia will be: to continue the current moratorium on commercial whaling; to support existing whale sanctuaries; to pursue the establishment of further whale sanctuaries including the South Pacific Whale Sanctuary; and to continue to seek an end to so-called “scientific” whaling and to commercial whaling carried out under reservations. 
Recognising the time and resources required to pursue any international initiative successfully, the Australian Government considers that its efforts in the lead-up to the 52nd meeting of the IWC are best focused on these highest priorities.  The potential for longer term changes to the Convention and its Schedule will become more apparent after the 52nd meeting, and it may be timely to begin work later in 2000 on a multi-lateral proposal for revisions. 
In conclusion, the Government appreciates that the Committee considered the issues arising from the amendments in some detail, and the Government wishes to express its gratitude to the Committee for their close attention to these important matters.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report: Government Response</title>,Committees,24,2,speech

"West, Sen Sue",ALP,2000-08-17,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
Where this government is leading us with health is a significant issue. In answer to questions I asked today about Medicare and about a grant being cut to a public health group, we heard the minister say that this government was the saviour of Medicare—that this government was doing wonderful things because it had got all these additional people with private health insurance. One has to wonder where Australia's health in the 2000s is going to go when all this government can say is that extra people have private health insurance. 
What the government are not telling us and what they cannot measure is what hospital and health facilities these people are going to use. What they do not tell us is that a person has to pay a very large front-end deductible before they then get the payments to cover their health needs, or that there are additional caveats. These additional people with private health insurance are not people who are wanting to take out private health insurance and to use it. This really looks like people taking out private health insurance because they are scared of what this government is going to do in the future. People are feeling that they have been blackmailed into taking out private health insurance, and they are very worried, upset and concerned. There is concern that this is a potential erosion of Medicare. The people of Australia really value Medicare, access to public hospitals and a good public hospital system.
—I hear bleats from the other side about tax rebates. Who do tax rebates benefit most? Those on higher incomes. Besides that, if you do not use your private health insurance for private hospital services, you are still dependent on the public hospital sector. Senators opposite need to remember that funding to public hospitals also has a catch clause: the number of people with private health insurance impacts on it. This needs to be recalled as well. 
This government do not care about health. The minister removed a grant of $300,000 and the minister representing him in this place could not tell us the reason why. This is pretty terrible. But this government do not care. They are a government who will not defend Medicare. They say they are going to, but their actions and their activities would very clearly indicate that they have no real commitment to public hospitals and public health. The minister in this place keeps talking about the number of people with private health insurance. He keeps talking about the private health sector. What this country has to have first of all is a good public sector and a government committed to that. It is fine for people who live in the city areas where they have access to private hospitals, but many people in country areas who feel compelled to take out private health insurance are never going to be able to utilise it within the community in which they live. They do not have a private hospital in their community. This is what makes Australia's health system very important. It is not an expensive health system, in terms of the world-class standards it delivers. People are able to access the health system here. But this government need to stop ripping off money for their public sector from the states and provide them with adequate Commonwealth funds to ensure that sector also is viable and vibrant.
Turning to Australia's Health 2000, this government is doing absolutely nothing to address the training needs of allied health professionals. I have spoken many times before on this matter. This is a government that is prepared to help doctors pay off their HECS bills, but is not prepared to help nurses or physiotherapists or speech therapists pay off their HECS bills. Where is the fairness in that? You do not need as many doctors to run a good health system as you do nurses, but the federal government is doing nothing to address the shortage of nurses in this country. It ignored it in the last budget. It gave doctors a chance to reduce their HECS bill but it did nothing towards giving nurses or any of the other health professionals that chance.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2000-08-17,"—I want to make some remarks on the report by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare that Senator West has just spoken to—Australia's Health 2000. One of the most outrageous claims that has been made by a minister of this government has to be the one that was made by Senator Herron, representing the Minister for Health and Aged Care, today. I note that the minister is in the chamber. He claims that this government is the greatest friend that Medicare ever had. Even Senator Herron knew, when he uttered that statement, that it is the most outrageous claim that has ever been made. This is from a minister whose Prime Minister is on the record as having had as his ultimate goal the destruction of Medicare. This is from a minister whose predecessors, when they came to power in 1975, set out to destroy Medibank. It was the Labor government in 1983 that restored universal health cover for the Australian population. As Senator West has just commented, the legacy of the Fraser years, the years when Mr Howard was a senior government member, was that two million Australians were left without any cover whatsoever. 
—Plus 11 per cent unemployed. 
—Plus 11 per cent unemployment. 
—Plus 10 per cent interest rates. 
—Plus 10 per cent interest rates. 
—Plus $22 billion of debt. 
—Plus debt that in today's terms is $22 billion. 
—Inflation was also in excess of 10 per cent. 
—Thank you. I am sure that I am going to have a lot of support from my colleagues in addressing this report. I take on board all of those comments. This government alleges that it has restored some equity, if you like, to the system. Nothing could be further from the truth. This government ripped out of the system in excess of $1 billion for public hospitals when it came to office in 1996. It reduced the level of funding available to the states for public hospitals at a time when reliance upon public hospitals in the states had been increasing.  
This government introduced the rebate system for private health insurance. Today the minister claimed that because people have joined those funds somehow that is solving the problem. I make two comments about that. Firstly, we all know why in recent months additional people have joined private health funds. They have been frightened into believing that they would not continue to have access to a decent health system unless they joined a private health fund. It is well known—it is documented—that many people have taken out private health insurance in situations where they were not particularly required to with respect to the surcharge that would be applied if they did not have private health insurance. Many elderly people have been forced to join health funds to prop up the numbers, fearing the consequences from this government if they did not do so. 
Secondly, we also know that many people on higher incomes have taken advantage of this system. In order to qualify for the rebate—the 30 per cent subsidy for taking out private health insurance—they have taken out the cheapest forms of private health insurance available. They have worked out that if they sign up to the cheaper forms of private health cover they get a significant rebate. So the cost to them is far less than the surcharge that would be applied if they did not have private health insurance. Further, the statistics show—they come from the Australian Healthcare Associates—that in New South Wales the number of patients going through the public hospitals is still increasing. Statistics show that half the 158,000 privately insured patients in New South Wales—85,000—registered as public patients. They are still using the public hospital system. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2000-08-17,"—I was not going to speak to this matter today but the member for Griffith saw fit to say a few words on the Brisbane Airport Corporation's master plan, so I thought I might add a few comments for the betterment of the public interest. Mr Rudd has claimed that the Liberal Party, including me and local councillors who are Liberals, do not care about the people of Griffith, that the potential building of a parallel runway is a foregone conclusion and that he is the only one that cares. 
I actually want to defend the Labor Party on this. There are very many people in the Labor Party who in fact agree that the process that this government has undertaken with respect to the master plan is appropriate. The Lord Mayor of Brisbane, Councillor Jim Soorley, agrees with the government. He says that every time Mr Rudd opens his mouth, real estate prices go down. Mr Bill Ludwig, a grand gentleman of Queensland politics, also supports the way the government has gone about this. I think the member for Bowman, Mr Sciacca, also does. Mr Martin Ferguson, the shadow minister for transport, has been very quiet, as has the former minister, Mr Brereton. No-one is supporting Mr Rudd on the Labor side at all. Why? Because under the Airports Act there is a process that has been outlined that we have all agreed to.
What Mr Rudd has done is this: he has made political capital out of people's fears. The Airports Act was put together by the Australian Labor Party and admittedly passed by the Liberal Party when we were in government. No objections. That process is a fair process and Mr Rudd has decided to make political capital out of it by scaremongering. He is not concerned about aircraft noise; he is concerned about making political capital. That is what he is doing. 
There is one issue that Mr Rudd has not answered. Here is a man who was the former head of the Cabinet Office under Mr Goss, the then Premier. Here is a man who seems to be constantly surrounded by lawyers, and yet he gave evidence to the Senate that he did not seek legal advice before he went around the electorate of Griffith, wrote columns to the paper and made statements on how dreadful the government process was outlined under the legislation—his party's legislation. 
He did not even check—that was his evidence. If he had checked, he would have discovered that the process was in fact fair. Do you know why he did not check? Because if he had checked he would have discovered that the Brisbane Airports Corporation master plan does not determine finally the location of any runway or staggered parallel runway. Mr Rudd is concerned with only one thing. We all know it, and those sitting opposite me know it—that is, political gain. He will do anything, including scaremongering day in and day out. I understand that many of his Labor colleagues do not agree with him, and I accept that. But the people of Griffith and I are very tired of the fact that every time he opens his mouth their real estate values go down. If he had taken the time to check the law—and remember this is a former head of the cabinet office running off to the AAT and the Federal Court at the moment and saying he had never checked the law—he would have seen that every piece of legal advice says the same thing; that is, the master plan does not determine the issue. 
—If you keep waving your arms around like that you'll take off.
—Senator Forshaw does not even support Mr Rudd. I congratulate you.

"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2000-08-17,"—I do not know whether it is the advent of laptops in the chamber—and a very effective tool they are for those of us who are interested in using that sort of technology—but one of the issues that I want to speak about this evening is electronic voting and Internet voting in particular. I was recently in the beautiful New England town of Tamworth, where, of course, as one does, I perused the local newspaper, the Northern Daily Leader. It is not necessarily the sort of publication in which you might expect to come across an article on electronic voting but there it was—pride of place—an article discussing possible moves to electronically based voting, in fact reporting statements made by my colleague Senator Chris Ellison, the Special Minister of State. In this article he was indicating the enormous potential for Internet based voting in this country and voicing his support for the efforts of the Australian Electoral Commission in keeping a watching brief on this issue.
For some time I have been looking at what advantages Australians can take of new technology to their benefit—for example, how the Internet can help those in rural and regional areas or women in certain parts of the community to overcome barriers to accessing information. I also canvassed the potential impact of the Internet on Australian and international politics. This is a potential which the Australian government is embracing with great enthusiasm. It is not only in influencing the decision making process involved in politics that technology can have a great impact, and those people who have dual interests in technology and voting systems have busily explored the possibility of using new technology to conduct ballots.
As I have said before, IT has impacted on virtually every aspect of our lives, from banking to education to communication and much more. Sometimes we do not even notice the effect of technology as we undertake our day-to-day tasks, and so far the use of technology in voting systems seems to be, to some degree, the exception to this. But there is absolutely no reason that the democratic process cannot also gain from new technology. In reality, the Australian electoral process and the voting system that we currently use have not changed significantly in the last 100 years—the computerisation of rolls and all those sorts of things, yes, but for the actual voting system itself there have been no great changes. So I think we have a unique opportunity now to consider how we might reinvigorate the electoral system.
So if you consider the possibilities on both a large scale and a small scale, you see we conduct ballots on a regular basis in Australia—in fact, some members of the community say too often. From federal elections to those at state and local level and to elections at schools, at universities, for organisations, and in the workplace, we are always participating in some sort of a ballot. We in the chamber know better than most how often you get to vote these days on a number of things. Mostly we still use that very traditional means of crossing our names off an electoral roll, whether literally or figuratively, and filling out a paper ballot. What technology offers is an enormous capacity to streamline this. There are two key means through which technology could be introduced into electoral systems here. One is through introducing computerised systems at the polling place and, of course, the alternative is the prospect of remote access to cast a ballot. 
That second means is not just a theoretical possibility. Across various parts of the world, in fact, the theory has been put into practice, testing the use of technology in conducting ballots. In the United Kingdom a number of local councils trialed electronic voting at the recent elections they held in May. Similarly, in New Zealand some testing has taken place. Interestingly, Costa Rica has been trialing the introduction of technology in their electoral systems and at their national elections two years ago the entire country was able to vote electronically via computer kiosks at polling stations. They had technical support provided from AT&T and policy guarantees from the Centre for Information Law and Policy in the United States, and voters cast their electronic ballots at polling locations. They undertook that process to test the ease of using its methodology, with a long-term view to full use of electronic voting in the future.
The well-known corporation Unisys managed an electronic voting project in Brazil. They were involved in the training of personnel, the installation and the maintenance of equipment and the more technical side of an operation that allowed 35 million Brazilians to vote electronically for their municipal councils. So there has been a lot of `testing of the water' in this process.
The United States obviously has been most prolific in its take-up of Internet technologies in politics. The overwhelming majority of candidates for office in the United States have an impressive Net presence, including, most interestingly, for their fundraising efforts in this recent campaign. It has become a key part of their political system, and it is bipartisan. In the last lot of presidential elections, the Democrat and Republican candidates noted the importance of their web sites to their campaigns. Both Bob Dole and John Kerry, Republican and Democrat respectively, said that one-third of their new campaign volunteers registered via the Internet. In 1998, for better or for worse, Jesse Ventura won a surprise victory in the gubernatorial race in Minnesota. Part of the reason for that was said to be his capacity to energise a demographic which utilises the Internet heavily—obviously the wrestling demographic.
The Internet is obviously fundamental to this year's US electoral cycle. Both the Republicans and the Democrats, through their national conventions, sought to have a `virtual' convention presence so that the process was accessible for those who could not be there physically. It is not just in regard to proselytising that the Internet has played a role in US elections. From the perspective of administration, they have also sought to utilise technology to improve their whole electoral processes, which are pretty complicated at the best of times. Oregon has experimented with mail-in voting, South Carolina is allowing its citizens to register to vote over the Net, and in 1996 the Reform Party utilised the Internet as a means of selecting their presidential candidate. In schools, colleges and universities electronic voting is used to run elections. At Kansas State University in March, the first student-body binding Internet election was held—unfortunately I do not have a report on who won. The United States government has been considering how to enable overseas residents, both military and other, from a number of states to vote online for the elections that they are holding in a couple of months. In Florida they trialed electronic voting in 12 counties in 1998.
More recently, the Democrats in Arizona chose to conduct their presidential primary election with the aid of the Internet. Voters were offered the options of voting at a polling place using a paper ballot, voting at a polling place using the Internet or voting via remote Internet connection. Of the 86,000 people who cast a vote, 45 per cent chose to utilise either the polling place Internet facility or to log on themselves at a remote location. A brief analysis of the results from that ballot indicated that it did not turn out any aberrant results. There were no great surprises, which hopefully goes some way towards alleviating concerns that Internet polls might bring about different results to more traditional ballots. In this case, Al Gore won comfortably over Bill Bradley, which was a result that was mirrored across the country. In a number of very remote regions of Alaska, the state Republicans have used an Internet straw poll for their state presidential primary.  
There is a range of examples, and the question must be: what does it mean for Australia? I think it is important to acknowledge that Australia has been keen to involve technologies in our political process, both to engage more people in the political system and to make the system open and accessible. That is one of the reasons why I am very proud of the web site that I operate. In 1998 in our federal election, the AEC hosted the largest live Internet event ever conducted in Australia—that, of course, was the virtual tally room. It was visited by an estimated 85,000 people, who were able to obtain results at a divisional, state and territory, and national level. Following the polling day, results were updated at least daily and polling place figures were also made available. So the Australian community is, at the very least, open to the use of the Internet in the political cycle.
Particular applications of new technologies internationally present lessons and indicators for our context. The most important thing that should be taken from some of those examples I mentioned is that choice should always remain available. Not everybody will be comfortable with using the new technologies. A presidential primary is pretty different from a national or state election here, but the fact remains that in the Arizona example I mentioned nearly half the voters who participated in that ballot participated online. Obviously we need to look at things like security, the protection of privacy and the need to guarantee a secret ballot, but I think we can do that. Senator Ellison, in his discussions on this issue, has also noted concerns about access to technology as a key issue when contemplating these sorts of changes. But I think that they are changes that we can take up enthusiastically, using them to move forward.
