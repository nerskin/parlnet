"PRESIDENT, The",,2016-10-13,"



The PRESIDENT
 (09:31):  Yesterday I informed the Senate that I had received letters from Senator Ludlam and Senator Hinch seeking appointment to the Senate Standing Committee of Privileges. These are two nominations for one position on the committee, the position to be nominated by any minority group or Independent senators. In accordance with standing orders, a ballot will be held to determine which one of the two senators who have nominated is to be appointed. Before proceeding to the ballot, we will ring the bells for four minutes.




The bells having been rung—




The PRESIDENT:  The Senate will now proceed to ballot. Ballot papers will be distributed to senators, who are requested to write on the ballot paper the name of the candidate they wish to vote for. The candidates are Senator Ludlam and Senator Hinch. I invite Senator Siewert and Senator Hinch to come forward to act as scrutineers.




A ballot having been taken—





The PRESIDENT:  The result of the ballot is 39 votes for Senator Ludlam and 29 votes for Senator Hinch. Therefore, Senator Ludlam is duly elected as a member of Senate Standing Committee of Privileges.

Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (09:47):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I am very pleased to commence debate in the 45th Parliament on the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security Amendment Bill 2015. This bill was originally introduced by Senator Wong in 2015. It lapsed at prorogation in April 2016, was restored to the Notice Paper, lapsed again at the dissolution ahead of the election and was restored to the Notice Paper again to enable it to be advanced in the new parliament. This bill brings together a series of proposals designed to improve the operation of this significant joint statutory committee. The proposals are designed to make it more accountable and adaptable to the needs of the parliament and are also designed to enable the committee to have a greater amount of discretion in the way it conducts oversight of our intelligence and security agencies.


At the outset, I want to acknowledge the role of former senator John Faulkner in initiating the drafting and consultation on this bill. I might interpose here that Mr Faulkner recently gave up some of his time to come and address new senators on the way in which estimates runs. The bill is one of the legacies of Mr Faulkner's long parliamentary career and his determination to support and enhance parliamentary oversight of our intelligence and security agencies. Then Senator Faulkner first prepared this bill for introduction in 2014, presenting it to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security for consideration and comment, but retired before he was able to introduce the bill into the Senate. Labor is pleased to pursue the reforms contained in this bill originated by Mr Faulkner. John Faulkner served in the cabinets of two Labor governments and under three prime ministers and as Minister for Defence. He understood better than most the importance of being strong on national security, but he also understood that strength on national security does not come from tough rhetoric—it does not come from chest thumping or inflammatory statements; it comes from having intelligence and security agencies of the highest calibre that can be trusted to protect the rights and the liberties of the Australian people without trampling upon them. John Faulkner also understood that effective and rigorous parliamentary oversight is critical to the maintenance of public support of our national security architecture, particularly in these times.


This bill serves both those objectives. Effective scrutiny and oversight strengthen public support for our agencies and they also strengthen the agencies subject to oversight. As elected representatives gather in the national parliament, we can never outsource our duty to ensure the security of our nation and the people who entrust us with the responsibility of governing. This is as true when we are in times of relative peace as it is when we see emerging threats to our national security. This parliament must not deny our intelligence and security agencies the necessary powers and resources to protect Australian citizens and Australian interests. However, it must be recognised that these powers can impinge upon the values and freedoms on which our democracy is founded—values and freedoms which the Australian people correctly expect parliament to protect. As with so many things, this parliament must find the right balance between the security imperatives of our nation and the liberties and the freedoms of our people. The central plank of the intelligence and security framework is strong and effective accountability. Enhanced powers demand enhanced safeguards. Public trust and confidence in our security and intelligence agencies can only be ensured fully through strong and rigorous oversight and scrutiny.


I want to talk about the environment that we are confronted with. We know that over the last 15 years in particular this parliament has scrutinised and passed many pieces of legislation which have contributed to the development of a legislative architecture relating to our security and intelligence agencies. This has been in response to developments in the security situation, which has altered in new and significant ways over time. It also reflects changes in technology, which means that our intelligence and security agencies must operate in a higher level of sophistication with specialist expertise. There has generally been a high level of cooperation in the parliament to secure bipartisan agreement on national security legislation. Of course, bipartisanship does not mean taking an uncritical approach to proposals or additional or amended national security language or legislation.


In order to ensure rights and liberties are protected, it is essential that all parties approach legislative proposals with a discerning eye. In the current parliament, this Senate has dealt with a number of very significant pieces of national security legislation, and all have been subject to scrutiny by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. Each piece of legislation has been amended as a result of recommendations of the committee, sometimes quite extensively. This is an example of the process of parliamentary scrutiny at work. Likewise, the addition of other perspectives in the Senate debate ensures all views are ultimately considered and represented before the legislation comes to a vote.


As agencies continue to seek, and are granted, additional powers to meet contemporary threats, so too must scrutiny and oversight keep pace. In recent years Australia has benefited from professional and well-run intelligence and security agencies. Labor acknowledges their work. They have demonstrated respect and understanding of the role of the parliament, the government of the day and our laws. But the personal integrity and quality of leaders of our agencies, as important as this is, are not reliable, effective safeguards against the abuse of security powers. It is the responsibility of parliament to prescribe safeguards that keep pace with the expansion of security powers that have been deemed necessary.


The purpose of this bill is to ensure that the adequacy and effectiveness of parliamentary oversight of intelligence and security agencies is in keeping with the development and enhancement of additional powers we have afforded to these agencies. It amends the Intelligence Services Act 2001, the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor Act 2010 and the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act 1986. As legislative changes extending the powers of security agencies are implemented, the requirement for reliable and effective external oversight becomes more critical. If these changes which extend the powers of the agencies are given effect but are not accompanied by adequate safeguards, it will be more challenging to maintain an essential level of trust in the community about the agency's operations. Trust is essential if our agencies are to be effective.


Not only are these safeguards important to protect the public interest but they also create an environment that protects the agencies themselves. It is to the parliament that these agencies are accountable and it is parliament's responsibility to provide oversight of their priorities and their effectiveness. It is not sufficient for the parliament to simply put in place a legislative framework for the oversight of agencies without conducting oversight itself. If the parliament is not a check and balance, it will not be possible to ensure agencies meet the requirements and the standards that the parliament itself has set. The parliament has no better or more authoritative forum than the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security to do this job.


Just as the legislation governing our intelligence and security agencies must be under constant review, so too must be the legislation governing the operation of the committees. Just as we would expect amendments to be brought to the parliament to correct deficiencies and enhance the operation of our intelligence and security agencies, so too must the parliament assess the effectiveness of its own committee. Labor's submission to the Senate today is that the legislation governing the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security can be improved. We present this bill as a means of doing so. 


I want to briefly traverse the key measures in the bill. This bill removes current constraints on the membership of the committee to provide that, except for a minimum representation of one government member and senator and one opposition member and senator, the balance on the 11-member committee can be drawn from either chamber. Currently, the Intelligence Services Act 2001 mandates a composition of six House of Representatives members and five senators from the committees. Removing this current constraint will enable greater flexibility in determining PJCIS membership.


I note that the bill does not amend the requirement for the government to hold a majority. In relation to this provision, there is no reason why senators should be in the minority. I suggest to the Senate it should be left to the parties to draw members from the best available representatives. Because of the nexus that currently exists between the Senate and the other place, as well as between the parties, for example, in the past some senators on both sides have had to relinquish their places on the committee for a period in order to accommodate certain members of the other place for particular inquiries by a committee. The opposition found itself constrained by both the apportionment of membership between the Senate and House and the desire by the government to allocate its six members across the chamber in a particular way.


I reiterate: the bill does not amend the requirement for the government to hold a majority, but it does mean that there are fewer constraints placed on the choice of members for the committee based on the chamber in which they sit. I presume there would not be a senator who would object if this resulted in a greater number of senators on the committee. I note the continuing requirement that, before nominating members, the Prime Minister or the Leader of the Government in the Senate, as appropriate, is obliged to consult with the leader of each recognised political party that is represented in the House and in the Senate, as the case may be, and that does not form part of the government.


The bill also: provides for the committee to conduct its own-motion inquiries after consultation with the responsible minister; authorises the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor to provide the committee with a copy of any report on a matter referred to it by the committee; requires the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security to give the committee a copy of any report provided to the Prime Minister or a minister within three months; gives the committee the function of conducting presunset reviews of legislation containing sunset provisions; and adds the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor and the National Security Adviser to officers able to be consulted by the committee.


As the role of agencies and the powers afforded to them develops, the greater the potential for that power to infringe upon individual liberties and, in turn, the greater the need for accountability in the exercise of that power. I do not in any way suggest that our security and intelligence agencies are acting otherwise than in accordance with the law. That is not my view. But, if powers were to be used inappropriately, there would be an erosion of public trust. Having appropriate and effective accountability mechanisms protects both the agencies and the public. As I said previously, it is the parliament to which the agencies are accountable, not the judiciary, and it is the parliament's responsibility to oversee their priorities and effectiveness and to ensure agencies meet the requirements and standards it sets.


I want to briefly turn to an international comparison. An increasingly complex and unpredictable security landscape in Australia and around the world means the powers of intelligence and security agencies have changed dramatically in recent years. This is as true in Australia as it is in many other similar democracies. The maintenance of public security in the current security environment has led to greater powers for the agencies charged with these responsibilities. However, the protection of democratic liberties and freedoms equally demands enhanced oversight of the exercise of these powers. This is the case at home and abroad.


As senators would know, Australia forms part of the Five Eyes intelligence and security network of nations, including the United Kingdom, the United States, New Zealand and Canada. With the exception of Canada, each of these countries has at least one committee of the legislature that exercises oversight of that country's intelligence and security agencies.


In the United Kingdom, the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament consists of nine members drawn from both the House of Commons and the House of Lords. The numbers from each chamber are not specified in the governing act. Similarly to our committee, the members of the intelligence and security committee of the United Kingdom are appointed by the house in which they serve, on the nomination of the Prime Minister in consultation with the opposition. Recent reforms provided that committee with greater powers and increased its remit, including oversight of operational activities and the wider intelligence and security activities of government.


The United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence is established by resolution of the senate and consists of 15 senators: eight from the majority party and seven from the minority party. It meets roughly twice a week, generally in closed sessions. Most hearings involve appearances by senior intelligence community officials, who present evidence and answer senators' questions. There is also the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence in the United States House of Representatives.


The New Zealand Intelligence and Security Committee has a membership of five, notably including the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. Two of the remaining three are nominated by the Prime Minister, and one by the Leader of the Opposition.


As I said at the outset, Canada does not currently have a parliamentary committee responsible for intelligence and security. However, the new government, during the election campaign, promised to establish an all-party national security oversight committee if it was elected. The new Prime Minister has instructed the relevant minister to assist the leader of the government in the House of Commons in the creation of a statutory committee of parliamentarians with special access to classified information to review government departments and agencies with national security responsibilities.


As can be generally seen, the legislative branch of government has a central role in the oversight and scrutiny of the work of such agencies amongst our allies. Further, the membership of the parliamentary committees that I have outlined in general is more flexible than the situation that currently applies in Australia—something this bill is designed to address.


As a result of legislation that passed in the last parliament, from 1 March 2016 the parliamentary joint committee has already had a number of additional functions added to its previously existing responsibilities. These include: monitoring and reviewing the performance of the AFP's counter-terrorism functions under the Criminal Code Act; reporting to the parliament on matters appertaining to the AFP, or connected to those functions; reviewing matters relating to the retained data activities of the AFP and ASIO covered in annual reports on the mandatory data retention regime, including where this goes to operational matters, for the sole purpose of assessing and making recommendations on the overall operation and effectiveness of the regime; reviewing bills in relation to the mandatory data retention regime; conducting a review of a range of counter-terrorism legislation, by 7 March 2018; conducting a review of the mandatory data retention regime, to be commenced by 13 April 2019 and completed a year later; conducting a review, by 1 December 2019, of the new citizenship revocation powers contained in the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Allegiance to Australia) Act 2015. This is in addition to powers in other areas.


I express my hope that the bill will receive sensible consideration and, in time, I hope, support from all parties across the chamber, recognising that this is a bill that is designed to enhance the ability of the committee to protect the interests of the parliament and, through us, the Australian people. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2016-10-13,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (10:07):  This is the first opportunity I have had to be in a debate that Senator Farrell has spoken in, so I take this opportunity of congratulating him on his appointment as deputy leader. I must say I look forward to his further advancement in the opposition in the years ahead.


Senator Farrell indicated in his opening remarks that this was a matter that former Senator Faulkner had an interest in. While I disagreed with then Senator Faulkner on many issues, I have always accepted his absolute commitment to parliament and to what he believed was right. So having this bill introduced by Senator Farrell with reference to the work that then Senator Faulkner had done meant I listened with a great deal of interest to what Senator Farrell said in his opening address and I tried to follow through the arguments that he was putting in support of this bill.


I want to say at the outset that in these days of heightened insecurity across the world, and Australia is no different, our intelligence and our security agencies have an even greater role to perform in protecting Australians. Regrettably, where that occurs throughout history it of necessity sometimes curtails some of the other freedoms that we would expect—some of the roles that parliament and others might have in looking at issues—because of this heightened security. We have to make sure that the agencies we entrust to look after our safety have everything going in their favour because, as I always point out, the bad guys—the terrorists, the criminals—are constrained by no-one and nothing. They are not accountable to anyone at all. They do what they like. But our agencies—our police forces, our security agencies—are always accountable to someone and so they have to act in the most appropriate manner all of the time. And sometimes that does constrain what they are able to do. I do not think this parliament should do anything that makes it harder for our security agencies and our police forces to do their jobs in protecting us. And while I accept that this bill has been introduced in good faith, it is not a bill that I could support or that the government could support for reasons that I will get onto shortly.


Just by way of background, I indicate to those who might be following the debate that the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security has existed in its current form since the inquiry into the Australian intelligence agencies by Mr Philip Flood AO in 2004. Amongst his findings, Mr Flood recommended that membership of the then parliamentary joint committee on ASIO, ASIS and the Defence Security Directorate should be extended to include the Defence Imagery and Geospatial Organisation, the Defence Intelligence Organisation and the Office of National Assessments. Following the passage of the intelligence services legislation bill in 2005, which resulted from the Flood inquiry, the committee was re-established as the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security.


The functions of that committee are outlined in the Intelligence Services Act, as amended. Briefly, section 29 provides that the committee's functions are:


… to review the administration and expenditure of ASIO, ASIS, AGO, DIO, ASD and ONA, including the annual financial statements …


The committee is also required:


… to review any matter in relation to ASIO, ASIS, AGO, DIO, ASD or ONA referred to the Committee by:


(i)  the responsible Minister; or


(ii)  a resolution of either House of the Parliament


The committee also has to: 


… monitor and to review the performance by the AFP of its functions under Part 5.3 of the Criminal Code—


which relates to terrorism. It is also to review the 'operation, effectiveness and implications' of: Part III of the ASIO Act, which relates to questioning and detention powers; division 3A of IAA of the Crimes Act, which relates to police powers in relation to terrorist acts and terrorism offences; divisions 104 and 105 of the Criminal Code, which relate to control orders and preventative detention orders; and sections 119.2 and 119.3 of the Criminal Code about declared area provisions.


The committee has other roles required by the act. I will not go through them all, but they are all set out in section 29 of the act. Under the Criminal Code, the committee is also able to review any regulation made for the listing or relisting of a terrorist organisation and report the committee's comments and recommendations to each house of parliament, so it has fairly wide powers. It can review and report on the declaration of any terrorist organisation under the Australian Citizenship Act. It can do all of those things that I have mentioned, and it is also required to prepare and table an annual report each year.


The committee, though, is not authorised by the act to initiate its own references, but may resolve to request the responsible minister to refer a particular matter to it for review. So if the committee thinks that there is an issue that needs to be addressed it can, by resolution, ask the relevant minister—no doubt the Attorney-General or the Minister for Justice—to make a reference on that particular matter. It is then up to the minister to either agree or disagree with that role.


The act specifically sets out what the committee is not able to do. It is important to understand these. The committee is barred from reviewing the intelligence gathering and assessment priorities of our intelligence agencies. It is prevented from reviewing the sources of information or other operational assistance or operation methods available to any of those agencies. It is not able to review particular operations that have been, are being or are proposed to be undertaken by any of our agencies. It is not entitled to review information provided by an agency of a foreign government where that government does not consent to the disclosure of the information. It is not allowed to review aspects of the activities of ASIO, ASIS, AGO, DIO, ASD or the Office of National Assessments that do not affect an Australian person. It is not allowed to review rules relating to the protection of privacy of Australians. It is not allowed to look at individual complaints about the activities of any of our agencies. It is not able to review the content of or conclusions reached in assessments or reports made by DIO or ONA, or to review sources of information on which such assessments are based.


It does not need me to go through and explain why the act that was passed several years ago made those prohibitions, because the last thing we want is individuals coming forward with a complaint which may or may not be genuine and then dragging our often secret intelligence agencies before a public parliamentary committee to respond to what may well be a frivolous complaint. I could give examples in relation to every one of those prohibitions, but I do not think it needs me to do that. Anyone who follows this area of law would understand the reasons for those prohibitions being put in place.


I will indicate—I think Senator Farrell made the same observation, but perhaps not with directly the same words—the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence Services has always been one of the most successful examples of effective bipartisanship throughout successive Australian parliaments and it has an excellent track record of conducting insightful and thorough investigations. I emphasise that it is a bipartisan committee. When it comes to the safety of Australians and our nation, politics does not enter into it. It does not matter which political party you are involved in. I would say with absolute confidence that there is no politicking and no partisan approach to the way our security agencies operate, because the job they are doing is to protect all of us. As I said earlier, it is essential that they have every power to do that.


This amending bill that we are dealing with today does a number of things. It expands the powers and the functions of the committee by allowing the committee to conduct a review into operational activities of the intelligence agencies and the Australian Federal Police. I shudder to think that any parliamentary committee would be asking our secret service people to explain their methods of operations: why they did things, the judgements they made or the secret information they get from other agencies from other nations with whom we have very close arrangements. It would just be a difficult constraint on those agencies. Remember, I said before—I was to emphasise this—the bad guys, the terrorists and the criminals have no constraints. They can do what they like and they are not answerable to anyone. Whilst our agencies act within the law, and the laws are made so that they do act appropriately and properly, having the agencies before a parliamentary committee to explain in detail every element of their operations, I think, would curtail them and would not only make their operations more difficult in the future but perhaps lessen their enthusiasm for protecting us properly in the case where they knew they would have to come and publicly explain their operations.


The bill also seeks to provide the committee with powers including operational oversight and presunset legislative review which would duplicate and overlap those of the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor and the IGIS—the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. These agencies are subject to oversight by these two statutory organisations. What this bill seeks to do is to give the committee its own powers to almost oversee the overseers, and that seems to be inappropriate. The bill does not provide adequate protection of operational activities, including methods and sources, to ensure that any reviews the committee conducts or any reports that either of the inspectors-general might be required to provide to the committee do not prejudice the operational activities of agencies and international relations—and that is very important as well.


If I could just perhaps elaborate a little further on some of those objections: the existing divide between the parliamentary committee and these independent agencies with oversight would compromise the independence of those two overseeing bodies by proposing that the committee receive direct reports from the IGIS on operational activities and could then commence its own inquiries. This would seem to be hugely double-guessing the existing agencies that are in place to oversee our security services.


The longstanding position in Australia is that operational oversight of the intelligence, security and law enforcement agencies is conducted by independent statutory oversight rather than by parliament. That has been around for some time. Currently, the IGIS, which serves a crucial role in overseeing and ensuring accountability for all operational activities, reports only to the minister, as I think is appropriate. I mentioned the Flood inquiry before and I will just quote from something that the inquiry found in its 2004 investigation:


Just as the advice that officials provide to ministers is not disclosed in Senate Legislation Committee hearings, the judgments of assessment agencies should not be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. Opening assessments to scrutiny by parliament would also weaken the instinct amongst assessors to provide forthright advice for government, which is vital for good assessment.


That is what the Flood inquiry reported and advised the parliament, following a very extensive inquiry back in 2004.


This bill, if it were passed, would enable the committee to conduct inquiries into legislation prior to a sunset date. This is an unnecessary duplication of the role of the INSLM, who has been granted powers that are tailored specifically to reviewing the operations, effectiveness and implications of Australia's national security agencies.


The amending bill also would enable the committee to conduct its own review into the activities of ASIO, ASIS, AGO, DIO, ASD and ONA, provided the PJC—the committee—has first consulted with the responsible minister. As I said, this is an unnecessary duplication of the role of the Inspector-General of Intelligence Services.


In 2014-15, under the coalition government, the Inspector-General received an increase of $840,000 in ongoing funding, allowing for the recruitment of additional staff to ensure effective oversight. So, the government has given these independent statutory officers all the resources necessary to properly oversee our security agencies—to make sure that they are doing the right thing. I think that is a system that works very well.


Of course, I do not know about—I am not privy to—the work of ASIO, or ASIS or any of the intelligence agencies, although as chair, once, of the parliamentary committee with oversight of the Australian Crime Commission I did get some limited insight into the work that is done by that agency and, indeed, others. But I have the highest regard for the professionalism and integrity of our services—particularly as they are overseen by independent statutory officers, in whom I think I can say confidently everyone in this parliament has confidence.


So, as I said, whilst I listened to the arguments and I understand the sentiments of the bill I think it is unnecessary. I think the system works well as it is at the present time and I would urge the chamber not to support the amending bill.

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2016-10-13,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (10:27):  I thank the opposition for bringing this Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security Amendment Bill 2015 on for debate. I want to start my contribution by just reflecting on the context—the global security environment within which we are having this discussion.


It is certainly true to say that at the moment we are facing on a global scale a very complex and rapidly-evolving security environment. It is one that brings with it specific and, to date in human history, unique challenges. That is why the Greens believe it is important that there is proper scrutiny through this parliament of Australia's security agencies. But, more importantly in that context, it is why we believe that we need a more strategic approach to law-making in this country around issues like intelligence gathering, data collection and the way that our security agencies operate.


I want to make the point up-front that in fact the Australian Greens do not believe that we are taking a strategic enough approach to making laws in this area. Of course, what we have seen in recent times—particularly in the last 15 years, since 2001-2002—is an ever-changing landscape of laws that the Australian people are told is there to protect us against some of the threats that I have just spoken about. We have seen a large volume of legislative change that has been made in the name of counterterrorism and national security, and I think it is beyond argument that the majority of those legislative changes have in fact eroded some fundamental civil rights and human rights that have existed in this country for many years. In many cases, these are civil and human rights that our ancestors fought for and in some cases tragically died to protect. We are now seeing some of these rights eroded away in the name of counterterrorism and national security. I think that is an unarguable statement.


Where discussion and, potentially, contention comes into this is: are those trade-offs worth making in terms of the advances that they bring protecting the Australian people? That is a discussion we want to place front and centre in this parliament and in the public conversation in this country. We urge both the coalition, currently in government, and the Labor Party, currently in opposition, to think very carefully about whether they would be prepared to support a more strategic approach around the way we are seeing our civil liberties eroded in the name of counterterrorism and national security.


I want to be clear that the Australian Greens genuinely believe it is time for a white-paper-style assessment—call it a blue paper if you like—of whether or not the legal changes that have occurred in the name of counterterrorism and national security have in fact made Australia safer, as we are told they were designed to do and, more specifically, whether that reduction in our civil liberties in this country has been worth any advance in national security and counterterrorism. As I said up-front, we are facing a very complex and rapidly-evolving security scenario around the world. The danger with taking a white paper approach is that it is a snapshot in time and then the world moves on, rendering all the work that had been done to generate a white paper less relevant than it otherwise would have been.


We believe that it is well within the competence of our policy makers and our security agencies to design a living white paper—one that is capable of evolving in very close to real time to respond to changes in the global security environment. We do not think this is a contentious idea. We see white papers in, for example, the Defence portfolio. We would pose the question: why don't we have a white paper process in the counterterrorism space and the national security space? There is nothing wrong with a strategic approach in this environment. We have seen white paper processes for tax, agriculture and defence. We have even seen a white paper for Northern Australia. But we have not for some time seen a white paper around national security in the context of counterterrorism.


Of course, a white paper process would involve the input of our security agencies, but it would also give a range of other experts from a number of other fields the chance to have a meaningful say. It should and could include an examination of the effectiveness of the dozens of legislative and administrative changes made since 2002. I will just place on the record that since that time we have seen new crimes created at least 12 times, legal powers have been extended at least seven times, police have been granted new powers at least 16 times and intelligence powers have been increased at least 12 times. In that period such laws have only been softened twice and new oversight created just once. This erosion of fundamental civil liberties in our country is unprecedented in Australia's peacetime history. We believe we owe it to our people, including the many Australians who have fought and at times died to protect these liberties, to make sure that this erosion is actually justified by an increase in the security of the Australian people.


I come now to this legislation. The bill seeks to amend a number of acts. Specifically, it seeks to amend the Intelligence Services Act 2001 by removing some of the current constraints on the membership of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. It would change it from the current six members from the House of Representatives and five senators to one government member and one government senator and one opposition member and one opposition senator, with the balance of the committee drawn from either chamber. We have heard contributions from both the government and the opposition today. I want to make the point that this committee is very much a closed shop; it is historically made up of members from the government of the day and the opposition of the day.


We are facing a context now where one-quarter of Australians did not vote for the coalition or Labor in the recent election—and that is a continuation of a declining trend in the vote of the political duopoly in this country. So the Australian Greens have a view that it is time the membership of this committee provided for an opportunity for a senator who is not from the government and not from the opposition to join in the role that this committee plays in our parliamentary system and in our scrutiny system. So I flag now that in the committee stages of this bill we will be moving an amendment which, if passed, will provide for a senator who is not a government or opposition senator to become part of the membership of this committee.


We understand the responsibilities that this would entail, the responsibilities that this would place on whichever member of the crossbench it is. I include the Australian Greens in that context, as members of the crossbench. We understand it would place a heavy responsibility on whichever non-government and non-opposition senator were appointed to fill a position on this committee, but we do believe that it is important that there be at least one voice on this committee that does not reflect the political duopoly, because what we have seen in Australia, certainly in the last decade to decade and a half, is a strong bipartisanship on national security matters.


My view is that the reason we have strong bipartisanship on national security matters actually owes more to politics than it does to a robust examination of the legislation that underpins Australia's national security. Neither party when in opposition want to appear weak on national security, so they fall into zombie lockstep with whoever is in government at the time and develop a bipartisanship that means legislation which is continually brought into this place—and we are facing more on the Notice Paper at the moment—and which erodes some of our fundamental civil and human liberties in this country is not adequately scrutinised. We believe we need more scrutiny; we believe there needs to be more justification put before the Australian people for this continued erosion of their civil liberties in the name of counterterrorism and national security; and we believe a crossbench senator, as a member of the Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, could play that role or be part of playing that role. This is a closed shop committee open only to members of the political duopoly in this country, and frankly the Australian people deserve better.


I would like to respond briefly to some comments that were made by the previous speaker, Senator Macdonald. He spoke about the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor and the role that he plays in scrutinising national security legislation. Well, it is a crucial role that the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor plays, but I do want to be clear that the Greens remain unconvinced that in fact the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor is adequately funded, and we certainly believe the government is making more and more of a habit of ignoring the recommendations that come from the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor. In fact, the recommendations do not, as I understand it, currently even receive a response from government. That is not good enough. The government should at least do the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor the courtesy of providing a response to his recommendations. The monitor does a great job in examining a wide suite of legislation. He does report to this parliament, but it is not good enough that the government does not provide a response to his recommendations, which ought to be tabled in both houses of this parliament.


We accept absolutely the crucial nature of the work that the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security does. We believe absolutely that it is an appropriate body that has been established, and we support absolutely the measures contained in this bill—with the caveat around the membership of the committee that has been proposed by the Labor Party. We particularly support the part of this bill that provides for the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security to conduct own-motion inquiries. That was spoken against by Senator Macdonald in the speech that he just made, and when this bill was previously debated, in the former parliament, it was spoken strongly against. But we do not accept the arguments that have been put up against this. We believe it is reasonable for this committee to conduct own-motion inquiries within the constraints that the act has established and we believe it would improve the scrutiny of our intelligence agencies for this parliament to be able, through this committee, to conduct own-motion inquiries. Of course, it is this parliament that has actually established our security agencies; they are creatures of this parliament. And this parliament has every right within the constraints that exist within the act to, through this committee, have own-motion inquiries conducted and reported back as appropriate.


As I said at the beginning of my contribution this morning, it is a complex area. It is a complex global environment—one that moves very rapidly and changes very quickly. This committee plays a crucial role in scrutinising the intelligence agencies that have been established by this parliament to make Australia as safe as it can possibly be, and we share that goal of making Australia as safe as it can reasonably be made. But we do believe that there has not been a strategic approach to this. We believe that the erosion of some fundamental civil and human liberties in this country has been done in a politically ad hoc manner rather than as a result of a carefully conceived strategy. We believe that owes much to the zombie lockstep in which both the coalition and Labor proceed in this space and we believe that having a senator who is not a member of either the government or the opposition on this committee would allow for a greater diversity of thought on this committee and a greater diversity of input to the processes of this committee.



In broad terms, we support this legislation because we think it will go some way towards improving the operations of the committee. However, as I said, we feel strongly enough that there should be a senator who is not from government or opposition on this committee and we will be seeking to amend this bill to provide for that, should that amendment be successful.


In conclusion, this is a challenging time for freedoms around the world. It is not only a challenging time because threats are arising; it is a challenging time because freedoms are being eroded in response to the threats that are arising. Both of those matters need to be considered strategically. They ought to be the subject of a white paper—a living, breathing white paper that can be adapted in response to the rapidly evolving global environment.


Also, we need to ensure that this committee is made up of members who have the capacity to bring some thoughts and some positions to this committee that, potentially at least—depending on who the appointed senator from the crossbench would be, should our amendment be successful—bring a more strategic approach that is outside the political lock step, which we so often see in the context of discussions and conversations in this parliament and in the public debate in Australia around responding to the national security threats to Australia that exist today.

"Dodson, Sen Patrick",ALP,2016-10-13,"



Senator DODSON
 (Western Australia) (10:47):  The matter of security, as we have heard, is one that we in this nation take very seriously. We obviously try to balance the liberties and freedoms that citizens would like to enjoy in our country. We take a fairly open-hearted approach to most things and most people from different cultures and different persuasions, and we generally try to abide by the laconic notion of a fair go for everyone. When that notion butts up against the heinous nature of indiscriminate assaults and murders of innocent citizens, in the most extreme consequences, by those who would want to destroy democracy and want to destroy the privileges, rights and freedoms that people enjoy, I think we find it very hard to get that balance right sometimes. I am not suggesting we have not got it right in Australia, but I do know we butt up against the tension point between our sense of freedom as a nation of people who tend not to understand, or tend not to have experienced, the atrocities we see in the Middle East and other places pretty much nightly on our televisions. We have experienced it in Bali with our citizens and in other places, and we are horrified when such things happen.


In fact, today there was a report of a couple of Syrian citizens in Germany capturing a wanted felon, a terrorist, and then reporting that person to the authorities. The appreciation of the citizens of Germany for that helps them have a different view of people who are fleeing from violence in other nation states and coming to their own countries. In fact, they have suggested that such individuals should be honoured with a medal for their services to the nation.


Here we are talking about something that is rather modest in its intent. The amending bill began with people like Senator Faulkner in his time here and way back, as Senator Macdonald said, with the recommendations in the report that came from by Mr Flood and others when we were in the beginning of the horrors of many of these atrocities. Our maturity around the necessity for incursions into the freedoms, responsibilities and rights of citizens was probably not weighed as heavily as it is today. I am not suggesting that it was not.


I can recall, as a young person, being detained by the police. It was not just being detained in the watch house; he actually had a whip, which he threatened to use. He had no power to do this, but he had a whip and threatened to use it. On the floor of the cell he showed us an iron circle to which people had been chained, or potentially could be chained. So the notion of deprivation of liberty is a very important matter to me personally, but, I think, for most Australians as well. But we do not like to be overencumbered by regulation and authoritarianism, or by delegations, when we have a sense that our freedoms are being infringed.


On the other hand, we know that there are people who, as Senator Macdonald said, have no regard for any of this, who have no regard for the sanctity and uniqueness and beauty of human life, and who are prepared to do whatever it takes to achieve an ideological outcome—that is, fundamentally to destroy the principles of freedom and democracy in a nation state, particularly in our country, Australia. It is sad that such things happen. As we come to the parliament of Australia each day we notice outside the parliament officers with guns. When I first started coming to the parliament to lobby in the old Parliament House that was a very rare sight. So the price of our democracy is pretty significant. I do not think we ought to be cowed by those who want to threaten it. Therefore, the necessity of a committee like the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security is a critical matter. It is a critical function of the parliament, interfacing with the senior people who have the day-to-day responsibilities of guaranteeing the freedom and safety of the citizens of this nation.


Really, this bill is trying to get that right. I heard Senator McKim, from the Greens, speak of getting the balance of the membership right. I note that the bill proposes that the majority of the government will not be affected by this amendment. It does allow for 11 other members to be nominated by the houses. That is a matter for political movement, it would seem to me. People are capable of doing things in this place to ensure that the representation is there. But I take the point that is being talked about, that there is pretty much a de facto presence on this very important committee.


The responsibility that goes with that is of course paramount to how we deal with sensitive information that comes from the other amendments that are being proposed to have access to information and advice given by the national officer responsible for these matters. That access is not for the purposes of flaunting the information but so that we as representatives of the parliament can be informed about where and what it is our nation has been apprised of at the highest levels, whether it be at the ministerial level, the level of the security council or wherever it is that these matters go to for decision making—ultimately, the executive of government.


The importance of that is also to deal with the question of our responsibility as elected representatives, to try and get a balance between us as the elected representatives, who are accountable to the public and therefore have a trust placed in us to ensure that their safety is looked after in the best possible manner, and the functionaries. I have no doubt that that is what we seek to do and are doing to the best of our capacities. The bill is really about how we can improve in a minor way some of the functional aspects of this. It is not seeking to overcome and overtake the role and responsibility that the agencies have for our security, but it is trying to, I suppose, ensure that the public is aware that we parliamentarians do not leave these things entirely in the hands of very capable functionaries who account to a particular individual—a minister—and not necessarily to the parliament. That is a complex matter, I understand and fully appreciate, and I am not suggesting that we ought to be overturning that. What I am suggesting is support for the proposal that we are putting forward on our side to have the capacity to be informed by reports on these matters and also to look towards initiating inquiries that are significant in this field, to pursue a matter. I would think that you would only do that, given the practicalities of this, after a long period of discussion—interacting with the relevant agencies and the minister responsible—and that it would not be just a case of a rabbit running down a hole hoping to find something. It would actually have to be something of great significance to do that.


We should recall also that intelligence gathering is not always left to those who are the specialists in the field. Often we require and rely upon citizens to inform us about what is going on in particular places to make sure that the eyes and ears, as it were, of the custodians of democracy and freedom that are in the hands of our citizens are also utilised beyond those who are the specialists and the most efficiently trained. So the role for the public in much of this is also critical.


It is about getting the right balance between trust, freedom, efficiencies and capacity to make decisions. No-one is suggesting, through this bill, a frustration with any of that. We are talking about a capacity to be better informed through the committee on national security so that the parliament itself is not just tangential to what takes place at a higher level but is in fact integral to that in a very important way that underpins democracy. It is conditioned and governed, obviously, by the existing tenants of the legislation, so is not something that is being proposed in a vacuum here; it is being proposed in a context. 


This is a very minor amendment to the existing legislation that we hope to win the support of the Senate for. It is not opening up a whole avenue for placing at risk the very important and significant matter of national security. In fact, it is trying to improve on that and lend greater support to those who have that onerous task of looking after us and ensuring our nation is safe and that the agencies are resourced. It is critical that their recommendations are taken up, but if they are not known then it is very difficult for those matters to be pursued—outside of the largesse of the minister or his or her responsibilities.


The question of global security weighs on us on a constant basis. Again, I recall some years ago going to the United States and to New York. People actually put money on the window sills of their houses so that people would not break in. There was a sense of fear that gripped the nation at the time—and it has probably only been enhanced by the terrorism acts that have taken place in America since my period there. The sense of fear is a very corrosive element to the principles of democracy and freedom. That is something we need to guard against most diligently whilst we balance the necessity for efficient and effective intelligence gathering and the capacity to orchestrate the activities necessary to undertake tasks while not being curtailed by unnecessary bureaucracy and management. It is getting both things right that is the challenge. 


I think what we have tried to do on our side is suggest some minimal changes. They can be improved upon, I have no doubt, but the intent is to ensure, through the membership proposals, that there is a role for the parliament in a greater manner than there has been in the past. I think the capacity to look at sunset legislation is often important, because there may well be amendments that could be made to improve it, or there could be matters that are no longer relevant that ought to be removed as well.


The significant factor, I think, is community trust in its institutions. Primarily, citizens look to the parliament for that to be exercised on their behalf. That is why they elect us. We are elected to make decisions.  I appreciate that sometimes those decisions are hard on people's senses of their own freedoms and their own sense of what and how they ought to enjoy their democracy. But we all have to balance the competing rights of each other and the diversity and differences that we bring to our wonderful democracy. 


But if we do not appreciate that and if we do not bring those balances then we are simply allowing ourselves to slip more and more into some form of totalitarian state—and I am not suggesting that these amendments have any intention of doing that. We need to bring to the notice of the government and to the parliament the ways in which democracy and its significant structures can be better made to reflect the trust that citizens place in us and to ensure that agents that are brought into existence, that look after our security, are also held accountable. Senator Macdonald's view about oversighting the oversighters is a point that I do not necessarily disagree with: But that is not what we are talking about.


What we are talking about is that there has to be a balance of all the various accountabilities that are required in a rather complex scenario of national security and intelligence gathering. If we can achieve that and improve upon that without placing at risk the necessities for security, confidentiality and privacy—those sorts of issues which are fundamental to good intelligence gathering and for good execution of activities to protect the nation—then that has to be paramount. But I do not think that the amendments that we are proposing in any way hinder or impact on that particular paramount goal. 


I think this is a modest set of recommendations. They seek to get the balance right and to bring in a bigger role for parliamentarians—not to usurp, in any manner, the role, function and authority of the agencies—in order to bring some comfort, I think, to the public that security is not always a matter that has to wear a gun. Security is also about: how do you cultivate friendships, freedom and trust with the others who you may not necessarily agree with? It is a bit hard when you do not know who wants to blow you up. But if you do have good intelligence and you do have good security measures, you can hopefully identify that better and you can accord to those people the kind of matters of justice that are— (Time expired)

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",NXT,2016-10-13,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (11:07):  At the beginning of my remarks on this important bill, I would like to pay tribute to the late Dr Des Ball, Professor at the Australian National University's Strategic and Defence Studies Centre, who passed away yesterday after a lengthy illness. Professor Ball was a towering figure in Australian strategic and defence policy and a pioneer over more than four decades in researching the activities of the Australian intelligence community, most notably exposing decades of dissembling by successive governments about the role of the United States-Australia joint defence facilities. Together with Professor Richard Tanter, Professor Ball was earlier this year still publishing immensely detailed and scholarly papers providing new insight into the role of the joint defence facility at Pine Gap, including details of its intimate involvement in supporting US military operations and the global surveillance network run by the so-called Five Eyes intelligence partners.


Des Ball was a champion for greater transparency and democratic accountability for the Australian intelligence community, so it is appropriate that the Senate today is able to debate an important and timely proposal for enhancing parliamentary scrutiny of Australia's intelligence and security agencies. I am very pleased to support this legislation—and on behalf of my colleagues as well—the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security Amendment Bill 2015, which is itself the legacy of another champion of parliamentary scrutiny and accountability, former Senator John Faulkner. I remember his words on that. This was a man who was a former defence minister and served not just his political party, the Australian Labor Party, but this country with distinction—a towering figure in the Senate. He made it very clear that, with increased power of our intelligence agencies, there must be increased levels of accountability.


This bill brings together a range of proposals designed to improve the operation of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, a joint statutory committee of the parliament that has been functioning in its present form since the passage of the Intelligence Services Act in late 2001. The bill seeks to broadly enhance the oversight of the Australian intelligence community by creating more substantive links between the joint committee and our other intelligence oversight agencies—the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security and the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor.


The bill's measures to remove current restraints on the membership of the joint committee are particularly welcome. If the process of parliamentary oversight over our intelligence and security agencies is to command public confidence, the joint committee must be more broadly representative of the make-up of the parliament and not just confined to members of the government and the opposition. The previous membership of the member for Denison, Mr Andrew Wilkie, in the period of the Gillard government from 2010 to 2013 has already demonstrated that crossbench members of the parliament can and should make valued contributions to the work of the joint committee.


The record of the joint committee has been productive but limited by the frequent bipartisan consensus between the coalition and Labor. And with it there is an element of secrecy and a lack of transparency in the process, more so than needs to be, even allowing for the sensitivity of the matters that are dealt with. On occasion the joint committee has got things quite wrong, most recently in the case of its report dealing with the secrecy provisions surrounding the conduct of special intelligence operations by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation—the amendments to section 35P of the ASIO Act. I voted against those provisions. They were something the joint committee said ought to be passed, but the change went to the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor, the Hon. Roger Giles AO QC, a former federal court judge and eminent lawyer and jurist. I made a submission to the inquiry. I do not think there were any other members of parliament who made a submission at that time. Professor Clinton Fernandes and I made a joint submission. Professor Clinton Fernandes is a professor at the University of New South Wales and at the ADFA campus here in Canberra.


This is what Mr Giles said after conducting the inquiry in relation to that in a summary of his report. He essentially stated that section 35P:


… creates uncertainty as to what may be published about the activities of ASIO without fear of prosecution. The so-called chilling effect of that uncertainty is exacerbated because it also applies in relation to disclosures made to editors for the purpose of discussion before publication.


He went on to say:


Journalists are prohibited from publishing anywhere at any time any information relating to an SIO—


a special intelligence operation—


regardless of whether it has any, or any continuing, operational significance and even if it discloses reprehensible conduct by ASIO insiders.


These were powerful words by the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor.


The issues identified by INSLM were that:


The basic problem with section 35P is that it does not distinguish between journalists and others (outsiders) and ASIO insiders. The application in this manner of broad secrecy prohibitions to outsiders is not satisfactorily justified, including by precedents in Australia or elsewhere.


Mr Giles also made this point:


Section 35P is arguably invalid on the basis that it infringes the constitutional protection of freedom of political communication. Section 35P is also arguably inconsistent with article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and so not in accordance with Australia's international obligations.


That piece of legislation slipped by the joint committee for which this bill seeks to have a more flexible membership arrangement. So that safeguard did not work on that occasion. The law was passed. It was put in force. It then was subject to a review by INSLM. Fortunately, there have been no prosecutions under section 35P, as I understand it. Also, fortunately, that is something that will be rectified by the government.


The subsequent report of the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor that I referred to made the weaknesses of the joint committee's review very clear, and the fact that there is further amending legislation before the Senate underlines the need for a more rigorous approach and a wider range of opinion represented on the joint committee.


The need for enhanced parliamentary scrutiny and oversight is clear. In the 15 years since the tragedies, the horrors, of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, a constant legislative drumbeat has accompanied what is commonly known as the war on terrorism. Successive governments and the parliament have repeatedly added to and elaborated our national security and counterterrorism laws. I note it was just yesterday that we commemorated the anniversary of the Bali bombings, where 202 innocent people, including 88 Australians, were killed by terrorists. The parliament has passed more than 70 different bills dealing with terrorism and, more broadly, national security issues. The exact number depends a bit on questions of definition, but the overall quantum of legislation is clear. We now have a very extensive and complex set of counterterrorism laws. As I have previously pointed out to the Senate, we have more counterterrorism laws than any other country. These laws are of great significance to national security and community safety, as well as to the rights, liberties and privacy of all Australians.


Back in October 2014, when the Senate was considering one of the long line of counterterrorism bills, I expressed the view that enough was enough and that we did not need more laws in this field and certainly should not enact greater powers for our intelligence and security agencies without a major expansion and strengthening of independent oversight of those agencies. That remains my broad view, subject of course to the overarching principle of community safety.


The record of our intelligence and security agencies in countering terrorism over the past 15 years is one of considerable success, thankfully. They have exercised the considerable investigative powers available to them and, in the process, thwarted many attacks on our soil and harm to Australians. Although the terrorist threat in Australia has not been on the same scale as in some other countries, it is significant, and serious threats and plots have been detected and thwarted. Our intelligence and security agencies have demonstrated considerable professionalism, but like all government agencies they are far from infallible. 


There also have been some very significant missteps. The case of Dr Muhamed Haneef involved the provision of incorrect and misleading information from British police counterterrorism investigators to the Australian Federal Police, which in turn failed to properly assess that information. A review by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security of the case of Mamdouh Habib found that the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation repeatedly failed to properly document key decisions, including dealings with foreign security and intelligence agencies. Senior officers subsequently claimed to have little or no recollection of key events. There have been instances where agencies have failed to provide appropriate information to the IGIS, and at least one case where an agency, the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, sought to intentionally mislead the IGIS.


 I would not wish to not pre-empt the findings of the inquiry by the New South Wales Coroner into matters relating to Man Haron Monis and the Martin Place siege of December 2014 and the tragic deaths of two innocent people, other than to say some of the evidence presented to the inquiry clearly raises serious concerns about the investigative and analytical capabilities of ASIO and the AFP as well as the operational response of the New South Wales police. I still cannot fathom why that man, that monster, was on the streets when he was, given his history.


Our intelligence and security agencies have very extensive powers and resources but are not infallible, and for that reason there needs to be very rigorous oversight and scrutiny. That is why this bill is both important and timely. It is a significant step towards a more rigorous scrutiny regime, more along the lines of the United States and German models of parliamentary intelligence committees, which have much more wide-ranging powers of review. In earlier debate on this legislation, one government senator suggested that greater parliamentary scrutiny, including the provision of highly classified IGIS reports to the joint committee 'may limit the voluntary provision of information by Australian intelligence community agencies to the inspector-general'. If this were really the case—and I doubt it would be so—then the need for rigorous parliamentary scrutiny would only be greater. In any case, if the United States intelligence community can operate effectively—and clearly it does—in the environment of oversight by the US Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the House of Representatives Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, then so too can the Australian intelligence community.


Significantly, I would highlight the scope of the US Senate committee's responsibilities, which include access to classified intelligence assessments and access to intelligence sources and methods, programs and budgets. By law, the US President is required to ensure the committee is kept 'fully and currently informed' of intelligence activities, including covert actions and any significant intelligence failure. Australia's intelligence agencies have long been deeply entwined with their US counterparts, and that is appropriate. It is time that we looked again at the greater extent of parliamentary scrutiny and oversight that characterises the intelligence system of our ally. This bill is a modest but important step in that direction. I am very pleased to lend my support, and that of my colleagues, to this bill, and I hope that this bill is passed in this place.

"Watt, Sen Murray",ALP,2016-10-13,"



Senator WATT
 (Queensland) (11:20):  I rise to speak on the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security Amendment Bill 2015. I note that this is not the first time that this bill has been debated in this place. It was restored to the Notice Paper after being introduced and debated in 2015. I want to acknowledge the contribution that other senators made to the debate of this bill in the last parliament. I also want to acknowledge the work of former senator John Faulkner in initiating the drafting of and consultation on this bill. Mr Faulkner's expertise and pursuit of the noble aims of this bill are well known. It is a pleasure and a privilege to speak on this bill, and in doing so I hope to help bring to fruition the task that former senator Faulkner set himself in bringing about these important reforms to the monitoring of the Australian intelligence community.


This bill seeks to give this parliament a stronger mechanism of oversight over Australia's intelligence and security agencies to ensure that, while their powers are necessarily increased to keep up with the demands of current security threats, their accountability to this parliament is not diminished. As former Senator Faulkner explained:


Parliament must strike a balance between our security imperatives and our liberties and freedoms. (The) Key to achieving this balance is strong and effective accountability. Enhanced powers demand enhanced safeguards. Public trust and confidence in our security and intelligence agencies can only be assured through strong and rigorous oversight and scrutiny.


Since the terror attacks that occurred on American soil on 11 September, 2001 our modern world has unfortunately lived in an age where terror attacks not only are real and possible but seem to becoming more frequent. I well remember 11 September 2001. As a young lawyer, I was working in Townsville in North Queensland at the time, working on an unfair dismissal case. We managed in the afternoon of 11 September to secure our client a very good result, and so I went to the pub and celebrated with some friends of mine who lived in Townsville at the time. The night got quite late, and I remember the TV screens at Molly Malones, where we were celebrating, had all of sudden flicked across to what seemed to be pretty crazy events of planes crashing into buildings in New York. It brought a very sober end to the night. I remember on the way home from that, talking to one of my friends and saying, 'That was pretty serious, wasn't it?' And we agreed it was. Of course, the world has gone on to see how serious these kinds of events have become ever since. 


Since that time, countries like Australia, which value democracy and human rights, have watched in horror as terrorist incidents have unfolded around the world. These incidents have caused us to fear attacks on us, whether it be when we are travelling overseas or even potentially at home. One of the most unfortunate aspects of this, apart from the terrible loss of human life that occurs in these attacks, is that terrorist attacks have been leapt upon by some politicians both in Australia and overseas as reasons to become suspicious of particular communities and to attempt to divide us. That is extremely sad to see. 


These terrorist threats are not far off foreign problems that stop beyond Australia's borders. Just this week, as other speakers have noted, we paused to remember the anniversary of the Bali bombings, where terrorists attacked crowded nightspots in Kuta Beach and 88 Australians lost their lives. Unfortunately, since 2001, as I say, these attacks have become more frequent, yet they are no less shocking or ruthless in their execution. Just this year we witnessed horrific attacks take place in Nice, in France, in Brussels, in Istanbul and among many other places around the world. Australians, when overseas in these sorts of places, do face real threats and, unfortunately, there have been similar incidents on Australian soil, albeit nowhere near as destructive as what we have seen overseas. So these threats are real, and it is the responsibility of this parliament to protect our country and to protect our people. Parliament is therefore tasked with enacting strong laws and ensuring that our intelligence and security organisations are given the necessary powers and resources that they need to ensure the security and safety of our citizens. 


There really is no greater responsibility for our parliament to uphold and there really is nothing more precious to protect than our democracy and our human rights. But protecting our country and protecting our citizens to the utmost degree does create an uneasy balance between keeping our country secure and valuing the human rights and freedoms that our democracy guarantees. There is nothing more counter-productive that we could do in attempting to prevent terrorists who are trying to send a message about our way of life and there is nothing more destructive and nothing more counter-productive that we could do than to overreach in our response to those incidents in the powers that we give our intelligence agencies to monitor our people and any other restrictions that we place on Australian citizens in order to secure our safety. If all we do is overreach and introduce draconian measures that restrict our population's freedoms and human rights then, in a sense, we have achieved what the terrorists themselves are seeking to achieve. So we do need to be extremely careful whenever we are considering increasing security precautions. This is because, as well as protecting our lives, this parliament's task is to provide protection to citizens which allow them to exercise their civil rights and liberties. In doing so, this parliament must act as a check and balance against the state itself. Parliament must also ensure that the public have full trust and confidence in our intelligence and security organisations and, as a result, that they have full trust and confidence in each Australian's ability to participate fully in an open and free democracy. So we must find a way to strike that balance—the right balance between creating laws that provide protection to Australians from terrorist threats but do not stifle core freedoms to the point where people have no protection from the state or its intelligence agencies. 


Today there are six intelligence agencies in the Australian intelligence community. These agencies are the keepers of strong powers, which include intelligence gathering and analysis. Four of these agencies undertake collection: ASIO, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, which is responsible to the Attorney-General; ASIS, the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, which collects foreign intelligence from human sources and is responsible to the Minister for Foreign Affairs; the ASD, the Australian Signals Directorate, formerly the DSD, which collects foreign signals intelligence, largely outside Australia. The ASD was given a legislative footing in 2001 and is responsible to the Minister for Defence. The AGO, the Australian Geospatial Organisation, collects geospatial intelligence from satellite imagery and other sources and is responsible to the Minister for Defence.


The other two agencies in the Australian intelligence community are analytical agencies. Firstly, the DIO, or the Defence Intelligence Organisation, which analyses the intelligence obtained by the Defence collection agencies and its overseas partners. And, secondly, the ONA, or the Office of National Assessments, which is established under its own act of parliament and is statutorily independent.


Australia is very fortunate to have agencies like these that work incredibly hard to meet their responsibilities professionally, thoroughly and with the utmost respect for our laws and security. I acknowledge the work and commitment of those agencies and note that this bill does not seek to diminish the powers or ability of those agencies to perform the important work they do. 


In recent times the parliament has enacted laws that increase powers granted to these agencies, and this bill does not seek to curtail those powers. However, as former Senator Faulkner said: 'Enhanced powers demand enhanced safeguards.' Currently, a range of mechanisms are available to scrutinise the Australian intelligence community. At the heart of these arrangements are the three pillars of oversight: ministerial responsibility, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security and the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. 


The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security is enshrined in the Intelligence Services Act 2001. That committee has a very important role. Its functions include: (a) to review the administration and expenditure of ASIO, ASIS, AGO, DIO, ASD and ONA, including the annual financial statements of those agencies; (b) to review any matter in relation to those agencies referred to the committee by the responsible minister or a resolution of either house of the parliament—and also their functions; and (c) to report the committee's comments and recommendations to each house of the parliament and to the responsible minister.


There are a number of restrictions on the committee's ability to review the actual intelligence gathered and/or assessments made by the agencies. As my colleagues in this chamber have mentioned today, this committee has been incredibly successful and is a very good example of bipartisanship, because we know that the protection of national security is a job for all parliamentarians.


What does this bill seek to do? At a time when the community is looking to the government and to the parliament to ensure that intelligence and security agencies have the powers they need, it is very important that the membership and functions of that parliamentary joint committee enable it to provide effective oversight. 


The purpose of this bill is to ensure that the adequacy and effectiveness of parliamentary oversight of intelligence and security agencies is in keeping with the development of the enhanced and additional powers we have afforded these agencies. The bill seeks to amend the Intelligence Services Act 2001, the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor Act 2010 and the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act 1986 to change the membership, powers and functions of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security.


I wish to briefly go over the measures this bill seeks to introduce. The bill removes current constraints on the membership of the parliamentary joint committee to provide that, except for a minimum representation of one government member and a senator and one opposition member and senator, the balance of the 11-member parliamentary joint committee can be drawn from either chamber. Currently, the Intelligence Services Act 2001 mandates a composition of six members and five senators on a parliamentary joint committee. Removing the current constraints will provide parliament with greater flexibility in determining its membership of the joint committee, but the bill does not amend the requirement for the government to hold a majority.


This provision is important because it means that senators can be equally represented on this committee. There is no reason why the House of Representatives needs to be disproportionally represented on this committee. As I have said previously, national security is a job for all parliamentarians, not just members of the House of Representatives. Again, to clarify, the bill does not amend the requirement for the government to hold the majority, but it does mean there are fewer constraints placed on the choice of members for the committee based on the chamber in which they sit.


There are a number of other amendments that this bill provides, and, in the interest of time, I will only very briefly refer to them. The bill also provides for the parliamentary joint committee to conduct own-motion inquiries after consultation with the responsible minister. It may be that matters come to the attention of the joint committee that equally require examination that the minister may not have necessarily considered such a priority, so I think it is a good move to give the committee the power to conduct inquiries on its own motion. 


The bill authorises the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor to provide the joint committee with a copy of any report on a matter referred to it by the committee. That is an important step to make sure that the joint committee stays informed of all developments on these matters. The bill requires the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security to give the joint committee a copy of any report provided to the Prime Minister or a minister within three months. 


The bill gives the joint committee the function of conducting pre-sunset reviews of legislation containing sunset provisions and adds the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor and the National Security Adviser to officers that are able to be consulted by the parliamentary joint committee. Again those two roles, the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor and the National Security Adviser, are obviously key to our intelligence community's response to developments, and it is important that the joint committee has the ability to consult those particular officers and inform its deliberations. These amendments are quite modest and process based, but they are very important.


In wrapping up, I just want to go back to some of the points that I made earlier in my speech. There is not one person in this parliament who disputes that one of our most important roles is to protect the safety of our people, but equally—and perhaps this reflects my background as a lawyer—I would place a very high premium on protecting the human rights and civil liberties of Australian citizens. Fortunately, in recent years we have not seen many examples of the abuse of these kinds of powers by our intelligence agencies, but it is important to make sure that our parliament does retain a bit of a check and balance on the actions of agencies that have such far-reaching and intrusive powers into our community. Perhaps it is a function of growing up as a child in Queensland in the Bjelke-Petersen era, when the Queensland government of the day had the Special Branch of the police force, which was essentially operating as a secret police service, spying on Queensland citizens, preparing files on them and conducting extremely intrusive investigations into Queensland citizens for no reason other than their political beliefs.


So it is vital that, if we are going to enhance the powers of our intelligence agencies in order to protect our safety, in parallel we have a responsibility to the Australian people to also enhance the powers of this parliament to oversight the actions of those intelligence communities. Australians—not just me but Australians generally, I think—place a very high premium on their freedoms and their human rights. They expect them to be protected, and it is incumbent upon us as members of parliament to make sure that those protections remain in place and are strengthened as the legislation which provides powers to our intelligence communities also expands. I think it is through that combination—the combination of providing our intelligence agencies with the powers that they need and also providing Australians with protections from the abuse of those kinds of powers—that we strike the right balance to protect Australians well into the future and make sure that all Australians remain safe from these terrible terrorist attacks that are becoming all too common right across the world.

"Hume, Sen Jane",LP,2016-10-13,"



Senator HUME
 (Victoria) (11:40):  I rise today to speak on the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security Amendment Bill, the PJCIS Amendment Bill 2015. This is a bill that proposes significant changes to the Intelligence Services Act 2001, the ISA. Firstly, it proposes to change the composition of the PJCIS. Secondly, this bill proposes to expand the powers and functions of the PJCIS by allowing the PJCIS to conduct a review into operational activities of the Australian intelligence agencies and the Australian Federal Police. It proposes to expand the powers and functions of the PJCIS by authorising the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor, the INSLM, to provide the PJCIS with a copy of any report on a matter referred to it by the PJCIS and requiring the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, the IGIS, to give the PJCIS a copy of any report provided to the Prime Minister or the minister within three months. The bill proposes allowing the PJCIS to conduct its own-motion inquiries, and it also proposes allowing the PJCIS to conduct pre-sunset review of legislation.


The government's position on this bill is not one of support. The well-regarded work that the PJCIS has conducted over many years is generally viewed as one of the most successful examples of effective bipartisanship throughout successive Australian parliaments. The PJCIS also has an impressive track record of conducting both insightful and thorough investigations. In light of these facts, the government is of the opinion that there is no need to amend the PJCIS's structure or powers.


Furthermore, the government has serious concerns about the content of this bill. Specifically, expanding the powers of the PJCIS will compromise the existing and appropriate divide between parliamentary and independent oversight by enabling own-motion inquiries and receipt of reports on operational activity from the IGIS. The government has serious concerns about the bill seeking to provide the PJCIS with powers, including operational oversight and pre-sunset legislative review, which would duplicate and overlap with those of the IGIS and  INSLM. The government has serious concerns that the bill does not provide adequate protection of operational activities, including methods and sources, to ensure any reviews that the PJCIS conducts, or any reports the INSLM or IGIS are required to provide to the PJCIS, do not prejudice the operational activities of the agencies and international relations.


The amendments this bill seeks to make are unnecessary, and they compromise the important distinction between the appropriate parliamentary oversight of the Australian Intelligence Community's administration, as outlined in the Intelligence Services Act 2001, and the operational oversight that is more appropriately performed by independent statutory roles such as the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security


For those of my colleagues who are not aware of the beginnings of the PJCIS, the committee has existed in its current form since the Inquiry into Australian Intelligence Agencies by Mr Philip Flood AO, known as the Flood inquiry, in 2004. Among his findings, Flood recommended that the membership of the existing Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD—the PJCAAD—should be extended to include the Defence Imagery and Geospatial Organisation, the DIGO, which has since been renamed the Australian Geospatial-Intelligence Organisation; the Defence Intelligence Organisation, the DIO; and the Office of National Assessments, the ONA. Following the passage of the Intelligence Services Legislation Amendment Bill in 2005, the committee was re-established as the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security—the PJCIS.


The functions of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security are outlined in the Intelligence Services Act 2001—the IS Act. Section 29 of the Intelligence Services Act provides that the functions of the committee are to:


review the administration and expenditure of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS), Australian Geospatial-Intelligence Organisation (AGO), Defence Intelligence Organisation (DIO), Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) and Office of National Assessments (ONA), including their annual financial statements


review any matter in relation to ASIO, ASIS, AGO, DIO, ASD or ONA referred to the Committee by the responsible Minister or a resolution of either House of the Parliament


monitor and to review the performance by the Australian Federal Police (AFP) of its functions under Part 5.3 of the Criminal Code (terrorism)


review, by 7 March 2018, the operation, effectiveness and implications of the following:


Division 3 of Part III of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 (ASIO questioning and detention powers)


Division 3A of Part IAA of the Crimes Act 1914 (police powers in relation to terrorist acts and terrorism offences)


Division 104 and 105 of the Criminal Code (control orders and preventative detention orders)


sections 119.2 and 119.3 of the Criminal Code (""declared area"" provisions)


review, by 13 April 2020, the mandatory data retention regime, as provided for under section 187N of the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979


review—for the sole purpose of assessing and making recommendations on the overall operation and effectiveness of the mandatory data retention regime—any matter that relates to the retained data activities of ASIO and is included in ASIO's annual report


review—for the sole purpose of assessing and making recommendations on the overall operation and effectiveness of the mandatory data retention regime—any matter that relates to the retained data activities of the AFP in relation to offences against Part 5.3 of the Criminal Code (terrorism) and is set out in the AFP's annual report on access to telecommunications data


review, by 1 December 2019, the operation, effectiveness and implications of sections 33AA, 35, 35AA and 35A of the Australian Citizenship Act 2007 (regarding the cessation of Australian citizenship) and any other provision of that Act as far as it relates to those sections; and


report the Committee's comments and recommendations to each House of the Parliament and to the responsible Minister.


Under section 102.1A of the Criminal Code, the Committee may also review any regulations made for the listing (or re-listing) of a ""terrorist organisation"" and report the Committee's comments and recommendations to each House of the Parliament before the end of the applicable disallowance period—a period of 15 sitting days after the regulation was laid before that House.


Further, the Committee may review and report on the declaration of any terrorist organisation for the purposes of section 35AA of the Australian Citizenship Act 2007.


The Committee is otherwise not authorised to initiate its own references, but may resolve to request the responsible Minister refer a particular matter to it for review.


Section 31 of the IS Act requires the Committee to prepare and table an Annual Report as soon as practicable after each year ending 30 June.


The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security has its limitations. The IS Act currently limits the inquiry powers of the PJCIS by providing that the functions of the committee do not include:


reviewing the intelligence gathering and assessment priorities of ASIO, ASIS, AGO, DIO, ASD or ONA;


reviewing the sources of information, other operational assistance or operational methods available to ASIO, ASIS, AGO, DIO, ASD or ONA;


reviewing particular operations that have been, are being or are proposed to be undertaken by ASIO, ASIS, AGO, DIO or ASD;


reviewing information provided by, or by an agency of, a foreign government where that government does not consent to the disclosure of the information;


reviewing an aspect of the activities of ASIO, ASIS, AGO, DIO, ASD or ONA that does not affect an Australian person;


reviewing the rules made under section 15 of the Act (to protect privacy of Australians);


conducting inquiries into individual complaints about the activities of ASIO, ASIS, AGO, DIO, ASD or ONA;


reviewing the content of, or conclusions reached in, assessments or reports made by DIO or ONA, or reviewing sources of information on which such assessments or reports are based


reviewing the coordination and evaluation activities undertaken by ONA


reviewing sensitive operational information or operational methods available to the AFP; or


reviewing particular operations or investigations that have been, are being or are proposed to be undertaken by the AFP.


These limitations are very important. They prevent inappropriate parliamentary influence being exercised over the operations, over the methodology and over the priority setting of the intelligence agencies. Responsibility for reviewing the operational activities of agencies is more appropriately given to the independent statutory role of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security.


The IGIS is responsible for overseeing and review of the Australian intelligence community in relation to its compliance with the law, compliance with ministerial directions and guidelines, proprietary and a respect for human rights. When exercising her inquiry function, the IGIS has significant powers, comparable to those of a royal commission—including obtaining information and requiring persons to answer questions and produce documents. The IGIS reports annually to parliament.


The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security proposes two main changes to the Intelligence Services Act 2001 regime. Firstly, the bill proposes changes to the composition of the PJCIS by removing the constraints on the membership of the PJCIS to provide that the balance of members can come from either chamber. Current requirements are that six come from the House of Representatives and five from the Senate. The bill also proposes introducing a requirement that the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Government in the Senate must be satisfied that members to be nominated to the PJCIS are the most appropriate members available.


Secondly, the bill proposes to expand the powers and functions of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security by allowing the PJCIS to conduct a review into operational activities of ASIO, ASIS, AGO, DIO, ASD, ONA and the Australian Federal Police. It would also authorise the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor, the INSLM, to provide the PJCIS with a copy of any report on a matter referred to it by the PJCIS and require the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security to give the PJCIS a copy of any report provided to the Prime Minister or the minister within three months. The bill would also allow the committee to conduct its own motion inquiries and allow the PJCIS to conduct pre-sunset review of legislation.


The amendments to this bill would blur the existing and appropriate divide between parliamentary and independent oversight and compromise the independence of existing overseeing bodies by proposing that the PJCIS receive direct reports from the IGIS on operational activities and that it could commence its own inquiries. The longstanding position in Australia is that operational overseeing of intelligence, security and law enforcement agencies is conducted by the overseeing independent statutory agencies, rather than by the parliament.


Currently the IGIS, which serves a crucial role in overseeing and ensuring accountability for the operational activities undertaken by our security agencies, only reports to ministers. It is important to note that the appropriateness of the overseeing of intelligence agencies by parliament was examined in the 2004 Flood inquiry. That inquiry found:


Just as the advice that officials provide to ministers is not disclosed in Senate Legislation Committee hearings, the judgments of assessment agencies should not be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. Opening assessments to scrutiny by parliament would also weaken the instinct amongst assessors to provide forthright advice for government, which is vital for good assessment.


The proposals duplicate and overlap with the roles of the IGIS and INSLM.


The bill would enable the PJCIS to conduct inquiries into legislation prior to a sunset date. This is an unnecessary duplication of the role of the INSLM, who has been granted powers that are tailored specifically to reviewing the operation, effectiveness and implications of Australia's national security legislation.


The bill would enable the committee to conduct its own review into the activities of intelligence agencies, provided the PJCIS has first consulted the responsible minister. This is an unnecessary duplication of the role of the IGIS. In 2014-15 the IGIS received an $840,000 increase in ongoing funding, allowing for the recruitment of additional staff to ensure effective oversight.


The current roles of the PJCIS, IGIS and INSLM ensure there is effective overseeing of the functioning of all aspects of Australia's security and intelligence agencies whilst minimising duplication and overlap. The current division also respects the appropriate divide between overseeing by parliament and independent agencies. The committee examines the administration and expenditure of all Australian intelligence community agencies, and the committee has only a very limited ability to inquire into operational activities.


The IGIS is responsible for oversight and review of the Australian intelligence community in relation to compliance with the law, compliance with ministerial directions and guidelines, propriety and respect for human rights. When exercising her inquiry function the IGIS has significant powers, comparable to those of a royal commission. The INSLM's role is to review the operation, effectiveness and implications of Australia's counterterrorism and national security legislation. This includes considering whether the laws contain appropriate safeguards for protecting the rights of individuals, that they remain proportionate to any threat of terrorism or threat to national security and remain necessary.


Should the committee be empowered to conduct its own reviews into the operational activities of the intelligence and security agencies, the bill does not provide adequate protection for operational activities, including methods and sources, to ensure reviews that the committee conducts, or any reports the INSLM or IGIS are required to provide to the committee, do not prejudice the operational activities of the agencies and international relations.


There is no demonstrated need for change. The PJCIS works well and has repeatedly demonstrated its ability to conduct insightful and thorough investigations. There is no demonstrated need to amend the PJCIS structure or powers. The government has referred each tranche of national-security-related legislation to the bipartisan PJCIS for review following its introduction into parliament, and has accepted every recommendation made by the committee. This consultative and collaborative approach has strengthened the transparency and accountability of our law enforcement and national security agencies.


This bill would only impose, at best, unnecessary changes. But at worst it would compromise the existing and appropriate divide between parliamentary and independent oversight. The risks that this bill poses have led to the government not supporting this bill and, similarly, I urge honourable senators not to support this bill in the chamber today.

"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2016-10-13,"



Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (11:59):  I rise today to speak on the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security Amendment Bill. This gives me cause to reflect on a few issues that were very present in my mind when I first entered this place back in 2008. In moving from the state legislature to the federal Senate, I was very self-aware about the fact that as a member of the government, a government backbencher, I would become part of and complicit with some significant decisions on things like sending troops to war, the surveillance of citizens, our civil liberties and the arbitrary detention of people. These were issues that weighed very heavily on my mind then and they are issues I take very seriously today. So when my colleagues put it to me that there is something not quite right and not yet quite good enough about how our parliamentary oversight of these matters is conducted and managed, I take that very seriously.


I know that these amendments are just adjustments in the way we currently operate; but they are important adjustments and they were put forward by no less than former Senator John Faulkner, who himself has reflected very carefully on these issues. What is proposed is the removal of the current constraints on the membership of the committee to provide that except for a minimum representation of one government member and senator and one opposition member and senator the balance of the 11 members of the committee can be drawn from either chamber. The current rules on who is eligible to be a member are fairly arbitrary in terms of saying we have this many from this chamber and that many from that chamber. That does not give the Labor Party, which takes this matter very seriously—or, for that matter, other parties—the capacity to appoint the people who are best placed to scrutinise these issues.


When you have six members and five senators, that is a very arbitrary thing to do. So it is important that this parliament has more flexibility in determining the membership of this joint committee. It will allow for the joint committee to be made up of members who are more expert in this field, without the constraint of whether they are a member or a senator. For example, I remember discussing with my new colleague Anne Aly MP, the member for Cowan, the fact that, while she has considerable expertise in this area, it is very difficult for her to get a position on the committee—because, by the time you put the shadow defence minister on the committee, or the Leader of the Opposition or others who are also a priority, there is no room left for her to be on the committee. So perhaps someone in the Labor Party might like to make a decision that a Labor senator might be able to give up their place for someone like Anne Aly. These constraints also mean that our shadow Attorney-General, the Honourable Mark Dreyfus, has been unable to serve on the committee because of the limited number of positions available to opposition members of the House of Representatives. So having more flexible membership provisions, without affecting the political balance of the committee, would enable the committee to benefit from this experience and expertise.


As previous senators have noted, this bill does not amend the requirement for the government to hold a majority on the committee. As a senator who has been a member of a number of committees and a chair of a committee, I think I am in a good position to reflect on the operation of committees. We are constantly faced with leading to deliberate on and renew our sense of how we balance our decision-making and deal with important national issues. We need to ensure that we connect in this place good decision-making to proper processes that scrutinise all avenues and outcomes of legislation.


The bill provides the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security capacity to conduct its own motions and inquiries after consultation with the responsible minister. I certainly think this is an important provision. When there is public debate about issues such as arbitrary intention or the quality of the intelligence that the parliament and the committee are receiving, there may not always be alignment between the views of the committee and the views of the minister. That means if a committee wants to interrogate those issues further they really need to be able to say to the minister: 'There is an important national security issue at stake here. It is time for us to be able to look more deeply into these issues.' This is an important extension but an essential one to enhance the oversight role of this committee.


This would bring the parliamentary joint committee in line with equivalent parliamentary committees in the US and the UK, which already have this power. But here in the Australian parliament our legislatures have, comparatively speaking, handed more power to government and more power to the agencies, while our parliamentary committees have been relatively more constrained in their capacity for scrutiny. In 2013 the UK's Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament was reformed by the passage of the Justice and Security Act 2013. So we now need to be able to keep up with these international movements.



The PRESIDENT:  The time for the debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting.

"Farrell, Sen Don",ALP,2016-10-13,"



Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (09:47):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I am very pleased to commence debate in the 45th Parliament on the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security Amendment Bill 2015. This bill was originally introduced by Senator Wong in 2015. It lapsed at prorogation in April 2016, was restored to the Notice Paper, lapsed again at the dissolution ahead of the election and was restored to the Notice Paper again to enable it to be advanced in the new parliament. This bill brings together a series of proposals designed to improve the operation of this significant joint statutory committee. The proposals are designed to make it more accountable and adaptable to the needs of the parliament and are also designed to enable the committee to have a greater amount of discretion in the way it conducts oversight of our intelligence and security agencies.


At the outset, I want to acknowledge the role of former senator John Faulkner in initiating the drafting and consultation on this bill. I might interpose here that Mr Faulkner recently gave up some of his time to come and address new senators on the way in which estimates runs. The bill is one of the legacies of Mr Faulkner's long parliamentary career and his determination to support and enhance parliamentary oversight of our intelligence and security agencies. Then Senator Faulkner first prepared this bill for introduction in 2014, presenting it to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security for consideration and comment, but retired before he was able to introduce the bill into the Senate. Labor is pleased to pursue the reforms contained in this bill originated by Mr Faulkner. John Faulkner served in the cabinets of two Labor governments and under three prime ministers and as Minister for Defence. He understood better than most the importance of being strong on national security, but he also understood that strength on national security does not come from tough rhetoric—it does not come from chest thumping or inflammatory statements; it comes from having intelligence and security agencies of the highest calibre that can be trusted to protect the rights and the liberties of the Australian people without trampling upon them. John Faulkner also understood that effective and rigorous parliamentary oversight is critical to the maintenance of public support of our national security architecture, particularly in these times.


This bill serves both those objectives. Effective scrutiny and oversight strengthen public support for our agencies and they also strengthen the agencies subject to oversight. As elected representatives gather in the national parliament, we can never outsource our duty to ensure the security of our nation and the people who entrust us with the responsibility of governing. This is as true when we are in times of relative peace as it is when we see emerging threats to our national security. This parliament must not deny our intelligence and security agencies the necessary powers and resources to protect Australian citizens and Australian interests. However, it must be recognised that these powers can impinge upon the values and freedoms on which our democracy is founded—values and freedoms which the Australian people correctly expect parliament to protect. As with so many things, this parliament must find the right balance between the security imperatives of our nation and the liberties and the freedoms of our people. The central plank of the intelligence and security framework is strong and effective accountability. Enhanced powers demand enhanced safeguards. Public trust and confidence in our security and intelligence agencies can only be ensured fully through strong and rigorous oversight and scrutiny.


I want to talk about the environment that we are confronted with. We know that over the last 15 years in particular this parliament has scrutinised and passed many pieces of legislation which have contributed to the development of a legislative architecture relating to our security and intelligence agencies. This has been in response to developments in the security situation, which has altered in new and significant ways over time. It also reflects changes in technology, which means that our intelligence and security agencies must operate in a higher level of sophistication with specialist expertise. There has generally been a high level of cooperation in the parliament to secure bipartisan agreement on national security legislation. Of course, bipartisanship does not mean taking an uncritical approach to proposals or additional or amended national security language or legislation.


In order to ensure rights and liberties are protected, it is essential that all parties approach legislative proposals with a discerning eye. In the current parliament, this Senate has dealt with a number of very significant pieces of national security legislation, and all have been subject to scrutiny by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. Each piece of legislation has been amended as a result of recommendations of the committee, sometimes quite extensively. This is an example of the process of parliamentary scrutiny at work. Likewise, the addition of other perspectives in the Senate debate ensures all views are ultimately considered and represented before the legislation comes to a vote.


As agencies continue to seek, and are granted, additional powers to meet contemporary threats, so too must scrutiny and oversight keep pace. In recent years Australia has benefited from professional and well-run intelligence and security agencies. Labor acknowledges their work. They have demonstrated respect and understanding of the role of the parliament, the government of the day and our laws. But the personal integrity and quality of leaders of our agencies, as important as this is, are not reliable, effective safeguards against the abuse of security powers. It is the responsibility of parliament to prescribe safeguards that keep pace with the expansion of security powers that have been deemed necessary.


The purpose of this bill is to ensure that the adequacy and effectiveness of parliamentary oversight of intelligence and security agencies is in keeping with the development and enhancement of additional powers we have afforded to these agencies. It amends the Intelligence Services Act 2001, the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor Act 2010 and the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act 1986. As legislative changes extending the powers of security agencies are implemented, the requirement for reliable and effective external oversight becomes more critical. If these changes which extend the powers of the agencies are given effect but are not accompanied by adequate safeguards, it will be more challenging to maintain an essential level of trust in the community about the agency's operations. Trust is essential if our agencies are to be effective.


Not only are these safeguards important to protect the public interest but they also create an environment that protects the agencies themselves. It is to the parliament that these agencies are accountable and it is parliament's responsibility to provide oversight of their priorities and their effectiveness. It is not sufficient for the parliament to simply put in place a legislative framework for the oversight of agencies without conducting oversight itself. If the parliament is not a check and balance, it will not be possible to ensure agencies meet the requirements and the standards that the parliament itself has set. The parliament has no better or more authoritative forum than the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security to do this job.


Just as the legislation governing our intelligence and security agencies must be under constant review, so too must be the legislation governing the operation of the committees. Just as we would expect amendments to be brought to the parliament to correct deficiencies and enhance the operation of our intelligence and security agencies, so too must the parliament assess the effectiveness of its own committee. Labor's submission to the Senate today is that the legislation governing the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security can be improved. We present this bill as a means of doing so. 


I want to briefly traverse the key measures in the bill. This bill removes current constraints on the membership of the committee to provide that, except for a minimum representation of one government member and senator and one opposition member and senator, the balance on the 11-member committee can be drawn from either chamber. Currently, the Intelligence Services Act 2001 mandates a composition of six House of Representatives members and five senators from the committees. Removing this current constraint will enable greater flexibility in determining PJCIS membership.


I note that the bill does not amend the requirement for the government to hold a majority. In relation to this provision, there is no reason why senators should be in the minority. I suggest to the Senate it should be left to the parties to draw members from the best available representatives. Because of the nexus that currently exists between the Senate and the other place, as well as between the parties, for example, in the past some senators on both sides have had to relinquish their places on the committee for a period in order to accommodate certain members of the other place for particular inquiries by a committee. The opposition found itself constrained by both the apportionment of membership between the Senate and House and the desire by the government to allocate its six members across the chamber in a particular way.


I reiterate: the bill does not amend the requirement for the government to hold a majority, but it does mean that there are fewer constraints placed on the choice of members for the committee based on the chamber in which they sit. I presume there would not be a senator who would object if this resulted in a greater number of senators on the committee. I note the continuing requirement that, before nominating members, the Prime Minister or the Leader of the Government in the Senate, as appropriate, is obliged to consult with the leader of each recognised political party that is represented in the House and in the Senate, as the case may be, and that does not form part of the government.


The bill also: provides for the committee to conduct its own-motion inquiries after consultation with the responsible minister; authorises the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor to provide the committee with a copy of any report on a matter referred to it by the committee; requires the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security to give the committee a copy of any report provided to the Prime Minister or a minister within three months; gives the committee the function of conducting presunset reviews of legislation containing sunset provisions; and adds the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor and the National Security Adviser to officers able to be consulted by the committee.


As the role of agencies and the powers afforded to them develops, the greater the potential for that power to infringe upon individual liberties and, in turn, the greater the need for accountability in the exercise of that power. I do not in any way suggest that our security and intelligence agencies are acting otherwise than in accordance with the law. That is not my view. But, if powers were to be used inappropriately, there would be an erosion of public trust. Having appropriate and effective accountability mechanisms protects both the agencies and the public. As I said previously, it is the parliament to which the agencies are accountable, not the judiciary, and it is the parliament's responsibility to oversee their priorities and effectiveness and to ensure agencies meet the requirements and standards it sets.


I want to briefly turn to an international comparison. An increasingly complex and unpredictable security landscape in Australia and around the world means the powers of intelligence and security agencies have changed dramatically in recent years. This is as true in Australia as it is in many other similar democracies. The maintenance of public security in the current security environment has led to greater powers for the agencies charged with these responsibilities. However, the protection of democratic liberties and freedoms equally demands enhanced oversight of the exercise of these powers. This is the case at home and abroad.


As senators would know, Australia forms part of the Five Eyes intelligence and security network of nations, including the United Kingdom, the United States, New Zealand and Canada. With the exception of Canada, each of these countries has at least one committee of the legislature that exercises oversight of that country's intelligence and security agencies.


In the United Kingdom, the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament consists of nine members drawn from both the House of Commons and the House of Lords. The numbers from each chamber are not specified in the governing act. Similarly to our committee, the members of the intelligence and security committee of the United Kingdom are appointed by the house in which they serve, on the nomination of the Prime Minister in consultation with the opposition. Recent reforms provided that committee with greater powers and increased its remit, including oversight of operational activities and the wider intelligence and security activities of government.


The United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence is established by resolution of the senate and consists of 15 senators: eight from the majority party and seven from the minority party. It meets roughly twice a week, generally in closed sessions. Most hearings involve appearances by senior intelligence community officials, who present evidence and answer senators' questions. There is also the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence in the United States House of Representatives.


The New Zealand Intelligence and Security Committee has a membership of five, notably including the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. Two of the remaining three are nominated by the Prime Minister, and one by the Leader of the Opposition.


As I said at the outset, Canada does not currently have a parliamentary committee responsible for intelligence and security. However, the new government, during the election campaign, promised to establish an all-party national security oversight committee if it was elected. The new Prime Minister has instructed the relevant minister to assist the leader of the government in the House of Commons in the creation of a statutory committee of parliamentarians with special access to classified information to review government departments and agencies with national security responsibilities.


As can be generally seen, the legislative branch of government has a central role in the oversight and scrutiny of the work of such agencies amongst our allies. Further, the membership of the parliamentary committees that I have outlined in general is more flexible than the situation that currently applies in Australia—something this bill is designed to address.


As a result of legislation that passed in the last parliament, from 1 March 2016 the parliamentary joint committee has already had a number of additional functions added to its previously existing responsibilities. These include: monitoring and reviewing the performance of the AFP's counter-terrorism functions under the Criminal Code Act; reporting to the parliament on matters appertaining to the AFP, or connected to those functions; reviewing matters relating to the retained data activities of the AFP and ASIO covered in annual reports on the mandatory data retention regime, including where this goes to operational matters, for the sole purpose of assessing and making recommendations on the overall operation and effectiveness of the regime; reviewing bills in relation to the mandatory data retention regime; conducting a review of a range of counter-terrorism legislation, by 7 March 2018; conducting a review of the mandatory data retention regime, to be commenced by 13 April 2019 and completed a year later; conducting a review, by 1 December 2019, of the new citizenship revocation powers contained in the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Allegiance to Australia) Act 2015. This is in addition to powers in other areas.


I express my hope that the bill will receive sensible consideration and, in time, I hope, support from all parties across the chamber, recognising that this is a bill that is designed to enhance the ability of the committee to protect the interests of the parliament and, through us, the Australian people. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2016-10-13,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (10:07):  This is the first opportunity I have had to be in a debate that Senator Farrell has spoken in, so I take this opportunity of congratulating him on his appointment as deputy leader. I must say I look forward to his further advancement in the opposition in the years ahead.


Senator Farrell indicated in his opening remarks that this was a matter that former Senator Faulkner had an interest in. While I disagreed with then Senator Faulkner on many issues, I have always accepted his absolute commitment to parliament and to what he believed was right. So having this bill introduced by Senator Farrell with reference to the work that then Senator Faulkner had done meant I listened with a great deal of interest to what Senator Farrell said in his opening address and I tried to follow through the arguments that he was putting in support of this bill.


I want to say at the outset that in these days of heightened insecurity across the world, and Australia is no different, our intelligence and our security agencies have an even greater role to perform in protecting Australians. Regrettably, where that occurs throughout history it of necessity sometimes curtails some of the other freedoms that we would expect—some of the roles that parliament and others might have in looking at issues—because of this heightened security. We have to make sure that the agencies we entrust to look after our safety have everything going in their favour because, as I always point out, the bad guys—the terrorists, the criminals—are constrained by no-one and nothing. They are not accountable to anyone at all. They do what they like. But our agencies—our police forces, our security agencies—are always accountable to someone and so they have to act in the most appropriate manner all of the time. And sometimes that does constrain what they are able to do. I do not think this parliament should do anything that makes it harder for our security agencies and our police forces to do their jobs in protecting us. And while I accept that this bill has been introduced in good faith, it is not a bill that I could support or that the government could support for reasons that I will get onto shortly.


Just by way of background, I indicate to those who might be following the debate that the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security has existed in its current form since the inquiry into the Australian intelligence agencies by Mr Philip Flood AO in 2004. Amongst his findings, Mr Flood recommended that membership of the then parliamentary joint committee on ASIO, ASIS and the Defence Security Directorate should be extended to include the Defence Imagery and Geospatial Organisation, the Defence Intelligence Organisation and the Office of National Assessments. Following the passage of the intelligence services legislation bill in 2005, which resulted from the Flood inquiry, the committee was re-established as the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security.


The functions of that committee are outlined in the Intelligence Services Act, as amended. Briefly, section 29 provides that the committee's functions are:


… to review the administration and expenditure of ASIO, ASIS, AGO, DIO, ASD and ONA, including the annual financial statements …


The committee is also required:


… to review any matter in relation to ASIO, ASIS, AGO, DIO, ASD or ONA referred to the Committee by:


(i)  the responsible Minister; or


(ii)  a resolution of either House of the Parliament


The committee also has to: 


… monitor and to review the performance by the AFP of its functions under Part 5.3 of the Criminal Code—


which relates to terrorism. It is also to review the 'operation, effectiveness and implications' of: Part III of the ASIO Act, which relates to questioning and detention powers; division 3A of IAA of the Crimes Act, which relates to police powers in relation to terrorist acts and terrorism offences; divisions 104 and 105 of the Criminal Code, which relate to control orders and preventative detention orders; and sections 119.2 and 119.3 of the Criminal Code about declared area provisions.


The committee has other roles required by the act. I will not go through them all, but they are all set out in section 29 of the act. Under the Criminal Code, the committee is also able to review any regulation made for the listing or relisting of a terrorist organisation and report the committee's comments and recommendations to each house of parliament, so it has fairly wide powers. It can review and report on the declaration of any terrorist organisation under the Australian Citizenship Act. It can do all of those things that I have mentioned, and it is also required to prepare and table an annual report each year.


The committee, though, is not authorised by the act to initiate its own references, but may resolve to request the responsible minister to refer a particular matter to it for review. So if the committee thinks that there is an issue that needs to be addressed it can, by resolution, ask the relevant minister—no doubt the Attorney-General or the Minister for Justice—to make a reference on that particular matter. It is then up to the minister to either agree or disagree with that role.


The act specifically sets out what the committee is not able to do. It is important to understand these. The committee is barred from reviewing the intelligence gathering and assessment priorities of our intelligence agencies. It is prevented from reviewing the sources of information or other operational assistance or operation methods available to any of those agencies. It is not able to review particular operations that have been, are being or are proposed to be undertaken by any of our agencies. It is not entitled to review information provided by an agency of a foreign government where that government does not consent to the disclosure of the information. It is not allowed to review aspects of the activities of ASIO, ASIS, AGO, DIO, ASD or the Office of National Assessments that do not affect an Australian person. It is not allowed to review rules relating to the protection of privacy of Australians. It is not allowed to look at individual complaints about the activities of any of our agencies. It is not able to review the content of or conclusions reached in assessments or reports made by DIO or ONA, or to review sources of information on which such assessments are based.


It does not need me to go through and explain why the act that was passed several years ago made those prohibitions, because the last thing we want is individuals coming forward with a complaint which may or may not be genuine and then dragging our often secret intelligence agencies before a public parliamentary committee to respond to what may well be a frivolous complaint. I could give examples in relation to every one of those prohibitions, but I do not think it needs me to do that. Anyone who follows this area of law would understand the reasons for those prohibitions being put in place.


I will indicate—I think Senator Farrell made the same observation, but perhaps not with directly the same words—the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence Services has always been one of the most successful examples of effective bipartisanship throughout successive Australian parliaments and it has an excellent track record of conducting insightful and thorough investigations. I emphasise that it is a bipartisan committee. When it comes to the safety of Australians and our nation, politics does not enter into it. It does not matter which political party you are involved in. I would say with absolute confidence that there is no politicking and no partisan approach to the way our security agencies operate, because the job they are doing is to protect all of us. As I said earlier, it is essential that they have every power to do that.


This amending bill that we are dealing with today does a number of things. It expands the powers and the functions of the committee by allowing the committee to conduct a review into operational activities of the intelligence agencies and the Australian Federal Police. I shudder to think that any parliamentary committee would be asking our secret service people to explain their methods of operations: why they did things, the judgements they made or the secret information they get from other agencies from other nations with whom we have very close arrangements. It would just be a difficult constraint on those agencies. Remember, I said before—I was to emphasise this—the bad guys, the terrorists and the criminals have no constraints. They can do what they like and they are not answerable to anyone. Whilst our agencies act within the law, and the laws are made so that they do act appropriately and properly, having the agencies before a parliamentary committee to explain in detail every element of their operations, I think, would curtail them and would not only make their operations more difficult in the future but perhaps lessen their enthusiasm for protecting us properly in the case where they knew they would have to come and publicly explain their operations.


The bill also seeks to provide the committee with powers including operational oversight and presunset legislative review which would duplicate and overlap those of the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor and the IGIS—the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. These agencies are subject to oversight by these two statutory organisations. What this bill seeks to do is to give the committee its own powers to almost oversee the overseers, and that seems to be inappropriate. The bill does not provide adequate protection of operational activities, including methods and sources, to ensure that any reviews the committee conducts or any reports that either of the inspectors-general might be required to provide to the committee do not prejudice the operational activities of agencies and international relations—and that is very important as well.


If I could just perhaps elaborate a little further on some of those objections: the existing divide between the parliamentary committee and these independent agencies with oversight would compromise the independence of those two overseeing bodies by proposing that the committee receive direct reports from the IGIS on operational activities and could then commence its own inquiries. This would seem to be hugely double-guessing the existing agencies that are in place to oversee our security services.


The longstanding position in Australia is that operational oversight of the intelligence, security and law enforcement agencies is conducted by independent statutory oversight rather than by parliament. That has been around for some time. Currently, the IGIS, which serves a crucial role in overseeing and ensuring accountability for all operational activities, reports only to the minister, as I think is appropriate. I mentioned the Flood inquiry before and I will just quote from something that the inquiry found in its 2004 investigation:


Just as the advice that officials provide to ministers is not disclosed in Senate Legislation Committee hearings, the judgments of assessment agencies should not be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. Opening assessments to scrutiny by parliament would also weaken the instinct amongst assessors to provide forthright advice for government, which is vital for good assessment.


That is what the Flood inquiry reported and advised the parliament, following a very extensive inquiry back in 2004.


This bill, if it were passed, would enable the committee to conduct inquiries into legislation prior to a sunset date. This is an unnecessary duplication of the role of the INSLM, who has been granted powers that are tailored specifically to reviewing the operations, effectiveness and implications of Australia's national security agencies.


The amending bill also would enable the committee to conduct its own review into the activities of ASIO, ASIS, AGO, DIO, ASD and ONA, provided the PJC—the committee—has first consulted with the responsible minister. As I said, this is an unnecessary duplication of the role of the Inspector-General of Intelligence Services.


In 2014-15, under the coalition government, the Inspector-General received an increase of $840,000 in ongoing funding, allowing for the recruitment of additional staff to ensure effective oversight. So, the government has given these independent statutory officers all the resources necessary to properly oversee our security agencies—to make sure that they are doing the right thing. I think that is a system that works very well.


Of course, I do not know about—I am not privy to—the work of ASIO, or ASIS or any of the intelligence agencies, although as chair, once, of the parliamentary committee with oversight of the Australian Crime Commission I did get some limited insight into the work that is done by that agency and, indeed, others. But I have the highest regard for the professionalism and integrity of our services—particularly as they are overseen by independent statutory officers, in whom I think I can say confidently everyone in this parliament has confidence.


So, as I said, whilst I listened to the arguments and I understand the sentiments of the bill I think it is unnecessary. I think the system works well as it is at the present time and I would urge the chamber not to support the amending bill.

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2016-10-13,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (10:27):  I thank the opposition for bringing this Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security Amendment Bill 2015 on for debate. I want to start my contribution by just reflecting on the context—the global security environment within which we are having this discussion.


It is certainly true to say that at the moment we are facing on a global scale a very complex and rapidly-evolving security environment. It is one that brings with it specific and, to date in human history, unique challenges. That is why the Greens believe it is important that there is proper scrutiny through this parliament of Australia's security agencies. But, more importantly in that context, it is why we believe that we need a more strategic approach to law-making in this country around issues like intelligence gathering, data collection and the way that our security agencies operate.


I want to make the point up-front that in fact the Australian Greens do not believe that we are taking a strategic enough approach to making laws in this area. Of course, what we have seen in recent times—particularly in the last 15 years, since 2001-2002—is an ever-changing landscape of laws that the Australian people are told is there to protect us against some of the threats that I have just spoken about. We have seen a large volume of legislative change that has been made in the name of counterterrorism and national security, and I think it is beyond argument that the majority of those legislative changes have in fact eroded some fundamental civil rights and human rights that have existed in this country for many years. In many cases, these are civil and human rights that our ancestors fought for and in some cases tragically died to protect. We are now seeing some of these rights eroded away in the name of counterterrorism and national security. I think that is an unarguable statement.


Where discussion and, potentially, contention comes into this is: are those trade-offs worth making in terms of the advances that they bring protecting the Australian people? That is a discussion we want to place front and centre in this parliament and in the public conversation in this country. We urge both the coalition, currently in government, and the Labor Party, currently in opposition, to think very carefully about whether they would be prepared to support a more strategic approach around the way we are seeing our civil liberties eroded in the name of counterterrorism and national security.


I want to be clear that the Australian Greens genuinely believe it is time for a white-paper-style assessment—call it a blue paper if you like—of whether or not the legal changes that have occurred in the name of counterterrorism and national security have in fact made Australia safer, as we are told they were designed to do and, more specifically, whether that reduction in our civil liberties in this country has been worth any advance in national security and counterterrorism. As I said up-front, we are facing a very complex and rapidly-evolving security scenario around the world. The danger with taking a white paper approach is that it is a snapshot in time and then the world moves on, rendering all the work that had been done to generate a white paper less relevant than it otherwise would have been.


We believe that it is well within the competence of our policy makers and our security agencies to design a living white paper—one that is capable of evolving in very close to real time to respond to changes in the global security environment. We do not think this is a contentious idea. We see white papers in, for example, the Defence portfolio. We would pose the question: why don't we have a white paper process in the counterterrorism space and the national security space? There is nothing wrong with a strategic approach in this environment. We have seen white paper processes for tax, agriculture and defence. We have even seen a white paper for Northern Australia. But we have not for some time seen a white paper around national security in the context of counterterrorism.


Of course, a white paper process would involve the input of our security agencies, but it would also give a range of other experts from a number of other fields the chance to have a meaningful say. It should and could include an examination of the effectiveness of the dozens of legislative and administrative changes made since 2002. I will just place on the record that since that time we have seen new crimes created at least 12 times, legal powers have been extended at least seven times, police have been granted new powers at least 16 times and intelligence powers have been increased at least 12 times. In that period such laws have only been softened twice and new oversight created just once. This erosion of fundamental civil liberties in our country is unprecedented in Australia's peacetime history. We believe we owe it to our people, including the many Australians who have fought and at times died to protect these liberties, to make sure that this erosion is actually justified by an increase in the security of the Australian people.


I come now to this legislation. The bill seeks to amend a number of acts. Specifically, it seeks to amend the Intelligence Services Act 2001 by removing some of the current constraints on the membership of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. It would change it from the current six members from the House of Representatives and five senators to one government member and one government senator and one opposition member and one opposition senator, with the balance of the committee drawn from either chamber. We have heard contributions from both the government and the opposition today. I want to make the point that this committee is very much a closed shop; it is historically made up of members from the government of the day and the opposition of the day.


We are facing a context now where one-quarter of Australians did not vote for the coalition or Labor in the recent election—and that is a continuation of a declining trend in the vote of the political duopoly in this country. So the Australian Greens have a view that it is time the membership of this committee provided for an opportunity for a senator who is not from the government and not from the opposition to join in the role that this committee plays in our parliamentary system and in our scrutiny system. So I flag now that in the committee stages of this bill we will be moving an amendment which, if passed, will provide for a senator who is not a government or opposition senator to become part of the membership of this committee.


We understand the responsibilities that this would entail, the responsibilities that this would place on whichever member of the crossbench it is. I include the Australian Greens in that context, as members of the crossbench. We understand it would place a heavy responsibility on whichever non-government and non-opposition senator were appointed to fill a position on this committee, but we do believe that it is important that there be at least one voice on this committee that does not reflect the political duopoly, because what we have seen in Australia, certainly in the last decade to decade and a half, is a strong bipartisanship on national security matters.


My view is that the reason we have strong bipartisanship on national security matters actually owes more to politics than it does to a robust examination of the legislation that underpins Australia's national security. Neither party when in opposition want to appear weak on national security, so they fall into zombie lockstep with whoever is in government at the time and develop a bipartisanship that means legislation which is continually brought into this place—and we are facing more on the Notice Paper at the moment—and which erodes some of our fundamental civil and human liberties in this country is not adequately scrutinised. We believe we need more scrutiny; we believe there needs to be more justification put before the Australian people for this continued erosion of their civil liberties in the name of counterterrorism and national security; and we believe a crossbench senator, as a member of the Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, could play that role or be part of playing that role. This is a closed shop committee open only to members of the political duopoly in this country, and frankly the Australian people deserve better.


I would like to respond briefly to some comments that were made by the previous speaker, Senator Macdonald. He spoke about the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor and the role that he plays in scrutinising national security legislation. Well, it is a crucial role that the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor plays, but I do want to be clear that the Greens remain unconvinced that in fact the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor is adequately funded, and we certainly believe the government is making more and more of a habit of ignoring the recommendations that come from the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor. In fact, the recommendations do not, as I understand it, currently even receive a response from government. That is not good enough. The government should at least do the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor the courtesy of providing a response to his recommendations. The monitor does a great job in examining a wide suite of legislation. He does report to this parliament, but it is not good enough that the government does not provide a response to his recommendations, which ought to be tabled in both houses of this parliament.


We accept absolutely the crucial nature of the work that the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security does. We believe absolutely that it is an appropriate body that has been established, and we support absolutely the measures contained in this bill—with the caveat around the membership of the committee that has been proposed by the Labor Party. We particularly support the part of this bill that provides for the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security to conduct own-motion inquiries. That was spoken against by Senator Macdonald in the speech that he just made, and when this bill was previously debated, in the former parliament, it was spoken strongly against. But we do not accept the arguments that have been put up against this. We believe it is reasonable for this committee to conduct own-motion inquiries within the constraints that the act has established and we believe it would improve the scrutiny of our intelligence agencies for this parliament to be able, through this committee, to conduct own-motion inquiries. Of course, it is this parliament that has actually established our security agencies; they are creatures of this parliament. And this parliament has every right within the constraints that exist within the act to, through this committee, have own-motion inquiries conducted and reported back as appropriate.


As I said at the beginning of my contribution this morning, it is a complex area. It is a complex global environment—one that moves very rapidly and changes very quickly. This committee plays a crucial role in scrutinising the intelligence agencies that have been established by this parliament to make Australia as safe as it can possibly be, and we share that goal of making Australia as safe as it can reasonably be made. But we do believe that there has not been a strategic approach to this. We believe that the erosion of some fundamental civil and human liberties in this country has been done in a politically ad hoc manner rather than as a result of a carefully conceived strategy. We believe that owes much to the zombie lockstep in which both the coalition and Labor proceed in this space and we believe that having a senator who is not a member of either the government or the opposition on this committee would allow for a greater diversity of thought on this committee and a greater diversity of input to the processes of this committee.



In broad terms, we support this legislation because we think it will go some way towards improving the operations of the committee. However, as I said, we feel strongly enough that there should be a senator who is not from government or opposition on this committee and we will be seeking to amend this bill to provide for that, should that amendment be successful.


In conclusion, this is a challenging time for freedoms around the world. It is not only a challenging time because threats are arising; it is a challenging time because freedoms are being eroded in response to the threats that are arising. Both of those matters need to be considered strategically. They ought to be the subject of a white paper—a living, breathing white paper that can be adapted in response to the rapidly evolving global environment.


Also, we need to ensure that this committee is made up of members who have the capacity to bring some thoughts and some positions to this committee that, potentially at least—depending on who the appointed senator from the crossbench would be, should our amendment be successful—bring a more strategic approach that is outside the political lock step, which we so often see in the context of discussions and conversations in this parliament and in the public debate in Australia around responding to the national security threats to Australia that exist today.

"Dodson, Sen Patrick",ALP,2016-10-13,"



Senator DODSON
 (Western Australia) (10:47):  The matter of security, as we have heard, is one that we in this nation take very seriously. We obviously try to balance the liberties and freedoms that citizens would like to enjoy in our country. We take a fairly open-hearted approach to most things and most people from different cultures and different persuasions, and we generally try to abide by the laconic notion of a fair go for everyone. When that notion butts up against the heinous nature of indiscriminate assaults and murders of innocent citizens, in the most extreme consequences, by those who would want to destroy democracy and want to destroy the privileges, rights and freedoms that people enjoy, I think we find it very hard to get that balance right sometimes. I am not suggesting we have not got it right in Australia, but I do know we butt up against the tension point between our sense of freedom as a nation of people who tend not to understand, or tend not to have experienced, the atrocities we see in the Middle East and other places pretty much nightly on our televisions. We have experienced it in Bali with our citizens and in other places, and we are horrified when such things happen.


In fact, today there was a report of a couple of Syrian citizens in Germany capturing a wanted felon, a terrorist, and then reporting that person to the authorities. The appreciation of the citizens of Germany for that helps them have a different view of people who are fleeing from violence in other nation states and coming to their own countries. In fact, they have suggested that such individuals should be honoured with a medal for their services to the nation.


Here we are talking about something that is rather modest in its intent. The amending bill began with people like Senator Faulkner in his time here and way back, as Senator Macdonald said, with the recommendations in the report that came from by Mr Flood and others when we were in the beginning of the horrors of many of these atrocities. Our maturity around the necessity for incursions into the freedoms, responsibilities and rights of citizens was probably not weighed as heavily as it is today. I am not suggesting that it was not.


I can recall, as a young person, being detained by the police. It was not just being detained in the watch house; he actually had a whip, which he threatened to use. He had no power to do this, but he had a whip and threatened to use it. On the floor of the cell he showed us an iron circle to which people had been chained, or potentially could be chained. So the notion of deprivation of liberty is a very important matter to me personally, but, I think, for most Australians as well. But we do not like to be overencumbered by regulation and authoritarianism, or by delegations, when we have a sense that our freedoms are being infringed.


On the other hand, we know that there are people who, as Senator Macdonald said, have no regard for any of this, who have no regard for the sanctity and uniqueness and beauty of human life, and who are prepared to do whatever it takes to achieve an ideological outcome—that is, fundamentally to destroy the principles of freedom and democracy in a nation state, particularly in our country, Australia. It is sad that such things happen. As we come to the parliament of Australia each day we notice outside the parliament officers with guns. When I first started coming to the parliament to lobby in the old Parliament House that was a very rare sight. So the price of our democracy is pretty significant. I do not think we ought to be cowed by those who want to threaten it. Therefore, the necessity of a committee like the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security is a critical matter. It is a critical function of the parliament, interfacing with the senior people who have the day-to-day responsibilities of guaranteeing the freedom and safety of the citizens of this nation.


Really, this bill is trying to get that right. I heard Senator McKim, from the Greens, speak of getting the balance of the membership right. I note that the bill proposes that the majority of the government will not be affected by this amendment. It does allow for 11 other members to be nominated by the houses. That is a matter for political movement, it would seem to me. People are capable of doing things in this place to ensure that the representation is there. But I take the point that is being talked about, that there is pretty much a de facto presence on this very important committee.


The responsibility that goes with that is of course paramount to how we deal with sensitive information that comes from the other amendments that are being proposed to have access to information and advice given by the national officer responsible for these matters. That access is not for the purposes of flaunting the information but so that we as representatives of the parliament can be informed about where and what it is our nation has been apprised of at the highest levels, whether it be at the ministerial level, the level of the security council or wherever it is that these matters go to for decision making—ultimately, the executive of government.


The importance of that is also to deal with the question of our responsibility as elected representatives, to try and get a balance between us as the elected representatives, who are accountable to the public and therefore have a trust placed in us to ensure that their safety is looked after in the best possible manner, and the functionaries. I have no doubt that that is what we seek to do and are doing to the best of our capacities. The bill is really about how we can improve in a minor way some of the functional aspects of this. It is not seeking to overcome and overtake the role and responsibility that the agencies have for our security, but it is trying to, I suppose, ensure that the public is aware that we parliamentarians do not leave these things entirely in the hands of very capable functionaries who account to a particular individual—a minister—and not necessarily to the parliament. That is a complex matter, I understand and fully appreciate, and I am not suggesting that we ought to be overturning that. What I am suggesting is support for the proposal that we are putting forward on our side to have the capacity to be informed by reports on these matters and also to look towards initiating inquiries that are significant in this field, to pursue a matter. I would think that you would only do that, given the practicalities of this, after a long period of discussion—interacting with the relevant agencies and the minister responsible—and that it would not be just a case of a rabbit running down a hole hoping to find something. It would actually have to be something of great significance to do that.


We should recall also that intelligence gathering is not always left to those who are the specialists in the field. Often we require and rely upon citizens to inform us about what is going on in particular places to make sure that the eyes and ears, as it were, of the custodians of democracy and freedom that are in the hands of our citizens are also utilised beyond those who are the specialists and the most efficiently trained. So the role for the public in much of this is also critical.


It is about getting the right balance between trust, freedom, efficiencies and capacity to make decisions. No-one is suggesting, through this bill, a frustration with any of that. We are talking about a capacity to be better informed through the committee on national security so that the parliament itself is not just tangential to what takes place at a higher level but is in fact integral to that in a very important way that underpins democracy. It is conditioned and governed, obviously, by the existing tenants of the legislation, so is not something that is being proposed in a vacuum here; it is being proposed in a context. 


This is a very minor amendment to the existing legislation that we hope to win the support of the Senate for. It is not opening up a whole avenue for placing at risk the very important and significant matter of national security. In fact, it is trying to improve on that and lend greater support to those who have that onerous task of looking after us and ensuring our nation is safe and that the agencies are resourced. It is critical that their recommendations are taken up, but if they are not known then it is very difficult for those matters to be pursued—outside of the largesse of the minister or his or her responsibilities.


The question of global security weighs on us on a constant basis. Again, I recall some years ago going to the United States and to New York. People actually put money on the window sills of their houses so that people would not break in. There was a sense of fear that gripped the nation at the time—and it has probably only been enhanced by the terrorism acts that have taken place in America since my period there. The sense of fear is a very corrosive element to the principles of democracy and freedom. That is something we need to guard against most diligently whilst we balance the necessity for efficient and effective intelligence gathering and the capacity to orchestrate the activities necessary to undertake tasks while not being curtailed by unnecessary bureaucracy and management. It is getting both things right that is the challenge. 


I think what we have tried to do on our side is suggest some minimal changes. They can be improved upon, I have no doubt, but the intent is to ensure, through the membership proposals, that there is a role for the parliament in a greater manner than there has been in the past. I think the capacity to look at sunset legislation is often important, because there may well be amendments that could be made to improve it, or there could be matters that are no longer relevant that ought to be removed as well.


The significant factor, I think, is community trust in its institutions. Primarily, citizens look to the parliament for that to be exercised on their behalf. That is why they elect us. We are elected to make decisions.  I appreciate that sometimes those decisions are hard on people's senses of their own freedoms and their own sense of what and how they ought to enjoy their democracy. But we all have to balance the competing rights of each other and the diversity and differences that we bring to our wonderful democracy. 


But if we do not appreciate that and if we do not bring those balances then we are simply allowing ourselves to slip more and more into some form of totalitarian state—and I am not suggesting that these amendments have any intention of doing that. We need to bring to the notice of the government and to the parliament the ways in which democracy and its significant structures can be better made to reflect the trust that citizens place in us and to ensure that agents that are brought into existence, that look after our security, are also held accountable. Senator Macdonald's view about oversighting the oversighters is a point that I do not necessarily disagree with: But that is not what we are talking about.


What we are talking about is that there has to be a balance of all the various accountabilities that are required in a rather complex scenario of national security and intelligence gathering. If we can achieve that and improve upon that without placing at risk the necessities for security, confidentiality and privacy—those sorts of issues which are fundamental to good intelligence gathering and for good execution of activities to protect the nation—then that has to be paramount. But I do not think that the amendments that we are proposing in any way hinder or impact on that particular paramount goal. 


I think this is a modest set of recommendations. They seek to get the balance right and to bring in a bigger role for parliamentarians—not to usurp, in any manner, the role, function and authority of the agencies—in order to bring some comfort, I think, to the public that security is not always a matter that has to wear a gun. Security is also about: how do you cultivate friendships, freedom and trust with the others who you may not necessarily agree with? It is a bit hard when you do not know who wants to blow you up. But if you do have good intelligence and you do have good security measures, you can hopefully identify that better and you can accord to those people the kind of matters of justice that are— (Time expired)

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",NXT,2016-10-13,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (11:07):  At the beginning of my remarks on this important bill, I would like to pay tribute to the late Dr Des Ball, Professor at the Australian National University's Strategic and Defence Studies Centre, who passed away yesterday after a lengthy illness. Professor Ball was a towering figure in Australian strategic and defence policy and a pioneer over more than four decades in researching the activities of the Australian intelligence community, most notably exposing decades of dissembling by successive governments about the role of the United States-Australia joint defence facilities. Together with Professor Richard Tanter, Professor Ball was earlier this year still publishing immensely detailed and scholarly papers providing new insight into the role of the joint defence facility at Pine Gap, including details of its intimate involvement in supporting US military operations and the global surveillance network run by the so-called Five Eyes intelligence partners.


Des Ball was a champion for greater transparency and democratic accountability for the Australian intelligence community, so it is appropriate that the Senate today is able to debate an important and timely proposal for enhancing parliamentary scrutiny of Australia's intelligence and security agencies. I am very pleased to support this legislation—and on behalf of my colleagues as well—the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security Amendment Bill 2015, which is itself the legacy of another champion of parliamentary scrutiny and accountability, former Senator John Faulkner. I remember his words on that. This was a man who was a former defence minister and served not just his political party, the Australian Labor Party, but this country with distinction—a towering figure in the Senate. He made it very clear that, with increased power of our intelligence agencies, there must be increased levels of accountability.


This bill brings together a range of proposals designed to improve the operation of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, a joint statutory committee of the parliament that has been functioning in its present form since the passage of the Intelligence Services Act in late 2001. The bill seeks to broadly enhance the oversight of the Australian intelligence community by creating more substantive links between the joint committee and our other intelligence oversight agencies—the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security and the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor.


The bill's measures to remove current restraints on the membership of the joint committee are particularly welcome. If the process of parliamentary oversight over our intelligence and security agencies is to command public confidence, the joint committee must be more broadly representative of the make-up of the parliament and not just confined to members of the government and the opposition. The previous membership of the member for Denison, Mr Andrew Wilkie, in the period of the Gillard government from 2010 to 2013 has already demonstrated that crossbench members of the parliament can and should make valued contributions to the work of the joint committee.


The record of the joint committee has been productive but limited by the frequent bipartisan consensus between the coalition and Labor. And with it there is an element of secrecy and a lack of transparency in the process, more so than needs to be, even allowing for the sensitivity of the matters that are dealt with. On occasion the joint committee has got things quite wrong, most recently in the case of its report dealing with the secrecy provisions surrounding the conduct of special intelligence operations by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation—the amendments to section 35P of the ASIO Act. I voted against those provisions. They were something the joint committee said ought to be passed, but the change went to the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor, the Hon. Roger Giles AO QC, a former federal court judge and eminent lawyer and jurist. I made a submission to the inquiry. I do not think there were any other members of parliament who made a submission at that time. Professor Clinton Fernandes and I made a joint submission. Professor Clinton Fernandes is a professor at the University of New South Wales and at the ADFA campus here in Canberra.


This is what Mr Giles said after conducting the inquiry in relation to that in a summary of his report. He essentially stated that section 35P:


… creates uncertainty as to what may be published about the activities of ASIO without fear of prosecution. The so-called chilling effect of that uncertainty is exacerbated because it also applies in relation to disclosures made to editors for the purpose of discussion before publication.


He went on to say:


Journalists are prohibited from publishing anywhere at any time any information relating to an SIO—


a special intelligence operation—


regardless of whether it has any, or any continuing, operational significance and even if it discloses reprehensible conduct by ASIO insiders.


These were powerful words by the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor.


The issues identified by INSLM were that:


The basic problem with section 35P is that it does not distinguish between journalists and others (outsiders) and ASIO insiders. The application in this manner of broad secrecy prohibitions to outsiders is not satisfactorily justified, including by precedents in Australia or elsewhere.


Mr Giles also made this point:


Section 35P is arguably invalid on the basis that it infringes the constitutional protection of freedom of political communication. Section 35P is also arguably inconsistent with article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and so not in accordance with Australia's international obligations.


That piece of legislation slipped by the joint committee for which this bill seeks to have a more flexible membership arrangement. So that safeguard did not work on that occasion. The law was passed. It was put in force. It then was subject to a review by INSLM. Fortunately, there have been no prosecutions under section 35P, as I understand it. Also, fortunately, that is something that will be rectified by the government.


The subsequent report of the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor that I referred to made the weaknesses of the joint committee's review very clear, and the fact that there is further amending legislation before the Senate underlines the need for a more rigorous approach and a wider range of opinion represented on the joint committee.


The need for enhanced parliamentary scrutiny and oversight is clear. In the 15 years since the tragedies, the horrors, of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, a constant legislative drumbeat has accompanied what is commonly known as the war on terrorism. Successive governments and the parliament have repeatedly added to and elaborated our national security and counterterrorism laws. I note it was just yesterday that we commemorated the anniversary of the Bali bombings, where 202 innocent people, including 88 Australians, were killed by terrorists. The parliament has passed more than 70 different bills dealing with terrorism and, more broadly, national security issues. The exact number depends a bit on questions of definition, but the overall quantum of legislation is clear. We now have a very extensive and complex set of counterterrorism laws. As I have previously pointed out to the Senate, we have more counterterrorism laws than any other country. These laws are of great significance to national security and community safety, as well as to the rights, liberties and privacy of all Australians.


Back in October 2014, when the Senate was considering one of the long line of counterterrorism bills, I expressed the view that enough was enough and that we did not need more laws in this field and certainly should not enact greater powers for our intelligence and security agencies without a major expansion and strengthening of independent oversight of those agencies. That remains my broad view, subject of course to the overarching principle of community safety.


The record of our intelligence and security agencies in countering terrorism over the past 15 years is one of considerable success, thankfully. They have exercised the considerable investigative powers available to them and, in the process, thwarted many attacks on our soil and harm to Australians. Although the terrorist threat in Australia has not been on the same scale as in some other countries, it is significant, and serious threats and plots have been detected and thwarted. Our intelligence and security agencies have demonstrated considerable professionalism, but like all government agencies they are far from infallible. 


There also have been some very significant missteps. The case of Dr Muhamed Haneef involved the provision of incorrect and misleading information from British police counterterrorism investigators to the Australian Federal Police, which in turn failed to properly assess that information. A review by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security of the case of Mamdouh Habib found that the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation repeatedly failed to properly document key decisions, including dealings with foreign security and intelligence agencies. Senior officers subsequently claimed to have little or no recollection of key events. There have been instances where agencies have failed to provide appropriate information to the IGIS, and at least one case where an agency, the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, sought to intentionally mislead the IGIS.


 I would not wish to not pre-empt the findings of the inquiry by the New South Wales Coroner into matters relating to Man Haron Monis and the Martin Place siege of December 2014 and the tragic deaths of two innocent people, other than to say some of the evidence presented to the inquiry clearly raises serious concerns about the investigative and analytical capabilities of ASIO and the AFP as well as the operational response of the New South Wales police. I still cannot fathom why that man, that monster, was on the streets when he was, given his history.


Our intelligence and security agencies have very extensive powers and resources but are not infallible, and for that reason there needs to be very rigorous oversight and scrutiny. That is why this bill is both important and timely. It is a significant step towards a more rigorous scrutiny regime, more along the lines of the United States and German models of parliamentary intelligence committees, which have much more wide-ranging powers of review. In earlier debate on this legislation, one government senator suggested that greater parliamentary scrutiny, including the provision of highly classified IGIS reports to the joint committee 'may limit the voluntary provision of information by Australian intelligence community agencies to the inspector-general'. If this were really the case—and I doubt it would be so—then the need for rigorous parliamentary scrutiny would only be greater. In any case, if the United States intelligence community can operate effectively—and clearly it does—in the environment of oversight by the US Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the House of Representatives Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, then so too can the Australian intelligence community.


Significantly, I would highlight the scope of the US Senate committee's responsibilities, which include access to classified intelligence assessments and access to intelligence sources and methods, programs and budgets. By law, the US President is required to ensure the committee is kept 'fully and currently informed' of intelligence activities, including covert actions and any significant intelligence failure. Australia's intelligence agencies have long been deeply entwined with their US counterparts, and that is appropriate. It is time that we looked again at the greater extent of parliamentary scrutiny and oversight that characterises the intelligence system of our ally. This bill is a modest but important step in that direction. I am very pleased to lend my support, and that of my colleagues, to this bill, and I hope that this bill is passed in this place.

"Watt, Sen Murray",ALP,2016-10-13,"



Senator WATT
 (Queensland) (11:20):  I rise to speak on the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security Amendment Bill 2015. I note that this is not the first time that this bill has been debated in this place. It was restored to the Notice Paper after being introduced and debated in 2015. I want to acknowledge the contribution that other senators made to the debate of this bill in the last parliament. I also want to acknowledge the work of former senator John Faulkner in initiating the drafting of and consultation on this bill. Mr Faulkner's expertise and pursuit of the noble aims of this bill are well known. It is a pleasure and a privilege to speak on this bill, and in doing so I hope to help bring to fruition the task that former senator Faulkner set himself in bringing about these important reforms to the monitoring of the Australian intelligence community.


This bill seeks to give this parliament a stronger mechanism of oversight over Australia's intelligence and security agencies to ensure that, while their powers are necessarily increased to keep up with the demands of current security threats, their accountability to this parliament is not diminished. As former Senator Faulkner explained:


Parliament must strike a balance between our security imperatives and our liberties and freedoms. (The) Key to achieving this balance is strong and effective accountability. Enhanced powers demand enhanced safeguards. Public trust and confidence in our security and intelligence agencies can only be assured through strong and rigorous oversight and scrutiny.


Since the terror attacks that occurred on American soil on 11 September, 2001 our modern world has unfortunately lived in an age where terror attacks not only are real and possible but seem to becoming more frequent. I well remember 11 September 2001. As a young lawyer, I was working in Townsville in North Queensland at the time, working on an unfair dismissal case. We managed in the afternoon of 11 September to secure our client a very good result, and so I went to the pub and celebrated with some friends of mine who lived in Townsville at the time. The night got quite late, and I remember the TV screens at Molly Malones, where we were celebrating, had all of sudden flicked across to what seemed to be pretty crazy events of planes crashing into buildings in New York. It brought a very sober end to the night. I remember on the way home from that, talking to one of my friends and saying, 'That was pretty serious, wasn't it?' And we agreed it was. Of course, the world has gone on to see how serious these kinds of events have become ever since. 


Since that time, countries like Australia, which value democracy and human rights, have watched in horror as terrorist incidents have unfolded around the world. These incidents have caused us to fear attacks on us, whether it be when we are travelling overseas or even potentially at home. One of the most unfortunate aspects of this, apart from the terrible loss of human life that occurs in these attacks, is that terrorist attacks have been leapt upon by some politicians both in Australia and overseas as reasons to become suspicious of particular communities and to attempt to divide us. That is extremely sad to see. 


These terrorist threats are not far off foreign problems that stop beyond Australia's borders. Just this week, as other speakers have noted, we paused to remember the anniversary of the Bali bombings, where terrorists attacked crowded nightspots in Kuta Beach and 88 Australians lost their lives. Unfortunately, since 2001, as I say, these attacks have become more frequent, yet they are no less shocking or ruthless in their execution. Just this year we witnessed horrific attacks take place in Nice, in France, in Brussels, in Istanbul and among many other places around the world. Australians, when overseas in these sorts of places, do face real threats and, unfortunately, there have been similar incidents on Australian soil, albeit nowhere near as destructive as what we have seen overseas. So these threats are real, and it is the responsibility of this parliament to protect our country and to protect our people. Parliament is therefore tasked with enacting strong laws and ensuring that our intelligence and security organisations are given the necessary powers and resources that they need to ensure the security and safety of our citizens. 


There really is no greater responsibility for our parliament to uphold and there really is nothing more precious to protect than our democracy and our human rights. But protecting our country and protecting our citizens to the utmost degree does create an uneasy balance between keeping our country secure and valuing the human rights and freedoms that our democracy guarantees. There is nothing more counter-productive that we could do in attempting to prevent terrorists who are trying to send a message about our way of life and there is nothing more destructive and nothing more counter-productive that we could do than to overreach in our response to those incidents in the powers that we give our intelligence agencies to monitor our people and any other restrictions that we place on Australian citizens in order to secure our safety. If all we do is overreach and introduce draconian measures that restrict our population's freedoms and human rights then, in a sense, we have achieved what the terrorists themselves are seeking to achieve. So we do need to be extremely careful whenever we are considering increasing security precautions. This is because, as well as protecting our lives, this parliament's task is to provide protection to citizens which allow them to exercise their civil rights and liberties. In doing so, this parliament must act as a check and balance against the state itself. Parliament must also ensure that the public have full trust and confidence in our intelligence and security organisations and, as a result, that they have full trust and confidence in each Australian's ability to participate fully in an open and free democracy. So we must find a way to strike that balance—the right balance between creating laws that provide protection to Australians from terrorist threats but do not stifle core freedoms to the point where people have no protection from the state or its intelligence agencies. 


Today there are six intelligence agencies in the Australian intelligence community. These agencies are the keepers of strong powers, which include intelligence gathering and analysis. Four of these agencies undertake collection: ASIO, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, which is responsible to the Attorney-General; ASIS, the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, which collects foreign intelligence from human sources and is responsible to the Minister for Foreign Affairs; the ASD, the Australian Signals Directorate, formerly the DSD, which collects foreign signals intelligence, largely outside Australia. The ASD was given a legislative footing in 2001 and is responsible to the Minister for Defence. The AGO, the Australian Geospatial Organisation, collects geospatial intelligence from satellite imagery and other sources and is responsible to the Minister for Defence.


The other two agencies in the Australian intelligence community are analytical agencies. Firstly, the DIO, or the Defence Intelligence Organisation, which analyses the intelligence obtained by the Defence collection agencies and its overseas partners. And, secondly, the ONA, or the Office of National Assessments, which is established under its own act of parliament and is statutorily independent.


Australia is very fortunate to have agencies like these that work incredibly hard to meet their responsibilities professionally, thoroughly and with the utmost respect for our laws and security. I acknowledge the work and commitment of those agencies and note that this bill does not seek to diminish the powers or ability of those agencies to perform the important work they do. 


In recent times the parliament has enacted laws that increase powers granted to these agencies, and this bill does not seek to curtail those powers. However, as former Senator Faulkner said: 'Enhanced powers demand enhanced safeguards.' Currently, a range of mechanisms are available to scrutinise the Australian intelligence community. At the heart of these arrangements are the three pillars of oversight: ministerial responsibility, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security and the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. 


The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security is enshrined in the Intelligence Services Act 2001. That committee has a very important role. Its functions include: (a) to review the administration and expenditure of ASIO, ASIS, AGO, DIO, ASD and ONA, including the annual financial statements of those agencies; (b) to review any matter in relation to those agencies referred to the committee by the responsible minister or a resolution of either house of the parliament—and also their functions; and (c) to report the committee's comments and recommendations to each house of the parliament and to the responsible minister.


There are a number of restrictions on the committee's ability to review the actual intelligence gathered and/or assessments made by the agencies. As my colleagues in this chamber have mentioned today, this committee has been incredibly successful and is a very good example of bipartisanship, because we know that the protection of national security is a job for all parliamentarians.


What does this bill seek to do? At a time when the community is looking to the government and to the parliament to ensure that intelligence and security agencies have the powers they need, it is very important that the membership and functions of that parliamentary joint committee enable it to provide effective oversight. 


The purpose of this bill is to ensure that the adequacy and effectiveness of parliamentary oversight of intelligence and security agencies is in keeping with the development of the enhanced and additional powers we have afforded these agencies. The bill seeks to amend the Intelligence Services Act 2001, the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor Act 2010 and the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act 1986 to change the membership, powers and functions of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security.


I wish to briefly go over the measures this bill seeks to introduce. The bill removes current constraints on the membership of the parliamentary joint committee to provide that, except for a minimum representation of one government member and a senator and one opposition member and senator, the balance of the 11-member parliamentary joint committee can be drawn from either chamber. Currently, the Intelligence Services Act 2001 mandates a composition of six members and five senators on a parliamentary joint committee. Removing the current constraints will provide parliament with greater flexibility in determining its membership of the joint committee, but the bill does not amend the requirement for the government to hold a majority.


This provision is important because it means that senators can be equally represented on this committee. There is no reason why the House of Representatives needs to be disproportionally represented on this committee. As I have said previously, national security is a job for all parliamentarians, not just members of the House of Representatives. Again, to clarify, the bill does not amend the requirement for the government to hold the majority, but it does mean there are fewer constraints placed on the choice of members for the committee based on the chamber in which they sit.


There are a number of other amendments that this bill provides, and, in the interest of time, I will only very briefly refer to them. The bill also provides for the parliamentary joint committee to conduct own-motion inquiries after consultation with the responsible minister. It may be that matters come to the attention of the joint committee that equally require examination that the minister may not have necessarily considered such a priority, so I think it is a good move to give the committee the power to conduct inquiries on its own motion. 


The bill authorises the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor to provide the joint committee with a copy of any report on a matter referred to it by the committee. That is an important step to make sure that the joint committee stays informed of all developments on these matters. The bill requires the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security to give the joint committee a copy of any report provided to the Prime Minister or a minister within three months. 


The bill gives the joint committee the function of conducting pre-sunset reviews of legislation containing sunset provisions and adds the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor and the National Security Adviser to officers that are able to be consulted by the parliamentary joint committee. Again those two roles, the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor and the National Security Adviser, are obviously key to our intelligence community's response to developments, and it is important that the joint committee has the ability to consult those particular officers and inform its deliberations. These amendments are quite modest and process based, but they are very important.


In wrapping up, I just want to go back to some of the points that I made earlier in my speech. There is not one person in this parliament who disputes that one of our most important roles is to protect the safety of our people, but equally—and perhaps this reflects my background as a lawyer—I would place a very high premium on protecting the human rights and civil liberties of Australian citizens. Fortunately, in recent years we have not seen many examples of the abuse of these kinds of powers by our intelligence agencies, but it is important to make sure that our parliament does retain a bit of a check and balance on the actions of agencies that have such far-reaching and intrusive powers into our community. Perhaps it is a function of growing up as a child in Queensland in the Bjelke-Petersen era, when the Queensland government of the day had the Special Branch of the police force, which was essentially operating as a secret police service, spying on Queensland citizens, preparing files on them and conducting extremely intrusive investigations into Queensland citizens for no reason other than their political beliefs.


So it is vital that, if we are going to enhance the powers of our intelligence agencies in order to protect our safety, in parallel we have a responsibility to the Australian people to also enhance the powers of this parliament to oversight the actions of those intelligence communities. Australians—not just me but Australians generally, I think—place a very high premium on their freedoms and their human rights. They expect them to be protected, and it is incumbent upon us as members of parliament to make sure that those protections remain in place and are strengthened as the legislation which provides powers to our intelligence communities also expands. I think it is through that combination—the combination of providing our intelligence agencies with the powers that they need and also providing Australians with protections from the abuse of those kinds of powers—that we strike the right balance to protect Australians well into the future and make sure that all Australians remain safe from these terrible terrorist attacks that are becoming all too common right across the world.

"Hume, Sen Jane",LP,2016-10-13,"



Senator HUME
 (Victoria) (11:40):  I rise today to speak on the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security Amendment Bill, the PJCIS Amendment Bill 2015. This is a bill that proposes significant changes to the Intelligence Services Act 2001, the ISA. Firstly, it proposes to change the composition of the PJCIS. Secondly, this bill proposes to expand the powers and functions of the PJCIS by allowing the PJCIS to conduct a review into operational activities of the Australian intelligence agencies and the Australian Federal Police. It proposes to expand the powers and functions of the PJCIS by authorising the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor, the INSLM, to provide the PJCIS with a copy of any report on a matter referred to it by the PJCIS and requiring the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, the IGIS, to give the PJCIS a copy of any report provided to the Prime Minister or the minister within three months. The bill proposes allowing the PJCIS to conduct its own-motion inquiries, and it also proposes allowing the PJCIS to conduct pre-sunset review of legislation.


The government's position on this bill is not one of support. The well-regarded work that the PJCIS has conducted over many years is generally viewed as one of the most successful examples of effective bipartisanship throughout successive Australian parliaments. The PJCIS also has an impressive track record of conducting both insightful and thorough investigations. In light of these facts, the government is of the opinion that there is no need to amend the PJCIS's structure or powers.


Furthermore, the government has serious concerns about the content of this bill. Specifically, expanding the powers of the PJCIS will compromise the existing and appropriate divide between parliamentary and independent oversight by enabling own-motion inquiries and receipt of reports on operational activity from the IGIS. The government has serious concerns about the bill seeking to provide the PJCIS with powers, including operational oversight and pre-sunset legislative review, which would duplicate and overlap with those of the IGIS and  INSLM. The government has serious concerns that the bill does not provide adequate protection of operational activities, including methods and sources, to ensure any reviews that the PJCIS conducts, or any reports the INSLM or IGIS are required to provide to the PJCIS, do not prejudice the operational activities of the agencies and international relations.


The amendments this bill seeks to make are unnecessary, and they compromise the important distinction between the appropriate parliamentary oversight of the Australian Intelligence Community's administration, as outlined in the Intelligence Services Act 2001, and the operational oversight that is more appropriately performed by independent statutory roles such as the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security


For those of my colleagues who are not aware of the beginnings of the PJCIS, the committee has existed in its current form since the Inquiry into Australian Intelligence Agencies by Mr Philip Flood AO, known as the Flood inquiry, in 2004. Among his findings, Flood recommended that the membership of the existing Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD—the PJCAAD—should be extended to include the Defence Imagery and Geospatial Organisation, the DIGO, which has since been renamed the Australian Geospatial-Intelligence Organisation; the Defence Intelligence Organisation, the DIO; and the Office of National Assessments, the ONA. Following the passage of the Intelligence Services Legislation Amendment Bill in 2005, the committee was re-established as the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security—the PJCIS.


The functions of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security are outlined in the Intelligence Services Act 2001—the IS Act. Section 29 of the Intelligence Services Act provides that the functions of the committee are to:


review the administration and expenditure of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS), Australian Geospatial-Intelligence Organisation (AGO), Defence Intelligence Organisation (DIO), Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) and Office of National Assessments (ONA), including their annual financial statements


review any matter in relation to ASIO, ASIS, AGO, DIO, ASD or ONA referred to the Committee by the responsible Minister or a resolution of either House of the Parliament


monitor and to review the performance by the Australian Federal Police (AFP) of its functions under Part 5.3 of the Criminal Code (terrorism)


review, by 7 March 2018, the operation, effectiveness and implications of the following:


Division 3 of Part III of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 (ASIO questioning and detention powers)


Division 3A of Part IAA of the Crimes Act 1914 (police powers in relation to terrorist acts and terrorism offences)


Division 104 and 105 of the Criminal Code (control orders and preventative detention orders)


sections 119.2 and 119.3 of the Criminal Code (""declared area"" provisions)


review, by 13 April 2020, the mandatory data retention regime, as provided for under section 187N of the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979


review—for the sole purpose of assessing and making recommendations on the overall operation and effectiveness of the mandatory data retention regime—any matter that relates to the retained data activities of ASIO and is included in ASIO's annual report


review—for the sole purpose of assessing and making recommendations on the overall operation and effectiveness of the mandatory data retention regime—any matter that relates to the retained data activities of the AFP in relation to offences against Part 5.3 of the Criminal Code (terrorism) and is set out in the AFP's annual report on access to telecommunications data


review, by 1 December 2019, the operation, effectiveness and implications of sections 33AA, 35, 35AA and 35A of the Australian Citizenship Act 2007 (regarding the cessation of Australian citizenship) and any other provision of that Act as far as it relates to those sections; and


report the Committee's comments and recommendations to each House of the Parliament and to the responsible Minister.


Under section 102.1A of the Criminal Code, the Committee may also review any regulations made for the listing (or re-listing) of a ""terrorist organisation"" and report the Committee's comments and recommendations to each House of the Parliament before the end of the applicable disallowance period—a period of 15 sitting days after the regulation was laid before that House.


Further, the Committee may review and report on the declaration of any terrorist organisation for the purposes of section 35AA of the Australian Citizenship Act 2007.


The Committee is otherwise not authorised to initiate its own references, but may resolve to request the responsible Minister refer a particular matter to it for review.


Section 31 of the IS Act requires the Committee to prepare and table an Annual Report as soon as practicable after each year ending 30 June.


The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security has its limitations. The IS Act currently limits the inquiry powers of the PJCIS by providing that the functions of the committee do not include:


reviewing the intelligence gathering and assessment priorities of ASIO, ASIS, AGO, DIO, ASD or ONA;


reviewing the sources of information, other operational assistance or operational methods available to ASIO, ASIS, AGO, DIO, ASD or ONA;


reviewing particular operations that have been, are being or are proposed to be undertaken by ASIO, ASIS, AGO, DIO or ASD;


reviewing information provided by, or by an agency of, a foreign government where that government does not consent to the disclosure of the information;


reviewing an aspect of the activities of ASIO, ASIS, AGO, DIO, ASD or ONA that does not affect an Australian person;


reviewing the rules made under section 15 of the Act (to protect privacy of Australians);


conducting inquiries into individual complaints about the activities of ASIO, ASIS, AGO, DIO, ASD or ONA;


reviewing the content of, or conclusions reached in, assessments or reports made by DIO or ONA, or reviewing sources of information on which such assessments or reports are based


reviewing the coordination and evaluation activities undertaken by ONA


reviewing sensitive operational information or operational methods available to the AFP; or


reviewing particular operations or investigations that have been, are being or are proposed to be undertaken by the AFP.


These limitations are very important. They prevent inappropriate parliamentary influence being exercised over the operations, over the methodology and over the priority setting of the intelligence agencies. Responsibility for reviewing the operational activities of agencies is more appropriately given to the independent statutory role of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security.


The IGIS is responsible for overseeing and review of the Australian intelligence community in relation to its compliance with the law, compliance with ministerial directions and guidelines, proprietary and a respect for human rights. When exercising her inquiry function, the IGIS has significant powers, comparable to those of a royal commission—including obtaining information and requiring persons to answer questions and produce documents. The IGIS reports annually to parliament.


The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security proposes two main changes to the Intelligence Services Act 2001 regime. Firstly, the bill proposes changes to the composition of the PJCIS by removing the constraints on the membership of the PJCIS to provide that the balance of members can come from either chamber. Current requirements are that six come from the House of Representatives and five from the Senate. The bill also proposes introducing a requirement that the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Government in the Senate must be satisfied that members to be nominated to the PJCIS are the most appropriate members available.


Secondly, the bill proposes to expand the powers and functions of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security by allowing the PJCIS to conduct a review into operational activities of ASIO, ASIS, AGO, DIO, ASD, ONA and the Australian Federal Police. It would also authorise the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor, the INSLM, to provide the PJCIS with a copy of any report on a matter referred to it by the PJCIS and require the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security to give the PJCIS a copy of any report provided to the Prime Minister or the minister within three months. The bill would also allow the committee to conduct its own motion inquiries and allow the PJCIS to conduct pre-sunset review of legislation.


The amendments to this bill would blur the existing and appropriate divide between parliamentary and independent oversight and compromise the independence of existing overseeing bodies by proposing that the PJCIS receive direct reports from the IGIS on operational activities and that it could commence its own inquiries. The longstanding position in Australia is that operational overseeing of intelligence, security and law enforcement agencies is conducted by the overseeing independent statutory agencies, rather than by the parliament.


Currently the IGIS, which serves a crucial role in overseeing and ensuring accountability for the operational activities undertaken by our security agencies, only reports to ministers. It is important to note that the appropriateness of the overseeing of intelligence agencies by parliament was examined in the 2004 Flood inquiry. That inquiry found:


Just as the advice that officials provide to ministers is not disclosed in Senate Legislation Committee hearings, the judgments of assessment agencies should not be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. Opening assessments to scrutiny by parliament would also weaken the instinct amongst assessors to provide forthright advice for government, which is vital for good assessment.


The proposals duplicate and overlap with the roles of the IGIS and INSLM.


The bill would enable the PJCIS to conduct inquiries into legislation prior to a sunset date. This is an unnecessary duplication of the role of the INSLM, who has been granted powers that are tailored specifically to reviewing the operation, effectiveness and implications of Australia's national security legislation.


The bill would enable the committee to conduct its own review into the activities of intelligence agencies, provided the PJCIS has first consulted the responsible minister. This is an unnecessary duplication of the role of the IGIS. In 2014-15 the IGIS received an $840,000 increase in ongoing funding, allowing for the recruitment of additional staff to ensure effective oversight.


The current roles of the PJCIS, IGIS and INSLM ensure there is effective overseeing of the functioning of all aspects of Australia's security and intelligence agencies whilst minimising duplication and overlap. The current division also respects the appropriate divide between overseeing by parliament and independent agencies. The committee examines the administration and expenditure of all Australian intelligence community agencies, and the committee has only a very limited ability to inquire into operational activities.


The IGIS is responsible for oversight and review of the Australian intelligence community in relation to compliance with the law, compliance with ministerial directions and guidelines, propriety and respect for human rights. When exercising her inquiry function the IGIS has significant powers, comparable to those of a royal commission. The INSLM's role is to review the operation, effectiveness and implications of Australia's counterterrorism and national security legislation. This includes considering whether the laws contain appropriate safeguards for protecting the rights of individuals, that they remain proportionate to any threat of terrorism or threat to national security and remain necessary.


Should the committee be empowered to conduct its own reviews into the operational activities of the intelligence and security agencies, the bill does not provide adequate protection for operational activities, including methods and sources, to ensure reviews that the committee conducts, or any reports the INSLM or IGIS are required to provide to the committee, do not prejudice the operational activities of the agencies and international relations.


There is no demonstrated need for change. The PJCIS works well and has repeatedly demonstrated its ability to conduct insightful and thorough investigations. There is no demonstrated need to amend the PJCIS structure or powers. The government has referred each tranche of national-security-related legislation to the bipartisan PJCIS for review following its introduction into parliament, and has accepted every recommendation made by the committee. This consultative and collaborative approach has strengthened the transparency and accountability of our law enforcement and national security agencies.


This bill would only impose, at best, unnecessary changes. But at worst it would compromise the existing and appropriate divide between parliamentary and independent oversight. The risks that this bill poses have led to the government not supporting this bill and, similarly, I urge honourable senators not to support this bill in the chamber today.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2016-10-13,"



Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (11:59):  I rise today to speak on the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security Amendment Bill. This gives me cause to reflect on a few issues that were very present in my mind when I first entered this place back in 2008. In moving from the state legislature to the federal Senate, I was very self-aware about the fact that as a member of the government, a government backbencher, I would become part of and complicit with some significant decisions on things like sending troops to war, the surveillance of citizens, our civil liberties and the arbitrary detention of people. These were issues that weighed very heavily on my mind then and they are issues I take very seriously today. So when my colleagues put it to me that there is something not quite right and not yet quite good enough about how our parliamentary oversight of these matters is conducted and managed, I take that very seriously.


I know that these amendments are just adjustments in the way we currently operate; but they are important adjustments and they were put forward by no less than former Senator John Faulkner, who himself has reflected very carefully on these issues. What is proposed is the removal of the current constraints on the membership of the committee to provide that except for a minimum representation of one government member and senator and one opposition member and senator the balance of the 11 members of the committee can be drawn from either chamber. The current rules on who is eligible to be a member are fairly arbitrary in terms of saying we have this many from this chamber and that many from that chamber. That does not give the Labor Party, which takes this matter very seriously—or, for that matter, other parties—the capacity to appoint the people who are best placed to scrutinise these issues.


When you have six members and five senators, that is a very arbitrary thing to do. So it is important that this parliament has more flexibility in determining the membership of this joint committee. It will allow for the joint committee to be made up of members who are more expert in this field, without the constraint of whether they are a member or a senator. For example, I remember discussing with my new colleague Anne Aly MP, the member for Cowan, the fact that, while she has considerable expertise in this area, it is very difficult for her to get a position on the committee—because, by the time you put the shadow defence minister on the committee, or the Leader of the Opposition or others who are also a priority, there is no room left for her to be on the committee. So perhaps someone in the Labor Party might like to make a decision that a Labor senator might be able to give up their place for someone like Anne Aly. These constraints also mean that our shadow Attorney-General, the Honourable Mark Dreyfus, has been unable to serve on the committee because of the limited number of positions available to opposition members of the House of Representatives. So having more flexible membership provisions, without affecting the political balance of the committee, would enable the committee to benefit from this experience and expertise.


As previous senators have noted, this bill does not amend the requirement for the government to hold a majority on the committee. As a senator who has been a member of a number of committees and a chair of a committee, I think I am in a good position to reflect on the operation of committees. We are constantly faced with leading to deliberate on and renew our sense of how we balance our decision-making and deal with important national issues. We need to ensure that we connect in this place good decision-making to proper processes that scrutinise all avenues and outcomes of legislation.


The bill provides the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security capacity to conduct its own motions and inquiries after consultation with the responsible minister. I certainly think this is an important provision. When there is public debate about issues such as arbitrary intention or the quality of the intelligence that the parliament and the committee are receiving, there may not always be alignment between the views of the committee and the views of the minister. That means if a committee wants to interrogate those issues further they really need to be able to say to the minister: 'There is an important national security issue at stake here. It is time for us to be able to look more deeply into these issues.' This is an important extension but an essential one to enhance the oversight role of this committee.


This would bring the parliamentary joint committee in line with equivalent parliamentary committees in the US and the UK, which already have this power. But here in the Australian parliament our legislatures have, comparatively speaking, handed more power to government and more power to the agencies, while our parliamentary committees have been relatively more constrained in their capacity for scrutiny. In 2013 the UK's Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament was reformed by the passage of the Justice and Security Act 2013. So we now need to be able to keep up with these international movements.



The PRESIDENT:  The time for the debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:08):  I indicate that the Greens will support that amendment, though I also give notice that I will be moving an amendment, which has already been circulated in my name, to the motion that the report be adopted. The amendment provides that the Criminal Code Amendment (War Crimes) Bill 2016 be referred to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by the first sitting day of 2017.


We attempted last night to refer this bill to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee. The reasons for referral are grave. We are astonished that the committee did not support it, because we think this bill has changes that deserve public scrutiny. We are unaware of any consideration of this bill in public and we understand that the last time the war crimes offences incorporated in domestic criminal law were amended was in 2002.


The changes proposed in this bill seriously alter the governance of ADF personnel in combat and change the definition of a war crime. This is an issue that has just recently broken as a story on radio, with the internal Defence inquiry into potential war crimes on foot at present. This is a highly charged, complex topic and there is a need to hear from the ADF about why such changes are needed and what actions they are trying to take that are being prevented by existing war crimes legislation. Parliament should have a greater role in debating the use of military force and the implications of those deployments. These are some of the most important decisions a nation can make, and that is what parliament should be for.


Australian forces operate under much more stringent rules of engagement than many of our allies, including the US. Anything that creates a risk of changing that needs to be carefully scrutinised. The announcement is also of concern since the Criminal Code was developed to reflect international law, and the extent to which Australia is following a dangerous precedent, set by the US, to expand international law's permissiveness around targeted killing must be explored. We also feel it is necessary to determine exactly what constraints the Australian Defence Force believes exists and who is in the list of persons not involved in hostilities, including civilians, medical personnel or religious personnel who not taking an active part in hostilities. Recent counterterrorism and national security views do not consider war crimes offences.


It is also of grave concern that proposed amendments did not arise from the recommendations of various recent reviews of national security and counterterrorism legislation and in fact appear to be materially different to the recommendations made by both the former INSLM and the COAG review of counterterrorism laws in 2013. We are aware of grave concerns about this bill from experts on the ground in actual war zones and protracted conflicts around the world in which we are implicated. This involves the International Committee of the Red Cross and Medecins San Frontieres.


For these reasons we strongly implore the government and the opposition to allow a full, thorough, public review of this legislation, and we believe the most appropriate committee therefore is the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee.



The PRESIDENT:  The question before the chair now is that the amendment moved by Senator Gallagher be agreed to.


Question agreed to.




Senator SIEWERT:
  I move:


At the end of the motion, add ""and in respect of the Criminal Code Amendment (War Crimes) Bill 2016 the provisions of the bill be referred immediately to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by first sitting day of 2017"".

 (Australian Capital Territory—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (12:08):  I move:


At the end of the motion, add ""and, in respect of the provisions of the Criminal Code Amendment (Firearms Trafficking) Bill 2016, the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee report by 7 November 2016"".

",Senate,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,COMMITTEES,4,2
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2016-10-13,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:08):  I indicate that the Greens will support that amendment, though I also give notice that I will be moving an amendment, which has already been circulated in my name, to the motion that the report be adopted. The amendment provides that the Criminal Code Amendment (War Crimes) Bill 2016 be referred to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by the first sitting day of 2017.


We attempted last night to refer this bill to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee. The reasons for referral are grave. We are astonished that the committee did not support it, because we think this bill has changes that deserve public scrutiny. We are unaware of any consideration of this bill in public and we understand that the last time the war crimes offences incorporated in domestic criminal law were amended was in 2002.


The changes proposed in this bill seriously alter the governance of ADF personnel in combat and change the definition of a war crime. This is an issue that has just recently broken as a story on radio, with the internal Defence inquiry into potential war crimes on foot at present. This is a highly charged, complex topic and there is a need to hear from the ADF about why such changes are needed and what actions they are trying to take that are being prevented by existing war crimes legislation. Parliament should have a greater role in debating the use of military force and the implications of those deployments. These are some of the most important decisions a nation can make, and that is what parliament should be for.


Australian forces operate under much more stringent rules of engagement than many of our allies, including the US. Anything that creates a risk of changing that needs to be carefully scrutinised. The announcement is also of concern since the Criminal Code was developed to reflect international law, and the extent to which Australia is following a dangerous precedent, set by the US, to expand international law's permissiveness around targeted killing must be explored. We also feel it is necessary to determine exactly what constraints the Australian Defence Force believes exists and who is in the list of persons not involved in hostilities, including civilians, medical personnel or religious personnel who not taking an active part in hostilities. Recent counterterrorism and national security views do not consider war crimes offences.


It is also of grave concern that proposed amendments did not arise from the recommendations of various recent reviews of national security and counterterrorism legislation and in fact appear to be materially different to the recommendations made by both the former INSLM and the COAG review of counterterrorism laws in 2013. We are aware of grave concerns about this bill from experts on the ground in actual war zones and protracted conflicts around the world in which we are implicated. This involves the International Committee of the Red Cross and Medecins San Frontieres.


For these reasons we strongly implore the government and the opposition to allow a full, thorough, public review of this legislation, and we believe the most appropriate committee therefore is the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee.



The PRESIDENT:  The question before the chair now is that the amendment moved by Senator Gallagher be agreed to.


Question agreed to.




Senator SIEWERT:
  I move:


At the end of the motion, add ""and in respect of the Criminal Code Amendment (War Crimes) Bill 2016 the provisions of the bill be referred immediately to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by first sitting day of 2017"".


Question negatived.

That the order of the Senate of 21 March 2002 restricting photography in the Senate chamber ceases to have effect on and from 28 November 2016.


Question agreed to.



The PRESIDENT:  Just for clarity, what the motion has in effect done is repeal the order of continuing effect in the standing orders, No. 26. This will take effect from 28 November this year. By way of the media rules governing the media rules in the entire parliament, which the Speaker and I have joint responsibility for, rule No. 5.7 will be amended. In fact, it will be deleted because that also reflects what is in the Senate standing orders of continuing effect, which will then put the Senate in complete alignment with the House of Representatives for media rules. I want to make sure that is the effect of the motion, because your particular motion was not specific. Unless I hear anything to the contrary, that is the effect that will take place on 28 November.

Senator GRIFF
 (South Australia) (12:42):  This is not my first speech. I rise to speak very briefly on this package of reforms and to indicate the Nick Xenophon Team's in-principle support for this package. Establishing a national register should go a long way towards reducing duplication and unnecessary red tape across jurisdictions and, more importantly, assisting with the management of bowel and cervical cancer screening programs.


These bills, the National Cancer Screening Register Bill 2016 and the National Cancer Screening Register (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2016, certainly have not been without criticism, but this is less to do with the underlying policy objectives and more to do with the contentious nature of the tender process that preceded them. The fact that the government chose to enter into a $220 million contract with Telstra Health prior to the passage of the enabling legislation demonstrates a complete disregard for the important role of this place in the legislative process and in ensuring transparency and accountability. Given the nature of the data that will be maintained in the national register, there are a multitude of privacy considerations that ought to have been considered before the awarding of the tender, particularly when the tenderer is a non-government entity. These criticisms, amongst others, have to a large extent formed the basis of the inquiry by the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee. That committee process has certainly been worthwhile in fleshing out these concerns. At the very least, we now have a redacted contract that we can also refer to for further consideration and clarification.


In terms of amendments, the opposition has indicated it intends to proceed with its proposal to restrict the operation of the register to a government agency or not-for-profit organisation. It claims Telstra Health does not have the requisite expertise to adequately manage the sort of sensitive data that would be kept on the register. I indicate for the record that the Nick Xenophon Team will not be supporting that proposal. However, I indicate that my colleague Senator Xenophon will also be moving a second reading amendment aimed at addressing at least some of the concerns around the tender process. That amendment will not prevent the passage or implementation of the bill but it will request that the Auditor-General undertake a review that looks at issues of value for money and efficiency in the contract. It is important to point out that the amendment does not require the minister to direct the Auditor-General—and the advice I have is that it is quite appropriate for the parliament to refer matters—

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (15:04):  I have additional information to provide in relation to two questions I was asked earlier in the week. Yesterday Senator Sterle asked me questions without notice regarding the resignation of Mr Brian Martin as Royal Commissioner into the Child Protection and Youth Detention Systems of the Northern Territory. As I said in my press conference on Monday, 1 August, and as I told the chamber yesterday, Mr Martin told me on the morning of Saturday, 30 July, of his wish to resign. The transcript of my press conference, which has been online since 1 August 2016, the day of the press conference, begins with me saying that. The original transcript, issued by my office, was drawn from a live captions service, tveeder, which did not include the opening remarks of the press conference. When my office was made aware of the fact, the full audio was immediately checked, and the transcript was amended and published online. As I said, it has been online since 1 August.


I can also confirm that, following Mr Martin's indication to me on the Saturday morning of his wish to resign, the Administrator of the Commonwealth, in Executive Council attended by Senator McGrath and me on the afternoon of 1 August, revoked Mr Martin's letters patent as royal commissioner and issued letters patent to Justice Margaret White and Mr Mick Gooda to serve as royal commissioners.


As well, on Tuesday Senator Gallacher asked me about consultation with Mr Mick Gooda, and I provided certain information to the Senate. As well as that, at my request, one of my senior advisers, Dr Susan Cochrane, also contacted Mick Gooda and spoke to him for approximately 45 minutes in order to seek his views, and she reported those views to me. So Mr Gooda was consulted both by me and, at greater length, by Dr Cochrane.

Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (15:08):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Attorney-General (Senator Brandis) to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today relating to the Solicitor-General.


I am sure the government senators are really surprised at that statement. I would like to thank the Attorney for the answers he did give us today, because I learnt much from those answers. I was very pleased to find out that there is actually a book that talks about the role of the Solicitor-General, and that will be on my reading list automatically, I think. There was also a reference to collected speeches from Mark Dreyfus, which are already on my reading list in terms of the process. I do take a lot of interest in the various speeches made by Mark Dreyfus and, indeed, prefaces to books—




Senator Brandis:
  Madam Deputy President, a point of order. I have the greatest respect for Senator Moore's respect for the Senate, but she does appear to be mocking Mr Dreyfus now, and I wonder whether that constitutes a reflection. 



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  It does not. 




Senator MOORE:
  I reject that point of order, and I will continue with my deep respect for at least one person involved in this debate, which is the shadow Attorney-General. I was also particularly interested in having some information about the independence of barristers. I had not actually had that information before, so I thank the Attorney for that. 


I think most of the issue relates to the statement constantly repeated by the Attorney that there can be differences of opinion amongst people with legal qualifications. No-one doubts that. In fact, you only have to be in this place for a short time to see that there will be, can be and often are differences of opinion between people with legal qualifications, but that was not the point of the questions. In terms of the process, the opposition was exploring issues around the legislation, which has been brought before us, that looks at the role of the Solicitor-General, and also the opinions that have been brought forward by a person who previously held that position. Whilst we know that there will be further debate on this process, particularly tomorrow in the legal and constitutional committee inquiry into this legislation, I think it is important to note that the issues we were raising are not so much about a difference of opinion but actually about the process leading up to the introduction of this legislation. 


We do not doubt that the Attorney, the leader of the government in this place, has every right to have differences of opinion on information that comes forward. What we do say and what we question—and there was a specific question about the relationship between the Attorney and the Solicitor-General—is that there must be some understanding of the deep respect for that role. This is the point that has been brought forward. In terms of the Attorney's relationship with the Solicitor-General, there must be not only a private understanding of a strong legal respect but also a public understanding that these two senior legal officers in our system have respect for each other and the views they put forward. Never, never was there any intent to say that they had to have the same opinion. 


Certainly through the answers to this place over the previous few days a key issue around consultation has arisen. When the Attorney was bringing forward the legislation into the Senate on the way that opinions by the Solicitor-General may be taken by members of the government and the very important aspect of that role, the issue was whether the current Solicitor-General had been given the respect of appropriate consultation on that decision. Answers were made and there will be a process taking place tomorrow. For me, one of the core aspects has been the ongoing public discussion around how the Attorney and the Solicitor-General interact. That was the core issue in terms of what the opposition has been asking over the last few days. And today's answers by the Attorney actually bring me no closer to any understanding of what this relationship is. It is not about having different opinions; it is about having an effective working relationship based on respect. So, in terms of the questions we asked today, we brought forward the opinion of a previous Solicitor-General on what the impact of this legislation would be. I know that the Attorney—not to a question on this particular issue—did refer to some language as being 'flamboyant'. I think the statements that were made by the previous Solicitor-General did tend to be flamboyant as well, but he clearly made the point that should the changes be made the role, the focus, the integrity and the status of the Solicitor-General could be impeded. In fact, in his opinion it would be impeded. It is important in this place that we understand what the exact relationship is— (Time expired)

Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (15:14):  We saw it all today; we saw it all yesterday and we have seen it all week—a huge lack of imagination on the part of the Australian Labor Party in the Australian Senate. All week, they tried, hopelessly and unsuccessfully—and I will come to why 'unsuccessfully' in a brief moment—to prosecute the most spurious of arguments against the Attorney-General.


You are right; they could have been focusing on issues of substance, rising consumer confidence in the economy. They could have been talking about industrial disputation in the construction sector and why industrial relations reform, which this Senate will debate in a few weeks' time, is important. They could have discussed a whole variety of issues—but, no. They started on a course of action that failed this afternoon with Senator Brandis's revelation that Mark Dreyfus is guilty of grand hypocrisy.


So let's start at the beginning. I have great respect for Senator Moore, but Senator Moore's suggestion that this is actually not about contestability and legal advice and that this is actually not about whether or not the Attorney-General is free to get other sources of legal advice—that is exactly what this issue is about. And why do we know that? Because that is how Mark Dreyfus started the argument on 7 October. 


Let me read from Mr Dreyfus's media statement of 7 October. To make it easy for you, I will start with the title: Brandis opinion shopping another sign of government dysfunction'. Mr Dreyfus uses some very, very colourful language. He says:


… that Attorney-General Senator George Brandis has been 'opinion shopping' for legal advice goes to the heart of concerns about the failure of Senator Brandis to work with Australia's second law officer …


And I will come in a moment to why that is not true. It goes on to say:


The job of the Solicitor-General is to provide legal advice to the government, to government ministers and to Heads of Department. Senator Brandis has clearly hobbled the ability of the Solicitor-General to do his job …


This is not true, and I will come to why that is in a moment. He goes on to say:


Senator Brandis' failure to consult the Solicitor-General breaks a century-long tradition of Attorneys-General and Solicitors-General working together on Commonwealth legal matters. 


These are big grand statements from Mr Dreyfus. Finally, he goes on to say that the Attorney-General needs to explain: 


… why he is not seeking the advice of the Solicitor-General on issues of public importance … Senator Brandis has failed to consult the one person that he is expected to consult for legal advice. 


This is not true—not true.


Today, Senator Brandis ended the week with a king hit against the Labor Party and its senators and their appallingly useless, futile efforts to brand Senator Brandis as a failure in his role as the chief legal officer of the nation. In contrast, Senator Brandis is an outstanding Attorney-General for this Commonwealth. 


Let's get to the core of the issue. What is Mr Dreyfus's real view about opinion shopping? Do not ask me. Do not even ask the Labor senators on the other side. Let's ask Mr Dreyfus himself. There it is for the world to see on page 174 of the book by Professor Gabrielle Appleby, The role of the solicitor-general. You just have to go a little way down the page. For those of us that can read English, it is easy to see; it is crystal clear. It says:


Some former Attorneys-General indicated that they were willing to seek alternative legal opinions where they disagreed with the Solicitor-General's advice …


They 'were' willing to seek other advice—what Mr Dreyfus would call 'opinion shopping'. Then it says:


Similarly, Mark Dreyfus indicated that the Solicitor-General's advice was given a high status within government … Nonetheless, he—


Mr Dreyfus—


would, occasionally, seek another legal opinion. He explained that he might seek another opinion on particularly important political issues—


Mr Dreyfus says—


""Or two. Or three. Perhaps I might feel I needed two to outweigh the Solicitor-General's advice, and I would go and get very senior advice. And I've done that. And I would do it again …""



Mr Dreyfus is accusing Senator Brandis of things he has done himself in the past and that he believes are totally respectable and credible. The idea that there should not be contestability around important legal advice that governs the affairs of the Commonwealth is just ridiculous. (Time expired)

"Gallacher, Sen Alex",ALP,2016-10-13,"



Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (15:19):  Over the last 44 years, there have been 17-odd Attorneys-General, and there are some pretty august names in there: Gough Whitlam QC, Lionel Murphy QC, Kep Enderby QC, Sir Ivor Greenwood QC, Bob Ellicott QC, Senator Peter Durack QC, Senator Gareth Evans QC, Lionel Bowen, Michael Duffy, Duncan Kerr, Michael Lavarch, Darryl Williams QC, Philip Ruddock, Robert McClelland, Nicola Roxon, Mark Dreyfus QC and Senator George Brandis QC. Out of those 44-year history of the Australian Parliament, only one Attorney-General has had the capacity to actually be the story. Only one Attorney-General has an uncanny ability—as journalist Mark Kenny says—to put himself in the dock, not anybody else.' 


All week there have been questions about whether he has handled the public statements properly, where there has been contestability about who said this and Senator Brandis said that. It is amazing. Whether it is the building of a bookshelf for his office, creative use of entitlements—the allegations are all in the public and media—the story is Senator Brandis. Whether it is his description of the Hon. John Howard, the most successful Liberal Prime Minister in this country's history, as a lying rodent', always the story is Senator Brandis. 


The tragedy is: the Attorney General should be above all of this. The Attorney-General should be looking after the constitutional issues and the important legal mechanisms that make this great democracy function. They should not be the story. We should not have an Attorney-General, proclaiming across the floor of the Senate, that everybody has a right to be a bigot. That is not a considered approach. He might well be entitled to do that, but in my humble opinion our Attorney-General should be looking for the things that will bring us together and not the things that will tear us apart.


When he gave the answer to Senator Peris that 'everybody has a right to be a bigot', Senator Brandis became the story for that news cycle. The commentariat spent an inordinate amount of time discussing the rights and the ins and outs of all that, and I do not think it brought anything to his role as Attorney-General, and it certainly did not do our constitutional respect any good.


So the capacity to be the story is, as Mark Kenny states in The Sydney Morning Herald, an uncanny ability, and our Attorney-General has continually demonstrated his capacity to be the story. With the Northern Territory royal commission, trying to deal with that awful situation up there, the story became who said what and when. With the shackling of the Solicitor-General's office in terms of approach to advice, the story is who said what and when. At the forefront of all of this is our Attorney-General's capacity to be the story—not for the issues to get resolved and not for proper progress to be made in important legal areas but, once again, for Senator Brandis to be the story. He has displayed this uncanny knack.


In the last 40-odd years, among those 17-odd attorneys-general, there have been many colourful characters, divisive characters, people of very strong political opinions and people who have articulated arguments about their positions held and their positions carried out. But no-one in that list—and I can probably go back to 1972 and look at those attorneys-general—really demonstrated this extraordinary capacity to be the story. That is very unfortunate, because Senator Brandis is approaching three years and 24 days as the Attorney-General. Serving for seven years and 210 days was Daryl Williams QC, who would be the least known of attorneys-general. He was the longest serving, at seven years and 210 days.




Senator Brandis:
  No, he was not. He was not the longest serving. The longest serving was William Morris Hughes.




Senator GALLACHER:
  Well, in my information here he served for seven years and 210 days. But my point, I suppose, is that people on that list have done their jobs to the best of their ability and been as political as they can, but they have not been the story, and their credibility has not been the story. On that point I will rest.

Senator PATERSON
 (Victoria) (15:24):  Well, here we are again: day 4 of the most wet-lettuce opposition Senate attack I have seen in my short career and, I am sure, for many years before that in this place. It is day 4 of avoiding all major policy issues that this country faces. It is day 4 of pursuing the Attorney-General in what some may characterise—I would say fairly—as an obsession. So I was most amused in Senate question time today to hear the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate in fact imply that the opposite is the case and that the Attorney-General is obsessed with his shadow counterpart, Mr Dreyfus, the member for Higgins—sorry, I correct myself: the member for Isaacs. He is just a resident of Higgins. The member for Isaacs is in fact, I think on the evidence, obsessed with the Attorney-General, not the reverse, and the entire opposition seems to be affected by and to share this obsession, because in almost every question on every day this week, and with every motion to take note of answers after question time this week, we have dwelt yet again on this issue of the Solicitor-General. This might have been a reasonable issue to pursue for one day, or even two if they were really passionate about it and really interested in the intricacies of the relationship between the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General, but to be continuing to talk about this issue, to the exclusion of almost all other issues—and, frankly, more meaty, weighty policy issues which affect the interests of their constituents—I think constitutes an obsession.


As Senator Brandis said, though, brownie points go to Senator Urquhart for taking up a policy issue in the last question of the week, the last question of question time today, the question of wind farms. I was saddened to hear, though, as a former fellow member of the Environment and Communications Committee, her lack of concern about herds in relation to wind farms. But I am sure that is not a reflection of her lack of concern for the environment and animals more generally.


In question time today, we had Senator O'Neill, senator for New South Wales, stand up and ask a question about the Solicitor-General. She could have asked, as my colleague Senator Duniam did, about counter-terrorism raids taking place in her home state. That might be of interest to her constituents. I suggest, if you ran an opinion poll, it would probably be of more concern than the Solicitor-General. We had Senator Farrell, senator for South Australia, asking about the Solicitor-General. I suspect his constituents are more interested in the fact that they had no power for 24 hours—that their power system entirely failed under a Labor government of some 14 years that he has had some hand in. But no; he would prefer to pursue the issue of the Solicitor-General. We had our new Senate colleague Senator Chisholm from Queensland ask a question about the Solicitor-General. I suspect, again, that his constituents might be more interested in the partnership with Singapore cemented this week, which Senator Macdonald asked about and which will be of tangible benefit and interest to his constituents, particularly in the north of Queensland, where a number of bases will be enhanced in a joint relationship with Singapore. We could have asked about that issue, but we did not.


This issue has been well ventilated and well explained. But I have to say I am pleased that we have gone into the fourth day of this issue, because it has unearthed a very timely publication, I must say, by Professor Appleby—and full congratulations to her and her publishers on getting such a timely publication out just very recently, to precede this debate. We heard in a media release from Mr Dreyfus on 7 October that it is a shocking practice to engage in what he describes as 'opinion shopping for legal advice'—that is, seeking alternative legal advice to that of the Solicitor-General. Without having delved into Mr Dreyfus's role as Attorney-General, I would have thought that it would be an entirely reasonable thing to rely on more than just one person for legal advice. The Solicitor-General is an eminent lawyer, but he is not God. His views on law are no doubt worth seeking, but not to the exclusion of all others. As it happens, it turns out it is not just the current Attorney-General who has that view and that belief; it is also a distinguished previous Attorney-General—a short-serving one, to take up Senator Gallacher's point, but an Attorney-General nonetheless: Mr Dreyfus, who himself said in an interview with Professor Appleby in her recently published book:


Perhaps I might feel I needed two to outweigh the Solicitor-General's advice, and I would go and get very senior advice. And I've done that. And I would do it again. Because, despite the fact that I say that the Solicitor-General has got higher status, she or he is still just a barrister. And, most difficult legal problems are capable of another outcome. I mean, if I've learnt [anything] in my legal career, I've learnt that.


Well, I suggest that Mr Dreyfus has a little bit more to learn in his legal career, and I hope we see evidence of that soon.

Senator CHISHOLM
 (Queensland) (15:29):  What we have seen today is really a continuation of what we have seen from Senator Brandis since the dispute with the Solicitor-General first started, and that is a consistent effort to be tricky with his answers. I think we need to look at where this is all heading for the Attorney-General. In my view, it is a descent by the Attorney-General into a real Donald Trump view of the world. What goes on in the locker room—I am not talking about the locker room here; that is another matter for Trump. I do not know what happens in the Attorney-General's locker room. What I am referring to here is an effort from Trump, like what we are seeing from the Attorney-General, to suggest facts do not matter. They are creating their own world views of how they operate and how they answer their questions.


Let's go through the pattern of what we saw today and what we have seen since this first became an issue. Since the Solicitor-General's statements last week, the Attorney-General and other government members have simply doubled down on their misleading statements, which are clearly at odds with the acknowledged course of events. Senator Brandis is continuing to deny the sky is blue and is setting a very bad example both as Attorney-General and as Leader of the Government in the Senate. The answers the Attorney-General gave today—indeed, all this week—leave a lot to be desired.


Misleading parliament is not the only worrisome part of this whole sordid affair. There is the continued procedural bungling by the Attorney-General who is clearly not across his brief. Let's look at the history of some of those issues. First there were the proposed changes to section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act, where the Attorney-General infamously said, 'You have a right to be a bigot.' The Attorney-General did a real good job there of building community opposition to that one. Let's not forget the poorly-treated President of the Human Rights Commission, Professor Gillian Triggs, and the inability of the Attorney-General to maintain that relationship. You can see a real pattern of events occurring here. Then there was the claim to have consulted with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, Mr Mick Gooda, before establishing the Don Dale royal commission, when no such consultation occurred. Now there are the false claims to have consulted the Solicitor-General on the proposed changes that would effectively reduce the quality of the advice that the government receives.


Yesterday, we saw this bungling spread to the other side of the parliament as well. Yesterday, for the first time in the history of Federation, an opposition second reading amendment was carried in the House. This was not the government's plan; the government simply forgot which way they were supposed to be voting. This is what I am saying: this is the pattern of what we are seeing from the government. The Attorney-General is supposed to be a leader, and this is what is happening under his watch. This means the House of Representatives passed a unanimous resolution about how bad the government is on multinational tax avoidance.


While we are talking about the Attorney-General's slippery story, let's not forget the desperate power grab at the core of this. Do not take my word for it; what does the former Solicitor-General Dr Gavan Griffith, who was in the role for 14 years, have to say about the proposed changes? He says 'the result will be the demeaning of the office to the equivalent of attracting monkeys.' This is from the former Solicitor-General Gavan Griffith, who was in the role for 14 years. He went on to say:


A government of integrity should not shirk from obtaining disinterested peak advice of integrity from its SG. It should not shop around, or even refrain from obtaining the second law officer’s advice on matters where is suspects the advice may be contra the government’s preferences.


At a time when this bumbling government cannot even run a parliament properly, it should be taking all the independent advice it can get.


I come back to my important point about the Trump world view and how this fits into it for the Attorney-General. What we have seen is the unravelling of this strategy from Donald Trump in America, where he has been trying to operate in a post facts world. That is clearly starting to do him damage. I think what we have seen from the Attorney-General over the last couple of weeks as he has had to answer questions on this is a similar thing occurring. My advice to the Attorney-General is that he needs to start being honest in this parliament and answer the questions properly. The trickiness must stop. It is important for the Attorney-General to front up and answer the questions.


Question agreed to.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (16:22):  The Greens initiated this inquiry into the joint strike fighters. It was a most enlightening Senate inquiry into a $60 billion procurement program by the Department of Defence into the joint strike fighter. Four words that would best encapsulate this acquisition of the joint strike fighters would be 'too big to fail'. The words of President Dwight D Eisenhower were very clear to me during the inquiry. In fact, I have a copy of the quote which I read to one of the witnesses from Lockheed Martin in the US who had flown in. It said:


Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper together.


That is only part of the quote from President Eisenhower, but he went on to warn about the risks of the military industrial complex if it is not properly scrutinised and policed.


I think if there was ever a case study of what not to do with a military procurement and how not to go about spending taxpayer moneys on our defence it would be this joint strike fighter program. Another quote says that the F35 program:


… is actually not on a path towards success, but instead on a path towards failing to deliver the full Block 3F capabilities, for which the department is paying almost USD400 billion …


That is $400 billion of US taxpayers' money. It has been spent essentially on one major company, Lockheed Martin, and a number of smaller suppliers. That quote is from Michael Gilmore, the US defense department's director of operational testing, only a few months ago. In fact, it is from August 2016. So it was after our inquiry wrapped up going into the double dissolution.


Defence procurement is often characterised by large numbers and opaque decision making. The reason it is important to scrutinise this joint strike fighter acquisition is that we have the biggest defence procurement program of submarines about to hit our shores—pardon the pun! They are coming very shortly. We need to be very, very careful about how that money is spent, and we need to learn from this joint strike fighter acquisition. 


Even by our standards, Australia's planned acquisition of 72 F35A joint strike fighters stands out for its cost and time overruns and lack of a backup plan. When even US testing authorities are uncertain whether the aircraft will be fit for service, the basis for the enthusiasm shown by Australian defence officials—all documented in this report—deserves greater scrutiny.


The Greens cannot support the majority recommendations in this report. It seems entirely likely that Australia will eventually be forced to follow Canada's lead and leave the joint strike fighter program and reassess its options rather than simply insisting that there is no plan B to these joint strike fighters.


The report makes for compelling reading. In particular, chapter 3 sets out the setbacks and the challenges that have beset this program since its inception. There are meant to be systems in place to prevent such debacles from occurring; however, they have occurred. This program has been beset by a litany of problems and serious issues. These were covered at length during the inquiry. They have been acknowledged in the report. The chair's report rightly concludes that it cannot draw definitive conclusions on the performance capability of the aircraft.


It is therefore baffling that the chair's report goes on to state that it is satisfied that the joint strike fighter will suit Australia's needs. Given the operational capability of the aircraft remains unproven, it is simply impossible to reach this conclusion. This underscores the fundamental problem with Australia's participation in this acquisition. The Greens will continue to scrutinise this acquisition. Our recommendation is that the Australian government cancel its contract to acquire the joint strike fighter and restart an open tender process to acquire new aircraft.

We need to make sure that as taxpayers we get the best value for money in any acquisition but also that importantly for our troops, our Air Force, it provides the best defence possible for the Commonwealth of Australia. The fact that there have been serious concerns raised around the world, the fact that the Israelis, who know a thing or two about defence, have real concerns about this program and are going down a different path in that the F35s they are aquiring are quite different from the F35s that our nation is acquiring, the fact that the Canadians have gone down a different path and the fact that there appears to be a lack of contestability in this process is all very concerning. It raises issues of capability as well. I seek leave to continue my remarks later on this very important issue.

"Burston, Sen Brian",PHON,2016-10-13,"



Senator BURSTON
 (New South Wales) (16:30):  I move:


That the Senate:


(a) supports the efforts of the Department of Defence and other Commonwealth and state government agencies responding to environmental and health issues arising out of firefighting foam contamination at RAAF Base Williamtown in New South Wales and Army Aviation Centre Oakey in Queensland, including engaging the University of Newcastle Family Action Centre (UNFAC) to develop and deliver mental health awareness and stress management activities in the Williamtown area;


(b) notes that:


   (i) some landholders in the immediate vicinity of Williamtown Air Base and Oakey Army Aviation Centre are reporting difficulties accessing equity, property value impacts and difficulty selling their land,


   (ii) the Department of Defence has met with a number of lending institutions and the Australian Property Institute to discuss property lending policies and practices and how valuations are conducted in the Williamtown area, and


   (iii) the Department of Defence has committed to review the issue of property acquisition once detailed environmental investigations at RAAF Base Williamtown and Army Aviation Centre Oakey have been concluded; and


(c) calls on the Government to expedite environmental investigations of the impact of firefighting foam contamination at Williamtown and Oakey to enable landholders to address the dilemma of land remediation or relocation, and move on with their lives and deal with issues of mental health and stress management.


During the 2016 election campaign, I was approached by the Salt Ash Community First group, through my twin brother, Graham, who was a One Nation candidate for the seat of Paterson. I attended a meeting at a private residence in Salt Ash to be briefed on contamination of residents in an investigation zone that the local residents call 'the red zone', allegedly from the RAAF base at Williamtown. The contamination is caused by leaching of contaminated carcinogenic firefighting chemicals from the base to surrounding areas. These chemicals are in the form of firefighting foam known as aqueous film-forming foam, AFFF, and are used primarily to control fires involving flammable liquids such as fuel and oil. The foam suppresses fire by producing a film over the fuel and oil that effectively starves the fire of oxygen. Defence used this foam across many of its facilities in fire control systems, in the testing and maintenance of those systems and in firefighting training. 


The acronyms for the contaminants contained within AFFF are PFOS and PFOA. These contaminants were a common ingredient in household products not so long ago. You might remember Scotchgard. They can still be found in non-stick frypans. The contamination is not confined to the RAAF base at Williamtown but can be found locally at another 16 Defence bases around Australia. Possible federal government liability extends to a further 20 privately owned airfields, being a total of 36 bases Australia wide. 


The major concern of the contamination is that it cannot be neutralised and has a cumulative effect over time in the human body. The chemicals are known to be associated with testicular cancer, kidney cancer, liver disease, thyroid disease, immune suppression, reduced fertility and hypertension. More than 650 homes as well as a primary school are caught up in the red zone. This may well involve 2,500 to 3,000 men, women and children at Salt Ash alone. Advice to residents throughout the red zone includes warnings not to drink water from dams, ponds or bores or to drink milk from cows or goats or to eat eggs or fish produced in the red zone. Commercial and recreational fishing in the Tilligerry Creek and Fullerton Cove has been suspended, with compensation being provided by the government. The fishing ban has since been partially lifted, about two weeks ago, although the ban on the consumption of flathead fish is still in place.


The Department of Defence has identified contamination in Moors Drain, which carries stormwater from the base and discharges into Tilligerry Creek. During heavy rain, flash flooding occurs on properties adjacent to Moors Drain. The defence department refers to the drain as an off-site mitigation pathway for the chemicals. The Salt Ash area has a very high water table and, during heavy rain, contaminated surface water rises and lies in many drains and gutters, where foaming is clearly visible. You can just imagine the effect this has on the residents. I have also witnessed this foaming, particularly along the main road through Salt Ash. The chemicals can also be transmitted through the atmosphere and humidity. 


Health risks are not the only impact on residents. Residential and business properties are deemed worthless, with banks not willing to provide loans against equity that would allow affected residents to relocate or carry out their own mitigation works. Valuers are not willing to put a valuation on any property in the red zone because of the contamination, and therefore the property owners have lost all their equity. As a result, the residents feel trapped in their own homes, unable to carry out any remediation work or to relocate to a safer environment.


During a briefing about three weeks ago from the Minister for Health and Aged Care and the Minister for Defence, I put a suggestion that the government consider meeting with major banks and the Real Estate Institute to implement a scheme to allow affected properties to retain their values, and as such restore the equity that existed prior to the contamination being publicly known. Defence Minister Payne agreed with that request and has kindly responded as in the motion.  Towards the end of the briefing, and following concerns I raised in relation to mental health issues that I consider will soon arise, the health minister indicated to me that the University of Newcastle family action strategy was about to be announced by the government. The plan is to alert local practitioners of the human health programs in place to deal with any medical conditions that may be linked to the PFOS and PFOA contamination.


A Senate inquiry in May was very critical of Defence's response to the contamination as 'slow and reactive' and 'seemingly focused on limiting its liability rather than addressing the needs of residents'. This is borne out in a confidential report commissioned by Defence in 2003—yes, 2003, 13 years ago—when this contamination was first investigated. At the end of the executive summary of that report, it states: 


In addition to environmental harm, such obvious pollution incidents have the potential to seriously damage Defence's reputation as an environmental manager and good corporate citizen.


It is apparent that Defence has covered up the contamination issue since 2003 and has not acted on any of the report's recommendations. 


I will highlight the key findings and recommendations to make the point. Some key findings of the report were:


Defence currently uses—


aqueous film forming foam—


AFFF product that contains non-biodegradable … (PFOS/PFOA) that are environmentally persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic to animals and humans.


PFOS is acutely toxic to frogs and honey bees. Both PFOS and PFOA have been implicated with a variety of cancers and toxic health effects in humans that have had long term exposure to products containing PFOS/PFOA.


In 2002 the US EPA forced products containing PFOS/PFOA off the market.


The repeated uncontrolled or poorly managed use of AFFF products that contain PFOS/PFOA is cause for major environmental and health concern. There is the risk that poor AFFF management practices across some of Defence’s facilities may have resulted in PFOS/PFOA contaminating of soil, surface water and groundwater, both on and off base. Furthermore, the biodegradable part of AFFF consumes a lot of oxygen as it breaks down. The consumption of oxygen may influence the biological/chemical/geological conditions of groundwater and surface waters by driving anaerobic systems and causing the asphyxiation of aquatic fauna.


…   …   …   


The main issues associated with fire fighting foam waste-water management are based around how it is collected, contained and disposed of…. there are no regulatory actions that specifically encompass the use and disposal of products containing PFOS/PFOA. 


…   …   …   


Most reports distinctly state that fire fighting foam waste-water should not be disposed of into watercourses, soils, or foul stormwater drains …


…   …   …   


Best management practice for AFFF waste-water, as indicated by reports and literature, include the appropriate collection and containment of AFFF waste-water, and disposal via a sewage treatment plant or by incineration.


There has been some issues with AFFF waste-water affecting the oil separation process, with many separators requiring constant repairs or replacement.


…   …   …   


In many cases across Defence the AFFF waste-water is being released into the environment … with the potential of AFFF pollutants … contaminating soil and groundwater on Defence bases as well as contaminating surrounding farm land and surface waters. 


The recommendations of the report were:


Defence should consider undertaking site testing … to determine if its facilities are contaminated by PFOS/PFOA and the extent of the contamination, and also consider establishing monitoring wells in areas where AFFF is repeatedly used and released …


Defence should consider restricting the use of AFFF across its facilities in accordance to NICNAS recommendations.


Defence should consider facilitating industry partnerships into researching the behaviour of AFFF mixtures and waste-water as they may occur in the Australian environment.


AFFF waste-water management system should be designed to contain the most probable worst case AFFF discharge, to minimise the risk of any AFFF waste-water reaching watercourses, soil, or stormwater drains.


The management of AFFF across Defence should meet the best practice methods used by others, as indicated in reports (manufacturer recommendations, US Defense, UK Defence, consultants’ reports) and in scientific literature.


If open ponds are used to store AFFF waste-water they should be managed to restrict access by fauna (e.g. using netting or synthetic liners).


It is imperative to contact the local waste authority to determine suitable waste disposal methods and if any pre-treatment or dilution is required.


At a recent briefing I had with a defence spokesman, he admitted the existence of the report and stated that it was the catalyst for the actions that are taking place now—some 13 years later. This contradicts the information I received at another briefing in Newcastle, just after the election, by the then acting CEO of Hunter Water, Mr Jeromy Bath. He stated that Hunter Water knew of the foam contamination several years ago and had reported it to all of the appropriate authorities, believing they would immediately act on it. However, it was not acted on until about 18 months ago—well after authorities were alerted by Hunter Water. Mr Bath said that Hunter Water was very remorseful in not making the contamination issue public themselves when they first became aware of it. 


Further, Hunter Water has received $3.5 million to provide reticulated water to affected properties within the red zone. This work should be completed by April 2017 and under budget. In the meantime, bottled water is being provided at no cost. An issue that has arisen is that, when the houses of residents are connected to the reticulated water, some houses may not withstand the increased water pressure and the plumbing will need to be renewed to current standards. These supplementary works should also be part of any compensation package.


Prior to the election, the Prime Minister promised $55 million Australia-wide for blood testing, which is voluntary, and an epidemiology study. The Defence Minister confirmed that commitment in an answer to a question I asked in the Senate recently. Unfortunately, the minister also confirmed in that answer that any compensation package or buyback will not be forthcoming until the results of that study are known. This could take several years. I have firmly suggested to the minister that this time frame is far too long and that, if the government does not act sooner, it may have another asbestos-type crisis on its hands in 20 years.


More recently, enHealth has released new safety guidelines for PFOS and PFOA levels. The new tolerable daily intake levels for PFOS are 0.15 micrograms per kilogram per day, and 1.5 micrograms per kilogram per day for PFOA. These are 78 times higher than the levels deemed safe by the US EPA. EnHealth's drinking water guidelines are 0.5 micrograms per litre for PFOS and five micrograms per litre for PFOA—excessively above the 0.07 micrograms per litre adopted by the US EPA. EnHealth's recommendations of these acceptable levels were endorsed by the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee, made up of chief health officers and a Department of Defence representative on 15 June this year. This commission is made up of members that held defence contracts worth many millions of dollars, and obviously there is a perceived conflict of interest. I am not suggesting in this chamber that there are any illegalities in the process. This decision reversed Australia's practice of adopting standards in line with those set by the US EPA. The US EPA drastically toughened its PFOS and PFOA guidelines, with stronger health warnings just three weeks before the Australian decision. This has raised suspicions in the community that the weaker safety standards are designed to reduce the number of people who will be eligible to be compensated and the quantum of payout.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2016-10-13,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (16:43):  I rise in response to the general business notice of motion moved by Senator Burston. Can I congratulate Senator Burston on raising this matter and also for the terms of reference as he has presented them before the chamber. I come to this discussion on two bases. I come to it as a member of the committee which has been investigating this issue and, of course, as a participant in the three inquiries we have had—one in Canberra; one at Williamtown or in Newcastle, New South Wales; and in Oakey, Queensland. I also come to it from a background of having been, as you know, Mr Acting Deputy President Sterle, chief executive officer of the Bushfires Board of Western Australia—an agency that used firefighting foams.


It might be of some interest to anybody listening to this discussion to know what the purpose of adding firefighting foam to water is for extinguishing fires. It is simply to create, at the microscopic level, a film around the material or the fuel that is to be burnt, and, in so doing, starve that fuel of oxygen. 


As we all know, the fire triangle is one of fuel, oxygen and a source of ignition. We can assume, therefore, that, by the time firefighting foam and water are being used, we have already had the oxygen and we have already had the source of ignition—and we have fuel. So the purpose of firefighting foam is to add to the effectiveness of water by creating, at the microscopic level, a capacity to be able to starve the fuel of air—oxygen—in which case, of course, it does not burn.


I just want to make some comments with regard to the process and those who appeared before us in the hearings we have had and to also speak of the actions being coordinated by the Minister for Health and Aged Care and the Minister for Defence.


With my veterinary hat from earlier days on, I put a question to doctors in Newcastle. What we would normally expect to have happen is that a doctor might find a number of cases for which they have no clinical explanation, and that would usually cause them to talk to other doctors in their clinic and their practice and say to them: 'Look, I think I am seeing an unusual set of circumstances. Are you also seeing it?' Those other clinicians might say, 'Yes, as a matter of fact, we are', and generally they would consult with others in their district. 


In the event that they think there is a 'cluster', as the term is used, it would be normal for doctors to get in touch with the state health department and say, 'Look, in this geographic area, a number of us believe we are seeing a range of clinical conditions for which we have no explanation.' It would then be the case that the state health department would be asked to come and inspect and do what is called an epidemiological study to establish if there is an epidemic of a certain circumstance or set of clinical signs and, therefore, what might be causing it. In Newcastle, I asked that very question of witnesses—are you aware of any such cluster in the Newcastle area as a result of the PFOA and PFOS presence in the water courses that have emanated from RAAF Base Williamtown?—and nobody was able to tell me that there had been such a circumstance. 


I want to place on record immediately the recognition of the deep concern that residents in these communities have—and it is your state and mine. We now have it appearing around RAAF Base Pearce at Bullsbrook, north of Perth. Probably every military base and every large commercial airport in Australia has used PFOA and PFOS at some time in their firefighting foams. We know, of course—and Senator Burston may have mentioned it—that from 2004 they ceased to be used in the Defence Estate. 


It needs to be understood that pretty well everybody in the western world, including all of us in this chamber, have levels of PFOA and/or PFOS in our bloodstreams. Why have we? Because, as has been said by my colleague, it is the substance used in Scotchgard, non-stick frypans and other products in common use. In fact, it has been recorded from the research that I have done that the person with the highest ever recorded blood levels of PFOA and PFOS was a lady working as a domestic cleaner in commercial buildings in a city in the United States.


Again, we do not have any record of adverse health effects. So, I wish to direct the chamber to the comments of Dr Eric Donaldson in Oakey in Queensland. Dr Donaldson was the base doctor at the base of Oakey, which for those who do not know, is directly to the west of Toowoomba on the way to Dalby, where I spent a good deal of my time as an undergraduate student whilst I was at vet school in Queensland. Donaldson also owns a very significant amount of farming land around the base at Oakey, and he runs beef cattle. 


I asked Dr Donaldson—and, of course, it is in the evidence of the hearing on Wednesday, 9 March 2016, under the chairmanship my colleague Senator Alex Gallacher—'Did you, at any time during the time you were the base doctor, ever observe any clinical signs in personnel resident on the base, those working for the military or their families, or did you have reason to believe there were clinical conditions for which you had no explanation?' and he said, 'No, I have not.' I then said to him, 'Well, you continued on in Oakey as a clinician?' I asked him the same question as a civilian doctor, 'Have you seen any evidence?' He said, 'No.' I said, 'Have other doctors?' He said, 'No.' I said, 'What about the medical professionals in Toowoomba?' He said, 'No, we haven't.'


I said, 'Well, you have been a very active cattle breeder.' I, of course, am associated somewhat with the Pascoe family—Dr Reg Pascoe, a very eminent Darling Downs veterinarian, and his two sons, John and David, both of whom I worked with at UC Davis in California. David, now with a doctorate himself in equine reproduction, is working back in the Darling Downs. I know very well, from his interests, that Reg Pascoe would have also and did have long conversations with Donaldson about the condition of their cattle. I put that same question to him. I said, 'Have you ever had any occasion—you or Reg Pascoe—to consider any pathology in cattle, be it abortions, be it early-term births, be it foetal abnormalities or anything at all?' He said, 'No, Senator Back. I have never ever had occasion and neither, I believe, has Dr Pascoe.'


We then had evidence from a Professor Jochen Mueller, who is the professor of environmental toxicology at the University of Queensland and who cut his teeth on the toxic chemical dioxin at his university in Europe. He is of interest to this debate because he is the only person to have actually done any definitive work on a group of people who might have been at risk. I think it was in about 2005 or 2006 that Airservices Australia engaged his services to work with 155 firefighters to look at possible pathologic impacts of PFOA and PFOS as a result of their exposure. He also looked at cholesterol levels and uric acid levels. He looked at issues such as obesity, whether they smoked et cetera.


For those interested, it would be important again to have a look at the Hansard of the conversations that Senator Gallacher and I had with Professor Mueller. Mueller has not been able to ascertain any pathology at all from those 155 firefighters associated with their exposure to PFOA and/or PFOS. I asked him that specific question. I asked him about someone who had 300 micrograms per litre. We—if we have it in our systems at all—probably have three, four or five. Dr Donaldson, as I recall, told us that he had levels of about 20 micrograms per litre, and his children—who have long been away from Oakey, working in other states of Australia—had levels higher than his, and I could not understand why. So I asked Mueller the question: what does a level of 300 micrograms per litre mean? He said:


I do not think there is any pathology that that person should expect, or can expect—


as a result of the 300 micrograms. He said:


I think that person should live as healthy a life as somebody that has eight nanograms per millilitre. We do not have any evidence that says a person with 350 has a different life expectancy. I am not saying that there are no health effects, but we do not know that there are health effects. As long as we do not know … we should not concern anybody about health effects when we do not know them.


I led him through a number of questions, because I think Mueller is a person that we need to take a lot of notice of in this whole debate.


Why do I say these things? Because the point that he made was that he believed members of the community of Oakey have been unnecessarily caused to be concerned by these. We had one witness, a young gentleman whose wife had just delivered a child in either Oakey Hospital or Toowoomba Hospital, and he did not know whether to bring his wife and daughter home. So this is clearly an event of great emotional concern, and nobody should belittle that concern. But at the same time, from an epidemiological point of view, we must be very guarded about going out and accepting and then escalating something for which there is not medical evidence to a level where it unnecessarily causes concern to a community of people. I believe Mueller to be a credible witness.


Having said that, I note that there is obviously a responsibility on government, because of people's concern for their own mental and physical wellbeing, valuation of land, and whether they should consume water, milk or eggs from chooks that drink the water. And, of course, particularly among those associated with Williamtown, there are those whose businesses, particularly fishing businesses, have been severely and adversely affected.


Ministers Payne, in the Defence space, and Ley are now taking a leadership role, and I for one am willing to accept that I think they are late on the train—not those two ministers but governments generally. It is governments of both persuasions, so neither one of us can take any partisan sort of advantage in this space. But, nevertheless, Minister Ley has commissioned work to be undertaken here in Australia by Adjunct Professor Andrew Bartholomaeus, who is an expert in toxicology and chemical regulation here in Australia. He completed a report which I understand he either has presented to Minister Ley or will present in the next few days. There was the commissioning of the University of Newcastle's Family Action Centre, a mental health awareness and stress management initiative which I believe my colleague Senator Burston has previously referred to. There has been the appointment of community liaison officers both in Williamtown and in Oakey. Of course, there has also been the commissioning of a study into what may be regarded as the health effects.


It brings me to the question of blood testing, because it is a very interesting question: do you encourage people to come forward and have blood tests or not? It all started, in fact, with Dr Donaldson, who of his own volition started to have blood samples taken from the community in Oakey and then provided that information, with the permission of those who had been sampled, to the Department of Defence. It was interesting that, when we had the hearing on Williamtown at Newcastle, the advice of the New South Wales Department of Health was that they did not understand where the value would be in having blood tests, simply because, again, as Mueller said, the question is: what information does it provide you? If you have five nanograms per millilitre, are you happy? If you have 300, are you unhappy, and what is the effect of that?


I thought to myself: what would I do in my circumstance? Would I have myself tested and encourage the members of my family to be blood-tested? Personally, my answer is: yes, I would. And I would not just have one set of blood tests, because those of us who know a bit about haematology actually know that one test only is of very, very doubtful significance or interest. You have to be tested over a period of time. Therefore, there has been some confusion and this has landed at the decision of voluntary blood testing by members of those communities who have the opportunity to do so.


I want to speak briefly about the conclusions drawn from a human health risk assessment associated with Williamtown and Oakey that was commissioned by the government. It was undertaken by an independent international environmental consulting group called AECOM, and their objective was to assess potential human health risks, including exposure through soil, groundwater, surface water, sediments, plants and animals within the investigation areas. It is my understanding that the work they did was as a result of the review and the endorsement of the toxicologist Professor Bartholomaeus. The words 'low' and 'acceptable' appear throughout their report regarding both Williamtown and Oakey in terms of human health risk assessment. This was completed in accordance with the National Environment Protection Measures.


I am not suggesting for one minute that we know the full answer to this question. But I think an incredibly ill-disciplined, ill-founded and regrettable comment was made by a person who was then in the defence service. As I understand it, that person addressed the first public meeting in Oakey and stood up and said, 'This is the new asbestos.' That person had absolutely and utterly no clinical history to use to make that statement. The person might be right. The weight of opinion—from my reading of the scientific literature over the last 12 months—is that they are not right. But it quite rightly has raised in the mind of the community very, very real concerns. Can they sell their land? Should they run livestock on their land? Should they live there? Should they move away?


As we have said, and as Senator Burston has drawn to our attention, there is the whole question about land valuation. If they want to move away, to whom can they sell their properties? Regarding the adjacent fishing fleets and the flow-down from RAAF Base Williamtown, to what extent can those people re-establish their lives? They have received some compensation—I would have thought it is not sufficient. We had one witness who had only just invested heavily in a new fishing enterprise, and he saw his life being ruined. But this is not just a short-term issue. For every airport—Mascot, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, the RAAF bases and the Army bases—this is a very, very important, key, long-term study, and it must be looked upon with a high degree of maturity. Government must continue to support those involved. We must continue to try and get epidemiological understanding and clinical knowledge so that we can inform the wider community as PFOA and PFOS impacts emerge. Senator Burston, thank you for raising this issue.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2016-10-13,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (17:03):  I rise to support the notice of motion from Senator Burston in relation to this issue of firefighting chemicals—PFOS and PFOA—and the situation that people find themselves in in Williamtown. Firstly, I acknowledge the member for Paterson, Meryl Swanson, who is here in the chamber. Williamtown is part of her electorate, and I am very pleased that Meryl is here to listen to this debate, because this is an issue that affects her community and an issue that she, along with the Labor Party, is extremely concerned about.


I have to say: I am absolutely gobsmacked by that last contribution from Senator Back. Senator Back, a man who tells you that wind farms can kill you from 10 kilometres away, is now saying that you need scientific knowledge on every issue about these chemicals before you can say there is a problem. I have never heard such a turnaround by any senator in this place in my career in the Senate. Apparently wind farms are a problem, but these chemicals are not. The chemical pollution in Williamtown? Not a problem! If you listen to Senator Back, you would think you could spread it on your toast in the morning and you would be okay. I do not think it is as clear as that. I do not think it is as simple as that. I have had a look at some of the reports that have been done and the reports are not clear.


As a union official, for years and years I had to deal with members of the old metal workers union and the AMWU who were dying with mesothelioma after exposure to asbestos, after they were told that it was okay: 'White asbestos is okay; it won't hurt you. Don't worry about it.' I used to go up to Barraba mine and see people there—boilermakers, fitters, machinists, labourers—covered in asbestos, their skin as pale as anything, dying young because of mesothelioma, and the company was telling people that there was not a problem.


I do not want to say there is a problem up in Williamtown, but I think we should take every precaution and we should do everything we possibly can for the people of Williamtown to give them some idea of what the situation is. But for Senator Back to come here and run the nonsense that he did just beggars belief. If you are part of some right-wing conspiracy theory on wind turbines, you can come and say whatever you like. But if you are a resident in Williamtown who has a genuine concern about chemicals affecting you, about chemicals affecting your kids and about chemicals affecting your livelihood, then you are, basically, dismissed. Bring in all the expert opinion you like and dismiss the concerns of the good folk of Williamtown!


Well I don't dismiss those concerns so quickly, and neither does the Labor Party. We do not dismiss those concerns, on the basis that our leadership has gone up on a regular basis to Williamtown to talk to the community about the implications for them and the concerns they have. In fact, the Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, went up there on 28 September 2016 to talk to the community about the issues affecting them. Richard Marles, then the shadow minister for defence personnel, went up on 15 August 2016 and spoke to the people in Williamtown. Former senator Stephen Conroy, the defence minister at the time, went up in June 2016 to talk to the community. Shadow minister Gai Brodtmann and local member Meryl Swanson have been there many times and have continued to talk to the people about their issues. Sharon Claydon, the former member whose area covered Williamtown prior to the redistribution, always had a concern for the citizens of Williamtown. I welcome Senator Burston's concern for the communities in that area. When we had the banking inquiry, Pat Conroy, the member for Charlton, forced the Commonwealth Bank to stop foreclosing on a family in Williamtown. Just think what we could do if we got a royal commission into the banks if we could do that sitting at that stupid forum that the Prime Minister established.


These are big problems and to simply dismiss the issue by trying to pretend that you are some expert because you are a vet beggars belief. I cannot understand that a doctor who runs a cattle ranch up in Queensland is suddenly an expert. He cannot see any clinical signs! I can tell you, you would not have seen any clinical signs in some of my mates, the boilermakers and fitters, that worked with me. There were no clinical signs for them for about 30 years before they started dying with asbestos disease and mesothelioma. We should not dismiss this matter just because so-called experts are saying these chemicals are okay. We should take every precaution we possibly can. That is why we made a range of recommendations to deal with this issue. 


I know there is a view that some companies do not see this as a serious problem. I am told that Canada and countries in Europe have major corporations operating within them that are very good lobbyists, and they certainly do not want any claims being made on them. In this place you almost have to talk about the Defence Force in hushed tones, as if the Defence Force can do no wrong. Every time a coalition member stands up they wrap the Australian flag around themselves and they talk about the Defence Force in hushed tones. Well the Defence Force can get it wrong too. The Defence Force is pretty well known for its capacity to avoid any legal implications for the actions that they take. Thankfully the Defence Force has some pretty smart people, but they also have some pretty smart operators trying to make sure that no litigation comes their way. So you have to take it with a grain of salt when the Defence Force says there is not a problem. 


I have had a brief look at what has been said about this issue. There has been a five-year analysis of these chemicals in the United States, from 2010 to 2015, called the PFOA Stewardship Program. Nobody can tell me that the US are backwards in their scientific capacity. Nobody would be arguing that. Their conclusion was that these substances should be banned. They said that they would work towards the elimination of these chemicals, and went on:


EPA launched the PFOA Stewardship Program in January 2006 because of concerns about the impact of PFOA and long-chain PFASs on human health and the environment, including concerns about their persistence, presence in the environment and in the blood of the general U.S. population, long half-life in people, and developmental and other adverse effects in laboratory animals.


So in the US they have concluded that it has affected laboratory animals. I do not know where Senator Back's mate, the part-time farmer/part-time doctor, gets his ideas from but certainly I would be more inclined to look at the EPA in the US as a guide rather than that farmer. The companies that participated in this program included Asahi from Japan, BASF Corporation, Daikin, 3M/Dyneon and DuPont. These major corporations were involved in this program for five years, and they determined that they had to get rid of these chemicals. For the coalition to come in here and just dismiss this view is absolutely obnoxious. If it is a wind turbine it is a major health problem; if it is a chemical produced by a major multinational corporation, suck it up. That is the tenor of Senator Back's proposition.


The report from coalition senators questions the value of conducting blood testing. They question every little thing. They say there have been no confirmed links, but after a five-year study the US decided to ban these chemicals. So you cannot tell me there is not a problem, and I would rather have the precautionary principle any day—the precautionary principle is absolutely essential in this.


We have gone up there. Labor has been onto this from day one. I myself met with some of the fishermen in a meeting in Parliament House last year, when they were concerned about the effects on their livelihood. So I am glad that Senator Burston has joined the Labor Party in dealing with this issue.



Honourable senators interjecting—




Senator CAMERON:
  I said 'in dealing with this issue'. Senator Burston, I am very happy to support this motion. I am sure there will be other motions that you put up that I will be appalled with and will not support, but I think this one is a good start. If your career in the Senate is about doing things like this, you will have a good career. If your career in the Senate is to run some of the rhetoric and nonsense I have heard over the last few maiden speeches, I do not think your career is going to be that—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator O'Sullivan
):  Senator Cameron, address your remarks through the chair.




Senator CAMERON:
  Anyway, well done for bringing this to the Senate. Labor has had inquiries into this issue. This is a big issue for the people of Williamtown.


I want to finish on this. This is not about a Senate inquiry hearing from some farmer-come-doctor in northern Queensland who cannot see any symptoms. This is about the precautionary principle. This is about taking steps to ensure that people who may have been affected by this are looked after and that, if they are affected, they are compensated. That is the issue here. It is pretty simple. When some of the weirder members in the Liberal Party—and their numbers are getting greater by the day in this place—simply say that wind turbines are a problem but firefighting chemicals are all okay, I really just do not get it. I stand beside the community in Williamtown, as does the local member, Meryl Swanson, and as does the Labor Party. We want the government to do more. The minister, Marise Payne, has only been up there once since this happened. I do not think that is good enough. I think the minister should be in here telling us exactly what is happening and how this can be fast-tracked. In fact, the minister should be in here now supporting this motion to get this resolved and not sending her minions in here to give us the nonsense that we just heard from Senator Back.


So I support the motion, and I hope that we can provide some support and some comfort to the residents of Williamtown and other areas that are affected by this. I am a New South Wales senator, so I particularly know about the issues in Williamtown. I am not across the issues elsewhere, but the principles will be the same. When multinational corporations are producing chemicals that could be carcinogenic, are long-lasting in the soil and are polluting the water system, something has to be done about it. I do not think the government is treating it seriously enough, so I welcome the opportunity to continue our concern about this issue. Again, Senator Burston, thanks for bringing this to the Senate today.

",Senate,<title>MOTIONS</title>,<title>Defence Facilities: Chemical Contamination</title>,MOTIONS,26,1
"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2016-10-13,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (17:18):  I rise to contribute to this debate and thank Senator Burston for bringing it to the attention of the Senate. As always, I will be very frank. Until a few days ago, I knew nothing about this issue at Salt Ash and Williamtown. I think the problem has been around for years; in 2003 or so it was first brought to light. I do not know if that is true or not. If it was, I question what Senator Cameron did about it in the six years they were in government, but we will not go into the politics of that. But it came to my attention because I had a call from a journalist, who said, 'There are some problems with the residents here at Williamtown because the banks are giving a couple of them a bit of a hard time.' What I mean by that is that this journalist—and I am not going to name people or institutions, banks or whatever—said that people's properties have been devalued because of this contamination. You would be aware of it, Senator Burston. The value of their properties has gone down, so their loan-to-value ratio has gone up and there are some concerns. So the first thing I did was phone Steven Munchenberg from the Australian Bankers Association just a few days ago and explain the situation to him.




Senator Cameron:
  'Hey, Steven, it's Wacka here,' and Steven goes, 'Uh-oh!'




Senator WILLIAMS:
  A terrible interjection from Senator Cameron over there, Mr Acting Deputy President—you should pull him into line! Anyway, Steven Munchenberg was very good, as always. I get on very well with Steven and the Australian Bankers Association. I called representatives of the big four banks to say, 'Look, there's a problem here. People's properties are being devalued through absolutely no fault of their own.' This foam was being used for many years to put out so-called fuel fires. It is a pollutant and it has spread. Has it gone into the water system? Has it gone into the ground? I do not know. There has to be a lot of research to find the facts out here. But the point I make is that it was no fault whatsoever of the residents there. Their properties have been devalued and perhaps are not even saleable, with the media et cetera going around. In my opinion, we have to have a good, close look at this. As I just said to Senator Nash, imagine if some government department or someone else came along to the edge of my little farm—my wife, Nancy, and I have a little property out at Inverell—and polluted the creek and our property or poisoned the soil or whatever. We would want to know why. It would certainly devalue our little farm. If we were totally not responsible for the damage, the pollution and the devaluation, I would certainly be asking questions, just like the residents of Williamtown. I am not familiar with the situation at Oakey; I only talk from experience and what has been brought to my attention. They have serious concerns.


I do thank the Australian Bankers Association and the representatives I have spoken to from the four big banks to say, 'Look, we're not going to be doing any panicking. We're going to work with these people.' It may be a different situation if you are in one of these houses, you have your house mortgaged to a business, your business is going bad, your cash flow is going bad and you cannot maintain your payments. Then you will have to talk to your bank and try to work it through. But the point I make is that, if these properties have been devalued through absolutely no fault of the owners of the properties, we have a problem to work through. And I do appreciate the Australian Bankers Association and the banks for being considerate and listening to my calls. I do not think there are going to be any problems for the residents as far as their mortgages go, so long as it is about the valuation and not, as I said, if they are running a business and their business is in trouble or for some other reason their cash flow has been dramatically reduced.


It is a very testing time for these people at Williamtown. This PFAS—that I had never heard of before I found out about it this week—is a serious chemical. There is talk about its listing on the Stockholm listing of chemicals. I think it is a case of banning these chemicals. The case I want to put is: what can the government do? The first thing we are doing is supporting these people, with some money going in from Defence to help Hunter Water put water into these houses that are not on town water so that they can be supplied with clean water. That is a good plus in itself. Certainly, we are helping them in the health department with the situation of blood tests and so on. There is also some mental health support, which is most important. Imagine if you lived there, Mr Acting Deputy President O'Sullivan, and you found yourself under financial pressure. You had bought a property and house that might have been worth $500,000. All of a sudden, you think it is worth $300,000—or even less. You owed $200,000 or $300,000 on your property and you thought you were getting ahead. You had half your house paid for—its value—and, all of a sudden, you were back to owing the whole value of the property. It is not a good thing to have on your mind. Mental health issues may be a serious problem there as well. I certainly hope that the Department of Health are doing all they can to assist these people through these tough times.


As far as I am concerned—and, Senator Burston, you would know more about this than me—we need to go right through this testing to see where the pollution is. The first thing to do is to stop any further pollution. No doubt these chemicals are no longer being used by the Defence department. We need to see that the pollution does stop—that this PFAS is not being used. Then we need to do the testing of the soils and the water to see how far the pollution has spread. We need to see if it is from the source of the Defence department and prevent the spreading. Then we need to see what we can do to clean up the mess.


As far as I am concerned, if it is the cause of the Defence department and the property values are seriously devalued, then I think the Defence department should compensate those people for the devaluations. As I said, they may be just living in their house—they have bought a property; they may have bought a block of land there, Senator Burston, and built their house—and thinking that everything is hunky-dory and fine. Then, through no fault of their own, just because of where they bought—near the Air Force base at Williamtown and at Salt Ash—they have suffered an enormous financial blow because of someone else or some department. I should not say 'someone else'; many people would have made these decisions, and they would have been advised, no doubt, years ago that these PFAS foams for fighting the fuel fires were safe, effective and the new modern way to put these fires out, especially in the case of emergency. If you had an airline crash, or whatever, and fuel had spilt everywhere, you would need something very effective to put that fire out. It could be a case of saving lives at the time. It would have been a great invention at the time. But many chemicals were great inventions—arsenic for drenching ship and dipping sheep for lice. Everything was a great invention years ago on the farm until they were banned and until people realised the carcinogenic effect of such dangerous chemicals. This may be a case of the same situation with this PFAS, where they have designed something—invented a chemical that is very effective for fuel fires—only to find later in life that, 'Hang on; this is not a pure chemical. It's actually a pollutant; it's dangerous. It can cause enormous damage to the environment and to people.' Who knows! I am not a doctor; I am not a specialist in this field.


I do sympathise with those people for what they are going through. I have done my best and I am very confident that the financial institutions will stick with them through this period of research, which I think must be carried out, to research the level of pollution, of contamination, so to see what can be done to clean it up, and how it can be cleaned up. If it cannot be cleaned up and if the people have to be moved out of there—I do not know the final situation; I have not visited there. But I hope that in the near future I can go down to Salt Ash to talk to the locals and see what we can do for them.


I thank the journalist for bringing it to my attention. I am sure that she appreciates very much the work I have done to contact the banks and institutions to see that those people are not under severe financial pressure and more stress. Only time will tell, but I know that the department is certainly working on it. I have discussed it with Minister Payne. She is very aware of the situation. When I phoned Minister Payne she was in America at the time. Thankfully, she rang me as soon as she could. She rang me straight back after I texted her to give me a call to assess the situation. She is certainly onto it, and so is the Department of Defence. I repeat that—




Senator Cameron:
  'On to it'?




Senator WILLIAMS:
  Senator Cameron, when did this first occur? If you want a political argument, I will gladly take you on. Had this PFAS been distributed when you were in government? Should I ask the question: what did you do for Williamtown in your six years in government?




Senator Cameron:
  The minister has been there once.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  What did you do?




Senator Cameron:
  The minister has been there once.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator O'Sullivan
):  Order on my left!




Senator WILLIAMS:
  So what did you do in those six years? You did nothing. You are just a great political hand grenade thrower in this place, where it is all about saying—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Address your remarks through the chair, Senator Williams.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  My sincere apologies, Mr Acting Deputy President. I did not realise. I will certainly come back to you. Mr Acting Deputy President, when it comes to political hand grenades, Senator Cameron is probably the best chucker of those around the place. You may have even experienced some of that in your own personal life in the Senate here, Mr Acting Deputy President.


Instead of making a political issue out of this for those people of Salt Ash, let us try to work together to see if we can get a solution. I thank Senator Burston for bringing this to the chamber. Just out of what you have done here today, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, of course, this will get more publicity and give more support to the people of Salt Ash. As I said, I cannot comment on Oakey. I am not familiar with the situation at Oakey, but clearly there is something similarly wrong up there. Let us hope that the contamination, as I said, is no longer being spread, that they can determine the borders of how far the contamination has spread and that they can then, perhaps, clean it up through neutralising the chemicals through some way or another—some design of a balancing chemical. If they do not do that, then I believe those people deserve compensation. I will repeat it again: if you have your place devalued through no fault of your own, the people—the department that are responsible for that devaluation should compensate you.


That is my contribution. I thank Senator Burston once again for bringing this very important issue to the attention of the Senate.

",Senate,<title>MOTIONS</title>,<title>Defence Facilities: Chemical Contamination</title>,MOTIONS,26,1
"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2016-10-13,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (17:29):  The Williamtown story of contamination has thrown the lives of so many people into uncertainty and disarray. It is actually a story that is repeated, we are learning, in many other areas around the country, and it really does underline why this government has to act urgently. People are living with possible health problems, the loss of property value and the inability to continue their lives. Some of them have lost their livelihood completely; fishing folk in and around Williamtown are an example of that. Each time I visit this area I find that the mental health of many of the local people is deteriorating, and it is understandable. When you have got your future ahead of you, and part of your future is where you live, your income, your property and home, and you are uncertain if you should even be living there but you cannot see any way out because your property now has no value, it clearly is incredibly alarming.


One of the saddest stories I heard was about a young couple who had decided to move from Sydney to this area to start their home. They liked the semirural lifestyle. She fell pregnant—after very much looking forward to starting a family—and then, while she was pregnant, the story of the contamination broke. She was then not sure if she should breastfeed the baby—if that was best, or if it was not best. Might she be poisoning her baby through her breast milk? These are the questions that people are asking themselves and that really underline that sense of insecurity that so many people are living with.


The banks are now becoming a big part of this story. The Commonwealth Bank has sent foreclosure letters to residents in Salt Ash, one of the areas affected by PFOS and PFOA contamination. We have heard from the Commonwealth Bank that it is not planning to foreclose—it has backed down on that, and it has said, 'Well, that was a bit of a mistake.' It is actually claiming that sending the letters was an administrative error. But anybody who has been involved in this crisis would have to be very sceptical of that claim.


The fact is that residents' homes have been devalued, residents have had difficulty getting bank loans, and resident have had difficulty selling. Many are begging the Department of Defence to buy them out. Again, that is something that has been repeated so often when I meet with locals at Williamtown, particularly because many of them went to the Senate inquiry that we had at the end of last year. That gave them some hope—because the Department of Defence have to turn up—that Defence would listen and then respond.


The government admits total responsibility. There is no wriggle room and no excuses. They admit that they have caused this contamination. So, understandably, people expect, 'Well, this is the government. They will do the right thing. They have admitted that they have made this very serious mistake and we are now living with contamination.' But there is nothing. The months keep rolling by. So this issue about the value of people's property and their future is becoming bigger and bigger.


ANZ, the Commonwealth Bank and NAB have all refused to offer new lending in the area known as the 'red zone'—the area that has been marked out as severely contaminated. There is a risk associated with these properties that the banks do not want to go near as they now have reduced value due to the high levels of contamination. So this is huge. Imagine how we would feel if we went home this weekend and we found that that was the situation for where we live—I guess most of us own our places—and then all of a sudden we could not get a loan and we could not sell our property. This is extraordinary. Who has caused it? In this case it was the government.


Real estate agents in the area have confirmed that they are struggling to sell properties. If the Department of Defence is responsible for the devaluation of the properties—and they are; we know that—then they are also responsible for ensuring that the affected residents are compensated for those property devaluations as well as for the loss of income, the health difficulties and the disruption that they have endured through no fault of their own. 


Again, I want to underline, and I know I have said it but we need to keep saying it: the government has admitted that they are responsible. The local people, through no fault of their own, are now in this incredible situation—a situation of constant uncertainty. This is causing stress, anguish and, in many cases, depression. I have been very concerned with what some people are saying to me about what they think that they might have to do with their future. It is extremely alarming, and it goes back to this failure of government to deal with what is happening.


It is the obligation of the Turnbull government to sort this out with the banks. This is precisely what a government should do. They should put the public good first. The public good has been damaged here. They should put the public good first, and, as the banks are part of the problem, they should be helping sort that out.


It is also the obligation of the government to compensate for the huge financial losses that the residents are coping with. Again, that should be obvious. There was a clear recommendation from our Senate inquiry that the government start working on this. But nearly a year later—nothing. It is also the obligation of the government to provide free health tests to residents.


The government should be working with state agencies to remediate the contaminated land and water. It is absolutely critical that the government sets out a clear timeline detailing its plans for remediation. That remediation is critical for residents and also for workers at the base. The level of problems in this area really are mounting as this goes on. I have had many shocks and surprises, both in listening to residents and in hearing how the government is handling it. One was when I learnt that the government initially had no plans for remediation. Now that is not nearly as extensive as it needs to be.


I feel that the coalition government is dodging this issue. I found out, when I first asked questions about this in estimates last year, that the government has actually known about this for many years—certainly for much longer than the one year that the local people have known about it. The Department of Defence have known about it for years. International studies have been done. So it was in the literature. It had been reported. But again the local people had been left in the dark.


I am pleased to be able to speak on this. Sadly, I think we will have to come back to this time and time again. But the ball really is with the government. We know the problems banks have in ever doing the right thing by people. That is why the government needs to address the issue of how the banks are operating, as well as to take up their own responsibility to do health tests properly and not run these scam ways of doing them by saying, 'If somebody goes and pays for the health tests then they can get the money back.' Many of these people do not have that sort of cash, to be able to manage it in that way. So there is much that the government needs to do, and they really need to get cracking.

Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (17:52):  I want to speak on the Aged Care Complaints Commissioner's Report for the period 1 January to 30 June 2016, including thefinal report of the Aged Care Commissioner for the period 1 July to 31 December 2015.


The Aged Care Complaints Commissioner's annual report details work that Rae Lamb has been doing in her first six months as the new Aged Care Complaints Commissioner. It is a good report, full of valuable information and data-specific to the aged care sector. This is the first time that a report about aged care complaints has been made available.


In the six months since the new commissioner was appointed she has been inundated with complaints. In fact, the number of complaints has increased by 11 per cent. Over 5,000 people contacted the commissioner's office with concerns between 1 January this year and June. More than 2,000 of these were formal complaints, mostly from concerned family and friends of people living in residential care.


Some people have attributed the increase in complaints to the fact that there has never before been an avenue specifically for aged-care-related complaints. But I am sure that I would not be alone in suggesting that the increase in complaints really stems from the Turnbull government's disinterest and neglect of the ageing and the aged care portfolio.


We have sought from this government on numerous occasions to have released the modelling that they made their judgement on when they cut over $1.2 billion of ACFI funding out of the aged care sector. It has been demonstrated over the last three years that this government has not had the passion, the vision or the drive to ensure that they have oversight of this extremely important sector—the sector that is caring for older Australians and the sector that is responsible for caring for some of the most vulnerable people in our community.


So the fact that we now have a complaints commissioner is a good thing. We will continue to watch with great interest, to see whether or not the increase in complaints continues. But I do at least acknowledge the fact that this is a step in the right direction.


But it does concern me that the minister responsible, Minister Sussan Ley, has said that the overall increase in complaints remained low. I think that is a bit of a joke—maybe she was trying to make light of it. But it does not matter how you look at this and how much you want to try to deny it: there has been an increase in complaints.


I am not surprised, really, considering that last weekend, when the minister, Senator Siewert and I attended the LASA Congress 2016, which was held on the Gold Coast, we heard the minister speak and give her address, which said nothing—as usual. But when we participated in a panel discussion in relation to this sector the minister did say that she wanted to be honest with the sector about the cuts. Unfortunately, she did not call them 'cuts'; she sees the ACFI funding cuts as a 'saving'.


But the sector knows, as we know, that a cut is a cut is a cut. So if she really does want to be honest, transparent and open with the sector then she should release the modelling which her government used. She has responsibility around the cabinet table as the minister to release that modelling. All other modelling that has been done by peak bodies has indicated that they believe the outcome will be far worse than the $1.2 billion. Those people who are going to be most affected are those who have multiple conditions and high and complex needs. These are the most vulnerable people in our community.


What I am asking the minister to do is what she said she was going to do—be open, be honest and release that modelling for us. We know that the interest shown by the minister in this sector has been very little. She much prefers to re-announce sporting events so that she can have her photo opportunities again and again. If she just paid 10 per cent more interest in aged care then we would be happy to acknowledge that. But we know that her interest lies in sport, photo opportunities and not doing the job that she has responsibility for.

"O'Neill, Sen Deb",ALP,2016-10-13,"



Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (18:02):  I refer to this report because I think it is a very important piece of record-keeping about the impact of the cuts to health that were heralded in that tragic 2014 budget brought in by the then Prime Minister Abbott. I want to speak to it this week in particular in the context of what has happened in the House of Representatives. I remind those who might be listening, and anybody who catches up with this speech that I am giving here today, that this week in the House of Representatives a vote was taken that absolutely and clearly indicates that the cuts in health that were backed in by the Abbott government, the $56 billion worth of cuts that the Abbott-Turnbull government undertook, are very much a real and live thing for this country.


What happened this week was that Liberal MPs in the House—I assume in concert with those here in the Senate—voted against guaranteeing to keep Medicare in public hands as a universal health insurance scheme for Australia. They are bleating all over the place about a 'Mediscare' campaign. But here in the Senate, where they think people might not be watching the chaos that has ensued under this government, they voted against keeping Medicare in public hands. They voted against protecting bulk-billing so that every Australian can see their doctor when they need to, not just when they can afford to. The Liberal and National parties voted against that this week in the House of Representatives. They refused to reverse harmful cuts to Medicare by unfreezing the indexation of the Medical Benefits Schedule. They voted against reversing cuts to pathology that will mean Australians with cancer will pay more for blood tests. They voted against reversing cuts to breast screening, MRIs, X-rays and other diagnostic imaging.


They want the election to go away. They lost all but a one-seat majority and they are trying to pretend Australians were hoodwinked. But today I want to put on the record that this week in the parliament, once again, they showed their true colours: they are committed to a massive cut to the health care of Australians. They voted against abandoning their plans to make all Australians, even pensioners, pay more for vital medicines. Finally, in the House this week, in concert with their Senate colleagues, the Liberal and National parties voted against developing a long-term agreement to properly fund our public hospitals so that Australians do not languish in our emergency departments or on long waiting lists for important surgery. That final point really brings home the message that Mr Turnbull, the Prime Minister of Australia, still has not learned his lesson. He copped a shellacking in the election. One seat is that majority—and we know how fragile that is because we have already seen them fail on multiple occasions in the 10 days they have had here in Canberra.


But the government has not reversed a single cut from the election. Why is that so important in regard to the report I am speaking to this evening? The report that I am addressing is the final report of the select health committee from the last parliament entitled Hospital Funding Cuts: The Perfect Storm. And that subtitle tells what happened—the demolition of federal-state health relations from 2014 to 2016. If I was a member of the government I would be hoping that this was going away. But this is a story we need to retell and retell and retell.


Prior to the Abbott government coming into being, a series of national partnership agreements were established to end the blame game on who is responsible for health—whether it is the state government or the federal government. It was a proportional responsibility that was assumed—that both levels were responsible for health. Those agreements were simply torn up with the hubris and arrogance that we now see every day on display from this government—torn up and destroyed. Those vital partnerships, federal-state relations, were torn apart. We are seeing now, as a legacy of those agreements being torn up, the impact of cuts to health.


In New South Wales it is creating incredible financial pressure on the state, and it is starting to manifest in all sorts of bizarre decisions by the state government of New South Wales. They are linked intimately with the cuts at federal level. I want to make sure that people who are listening to the parliamentary broadcast, including people from the Central Coast, know that there will be a very important community gathering of people who are a wake-up to this Liberal-National government; who understand that the government are cutting our access to health and in the Central Coast region they want to privatise Wyong Hospital. This Sunday at 11 am, at the Morrie Breen Oval on Wallarah Road in Kanwal, there will be a community gathering of concerned residents from right across the coast who have seen Premier Baird decide he should privatise five hospitals, including Wyong. The impact of that is very, very concerning, particularly in light of evidence that we have received about the scale of the New South Wales cuts.


Mr Baird, it seems, has decided that instead of taking on his colleagues here at federal level he is going to cut services to the people of New South Wales. He is letting his federal colleagues get away with their massive cuts to New South Wales. Why is he in this situation? Let's talk about what the scale of this is. This is evidence we received from Dr Andrew McDonald, a paediatrician from Campbelltown Hospital who was formerly the health minister in a Labor government and who understands the budgetary implications of these cuts very well indeed:


The annual hospitals budget, from New South Wales, is about $20 billion. That is one year's salary, effectively … You can close the system for a year or you can fund to meet demand … $18.3 billion so it is, virtually, a year's New South Wales hospital budget worth of cuts.


That is what New South Wales is attempting to accommodate and, rather than take on his federal colleagues, Mr Baird is starting to cut the services for New South Wales.


We heard about what it means on the ground. In evidence that we received in March 2015 to the select committee hearing in Gosford, the Australian Paramedics Association told the committee of the serious impacts that increasing resource pressures are having on paramedics. These are vital people, who come to respond to emergencies on the ground in our community on the Central Coast. They said that due to at-capacity emergency departments, ambulances are being forced to 'ramp' until an emergency bed becomes available. Mr Jeff Andrew, the Vice President of the Australian Paramedics Association, explained that a two-hour ramp at peak periods is not unusual. A ramp is when an ambulance crew cannot discharge the patient that they brought to the hospital. They have to stay there with them and cannot go to the next call. Mr Andrew said a recent experience of a six-hour ramp would become common.


That is what we are starting to hear more and more of in the community. I am sure that people who attend this community rally, this community gathering of concern about the cuts to their health access and health services, will hear, sadly, more stories of the impact of the cuts from this federal government.


Mr Andrew described the whole system as 'overwhelmed'. When he was asked what additional pressures would result from the government's decision to cut $56 billion over eight years from the hospital system, combined with the government's additional measures to cut primary care—which I have not even mentioned in my speech yet—Mr Andrew, a paramedic on the front line said this:


I think we will get more sick patients if the primary health care is not attended to. I mentioned some patients, like asthma patients and patients with a chronic disease like emphysema, who have been better managed because there are good strategies and care plans in place for them. Any budget cuts in that area will only reflect to us getting them at a sicker state. There will be a higher burden on the presentations in the health system.


So, we have a twin attack on the health and wellbeing of people across the nation and in the great state of New South Wales that I represent. In a climate where its funding has been cut to the bone, the New South Wales government is inflicting pain on communities, and the further away you are from Manly and Mr Baird, the harder he is cutting. This needs to stop.


I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

Leave granted.




Senator GALLACHER:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


I will start my contribution by referring to a letter of transmittal that is addressed:


Senator the Hon Marise Payne


Minister for Defence


Parliament House


Canberra ACT 2600


It reads:


Dear Minister


We present the Defence Annual Report 2014–15 for the year ended 30 June 2015. The report has been prepared in accordance with section 63 of the Public Service Act 1999. Subsection 63(1) of the Act requires that our report to you be tabled in Parliament.


Here is the punchline:


Consistent with section 10 of the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Rule 2014, we certify that we are satisfied that Defence has prepared fraud risk assessments and fraud control plans and has in place appropriate fraud prevention, detection, investigation, recording and reporting mechanisms that meet the specific needs of the department, and that Defence has taken all reasonable measures to appropriately deal with fraud relating to the department.


Yours sincerely


Dennis Richardson


Secretary


Mark Binskin, AC


Air Chief Marshal


The minister has been given an assurance that all of the probity requirements have been met, but that assurance is contradicted by Audit report No. 33. The audit report is scathing. I will refer to just one particular section:


Defence has not exercised adequate central control over the issuing or use of Fastcards or eTickets. Defence has no system in place and little capacity to routinely monitor and manage the risks it has identified in its use of Cabcharge eTickets. Defence could have used an available IT system to help it manage risks but did not do so.


   …   …   …


Defence advised the ANAO that it proposes to begin using an appropriate system.


Despite the fact that they have assured the minister that they were using a system, that clearly has not been the case. The report continues:


4.6 On 9 July 2015, in the course of the audit—


after having given the minister assurances—


Defence cancelled 31 of the 34 Fastcards mentioned above but left active each of those it had provided to the then Minister for Defence, Assistant Minister for Defence and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence. Defence had previously advised Parliament in February 2015 that it ‘does not issue corporate credit cards to the Minister or ministerial office staff'. Defence informed the ANAO that it was in the process of correcting this statement.


   …   …   …


The ANAO identified records of 261,158 taxi trips paid by eTicket at a total cost of over $16.28 million—


over the course of three years. It is a big department. We understand that it is a huge department. We are talking about $548 million of taxpayers expenditure, about which they assured the minister and assured the parliament they had appropriate governance and probity controls in place. The Audit Office has found the reverse. Section 4.27 of the audit report reads:


Some 17 905 different taxis (by recorded taxi number) were involved in making 261 158 trips over the period January 2012 to July 2015, a mean of just under 15 trips per taxi—


However—


Some taxis were much more fortunate than others in winning Defence eTicket business. Whereas 16 800 taxis each undertook 50 or fewer of these trips for Defence, some 12 taxis each took 500 or more such trips, with three of these taxis each taking more than 1000 trips. One particular taxi took 2160 trips using eTickets, an average of over 4.5 trips a day, at a total cost of $174 621. On its busiest day, it did 15 trips, costing $1162 in fares. The same taxi earned fares of over $1000 on each of seven separate days. Three taxis each earned over $100 000 in fares … in the period.


When you scrutinise this paperwork, it appears exceedingly strange that Defence, with its claim of proper control mechanisms in place, would accept items like 'City to Pinkenba'. One can only assume that it is the good city of Brisbane. I am not sure that it would be another city if it was going from the city to Pinkenba. So it is the city of Brisbane. The distance from the city to Pinkenba is 14.8 kilometres via Kingsford Smith Drive, State Route 25 and the M3. It would take 24 minutes to travel that 14.8 kilometres. The Defence bill for that trip was $585.20. That does not sound to me like they have appropriate mechanisms in place and used the appropriate technology to identify misuse—dare I say fraud—and the assurances given to the minister clearly have not been honoured.


The next section is entitled 'Small hours’ travel by eTicket'. We know that Defence is a very vital, busy organisation, but the ANAO analysis also identified:


… taxi trips paid for by eTicket and timed between 1.00am and 4.00am. This is a period when little work-related travel might be expected to take place, with the possible exception of trips to or from an airport or shift work. After excluding airport-related trips, the analysis indicated there had been 1263 such taxi trips—


in the wee small hours. Clearly the assurances given to the minister have not been honoured.


Now, the other simple problem with all of the efforts of Defence is that they have fundamentally failed to have a second person tick off on the transactions. Some 37 per cent of all transactions have been validated by a person junior to the cardholder and, in a lot of cases, by the person who incurred the expenditure. Clearly, Defence is deficient and proven to be deficient by this analysis of, I think, some seven million transactions. The Audit Office has gone to the extent of analysing an extraordinary number of transactions and has come up with an extraordinary amount of evidence pointing to a failure of Defence to do precisely what the two gentlemen responsible have said they would do. 


I suppose this issue—that there would be limitations in governance, due diligence and probity—is not uncommon. Now, Defence is a vital sector of the Australian economy; they move around a lot and they have to do it efficiently. No-one is arguing about that. But when you talk, in your financial governance statements, about low-value, low-risk transactions and you issue one credit card with a $2 million credit limit, three credit cards with a million-dollar credit limit, a hundred-odd credit cards with a $250,000 credit limit and some 900 credit cards with a $100,000 credit limit—when you have that expenditure signed off by a person junior to the person holding the credit card and you have a very high proportion of self-validation, the whole reputation of Defence is impugned. My view is that this needs to be diligently worked through and the respectable people in the Defence Force need to be protected by proper probity and governance. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (18:21):  I seek leave to return to a previous Auditor-General report, tabled on 30 August 2016, to allow me to take note of Audit report No. 33 2015-16: Performance Audit: Defence's management of credit and other transaction cards: Department of Defence.


Leave granted.




Senator GALLACHER:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


I will start my contribution by referring to a letter of transmittal that is addressed:


Senator the Hon Marise Payne


Minister for Defence


Parliament House


Canberra ACT 2600


It reads:


Dear Minister


We present the Defence Annual Report 2014–15 for the year ended 30 June 2015. The report has been prepared in accordance with section 63 of the Public Service Act 1999. Subsection 63(1) of the Act requires that our report to you be tabled in Parliament.


Here is the punchline:


Consistent with section 10 of the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Rule 2014, we certify that we are satisfied that Defence has prepared fraud risk assessments and fraud control plans and has in place appropriate fraud prevention, detection, investigation, recording and reporting mechanisms that meet the specific needs of the department, and that Defence has taken all reasonable measures to appropriately deal with fraud relating to the department.


Yours sincerely


Dennis Richardson


Secretary


Mark Binskin, AC


Air Chief Marshal


The minister has been given an assurance that all of the probity requirements have been met, but that assurance is contradicted by Audit report No. 33. The audit report is scathing. I will refer to just one particular section:


Defence has not exercised adequate central control over the issuing or use of Fastcards or eTickets. Defence has no system in place and little capacity to routinely monitor and manage the risks it has identified in its use of Cabcharge eTickets. Defence could have used an available IT system to help it manage risks but did not do so.


   …   …   …


Defence advised the ANAO that it proposes to begin using an appropriate system.


Despite the fact that they have assured the minister that they were using a system, that clearly has not been the case. The report continues:


4.6 On 9 July 2015, in the course of the audit—


after having given the minister assurances—


Defence cancelled 31 of the 34 Fastcards mentioned above but left active each of those it had provided to the then Minister for Defence, Assistant Minister for Defence and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence. Defence had previously advised Parliament in February 2015 that it ‘does not issue corporate credit cards to the Minister or ministerial office staff'. Defence informed the ANAO that it was in the process of correcting this statement.


   …   …   …


The ANAO identified records of 261,158 taxi trips paid by eTicket at a total cost of over $16.28 million—


over the course of three years. It is a big department. We understand that it is a huge department. We are talking about $548 million of taxpayers expenditure, about which they assured the minister and assured the parliament they had appropriate governance and probity controls in place. The Audit Office has found the reverse. Section 4.27 of the audit report reads:


Some 17 905 different taxis (by recorded taxi number) were involved in making 261 158 trips over the period January 2012 to July 2015, a mean of just under 15 trips per taxi—


However—


Some taxis were much more fortunate than others in winning Defence eTicket business. Whereas 16 800 taxis each undertook 50 or fewer of these trips for Defence, some 12 taxis each took 500 or more such trips, with three of these taxis each taking more than 1000 trips. One particular taxi took 2160 trips using eTickets, an average of over 4.5 trips a day, at a total cost of $174 621. On its busiest day, it did 15 trips, costing $1162 in fares. The same taxi earned fares of over $1000 on each of seven separate days. Three taxis each earned over $100 000 in fares … in the period.


When you scrutinise this paperwork, it appears exceedingly strange that Defence, with its claim of proper control mechanisms in place, would accept items like 'City to Pinkenba'. One can only assume that it is the good city of Brisbane. I am not sure that it would be another city if it was going from the city to Pinkenba. So it is the city of Brisbane. The distance from the city to Pinkenba is 14.8 kilometres via Kingsford Smith Drive, State Route 25 and the M3. It would take 24 minutes to travel that 14.8 kilometres. The Defence bill for that trip was $585.20. That does not sound to me like they have appropriate mechanisms in place and used the appropriate technology to identify misuse—dare I say fraud—and the assurances given to the minister clearly have not been honoured.


The next section is entitled 'Small hours’ travel by eTicket'. We know that Defence is a very vital, busy organisation, but the ANAO analysis also identified:


… taxi trips paid for by eTicket and timed between 1.00am and 4.00am. This is a period when little work-related travel might be expected to take place, with the possible exception of trips to or from an airport or shift work. After excluding airport-related trips, the analysis indicated there had been 1263 such taxi trips—


in the wee small hours. Clearly the assurances given to the minister have not been honoured.


Now, the other simple problem with all of the efforts of Defence is that they have fundamentally failed to have a second person tick off on the transactions. Some 37 per cent of all transactions have been validated by a person junior to the cardholder and, in a lot of cases, by the person who incurred the expenditure. Clearly, Defence is deficient and proven to be deficient by this analysis of, I think, some seven million transactions. The Audit Office has gone to the extent of analysing an extraordinary number of transactions and has come up with an extraordinary amount of evidence pointing to a failure of Defence to do precisely what the two gentlemen responsible have said they would do. 


I suppose this issue—that there would be limitations in governance, due diligence and probity—is not uncommon. Now, Defence is a vital sector of the Australian economy; they move around a lot and they have to do it efficiently. No-one is arguing about that. But when you talk, in your financial governance statements, about low-value, low-risk transactions and you issue one credit card with a $2 million credit limit, three credit cards with a million-dollar credit limit, a hundred-odd credit cards with a $250,000 credit limit and some 900 credit cards with a $100,000 credit limit—when you have that expenditure signed off by a person junior to the person holding the credit card and you have a very high proportion of self-validation, the whole reputation of Defence is impugned. My view is that this needs to be diligently worked through and the respectable people in the Defence Force need to be protected by proper probity and governance. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (18:33):  It seems that hardly a day goes by without seeing or hearing a report in the media about a tragic event occurring in an indigenous community somewhere across our nation. The epidemic of suicide in indigenous communities has been a particular focus of some reporting this week, following the tragic suicide of a 37-year-old mother of three children in Kalgoorlie, in my home state of Western Australia. The local indigenous community in this key regional WA centre has already witnessed tragedy this year with the death of 14-year-old, Elijah Doughty. The suicide that has been reported this week occurred at the site of the incident that claimed Elijah's life, further compounding the tragedy and sense of grief amongst the local community.


I am also aware that tomorrow the Minister for Health and Aged Care, Sussan Ley, the Minister for Indigenous Affairs, Senator Scullion, and the Assistant Minister for Health and Aged Care, Ken Wyatt, are going to be in Western Australia's Kimberley region to hold a roundtable to discuss indigenous suicide prevention strategies. Given the multiple tragedies that have been experienced in Western Australia in this regard over the last year, this will be a critical and timely discussion. I also hope it is going to be a frank discussion of the, because I think we all have to agree that things cannot continue as they have been. 


But, of course, suicide prevention is just one area where indigenous communities in Western Australia and elsewhere across our country experience particular challenges and continue to experience poor outcomes. The health difficulties faced by those living in indigenous communities and the resultant lower life expectancy, the housing issues, poor educational results and difficulties in obtaining employment are all areas that have been well-ventilated in public policy discussions over many decades now.


Any stranger visiting these shores for the first time who was presented with a statistical snapshot of what is happening in some of our indigenous communities might conclude that this is an uncaring nation—might conclude an indifference to the plight of some of our most vulnerable fellow citizens. But, of course, we know that such a conclusion would be erroneous. The problem is not a lack of compassion or concern from our fellow Australians. It is not a lack of awareness. It is not even a lack of funding or lack of institutional support from government and non-government organisations.


There is an old saying that 'the road to hell is paved with good intentions', and when it comes to improving the lives of indigenous Australians we suffer no deficit of good intentions. However, it is clearly time to take a step back and measure the effectiveness of many of the things we are doing and many of the things that have been done, because it is clear that simply continuing to spend money in the same way we have been—without adequately evaluating the effectiveness of programs—is not delivering the right outcomes and is not reversing indigenous disadvantage.


This evening, I would like to draw the Senate's attention to a recently released research report from The Centre for Independent Studies, Mapping the Indigenous program and funding maze. It is a very accessible and compelling read, though not a happy one. What it shows, convincingly, is that for all the plethora of programs designed to address indigenous disadvantage and all the billions of dollars that have been invested in them, the return on that investment has been poor.


I should point out that criticisms along these lines are coming from Indigenous leaders themselves. Patrick Green, an Indigenous community leader from Fitzroy Crossing in WA, has noted:


If it’s $1 that leaves Canberra, what is it that hits Fitzroy Crossing—10c, 20c?


…   …   …


They probably need to have a look at how their policies are working and they need to have indicators on how those funds are rolled out …


Similar criticisms have been made by the Indigenous leaders who contributed to the Wunan Foundation's Empowered Communities report in 2015, which noted:


Vast swathes of funding are absorbed by the red tape of administration within the government bureaucracy, and on the ‘middlemen’ between government and Indigenous people.


The report that has now been produced by the Centre For Independent Studies contains multiple real-life examples of where money is not always going to areas of greatest need and where a heavily centralised approach is not adequately respecting input from Indigenous people themselves into program design and delivery.


One such example noted in the report also come to my own attention through a report from the Australian National Audit Office at the end of 2015 into the operation of the Indigenous Home Ownership Program. The program itself has a worthy objective: to facilitate home ownership among Indigenous Australians by addressing barriers such as lower incomes and savings pools, credit issues and limited experience with loan repayments. In essence, the program is designed to make basic home loans available to Indigenous Australians who, because of those factors I have just outlined, might otherwise struggle to obtain one.


However, the National Audit Office report found this objective was not being met. It found funding is not being directed where it is most needed and that loans are increasingly provided to medium- and high-income earners, people who would quite easily qualify for a home loan from a mainstream banking institution. Yet the program's administrator, Indigenous Business Australia, does not generally conform with other lenders that a customer cannot access mainstream finance, even though this is considered a key eligibility threshold  for the Indigenous Home Ownership Program. In fact, the National Audit Office report recommended the government consider whether, after 40 years of operation, a government-run loan program is any longer necessary or the most efficient way to improve the rates of Indigenous home ownership. The response from Indigenous Business Australia to this suggestion was decidedly mute, as was its response to previous reports criticising its Indigenous business loan program. In 2013-14, it approved a grand total of 75 loans—around one loan for every bureaucrat employed to administer it. Surely, we can do better than this?


These are just two examples from the litany that were examined by the research of the Centre for Independent Studies. Time and again, there is evidence presented which suggests that many Indigenous programs are being established and evolving in response to perceived need. As a result, there are a plethora of programs coming on stream which duplicate existing programs. The lack of requirement for evidence based funding is leading to expenditure growth with no commensurate improvement in outcomes.


The CIS report identified a total of 1,082 Indigenous-specific programs. Of these, 49 are funded federally, 236 are delivered by state and territory governments, and 797 are delivered by non-government organisations, though often with funding that comes from governments. Of the 1,082 programs, just 88—eight per cent—have been audited or evaluated in any meaningful way to determine the effectiveness of their outcomes. Given the waste, mismanagement and ineffectiveness that has been found in those programs which have been evaluated, the fact that 92 percent have not been evaluated should be alarming to all of us. All up, these programs are estimated to cost taxpayers at least $5.9 billion every year—but Indigenous people are seeing precious little benefit from these large investments of taxpayers' dollars.


At the same time, even more taxpayer money is being spent by advocacy groups to pursue political outcomes that will deliver no tangible benefit to health and education outcomes across Indigenous communities. Take the Recognise campaign as a shining example. It was established to raise awareness of proposals to recognise Indigenous Australians in the Constitution. After four years and around $20 million in funding from taxpayers, research that was released by the Recognise campaign itself in May this year showed that awareness has actually fallen—down 10 per cent among Indigenous people and down 13 per cent among non-Indigenous people.



As someone who pays close attention to constitutional debates, I cannot recall seeing a single TV advertisement, receiving any leaflets in my mailbox or being doorknocked by this taxpayer funded campaign operation. So where has the $20 million gone? What is Recognise actually doing to meet its supposed objective of raising awareness? Why is awareness falling? Why is Recognise continuing to actively recruit paid field staff to campaign when there is no referendum question finalised and the referendum itself appears to have been delayed? It is a textbook example of why providing taxpayers' money to third parties to fund their political campaigns is a bad idea. (Time expired)
