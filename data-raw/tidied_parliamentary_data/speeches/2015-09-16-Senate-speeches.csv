Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia) (09:31):  Previously in my speech on the Tax and Superannuation Laws Amendment (2015 Measures No. 4) Bill 2015, I was reflecting on how the government was continuing with the previous Labor government's initiative, first announced in the 2013 federal budget. Of course, quickly after coming to government on 6 November 2013 the coalition government announced that it would also continue to enact this measure.


The government's decision to proceed with the increase to the small or lost members' superannuation account threshold is a sensible measure. I have no trouble saying that of course, and I am sure my colleagues on this side have no trouble in saying that. When the Labor Party puts forward a sensible idea—one that will modernise the economy and benefit consumers—the coalition is prepared to back it. What a shame, of course, that the reverse is not true. What a shame that those opposite have consistently and trenchantly fought this government's attempts to make sensible reforms to get the budget back under control and to pay down debt. What a pity that more recently the opposition has been engaged in a despicable campaign against the free trade agreement with China, a campaign designed and run at the behest of xenophobes within the CFMEU and other of the Labor Party's financial enablers. I make that point only in passing, but I think it is an important one on which to start the day.


The changes in this bill are complemented by the other measures that will reduce red tape for superannuation funds by removing redundant reporting obligations and by streamlining some of the lost and unclaimed superannuation administrative arrangements. These changes include updating the definition of 'uncontactable' to account for contemporary forms of member communication—for example, email or online communications; supporting eligible rollover funds proactively consolidating lost accounts; and allowing direct payments of lost super held by the ATO to persons with a terminal illness.


These changes will enhance the nation's superannuation system by making it easier for individuals to be reunited with their lost and unclaimed superannuation. That can only be a good thing. To the fullest extent possible, superannuation should benefit the people who earn the money, and it should not be a sneaky way for governments to raise revenue.


I know the Australian Taxation Office has made extensive efforts with regard to uniting Australian workers with their lost superannuation accounts through an online service, and I am sure those efforts will continue. It is an area where, quite frankly, I think superannuation funds should also be proactive, just from a customer service point of view. But of course, that is a discussion for another time and is outside the limited scope of this bill. However, the changes contained within the bill underscore the point that the coalition government is committed to ensuring that money Australians have saved for their retirement through superannuation is preserved and is available for their own use in retirement, rather than being depleted by account fees and charges. They are changes driven by a sense of fairness and improving the sustainability of the nation's taxation and superannuation structures. They are entirely consistent with the government's overarching economic approach and values, and I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Canavan, Sen Matthew",Nats,2015-09-16,"



Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (09:35):  I know how passionate and supportive Senator Smith is of these particular changes. He was able to sum those up very concisely.


But I am also a passionate supporter of these changes to our tax and superannuation laws—particularly laws to facilitate scrip-for-scrip rollover and assist firms that would like to merge. That is a very important part of our economy—to assist those aspects and also to help protect people with low balances in their superannuation accounts.


These are relatively small changes to our overall tax system, but they are important ones nonetheless. The coalition government is committed to fairness and sustainability in our tax and superannuation systems. We announced that we would deal with a backlog of tax measures when we came into government. Some of the decisions in this bill deal with decisions that were actually made by the previous Labor government. They were largely uncontroversial and ones that we were happy to support. But there was a very large backlog of measures that were there in our tax system which had not been dealt with when we came to government. So I applaud the government for bringing this forward and dealing with these issues.


This Tax and Superannuation Laws Amendment (2015 Measures No. 4) Bill 2015 incorporates changes that are covered in three schedules. The first schedule removes unintended consequences in the tax system, schedule 2 outlines protection for lost superannuation accounts with low balances and schedule 3 helps to ensure that everyone pays the right and correct amount of tax.


A large part of this bill ensures that our tax laws are robust and cannot be circumvented for an unfair personal or corporate gain. Of course, as situations change and new information comes to light our tax system should change accordingly. These amendments undertake tax changes that make our tax system fairer and more robust, and they are important integrity measures that will eliminate unintended consequences.


The overview of this bill incorporates three schedules, as I said. I will just expand a bit further on each of those. Schedule 1 includes improving the integrity of the scrip-for scrip-rollover provisions. These are provisions that tackle the tax treatment of equity transfers in a merger situation. Where two companies merge there is a potential transfer of equity ownership between the parties involved in the merger rather than a cash transfer per se. That, of course, makes it more difficult for the tax system to deal with those transfers. But we have laws to deal with scrip-for-scrip rollover issues at the moment, and these laws will help to improve the integrity of those processes in a merger situation.


Schedule 1 amends the scrip-for-scrip rollover rules to ensure they are better targeted and work as intended. The measure is an integrity measure which ensures that opportunities for entities to defer tax indefinitely are removed. Scrip-for-scrip rollover rules provide tax relief for certain merger and acquisition transactions. They apply where shares or interest in a company or trust are exchanged for similar shares or interests. A tax ordinarily payable at the time of the exchange is deferred until the new shares or interests are sold. This reduces the cost of takeovers and mergers, as the acquiring entity does not need to compensate the share or interest holders for tax that would otherwise be payable.


The rollover ensures that tax is not an impediment to merger and acquisition activity taking place in Australia. Merger and acquisition activity is an important element of a functioning capital market, and a functioning capital market is extremely important for our economic growth and development. Integrity rules in a scrip-for-scrip rollover prevent entities accessing the tax relief in some circumstances—generally where both the acquiring entity and the entity being acquired are controlled by the same person or group.


A recent court decision highlighted that these integrity rules are not operating as intended, and that they were able to be circumvented. This was done by temporarily suppressing the ownership rights of related parties through a fresh issue of instruments. This measure in this bill strengthens these rules to ensure that entities cannot inappropriately access tax relief through this structure. These strengthened rules will help protect integrity and apply to both companies and trusts. Further, the measure also changes the treatment of some acquisitions—so-called 'downstream' acquisitions—which involve the use of debt to reduce an amount of tax payable.


These amendments are required to ensure that the rollover cannot be inappropriately accessed, to overcome issues with the use of debt in some transactions and to ensure that the rules apply to both company and trust restructures. These amendments are narrowly targeted and will impact only those merger and acquisition transactions which inappropriately access rollover relief. As a result, they are not expected to make restructures more difficult in Australia.


The Treasury's corporate and international tax division have advised that this measure is not expected to impact small businesses at all. There is an unquantifiable but potentially large revenue protection associated with these amendments. That protection will depend on the mergers that it does impact. They would be very difficult to estimate, because merger and acquisition activity goes up and down considerably and varies from year to year depending on the economic climate. But it is important to make sure that we keep the integrity of our tax system and build confidence that our tax system applies equally to everybody in our economy—companies, households, business that are merging—and this small measure will help to improve that integrity.


Schedule 2 of the bill is an amendment to incorporate the exemption of income earned in overseas employment. Schedule 2 will apply to those who are an Australian resident for income tax purposes while overseas. The measure removes an income tax exemption that is currently being accessed by Australian government employees who are posted overseas for more than 90 days to deliver official development assistance. The intent of this income tax exemption is to provide relief from double taxation, but it no longer has this effect. Instead, it now acts to provide a tax break for many Australians who are not liable to pay income tax on their foreign earnings in Australia or in the overseas country.


In the 2009-10 budget the former Labor government announced the tightening of the eligibility for this income tax exemption. This measure will go one step further by ensuring that all government employees who deliver official development assistance overseas are subject to Australian income tax on their pay and allowances. The change will take effect from 1 July 2016. This change will not affect the taxation arrangements for private sector aid workers or charity workers and it will not affect the Australian Defence Force and the Australian Federal Police. These groups will maintain their existing eligibility for an income tax exemption on income earned while working overseas. This particular measure was announced in last year's budget and expects to result in a gain to revenue of $6.7 million over the forward estimates.


We are lucky to have a tax system which generally works and a personal income tax system which applies in a progressive and in an overall fair way for most Australians. This income tax exemption was introduced for a valid reason—that is, to ensure that people who were working overseas were not taxed in the country that they were working in as well as in the country of their residence, Australia. But over time it has been highlighted that this tax exemption has become more of a tax break for certain Australians who travel overseas to work. It has particularly meant that government employees who claim this exemption have not been liable to pay income tax either in Australia or overseas. The practical effect is that some government employees are eligible for an income tax exemption on foreign earnings while others are liable to pay income tax. This bill will ensure that all government employees who deliver official development assistance are subject to Australian income tax on their pay and allowances. The amendment will take effect from 1 July next year and will standardise the tax treatment for government employees across the sector.


In the context of some of the controversy over the past year about the fairness of our tax system, largely involving large corporations, it is still important that we maintain the integrity of the system across individuals as well to ensure we all pay our fair share of tax, and this is a reasonable change that I hope will be supported.


Schedule 3 deals with small balances in superannuation accounts. It is important to first put some facts on the table about superannuation, particularly small superannuation balances that may be classified as lost. Under the current arrangements a super fund will not be considered lost, even if it has a small balance, if the individual holding the account has confirmed their current address within the previous two years of membership, taken a positive action such as deferring a benefit in the fund, or contacted their superannuation provider and indicated that they wish to continue to be a member. The unclaimed super rules do not apply to amounts above the threshold or to self-managed super funds or defined benefit funds.


Superannuation is important to all Australians. We are living longer and we can expect, given current actuarial tables, that if we make it to the ripe old age of 65 we will probably have at least another 20 years on this planet. People need to plan for that eventuality, and our superannuation system helps them do that. We do not have a crystal ball to show what may happen in the future, but we need to have superannuation policies that allow people to retire and have some money to support themselves and not rely simply on a government pension. Most super funds have put together a retirement standard, which one could use to calculate how much one would need to live off in retirement, that takes into account the usual expenses for a retiree who owns their own home. This is why the coalition government has introduced tax and superannuation laws to assist people to increase their superannuation account balances and to make it more accountable.


It is important that Australians keep track of their super. Many Australians who have changed their name, address or job have lost track of some of their super. Having several super accounts means they are not maximising their super and are reducing their overall superannuation investment through multiple fees and charges. If you are in this situation, you can use the SuperSeeker search tool to find out the balances that you currently have and ensure that they do not become lost.


This final schedule of the bill deals with these lost small superannuation account balances. If they are inactive for a certain period of time, they will be transferred to the Australian Taxation Office. This measure was announced by the former Labor government in the 2013-14 budget, the last budget of that government. However, they did not pass legislation for this measure. On 6 November 2013, not long after the new government was elected, we announced that we would enact this measure as part of a broader suite of measures that were previously declared but unlegislated by the parliament.


Currently the law states that lost member super accounts with less than $2,000 must be transferred from superannuation funds to the ATO as unclaimed superannuation money. This measure will increase the $2,000 threshold in two phases—first, to $4,000 from 31 December 2015 and then to $6,000 from 31 December 2016. Lost super is a super account held by a super fund where the fund has lost contact with the member or the account has been idle for more than five years.


We know that when employees get into super about 70 per cent are members of the default fund offered by their employer. When people switch jobs they often end up with a new super account and fail to consolidate these existing accounts. As a result, many people end up with more superannuation accounts than they want or need. According to the ATO, 45 per cent of working Australians have more than one superannuation account. In many cases members are not even aware that they have lost super accounts.


For super accounts with smaller balances, the cost of fees and charges and insurance premiums can exceed investment returns. This can be particularly problematic for lost super accounts because, in most cases, the members are not aware that they have these accounts and they can end up losing money that was meant for their retirement. Transferring lost super accounts with low balances to the ATO helps protect such accounts and preserves their value until they can be reunited with the member. The ATO does not charge any fees for maintaining these accounts. Individuals are able to reclaim their super money from the ATO at any time and are paid interest calculated in accordance with the consumer price index when they reclaim this money.


In the 2015-16 budget the government announced six measures that will reduce red tape for superannuation funds by removing redundant reporting obligations and by streamlining some of the lost and unclaimed superannuation administrative arrangements. These include updating the definition of 'uncontactable' to account for contemporary forms of member communication—for example, to include online communication; supporting eligible rollover funds; proactively consolidating lost accounts; and allowing direct payments of lost super accounts held by the ATO to persons with a terminal illness. These changes will make it easier for individuals to be reunited with their lost and unclaimed superannuation.


The ATO has a range of strategies in place which aim to reunite members with lost and unclaimed superannuation accounts and reduce the number of unnecessary and inactive accounts in the superannuation system. Some of the strategies are matching superannuation accounts to an individual, providing this information on an online portal, and proactively working with super funds to ensure that they have updated addresses and contact details for their lost members. The estimated total fiscal impact of this measure is $483.9 million over the forward estimates. These strategies are very important to make sure that people are kept in contact with, and that is why it was announced that we would continue these measures and would continue to improve transparency in our tax system.


I would also say that the issue of multiple superannuation accounts is one that the government has taken some action on since coming to government. We have made it easier for small businesses to have their superannuation forms consolidated and filled out by the Australian Taxation Office, not themselves. One of the issues with multiple superannuation accounts is that sometimes small businesses suffer under large amounts of red tape when they need to allocate their component of superannuation payments to different accounts. Now they can apply to the ATO so that the ATO will handle that amount of red tape. They simply have to transfer the appropriate superannuation guarantee amounts to the tax office, which will handle it from there.


I think that this can be built on in the future. I agree with Peter Strong from the Council of Small Business Australia that it is unusual and a little strange that each of us when we start a job—my first job was at McDonald's—gets put in a superannuation account. As I said, more than 70 per cent of Australians just go with a default account. That is what I did at the time. And you end up with these small super accounts all over the place, connected to different employer superannuation funds. It is strange that a system that is meant to take into account my retirement and that of other Australians is handled so much by the employer, not me, so that the superannuation account depends on the employer you work for, not who you are and what your individual savings plan for your retirement might be. So, it seems to me to make a lot of sense that when an individual starts work they are perhaps put in a default fund, not necessarily connected to an employer. There are now MySuper accounts and other small and basic superannuation accounts that could perhaps serve that purpose. And then I, the employee, would decide whether I wanted to change from that account at any particular time. Just because I moved after a year—I was not very good at flipping burgers; I did not get the sack, but I left McDonald's and went to work at a car wash—why should my superannuation change just by doing that? It should change only if I make the decision to change it, and there is no reason we could not have a system whereby you are in a default account at any particular time and if you want to change it is not about changing your job; it is about simply changing those details with the Australian Taxation Office.


And we could build on that system we have introduced to ensure that businesses themselves would therefore not have to be interfaced with the superannuation system. They can get back to their job, which is about providing a service, producing a product, and employing people, and all they then need to worry about is transferring the relevant superannuation amounts to the taxation office, which would then put them in the appropriate accounts according to what an individual wanted and needed.

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women) (09:55):  I would like to thank those senators who have contributed to this debate. This bill is part of the government's plan to modernise our tax and superannuation laws and remove laws that are no longer working or appropriate. Schedule 1 to this bill will help improve the operation of the scrip-for-scrip rollover rules where shares or interests in one entity are exchanged for similar shares or interests by ensuring that the integrity measures are better targeted. A recent decision in the full Federal Court of Australia highlighted that integrity measure in the rollover rules were not operating as intended and could be circumvented. It is important to ensure that a rollover is available only where it is appropriate—for instance, where an entity seeks to structure its affairs in such a way that tax is indefinitely deferred. Schedule 1 to this bill will amend the special integrity rules of the scrip-for-scrip rollover relief. These new rules will also apply to restructures involving trusts and will ensure that integrity rules cannot be avoided.


It is also important to ensure integrity in the personal income tax system. Schedule 2 to this bill will update the tax law to ensure that government employees who earn an income while delivering official development assistance overseas are subject to income tax on those earnings through the Australian personal income tax system. This income tax exemption was introduced to protect against the double taxation of income, but the operation of intergovernmental tax agreements now effectively means that some Australians are able to avoid paying income tax in both Australia and the overseas country. This bill will remove an unintended consequence in the personal income taxation system and make the system fairer by ensuring that some people are not able to obtain an inappropriate tax exemption. Defence and police personnel as well as private sector and charity workers delivering official development assistance overseas will maintain that current eligibility for the income tax exemption.


The final amendment presented in this bill will help to ensure that lost member superannuation accounts with smaller balances are not eroded by fees, charges and insurance premiums. In general, lost super is a super account held by a super fund where the fund has lost contact with the member or the account has been idle for more than five years. Small lost accounts must be transferred to the ATO as unclaimed money. Transferring lost super accounts with low balances to the ATO helps protect such accounts from fee erosion and preserves their value until they can be reunited with the member. Individuals are able to reclaim this super money from the ATO at any time and are paid interest. Presently, lost member super accounts with less than $2,000 must be transferred from funds to the ATO as unclaimed superannuation money. This bill will increase the $2,000 threshold in two phases: first, to $4,000 from 31 December 2015, and then to $6,000 from 31 December 2016. These changes will help ensure that small lost member super account balances remain available to improve retirement incomes. It is only fair that this money is preserved for its original purpose, and that is of course to benefit members in retirement.


This bill makes Australia's tax and superannuation laws more modern and robust by removing or amending provisions that are no longer appropriate or no longer have the intended effect. I commend this bill to the Senate.

Senator RHIANNON

(2) Schedule 2, page 8 (lines 1 to 11), to be opposed.


This is an issue that I did cover in the second reading debate. It addresses the issue of overseas employment. Effectively, it would remove the exemption for some, but not all, overseas employees. This is where I do request clarification from the minister, because from my  reading of the bill the tax exemptions would be retained for workers in private NGOs, the Australian Federal Police and the military. While the Greens can see merit in having consistency in our tax laws, why is there this inconsistency in this piece of legislation?


When you look at it it looks as though this is just one small aspect, but it appears that it could be quite significant. It certainly looks as though it is buried in there, that we have this measure that really does create a two-tier system. It penalises workers who choose to work for the government in delivering overseas development assistance. And this is my direct question that I put to the minister: is it the case that workers in private NGOs, the Australian Federal Police and the military will retain their tax exemption status? And why should not all government employees, or all employees who are working under overseas development systems, be treated in the same way?

 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women) (10:01):  Thank you, Senator Rhiannon, for the question. I am instructed that in relation to your question, Australian Defence Force and Australian Federal Police personnel access an income tax exemption under a different provision in the income tax law, and that provision will not be affected by this amendment. I am also advised that DFAT has recently made administrative amendments to exclude their employees from accessing an income tax exemption on income earned in delivering ODA overseas. DFAT has clarified this position via an ATO private ruling.


As a result, this amendment is not expected to affect DFAT staff as they are already ineligible for the exemption. This change puts public service staff who deliver overseas development assistance on the same footing. I will just see if there are any further instructions or advice that I can get from the Treasury officials. No—thank you, Senator Rhiannon.

I understand that the Australian Federal Police and the military are separate, but I do just want that clarification about DFAT.


From my reading of the legislation there seems to be a two-tier system here. There is one for the private NGOs, for whom the tax exemption is being retained. I assume that is what you just explained when you talked about DFAT having a private ruling from the ATO—that DFAT workers, who are not private NGOs but who are already workers who come under overseas development assistance, do not come under this tax exemption and they lose out. So, I still understand that it is a two-tier system for DFAT people with regard to ODA, depending on whether they are employed by the government or not. That is what I am trying to get clarified.

Around 55 per cent of the Australian Public Service employees who accessed the ODA provision in 2011-12 were employed by AusAID, which is now, of course, part of DFAT.

Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (10:09):  I will just indicate that Labor will be opposing the Greens amendment on sheet 7763. As Senator Cameron stated in his second reading debate speech on behalf of the Labor Party, schedule 2 is the exemption of income earned in overseas employment


The opposition supports this bill's efforts to boost the integrity of our personal tax system by standardising the tax treatment for workers delivering overseas development assistance. This integrity measure improves the consistency of our personal income tax system by upholding the principle that Australians should pay tax on their earnings somewhere. 


As a general rule, Australian resident individuals are taxed on their worldwide income through the Australian personal income tax system; however, under the current law all employees of an Australian government agency who work overseas for not less than 91 continuous days delivering official development assistance are exempt from the payment of income tax on the income they have earned while overseas. This provision was originally introduced to provide relief from double taxation—that is, in terms of liabilities in both Australia and the source country—however, the provision no longer serves this purpose, with Australians working overseas often able to avoid income tax in both jurisdictions. As such this measure unifies the tax treatment of all Australian government agency employees by subjecting their income derived in the delivery of ODA overseas to Australian income tax. Notably, Australian Defence Force personnel, Australian Federal Police personnel and individuals delivering official development assistance for a charity or a private sector contracting firm will still maintain eligibility for the exemption, despite these changes.

This is precisely why we have raised our objection to schedule 2—because we do not have that here. I will not repeat the arguments in detail, but when it comes to ODA there is a two-tier system. It needs to be put on the record again that the AFP, military and some private NGOs who receive ODA are exempt so we do not have a standardised system. There is an inconsistency within one category that has been brought to our attention.




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Smith
):  The question is that schedule 2 stand as printed.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (10:19):  The result of that vote means that Senator Rhiannon is no longer required to move her first amendment. Is that correct, Senator Rhiannon?

Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia) (09:31):  Previously in my speech on the Tax and Superannuation Laws Amendment (2015 Measures No. 4) Bill 2015, I was reflecting on how the government was continuing with the previous Labor government's initiative, first announced in the 2013 federal budget. Of course, quickly after coming to government on 6 November 2013 the coalition government announced that it would also continue to enact this measure.


The government's decision to proceed with the increase to the small or lost members' superannuation account threshold is a sensible measure. I have no trouble saying that of course, and I am sure my colleagues on this side have no trouble in saying that. When the Labor Party puts forward a sensible idea—one that will modernise the economy and benefit consumers—the coalition is prepared to back it. What a shame, of course, that the reverse is not true. What a shame that those opposite have consistently and trenchantly fought this government's attempts to make sensible reforms to get the budget back under control and to pay down debt. What a pity that more recently the opposition has been engaged in a despicable campaign against the free trade agreement with China, a campaign designed and run at the behest of xenophobes within the CFMEU and other of the Labor Party's financial enablers. I make that point only in passing, but I think it is an important one on which to start the day.


The changes in this bill are complemented by the other measures that will reduce red tape for superannuation funds by removing redundant reporting obligations and by streamlining some of the lost and unclaimed superannuation administrative arrangements. These changes include updating the definition of 'uncontactable' to account for contemporary forms of member communication—for example, email or online communications; supporting eligible rollover funds proactively consolidating lost accounts; and allowing direct payments of lost super held by the ATO to persons with a terminal illness.


These changes will enhance the nation's superannuation system by making it easier for individuals to be reunited with their lost and unclaimed superannuation. That can only be a good thing. To the fullest extent possible, superannuation should benefit the people who earn the money, and it should not be a sneaky way for governments to raise revenue.


I know the Australian Taxation Office has made extensive efforts with regard to uniting Australian workers with their lost superannuation accounts through an online service, and I am sure those efforts will continue. It is an area where, quite frankly, I think superannuation funds should also be proactive, just from a customer service point of view. But of course, that is a discussion for another time and is outside the limited scope of this bill. However, the changes contained within the bill underscore the point that the coalition government is committed to ensuring that money Australians have saved for their retirement through superannuation is preserved and is available for their own use in retirement, rather than being depleted by account fees and charges. They are changes driven by a sense of fairness and improving the sustainability of the nation's taxation and superannuation structures. They are entirely consistent with the government's overarching economic approach and values, and I commend the bill to the Senate.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Canavan, Sen Matthew",Nats,2015-09-16,"



Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (09:35):  I know how passionate and supportive Senator Smith is of these particular changes. He was able to sum those up very concisely.


But I am also a passionate supporter of these changes to our tax and superannuation laws—particularly laws to facilitate scrip-for-scrip rollover and assist firms that would like to merge. That is a very important part of our economy—to assist those aspects and also to help protect people with low balances in their superannuation accounts.


These are relatively small changes to our overall tax system, but they are important ones nonetheless. The coalition government is committed to fairness and sustainability in our tax and superannuation systems. We announced that we would deal with a backlog of tax measures when we came into government. Some of the decisions in this bill deal with decisions that were actually made by the previous Labor government. They were largely uncontroversial and ones that we were happy to support. But there was a very large backlog of measures that were there in our tax system which had not been dealt with when we came to government. So I applaud the government for bringing this forward and dealing with these issues.


This Tax and Superannuation Laws Amendment (2015 Measures No. 4) Bill 2015 incorporates changes that are covered in three schedules. The first schedule removes unintended consequences in the tax system, schedule 2 outlines protection for lost superannuation accounts with low balances and schedule 3 helps to ensure that everyone pays the right and correct amount of tax.


A large part of this bill ensures that our tax laws are robust and cannot be circumvented for an unfair personal or corporate gain. Of course, as situations change and new information comes to light our tax system should change accordingly. These amendments undertake tax changes that make our tax system fairer and more robust, and they are important integrity measures that will eliminate unintended consequences.


The overview of this bill incorporates three schedules, as I said. I will just expand a bit further on each of those. Schedule 1 includes improving the integrity of the scrip-for scrip-rollover provisions. These are provisions that tackle the tax treatment of equity transfers in a merger situation. Where two companies merge there is a potential transfer of equity ownership between the parties involved in the merger rather than a cash transfer per se. That, of course, makes it more difficult for the tax system to deal with those transfers. But we have laws to deal with scrip-for-scrip rollover issues at the moment, and these laws will help to improve the integrity of those processes in a merger situation.


Schedule 1 amends the scrip-for-scrip rollover rules to ensure they are better targeted and work as intended. The measure is an integrity measure which ensures that opportunities for entities to defer tax indefinitely are removed. Scrip-for-scrip rollover rules provide tax relief for certain merger and acquisition transactions. They apply where shares or interest in a company or trust are exchanged for similar shares or interests. A tax ordinarily payable at the time of the exchange is deferred until the new shares or interests are sold. This reduces the cost of takeovers and mergers, as the acquiring entity does not need to compensate the share or interest holders for tax that would otherwise be payable.


The rollover ensures that tax is not an impediment to merger and acquisition activity taking place in Australia. Merger and acquisition activity is an important element of a functioning capital market, and a functioning capital market is extremely important for our economic growth and development. Integrity rules in a scrip-for-scrip rollover prevent entities accessing the tax relief in some circumstances—generally where both the acquiring entity and the entity being acquired are controlled by the same person or group.


A recent court decision highlighted that these integrity rules are not operating as intended, and that they were able to be circumvented. This was done by temporarily suppressing the ownership rights of related parties through a fresh issue of instruments. This measure in this bill strengthens these rules to ensure that entities cannot inappropriately access tax relief through this structure. These strengthened rules will help protect integrity and apply to both companies and trusts. Further, the measure also changes the treatment of some acquisitions—so-called 'downstream' acquisitions—which involve the use of debt to reduce an amount of tax payable.


These amendments are required to ensure that the rollover cannot be inappropriately accessed, to overcome issues with the use of debt in some transactions and to ensure that the rules apply to both company and trust restructures. These amendments are narrowly targeted and will impact only those merger and acquisition transactions which inappropriately access rollover relief. As a result, they are not expected to make restructures more difficult in Australia.


The Treasury's corporate and international tax division have advised that this measure is not expected to impact small businesses at all. There is an unquantifiable but potentially large revenue protection associated with these amendments. That protection will depend on the mergers that it does impact. They would be very difficult to estimate, because merger and acquisition activity goes up and down considerably and varies from year to year depending on the economic climate. But it is important to make sure that we keep the integrity of our tax system and build confidence that our tax system applies equally to everybody in our economy—companies, households, business that are merging—and this small measure will help to improve that integrity.


Schedule 2 of the bill is an amendment to incorporate the exemption of income earned in overseas employment. Schedule 2 will apply to those who are an Australian resident for income tax purposes while overseas. The measure removes an income tax exemption that is currently being accessed by Australian government employees who are posted overseas for more than 90 days to deliver official development assistance. The intent of this income tax exemption is to provide relief from double taxation, but it no longer has this effect. Instead, it now acts to provide a tax break for many Australians who are not liable to pay income tax on their foreign earnings in Australia or in the overseas country.


In the 2009-10 budget the former Labor government announced the tightening of the eligibility for this income tax exemption. This measure will go one step further by ensuring that all government employees who deliver official development assistance overseas are subject to Australian income tax on their pay and allowances. The change will take effect from 1 July 2016. This change will not affect the taxation arrangements for private sector aid workers or charity workers and it will not affect the Australian Defence Force and the Australian Federal Police. These groups will maintain their existing eligibility for an income tax exemption on income earned while working overseas. This particular measure was announced in last year's budget and expects to result in a gain to revenue of $6.7 million over the forward estimates.


We are lucky to have a tax system which generally works and a personal income tax system which applies in a progressive and in an overall fair way for most Australians. This income tax exemption was introduced for a valid reason—that is, to ensure that people who were working overseas were not taxed in the country that they were working in as well as in the country of their residence, Australia. But over time it has been highlighted that this tax exemption has become more of a tax break for certain Australians who travel overseas to work. It has particularly meant that government employees who claim this exemption have not been liable to pay income tax either in Australia or overseas. The practical effect is that some government employees are eligible for an income tax exemption on foreign earnings while others are liable to pay income tax. This bill will ensure that all government employees who deliver official development assistance are subject to Australian income tax on their pay and allowances. The amendment will take effect from 1 July next year and will standardise the tax treatment for government employees across the sector.


In the context of some of the controversy over the past year about the fairness of our tax system, largely involving large corporations, it is still important that we maintain the integrity of the system across individuals as well to ensure we all pay our fair share of tax, and this is a reasonable change that I hope will be supported.


Schedule 3 deals with small balances in superannuation accounts. It is important to first put some facts on the table about superannuation, particularly small superannuation balances that may be classified as lost. Under the current arrangements a super fund will not be considered lost, even if it has a small balance, if the individual holding the account has confirmed their current address within the previous two years of membership, taken a positive action such as deferring a benefit in the fund, or contacted their superannuation provider and indicated that they wish to continue to be a member. The unclaimed super rules do not apply to amounts above the threshold or to self-managed super funds or defined benefit funds.


Superannuation is important to all Australians. We are living longer and we can expect, given current actuarial tables, that if we make it to the ripe old age of 65 we will probably have at least another 20 years on this planet. People need to plan for that eventuality, and our superannuation system helps them do that. We do not have a crystal ball to show what may happen in the future, but we need to have superannuation policies that allow people to retire and have some money to support themselves and not rely simply on a government pension. Most super funds have put together a retirement standard, which one could use to calculate how much one would need to live off in retirement, that takes into account the usual expenses for a retiree who owns their own home. This is why the coalition government has introduced tax and superannuation laws to assist people to increase their superannuation account balances and to make it more accountable.


It is important that Australians keep track of their super. Many Australians who have changed their name, address or job have lost track of some of their super. Having several super accounts means they are not maximising their super and are reducing their overall superannuation investment through multiple fees and charges. If you are in this situation, you can use the SuperSeeker search tool to find out the balances that you currently have and ensure that they do not become lost.


This final schedule of the bill deals with these lost small superannuation account balances. If they are inactive for a certain period of time, they will be transferred to the Australian Taxation Office. This measure was announced by the former Labor government in the 2013-14 budget, the last budget of that government. However, they did not pass legislation for this measure. On 6 November 2013, not long after the new government was elected, we announced that we would enact this measure as part of a broader suite of measures that were previously declared but unlegislated by the parliament.


Currently the law states that lost member super accounts with less than $2,000 must be transferred from superannuation funds to the ATO as unclaimed superannuation money. This measure will increase the $2,000 threshold in two phases—first, to $4,000 from 31 December 2015 and then to $6,000 from 31 December 2016. Lost super is a super account held by a super fund where the fund has lost contact with the member or the account has been idle for more than five years.


We know that when employees get into super about 70 per cent are members of the default fund offered by their employer. When people switch jobs they often end up with a new super account and fail to consolidate these existing accounts. As a result, many people end up with more superannuation accounts than they want or need. According to the ATO, 45 per cent of working Australians have more than one superannuation account. In many cases members are not even aware that they have lost super accounts.


For super accounts with smaller balances, the cost of fees and charges and insurance premiums can exceed investment returns. This can be particularly problematic for lost super accounts because, in most cases, the members are not aware that they have these accounts and they can end up losing money that was meant for their retirement. Transferring lost super accounts with low balances to the ATO helps protect such accounts and preserves their value until they can be reunited with the member. The ATO does not charge any fees for maintaining these accounts. Individuals are able to reclaim their super money from the ATO at any time and are paid interest calculated in accordance with the consumer price index when they reclaim this money.


In the 2015-16 budget the government announced six measures that will reduce red tape for superannuation funds by removing redundant reporting obligations and by streamlining some of the lost and unclaimed superannuation administrative arrangements. These include updating the definition of 'uncontactable' to account for contemporary forms of member communication—for example, to include online communication; supporting eligible rollover funds; proactively consolidating lost accounts; and allowing direct payments of lost super accounts held by the ATO to persons with a terminal illness. These changes will make it easier for individuals to be reunited with their lost and unclaimed superannuation.


The ATO has a range of strategies in place which aim to reunite members with lost and unclaimed superannuation accounts and reduce the number of unnecessary and inactive accounts in the superannuation system. Some of the strategies are matching superannuation accounts to an individual, providing this information on an online portal, and proactively working with super funds to ensure that they have updated addresses and contact details for their lost members. The estimated total fiscal impact of this measure is $483.9 million over the forward estimates. These strategies are very important to make sure that people are kept in contact with, and that is why it was announced that we would continue these measures and would continue to improve transparency in our tax system.


I would also say that the issue of multiple superannuation accounts is one that the government has taken some action on since coming to government. We have made it easier for small businesses to have their superannuation forms consolidated and filled out by the Australian Taxation Office, not themselves. One of the issues with multiple superannuation accounts is that sometimes small businesses suffer under large amounts of red tape when they need to allocate their component of superannuation payments to different accounts. Now they can apply to the ATO so that the ATO will handle that amount of red tape. They simply have to transfer the appropriate superannuation guarantee amounts to the tax office, which will handle it from there.


I think that this can be built on in the future. I agree with Peter Strong from the Council of Small Business Australia that it is unusual and a little strange that each of us when we start a job—my first job was at McDonald's—gets put in a superannuation account. As I said, more than 70 per cent of Australians just go with a default account. That is what I did at the time. And you end up with these small super accounts all over the place, connected to different employer superannuation funds. It is strange that a system that is meant to take into account my retirement and that of other Australians is handled so much by the employer, not me, so that the superannuation account depends on the employer you work for, not who you are and what your individual savings plan for your retirement might be. So, it seems to me to make a lot of sense that when an individual starts work they are perhaps put in a default fund, not necessarily connected to an employer. There are now MySuper accounts and other small and basic superannuation accounts that could perhaps serve that purpose. And then I, the employee, would decide whether I wanted to change from that account at any particular time. Just because I moved after a year—I was not very good at flipping burgers; I did not get the sack, but I left McDonald's and went to work at a car wash—why should my superannuation change just by doing that? It should change only if I make the decision to change it, and there is no reason we could not have a system whereby you are in a default account at any particular time and if you want to change it is not about changing your job; it is about simply changing those details with the Australian Taxation Office.


And we could build on that system we have introduced to ensure that businesses themselves would therefore not have to be interfaced with the superannuation system. They can get back to their job, which is about providing a service, producing a product, and employing people, and all they then need to worry about is transferring the relevant superannuation amounts to the taxation office, which would then put them in the appropriate accounts according to what an individual wanted and needed.

"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2015-09-16,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women) (09:55):  I would like to thank those senators who have contributed to this debate. This bill is part of the government's plan to modernise our tax and superannuation laws and remove laws that are no longer working or appropriate. Schedule 1 to this bill will help improve the operation of the scrip-for-scrip rollover rules where shares or interests in one entity are exchanged for similar shares or interests by ensuring that the integrity measures are better targeted. A recent decision in the full Federal Court of Australia highlighted that integrity measure in the rollover rules were not operating as intended and could be circumvented. It is important to ensure that a rollover is available only where it is appropriate—for instance, where an entity seeks to structure its affairs in such a way that tax is indefinitely deferred. Schedule 1 to this bill will amend the special integrity rules of the scrip-for-scrip rollover relief. These new rules will also apply to restructures involving trusts and will ensure that integrity rules cannot be avoided.


It is also important to ensure integrity in the personal income tax system. Schedule 2 to this bill will update the tax law to ensure that government employees who earn an income while delivering official development assistance overseas are subject to income tax on those earnings through the Australian personal income tax system. This income tax exemption was introduced to protect against the double taxation of income, but the operation of intergovernmental tax agreements now effectively means that some Australians are able to avoid paying income tax in both Australia and the overseas country. This bill will remove an unintended consequence in the personal income taxation system and make the system fairer by ensuring that some people are not able to obtain an inappropriate tax exemption. Defence and police personnel as well as private sector and charity workers delivering official development assistance overseas will maintain that current eligibility for the income tax exemption.


The final amendment presented in this bill will help to ensure that lost member superannuation accounts with smaller balances are not eroded by fees, charges and insurance premiums. In general, lost super is a super account held by a super fund where the fund has lost contact with the member or the account has been idle for more than five years. Small lost accounts must be transferred to the ATO as unclaimed money. Transferring lost super accounts with low balances to the ATO helps protect such accounts from fee erosion and preserves their value until they can be reunited with the member. Individuals are able to reclaim this super money from the ATO at any time and are paid interest. Presently, lost member super accounts with less than $2,000 must be transferred from funds to the ATO as unclaimed superannuation money. This bill will increase the $2,000 threshold in two phases: first, to $4,000 from 31 December 2015, and then to $6,000 from 31 December 2016. These changes will help ensure that small lost member super account balances remain available to improve retirement incomes. It is only fair that this money is preserved for its original purpose, and that is of course to benefit members in retirement.


This bill makes Australia's tax and superannuation laws more modern and robust by removing or amending provisions that are no longer appropriate or no longer have the intended effect. I commend this bill to the Senate.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2015-09-16,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (12:45):  Australia emits less than 1.2 per cent of carbon of the total emissions from the world. Australia emits less than 1.2 per cent of the total world emission of carbon. Australia emits less than 1.2 per cent of the world's carbon emission. In politics we know that if you say something 20 times people will start to listen to you. The Senate may be pleased to know that I am not going to repeat that phrase—Australia emits less than 1.2 per cent of the world's carbon emissions—20 times in this speech.


I feel passionate about the fact that Australians must know, children must know, that Australia is a very small contributor, a tiny contributor, an infinitesimal contributor to the carbon emissions of the world. If you believe that man's emissions of carbon are the cause of the changing climate—and I do not enter into the debate, but let us assume that is correct—then by reducing Australia's emissions by five per cent, which the Liberal and Labor parties are proposing to do, the impact on the changing climate from man's emissions of carbon will be infinitesimal. Yet, why do we continue to destroy the Australian economy and Australian jobs, and export those Australian jobs overseas, by pretending that if Australia does something with climate change then the rest of the world will follow?


I am a proud and passionate Australian. I know that Australia leads the world in some things, like on the cricket pitch, occasionally, or on the rugby league or rugby union field, or as the Matildas do, or in some science areas. In some areas of our life Australia does lead the world. But, come on, you are not telling me that because Australia reduces its carbon emissions by, say, 50 per cent that, firstly, that is going to have any impact on the changing climate of the world and, secondly, that the rest of the world are going to say, 'Gee Australia's done that. We'd better do that as well.'


I have just come from a wonderful meeting with the Foreign Affairs Committee of the National People's Congress of China. They have confirmed that 70 per cent of China's energy comes from coal fired power stations. They have confirmed that they are encouraging more coal from Australia and Indonesia because of transport needs. They have indicated that they continue to build coal fired power stations in China. They are shutting down some smaller ones and building bigger new ones. They also said that the use of coal has been down by five per cent in recent times, but they clearly say that is because all energy is down due to the slight contraction of the Chinese economy. They say that they are increasing their nuclear sources of power from four per cent up to a planned, I think, nine per cent.


Clearly, to meet our target of a five per cent reduction by 2020, we have to reduce our emissions by 126 million tonnes from business as usual, limiting them to less than 550 million tonnes annually. China's annual emissions top 10,000 million tonnes—that is more than the US and Europe combined. China's emissions have been growing most years by more than the total emissions from Australia. Our meagre reduction can have no discernible effect on the total global emissions, let alone upon climate change. We argue on how to trim five per cent, which is effectively one per cent of global emissions, while China produces a third of the total global emissions, and it continues to build coal fired power stations.


When are we going to get some sense into this argument? I keep asking the Greens and the Labor Party, and I know they hear me when I say: 'Australia emits less than 1.2 per cent of the world carbon emission.' I know they hear me because they, at times, try very hesitantly to explain that we have to show that we are part of the world. I am sorry, but the world is not sitting there waiting for us to put pen to paper. Few serious countries outside the European Union are implementing any emission trading schemes. The fact is, and it is a crucial fact, it shows that there is no sign of this changing at any time in the future. Labor's preoccupation with an ETS is a testament to its political masochism and to the puerile nature of the Australian climate debate.


For almost a decade now, in a nation that will have little influence over international policy developments and no discernible effect on global climate patterns, this issue has been allowed to dominate domestic political debate and consume political leaders. It is a nonsensical debate. And I am concerned about the education of our children, because the children of Australia have been brainwashed into thinking that, if you turn off a light in Australia, somehow that is going to stop climate change. 


This is a puerile debate in the extreme. We have to bring some sense into the debate. Sure, if everybody else were reducing emissions down to the levels proposed by some, then Australia should do its part. I have never suggested otherwise. But Australia should not ruin its economy, or send workers' jobs overseas because of the Labor-Greens carbon tax and other stupid proposals from those parties into the future. The Greens will always, as they do, denigrate anyone who does not believe in their passion, in their view on life. They are pretty good at denigrating and belittling people who express their own, different views. But I have not been a climate change denier. Never have I denied the climate was changing, because, as I repeatedly say, Australia was once covered in ice; of course the climate changes. The centre of Australia was once a rainforest; of course the climate changes. It is something that has been happening since time immemorial. This new theory—I often refer to it as a fad, a farce or a hoax—that suddenly, since the start of the industrial age, that sort of change of climate is happening anew, is just farcical and fanciful. But I do not even enter into that debate. 


What I have to say to Australians—and to people in this parliament, in this government now and in future governments—is that Australia emits less than 1.2 per cent of the total world emissions of carbon. Australia emits less than 1.2 per cent of the world's emissions of carbon. I challenge anyone from the Greens political party or the Labor Party to tell me how reducing Australia's emissions by even, say, 50 per cent will have any discernible impact on the changing climate of the world. I await a response. I repeat: Australia emits less than 1.2 per cent of the world— (Time expired)

"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2015-09-16,"



Senator STERLE
 (Western Australia) (15:06):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Employment (Senator Abetz) and the Minister for Finance (Senator Cormann) to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today.



Honourable senators interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I think the discussion is now over. If all senators could simply either resume their seats, or those in the process of leaving the chamber should continue to do so.




Senator STERLE:
  I can understand emotions are running high after the crazy week we have seen with the knifing of a first-term Prime Minster. But I just want to touch on some of the questions put to ministers today that they did not answer. Senator Cormann was a repeat offender. He could not even answer, directly, how much money has been put aside—and where is it going to come from?—for this promise that has been made to the Nats.


The new Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull, who has prided himself on being environmentally friendly, has made a massive commitment to the Nats—at what price, I still do not know—to take water from environment and give it to Minister Joyce in agriculture. I do not know what was going on, in that room, to secure the deal but—crikey—it is going to end in tears.


It is very important to know why these deals are being done by the junior members of the coalition, the Nats. There was no concern about the bush. I say that as a long time chair of the rural and regional affairs and agriculture committee, both in references and in legislation, and because of the amount of work that I and my colleagues on the committee have done over the years addressing the issues faced in the bush, in remote and rural communities. 


One of the biggest issues that has come to light, just recently—and no bigger, seriously, for canegrowers in Queensland—is the plight of the sugar growers of Australia, who are in dire straits. Senator Macdonald knows this because he was on the inquiry with me, as were Senator Williams, Senator Canavan and Senator O'Sullivan. Canegrowers in Queensland, predominantly, are facing extension. The words I am using sound a little emotional, but I went out of my way with my colleagues on the committee to go and visit—



Senator Bushby interjecting—




Senator STERLE:
  Senator Bushby is being a little bit smart. I do not think he should, because there are many Queensland canegrowers, in particular, and some in Northern New South Wales who would not take kindly to smart remarks, in interjection, when I am talking about the future of the sugar industry in Australia.




Senator Bushby:
  What's your solution?




Senator STERLE:
  I would like to take that interjection. What is the solution? Here is the solution, Senator Bushby. There is a group of Nats senators and members—Nationals not Country Party—who, with the agreement of former Prime Minister Abbott, formed a sugar task force. Their local members, being the Nats in Queensland, were absolutely switched on to know that this industry is in dire straits. So listen carefully, Senator Bushby.


Off they went, under the guidance of Mr Christensen, the member for Dawson. I honestly believe the member for Dawson is in touch with his electorate, as are the other National senators and members mentioned in Mr Christensen's web page who are talking about the good work. The sugarcane growers are under serious attack, because of Wilmar, foreign millers. Currently, they are able to market their sugar through QSL. QSL is disappearing so they will not—and Senator Bushby, listen very carefully—be able to choose who will be marketing their sugar. That is why my office is inundated with canegrowers coming to visit me and they are on the phone regularly. Mr Christensen and the other hardworking Nats from Queensland are really worried. They made certain recommendations. Senator Bushby asked how it could be fixed. A mandatory code of conduct is the answer.


You do not have to take it from me, because that is what Mr Christensen said in his task force. He and his fellow hardworking, diligent, panicking members of the National Party in Queensland want a mandatory code of conduct. My report came out in full support of my colleagues. Both the government senators and the crossbench senators, the Greens, agreed that they should have a mandatory code of conduct. That is how we fix it.


While deals are being cut from Mr Turnbull to take the prime ministership at the wishes of the party, in the Liberal Party room, he still has to do deals with the Nats. I would love the Nats to come in here and tell me—we have their $4 billion deal but we do not know of anything else that has been cut. What have they done to Queensland's canegrowers? I am not Mr Christensen and I am not a Nats member but we all share concern for a very important industry in Queensland.


It was made very clear to us. If the cane industry goes down—and Senator Macdonald, correct me if I am wrong—the suffering that would create in Queensland's remote communities will never be repaired. (Time expired)

Senator EDWARDS
 (South Australia) (15:12):  This is a very good opportunity to reinforce the competent management of the budget, this $4 billion that is part of the coalition's agreement. It can only come about through prudent fiscal management. That is what this government has always been about. It has always been about repairing the budget so that there is this kind of latitude in there, so that when you identify different policy areas that are in need you can make the adjustment. That is what the Nationals brought to the table yesterday and that is what they negotiated.


It is no secret that the National Party enjoy a great deal of popularity on the east coast of Australia. They are represented there in numbers; therefore, it is not unusual for them. That may vary down the east coast. Water is one of those issues I can talk about. Under the six years of the Labor government we saw an explosion in desalination plants. In South Australia my own experience with water is that we now have a dormant $2.3 billion desalination plant that costs $1 million a week not to operate. That was the reaction on water policy that Labor came up with. It costs $1 million a week to run a desalination plant that the government cannot afford to turn on. It is the same deal in Victoria and the same deal in New South Wales. That is what happens when government policy on water goes into the hands of people who do not understand the water requirements of the bush.


There has also been some sniping across the chamber about the fact that the National Party took the opportunity to raise the issue of extra money for families. And why wouldn't they take that opportunity. It is no secret that many National Party members in this chamber have spoken quite passionately about the needs of young families in Australia. I find it somewhat disingenuous that people in the Labor Party no longer want to represent the views of young families in this country. It is quite amazing. They are disrespectful when they call the Nationals 'the doormats to the coalition'. It is appalling. All these people were doing was raising an issue at a time when the Prime Minister felt the budget could allow that money for young families.


The issue that we have in relation to family payments could only be seen as good government policy and a policy adjustment at a time when it was appropriate. The Leader of the Nationals, Mr Truss, is a very considered fellow, a very credible fellow and one of the most sensible statesman you could meet. I am sure that when they sat down to look at this the Prime Minister looked at it in terms of how he could help. They obviously feel quite strongly about it—as they do about the effects test with small business. That has been raised as well. And Senator Dastyari, on the other side, knows that the effects test was raised with us in a recent Senate hearing. There are a lot of people raising these issues about small business, and it is quite right of the National Party to raise this. Some might say that was opportunistic. It was not. It has been raised in this chamber in recent times. Their views on it are well known, and good on them for bringing it up.

Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales) (15:17):  I want to acknowledge the contribution from Senator Edwards, a fine senator whom I have had the opportunity to do much work with on many of these issues. For the record, I am happy to endorse him for any position he ever runs for! Some questions were asked in question time regarding this agreement between the National Party and the Liberal Party. Was it worth $2 billion? Was it worth $4 billion? We are not sure of the amount. I am getting a bit confused by this because we have heard some very different things in this chamber. On one hand, we heard from the National Party that it was an amazing deal, that they went in hard, that they negotiated tough, that they demanded a list of things from the government and that the government willingly oblige. And then we heard from Senator Cormann, who effectively said that all of this had already been promised and there was nothing in the agreement. I am confused about whether the National Party has played the Liberal Party or the Liberal Party has played the National Party. If there is anyone whose word I will take on this, it is Senator Canavan. You can call this what you want. You can call it a negotiation. You can call it an agreement. Personally, I call it a ransom payment. It is a $2 billion to $4 billion ransom that was paid to the National Party to get an agreement up. They even held up question time yesterday to be able to strengthen their negotiating position. It had all the hallmarks of a ransom payment. There was the media. There was the leaking about it earlier. There was the press conference. The one thing that has been missing is the proof of life ;that is the only bit we are yet to see.


And today Senator Cash, in response to questions, went on with the outrageous claim that the Labor Party had been xenophobic in our position on trade. Yesterday they were telling us we were 'Xenophonic'! Today they are telling us that we are xenophobic. I want to explain what 'Xenophonic' means. I have actually been looking this up. 'Xenophonic' means 'having a fear of two or more Nick Xenophons in the same place at the same time'. I can understand that they have been pretty afraid of this. They are so 'Xenophonic' on the other side that they got rid of their Prime Minister! They are so 'Xenophonic' that they are about to make Christopher Pyne the Defence Minister of Australia! This is a frightening set of situations. And they accuse the Labor Party of xenophobia! In question time we had members opposite yelling out comments that somehow in this chamber it is now allegedly appropriate to say that you have to 'talk Australian, mate', that there is a ruling that this is somehow now appropriate language to be using in this chamber. Frankly, what we saw in the answers at question time today is a government that is devoid of action and devoid of any real plan. What we saw was audition after audition for people's own jobs.




Senator Bilyk:
  A dress rehearsal.




Senator DASTYARI:
  It is a pathetic dress rehearsal. It is embarrassing. It is unbecoming. Leadership battles are not easy, they are tough. The outcomes are hard. But at least on our side of politics, when they happen, people have the decency to turn around and offer their resignations—on different occasions five or six resign. If leaders want to accept the resignations or bring them back, that is up to them. Frankly, this ungracious, undignified auditioning for positions—people out there backgrounding and begging to keep their jobs—is unbecoming. The great Gareth Evans said: 'Pull out, digger; the dogs are pissing on your swag.' I think, frankly, that is some advice that can be used for a whole bunch of the frontbench ministers of this government, who should be offering their resignations and stepping down. If they stood by what they said and had any decency or integrity, they would know they have lost the confidence of the people to serve in this place.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (15:22):  I think the great Gareth Evans might have also said to the Labor Party, as has every other serious Labor Party leader: 'Sign the China free trade agreement.' Apart from that, there is nothing memorable that I can recall in anything that Mr Evans has ever said to this chamber.


I am sorry Senator Sterle is leaving the chamber, because I do want to respond to his well-meaning but inaccurate comments about the sugar industry. Before I do that, I explain to members of the Labor Party who might be interested that they keep talking about my friend and colleague Senator Canavan but Senator Canavan and I are in the same political party. We are in the Liberal National Party of Queensland, which is the Queensland division of the Liberal Party of Australia. In this parliament and elsewhere, the coalition is one big, happy family. We are a broad church. We have various different people with different inclinations on policy issues, and that is what has made the coalition government so strong. We all work together. We are all interested in water policy; we are all interested very much in the sugar industry. Senator Sterle asked: what has the coalition ever done for the Queensland sugar industry? I will tell you, Senator Sterle, because I was a member of the government at the time. Back in 2004, we provided over $400 million to save the sugar industry from the difficulties it was going through at the time, as a result, partly, of the deregulation of the sugar industry in Queensland by the then state Labor government. It was the state Labor government that deregulated the sugar industry, which Senator Sterle, as I understand him, is now suggesting should be re-regulated. I also say, Senator Sterle, that you complain about—




Senator Sterle:
  On a point of order, Mr Deputy President: Senator Macdonald has misled the Senate. My report never mentioned bringing back regulation at all. He knows that that is a lie and he needs to withdraw—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Sterle, resume your seat. I remind senators that there are no points of order to be raised if a senator simply disagrees with what another senator has said. There are other opportunities to correct the record, but a point of order is not the appropriate mechanism for that.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Thank you, Mr Deputy President, and I will not worry about the accusation that I am lying. Those sorts of sticks and stones do not break my bones, and names will never hurt me. Senator Sterle, you talk about foreign investment in the sugar industry.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Macdonald, I would ask you to direct your comments through me.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Yes, Mr Deputy President. Senator Sterle raised the issue, directly talking to me, of foreign investment in the sugar industry. I remind him that, when Wilmar came in and bought out all the Sucrogen mills, the deal was approved by Mr Wayne Swan, the then Labor Treasurer of this country. Now Senator Sterle has a new interest. I have to say, in Senator—




Senator Conroy:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order on relevance. This is a debate about the questions asked by the opposition, and I do not think we asked a question about sugar. So perhaps Senator Macdonald might want to come to the topic.



Honourable senators interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I do not need other senators to rule on the point of order, that is my role. Senator Conroy, while the motion before the chair is that the Senate take note of answers to questions asked by the opposition, it is a debate and Senator Sterle did introduce this subject in much of his contribution. It is in order for Senator Macdonald to respond to the comments that Senator Sterle made.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I was about to pay Senator Sterle a compliment, because he is one of the few Labor senators who I think is sensible and rational and actually tries to help, and he chaired the committee that looked into this issue very, very well. But he tries to make some division between the Liberal and National parties when there is none. I remind him that some federal parliamentarians are vitally interested in the sugar industry, and I am one, of course, because I am one of the few members of parliament who actually live in a sugar town—as do Mr Christensen, Mr Pitt, Michelle Landry, part of whose electorate is in a sugar region, and Stuart Robert. Of those, three sit with the Nationals in Canberra and two with the Liberals, and one of those Nationals has a different view to Mr Christensen on the issues that Senator Sterle was talking about.


The matter that Senator Sterle raised is a complex issue and it will not be resolved in a five-minute debate, but I disagree with Senator Sterle's comment that the sugar industry was 'in danger of collapse'—or he used some other term like that. Can I tell you: the sugar industry in Queensland, particularly in the electorate of Dawson, where I live in my home town in the Burdekin, is a very vibrant industry with lots of different farmers, many of them better businessmen than most other businessmen you would find around Australia. The sugar industry will continue to flourish in North Queensland and will continue to be guided by sensible leaders and sensible representatives. I decry that the industry is in any danger. Any danger coming to the industry is from this campaign to abolish sugar from our diets. That is a real issue, and that is what millers and growers should be getting together to fight.

"O'Neill, Sen Deb",ALP,2015-09-16,"



Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (15:29):  I am pleased to participate in the debate this afternoon about the vague answers that we were given to some pretty important questions in question time today. Here we are, on day 2 of the bright, new Turnbull era of the Abbott-Turnbull government, and already we can see just how different this government is not going to be. This is not a government that is in any shape or form significantly different from the one that Australians have been ashamed of and disgraced by so frequently since Mr Abbott came to office. We still have ministers avoiding answering any of the questions, and we still have the same policies intact—the cutting of $57 billion from health remains and the cutting of $30 billion from schools remains. Yesterday in question time we saw the new Prime Minister confirm that he supports all of the policies. All of their measures that will bring a change of style to the role will not do anything in terms of changing the direction. That was evident in Senator Cormann's answers to my questions today.


When I asked my first question about the deal that was stitched up between Mr Turnbull and Mr Truss to secure the Prime Minister's job, there was a question about the families package that is supposed to be coming as part of the deal to improve the lot of people in the bush. Well, nice try! But the answer we heard was that it would be 'cost neutral'. And the National Party are trying to dress themselves up in a new suit as well. With this new agreement that they have made with the Turnbull government they acting like they are great heroes. But we have seen week after week, month after month and, sadly, year after year this Liberal government absolutely trash its partners in coalition—the National Party—and rip off the people of the bush. And they are being sold another dud on this families package. 'Cost neutral', says Senator Cormann. That means no more money for those families. So they should listen very carefully to the web of lies that is already being spun by those in this place who seek to pretend that they represent the people of the bush.


Going to the question about Minister Joyce's dams, again, the National Party has made some claims that they have this great deal. We had some of them saying, 'Let's not go into a deal'. Others have rushed headlong into it. We are getting claims that Minister Joyce has secured this great deal about dams. But, again, what did Senator Cormann reveal? He said, 'Oh, no, we'd already done that deal. That's already accounted for.' Again, this shows the gap between what the Nationals are trying to tell their constituency, who have been loyal to them for many years in the bush, and the reality that is emerging. When the finance minister has to cough up the money, it simply is not there.


Let us go to the last question that I asked of Senator Cormann. It was a question about Senator Canavan's claims on radio in Brisbane yesterday that there will be between $2 billion and $4 billion—additional dollars—that they have for the bush. What did the minister have to say about that? In his comments, he confirmed what he has already put on the record with the media, and that is that that is not correct. The first two items, as was clearly indicated in Senator Cormann's response, were cost neutral—already in the budget. This claim of $2 billion to $4 billion is a furphy. It is not the truth. And that is what we get: you cannot get the Liberals telling the truth and you cannot get the Nationals telling the truth. That is what we have got: a completely untruthful government. Whether it is left or right, whether it is city or country, they cannot tell the truth about what they are doing. 


They certainly do not respect the people of the bush. The people of the bush, who have aspirations for their children, know not just in their heart and soul and not just in their sense of integrity and fairness but in their hip pockets that they cannot possibly envision a future for their children with $100,000 degrees on the horizon. That is what this government will try to continue to push through. They know that they cannot afford a GP tax. Whether it is the one that they advertised that they wanted to bring in to put a price signal between sick people and their doctor or the shameful one that they snuck in by regulation on the first day of July in this new financial year where they froze the indexation, the people in the bush will pay. It is hard enough for them to get petrol in their car and drive the distances that they need to get to a doctor, but this Liberal-National coalition will put a barrier between people in the bush and health.


They are continuing on their merry way. Turnbull is nothing new. It is all the same—the same old, same old. (Time expired)

(a) notes:


(i) the release of the University of Melbourne and Price Waterhouse Coopers report, The value of Indigenous sight: An economic analysis, and


(ii) that currently for every $1 invested in eye care the return is $0.90, however, if the recommendations in the report The Roadmap to Close the Gap for Vision are implemented it is anticipated that there will be a return of $2.50 for every additional $1 spent; therefore the elimination of unnecessary vision loss for Indigenous Australians will generate an estimated return of $1.60 for every $1 spent on eye care;


(b) acknowledges that:


(i) 94 per cent of the vision loss experienced by Indigenous Australians is preventable or treatable, and


(ii) if Australia implements the 'roadmap', in addition to the provision of current eye care services and programs, it will be able to restore sight or avoid future vision loss for 34 000 Indigenous Australians, closing the gap for Indigenous eye health; and


(c) urges the Federal Government to:


(i) review the report and provide national leadership on eye health, and


(ii) address the gap between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal eye health as a matter of priority.

The PRESIDENT

 (
15:50

Pursuant to standing order 75, I propose that the following matter of public importance be submitted to the Senate for discussion:


The Coalition Government's failure to debate in the House of Representatives private members legislation that has been passed by the Senate guaranteeing future pay rises for member of our Australian Defence Force are linked to the pay rises of members of parliament or Consumer Price Index, whichever is highest.


Is the proposal supported?

",Senate,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Defence Personnel</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,10,1
"Lambie, Sen Jacqui",Ind.,2015-09-16,"



Senator LAMBIE
 (Tasmania) (15:50):  Today's matter of public importance is an exciting opportunity for Prime Minister Turnbull to show the Australian people that he is different from the old PM and that he truly cares for the men and women of our defence forces. As most people will recall, the former Prime Minister liked getting his photo regularly taken with members of the Australian Defence Force. But, despite his apparent affection, the former PM betrayed and used our diggers when he failed to deliver a fair pay rise to them. This injustice was partly remedied after an extra pay rise was reluctantly offered to our defence community, but only after a big public backlash and my threat to block all legislation until the Australian Defence Force received a fair pay rise.


As well as our Australian Defence Force still being left out of pocket, this shameful incident proved that we needed to find a better way to guarantee that our diggers receive a fair pay rise. I offered the Senate a solution to the Australian Defence Force pay crisis, in the form of a private member's bill which automatically linked Army, RAAF and Navy pay rises to the pay rises of politicians or the CPI, whichever was the higher amount. After debate this Senate voted on and passed the Defence Amendment (Fair Pay for Members of the ADF) Bill 2014. This bill now sits in the other place—the House of Representatives—awaiting a final debate, vote and passage to the Governor-General for the signature of assent.


Through this discussion on today's matter of public importance this Senate is again able to remind the Liberal and National parties about unfinished business they have with regard to our diggers' pay. If the Liberals and Nationals follow their old path of never giving an inch to the crossbench senators and not listening to reason and common sense then there is no point in changing Prime Ministers. I know that this new PM has genuine respect for and close links with our Australian Defence Force. I ask him to seriously consider the message that this Senate has sent—not only once but, including, today twice—to this parliament and the Australian government.


In closing I want to counter the misleading comments and arguments that the National and Liberal party members made in this Senate when they opposed my private members bill. The Australian people will not stand for Liberal and National members hiding behind nitpicking, sly and false arguments when it comes to fair pay rises for members of our Australian Defence Force. Linking Defence Force wage rises to the wage rises of politicians—or the CPI, whichever is higher—will not mean that our Australian Defence Force members receive less pay. That is rubbish. Parliamentary Library research reveals that the average yearly rise in defence pay over the last 10 years is only three per cent. This stands in stark contrast with the average yearly rise in politicians' pay, which since 2004 is almost seven per cent. The calculations include the politicians' pay rise in 2012 of 34.3 per cent and the last two years when politicians' pay has been frozen. The weighted median figure for the CPI is 2.4 per cent.


On Wednesday 4 March former PM Abbott asked the Chief of the Defence Force to take a proposed pay increase of only 0.5 per cent to the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal, making for a total Australian Defence Force pay rise of two per cent. In 2000 the Chief of the Defence Force received $305,000 per annum. The latest figures show that the Chief of the Defence Force in 2014 took home $764,000 that year. That means the person asked by Mr Abbott to increase ordinary diggers' pay, by a mingy 0.5 per cent, in the last 14 years had his own pay increased by almost $460,000, or 250 per cent. It is clear that if the private members bill regarding Australian Defence Force pay is passed by the House of Representatives our diggers would be guaranteed a fair pay rise over the next 10 years without having to be subjected to the current flawed and biased Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal, which has betrayed them while tribunal members have enjoyed pay rises of 250 per cent over the last 10 years. This unjust system must be changed for the better—and the Prime Minister has the power today to deliver justice and fair pay finally and once and for all to our Australian Defence Force families.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2015-09-16,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (15:56):  I rise to speak on this matter of public importance because I spoke against Senator Lambie's original bill when it came into this place. My reasons for opposing her Defence Amendment (Fair Pay for Members of the ADF) Bill then have not changed. It is important that we do get some facts on the record. I do not for a moment doubt Senator Lambie's absolute commitment to the men and women of Australia's Defence Force, or the commitment of those on both sides of this chamber. Those men and women do an amazing job serving our country and they do deserve fair pay. In many instances the pay rises that they have had have been more than competitive with rises in other arenas in the public sector. To labour the point about Senator Lambie's pay rises for politicians, if you exclude structural adjustments, where we have seen the incorporation and rolling in of various entitlements into a single wage structure, there has only been a 0.4 per cent differential between politicians' and ADF pay. So we have to get the facts on the record.


The purpose of this place is to pass legislation, to pass bills, to reduce complexity and make government much more efficient in many instances. The bill that Senator Lambie is seeking passage of is unnecessarily complex and it does have a number of consequences, which were highlighted to Senator Lambie when it was debated in the Senate. They were probably unintended consequences. The bill may appear straightforward, but it is actually not straightforward. There are many and varied differentials in the comparisons between parliamentarians' and ADF remuneration and entitlements. A case in point is that the ADF has more than 1,300 pay points across more than 500 employment categories,. The bill that Senator Lambie introduced did not link them in a successful manner and many of the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal functions would have been negatively affected under her proposal.


Of course pay in the ADF is not linked to inflation movements up or down, and the government requires pay rises for ADF members to follow the same general pacesetting principles that apply to other government employees and to the wider community. I made the point then, and I make it again now, that over the past decade ADF wage rises have outpaced inflation by over 13 per cent. Under the government's current policy of providing a two per cent pay rise to ADF personnel for each of the next three years, once again ADF pay will both exceed current parliamentary pay increases and increase more than the expected CPI.


ADF pay is currently determined by the independent Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal, in accordance with section 58H(2) of the Defence Act 1903. This was formally established in 1984 under the then Hawke Labor government. It comprises three members: a president, who has to be a deputy president of the Fair Work Commission; a person experienced in industrial relations matters; and a person who was but is no longer a permanent member of the forces.


They determined the first pay case in 1985. The ADF is represented before that tribunal by the Defence Force Advocate. In accordance with section 55 of the Defence Act this person is skilled in industrial relations matters and has intimate knowledge as to the nature of service in the Defence Force. That is important because it means that there will always be a contemporary perspective put into the Defence Force remuneration determinations. That means it is not subject to the whims and whines of people in this place, who may have a longstanding knowledge or history; also, as they leave the Defence Force their knowledge cannot be as intimate as it was when they were there. I think it is very important that we maintain the current circumstance where those who have a thorough understanding of the Defence Force, the nature of service and the determinations can make these assessments. Thus, I would advocate continuing with the current scheme.


The nature of military service is in itself unique. These are people who voluntarily enlist. They do it for myriad reasons. I do not know a single service man or woman who says they joined up for the money, because it is perhaps not the most lucrative career. But it is an absolutely vital career for us and we are very, very thankful that they are prepared to serve in whatever capacity, whether at home or abroad, defending our freedoms, keeping us safe and providing an essential service. As valued employees, as valued service people and as valued servants of the country they deserve a fair go—absolutely. No-one is going to quibble about that. But the fairest and best method for them to get a fair go, to get appropriate remuneration, is through an independently assessed criteria, not subject to linking it to inflation or another measure. I think that is the most positive thing we can do for the service men and women who do such a sterling job for us.


Returning to the bill, I recall the explanatory memorandum was very brief but contained a number of factual inaccuracies, which I believe were explained to the Senate at the time. However, if you are going to perpetuate factual inaccuracies and then continue with your bill, I think we are entitled to repeat them and say, 'They're wrong.' Because if you cannot rely on the integrity of what is said in this place in respect of legislation we will face some great difficulties.


The EM states, if I recall, that members of the ADF have their pay assessed arbitrarily by the Minister for Defence, under section 58B, and the minister's decision cannot be appealed. As I have made it very clear, that is actually not true. The Minister for Defence does not make determinations on ADF pay. In relation to appeals, the Defence Act actually provides mechanisms for the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal to review ADF pay. 


The powers of the minister in respect of ADF remuneration under section 58B of the Defence Force Act relate to determinations regarding conditions of service for ADF members, other than salary. These include housing benefits, relocation support, leave entitlements, family healthcare programs and other non-salary allowances. 


If you cannot get that right, do you really think we should be pushing through a bill, through the other place, that I would argue will not only disadvantage service men and women but is actually entirely flawed in its premise and in the explanatory memorandum. This is the great problem and that is why these longstanding remuneration arrangements should be maintained rather than being at the whim of some well-meaning senator. 


I am very fortunate in that I have the power of a large party organisation behind me, in which we can distil the essence of good and bad policy. I can rely on my colleagues with respect to their unfettered loyalty in supporting my goals and aims through the parliament. Senator Lambie, unfortunately, does not have that same support network, if you will, so we need to ensure that we can get decent legislation through this place that is accurate. (Time expired)

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2015-09-16,"



Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (16:06):  I rise today to speak on Senator Lambie's matter of public importance. In March this year the Senate passed Senator Lambie's Defence Amendment (Fair Pay for Members of the ADF) Bill 2014. This bill linked, as a minimum, ADF pay to either an increase to CPI or parliamentary allowances, whichever is the highest. Since then this government has failed to allow that bill to be debated in the other place. Australia's new Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull, should now do the right thing. He should do what his predecessor would not and allow this bill to be debated in the other place. This is an important issue and parliament should have an opportunity to debate the matter.


Earlier this year the former Prime Minister was dragged kicking and screaming to increase the government's measly pay offer from 1.5 per cent to two per cent. Two per cent is higher than current inflation. Labor welcomed that increase, but it is important that parliament examines a way to ensure that ADF personnel never have to go through that pain again. Senator Lambie's bill proposes a mechanism that would ensure that if inflation moves ADF personnel will not be worse off.


A future Labor government will undertake a full review of the process for determining ADF pay to ensure that it is effective and transparent and properly takes into account the unique nature of military service. It is worthwhile going through some history here to understand Labor's position. After promising not to cut defence funding before the election the coalition government cut ADF pay at the first opportunity. They also sought to cut ADF Christmas leave and other allowances while they were at it. Worse than that, they did it in November, not long before Christmas. 


In October last year reports began to emerge that the government was offering an unfair and below inflation increase of 1.5 per cent a year across the three-year agreement. This disgraceful deal was explained away by the former Prime Minister as a way to drive down the pay and conditions of all Commonwealth public servants. He was using our Defence Force personnel as a battering ram in his ideological crusade against the Public Service. That is right—he was using the pay and conditions of our serving men and women as part of his political strategy to hurt all Commonwealth public servants.


ADF personnel have long held a special place in our society. ADF personnel undertake unique, demanding and often dangerous work. They put their lives on the line with dedication and courage to ensure Australia is safe. They do this on behalf of all Australians. Today we have ADF personnel deployed all over the world. Most notably, they are in the Middle East supporting the international effort against Daesh and the Taliban. They are also working on the high seas against piracy and drug traffickers. 


Australians instinctively understand the sacrifices our ADF personnel make. That is why we saw such community backlash when the government sought to cut the pay of our ADF personnel. Senator Lambie in particular was extremely vocal in her calls for the government to pay the ADF more. Other crossbenchers also spoke out. The RSL and the Defence Force Welfare Association pushed hard against the pay cut. The new Prime Minister should do the right thing and allow this bill to be debated in the other place.


In 2012 former Prime Minister Abbott told the RSL national conference that 'a fair go is the least a grateful nation can offer to serving and former military personnel'. Prime Minister Turnbull should heed his predecessor's advice and give our ADF personnel a fair go. It is embarrassing that those opposite unanimously supported this—every single coalition senator supported this. Only when the pressure built, as outrage flooded social media pages and the petition was collected, did the craven members of the coalition decide they had to protect serving personnel's pay and conditions. Let no-one on the other side of the chamber pretend that they were there when it counted in this debate, because they were not.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (16:11):  I support this matter of public importance and I support Senator Lambie's Defence Amendment (Fair Pay for Members of the ADF) Bill 2014. There is an important principle here. This bill ought to be debated. If a bill has been passed, particularly by this place, it ought to be dealt with and debated in the other place, one way or the other. People need to nail their colours to the mast—do they support this bill or not? To leave it in the never-never is fundamentally wrong. It needs to be dealt with. This bill passed the Senate in March and has been stuck in the lower house ever since. Now that the government has changed leadership I hope it takes note of this matter of public importance debate and brings this bill on in the lower house as a matter of urgency. 


Members of the Australian Defence Force are called upon to carry out a huge range of challenging and at times life-threatening duties here at home and overseas. As Senator Conroy pointed out, we have members of the Defence Force deployed throughout the world. They are doing things as grave as fighting the evil that is Daesh and the Taliban in Afghanistan. Signing on to be an ADF member could see you involved not just in wars in far off countries but in drought, bushfire, flood and natural disaster relief and peacekeeping. 


The sense of duty and loyalty of our Defence Force members to this country is incredibly strong and has been so for well over a century and must remain so. Senator Lambie's bill goes a long way towards this aim. It is about having fair pay increases for the ADF. ADF employees are not like other workers. They cannot go on strike; they cannot decide to not do their duty because of an industrial dispute. They are in a unique position in the sense that the ordinary rules that apply to other workers cannot apply to them because of the very nature of their duties. That is why there needs to be a better way of setting their pay. The proposition in Senator Lambie's bill does provide a mechanism, because they do not have the same rights as other workers. Therefore, this bill has a lot of merit.


When this bill was being debated the government was embroiled in a bitter and drawn out pay dispute with the ADF's almost 60,000 full-time members. It was stubbornly sticking to an offer of 1.5 per cent—below the CPI of 1.7 per cent and well below the significant pay increases parliamentarians have had in recent years. Senator Lambie's bill would guarantee that all future ADF pay rises would never fall behind either the cost of living, the CPI, or the pay rises of those of us here in parliament—whichever is greater. It focuses the mind on how we have a mechanism that is fair and equitable for members of our defence forces.


The government settled its pay dispute with the ADF in June, providing for a two per cent annual increase up to November 2017, but this bill forces us to consider a fairer mechanism of pay increases for members of the ADF. This MPI is essentially about having this bill debated in the other place. If a bill has been debated and dealt with in this place then there ought to be a mechanism to ensure that it is debated in the other place. To ignore this bill is completely disrespectful of not only Senator Lambie but the entire Senate, given the passage of this bill in the Senate. That is why I support this MPI. 


I urge the Turnbull government to consider this bill, have it debated and come up with a better mechanism of dealing with pay increases for ADF personnel, because they do not have the same rights as others in the workforce because of the very precious nature of the vital duties they perform in the national interest.

"Reynolds, Sen Linda",LP,2015-09-16,"



Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia) (16:15):  I too rise to speak on Senator Lambie's matter of public importance and also to remind the Senate of my original objections to the bill in question. First of all, I again commend Senator Lambie on the intention behind the MPI and also the Defence Amendment (Fair Pay for Members of the ADF) Bill 2014. The intent reflected in the title is entirely laudable. Senator Lambie is absolutely a passionate advocate for past and present service personnel, but unfortunately the devil is always in the detail and it resides within this bill.


Unfortunately, despite the laudable title of this bill, the practical operation of this bill does precisely the opposite of what the title suggests it would achieve. If passed by the House of Representatives, this bill would result in a significant decrease not only to the base pay of ADF personnel but also to their service allowances and entitlements. It is for that reason alone that it is inconceivable to me why the ALP and the Greens would have voted for a bill that will have a significant decrease for Defence personnel from the current two per cent.


By way of a quick history, the government's move to increase the ADF pay offer from 1.5 per cent to two per cent since March this year has provided a higher pay increase for the ADF personnel than that provided for by Senator Lambie's bill. As I said, though my colleagues and I applaud Senator Lambie's intent, after the first decision—




Senator Lambie:
  CPI was 2.4 per cent! You are misleading the Senate!




Senator REYNOLDS:
  If Senator Lambie gives me time, I will explain exactly how, in great detail, this is a retrograde bill. Following the announcements, Mr Nikolic, I and other colleagues quietly but very persistently advocated to the minister and the Prime Minister that we thought the initial 1.5 per cent pay increase was insufficient. We also worked with them very hard to find where the additional $200 million would come from out of the Defence budget. Once we had done that and we had found the money, we also put another very persuasive argument to government about why this was equitable. The reason was that, under the last government—the Labor government—the wage increase of ADF uniformed personnel lagged behind those of the APS by 25 per cent. We believe, therefore, that this recommendation was not only appropriate but that we had found the money to pay for it. Subsequently, on 4 March, the Prime Minister announced the government's intention to seek a variation to the ADF Workplace Remuneration Arrangement—the WRA—to provide an increase to the pay to two per cent per annum each year over the three-year life of the arrangement. The cost of the existing WRA is $634 million over the life of the agreement, and, as I said, the increase was an extra $200 million that has now gone to our ADF personnel.


The DFRT endorsed the government's new proposal when it handed down its determination on 9 June 2015 and the additional increase was reflected in ADF pay packets from 30 July and it was backdated to 12 March this year. Importantly, the DFRT decision kept ADF pay well above the current annual inflation rate of 1.5 per cent, which, in fact, as we have just heard from the speakers opposite, is what ADF pay would drop to under Senator Lambie's bill—not two per cent but 1.5 per cent.


There are three major reasons why I believe this is a very well-intentioned but ill-drafted bill and it would have devastating consequences on the incomes of our Defence Force personnel. The first reason is the linking of pay rises for members of the ADF to one of two things: either to CPI or to MP's salaries—option A or option B, and nothing else. Let's have a look at these options. Option A is tying it to politicians and senior public servants. The fundamental flaw in this is that we have all had our salaries frozen to zero, so option A that is proposed under the bill is zero. I am assuming that the drafter did not realise this when this bill was drafted. So, option A is zero per cent and is tied to politicians. Option B under the bill is tied to CPI, which, as we know from current CPI figures is well below the current two per cent. In fact, it is about 1.5 per cent. So it would be either option A or option B—zero per cent or 1.5 per cent.




Senator Lambie:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. When this pay rise was disputed and done last November, the CPI was 2.4 per cent, so let's get some facts in here, please.




Senator REYNOLDS:
  That is not a point of order.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Sterle
):  Senator Reynolds, thank you very much for your assistance—




Senator REYNOLDS:
  That is a debating point.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Reynolds! I do not need your assistance. I have listened to Senator Lambie. I say to Senator Lambie that there is not a point of order. Senator Reynolds, ignore the interjections.




Senator REYNOLDS:
  We have option A—zero per cent—and we have option B, which is currently 1.5 per cent. The bill is very short and it is very clear, as has been confirmed by the speakers who preceded me. That is the first reason why it is a bad bill, because it will clearly reduce the salaries of ADF members.


The second reason I think this is a well-intentioned but bad bill is that under the bill the members of the ADF will have their pay assessed arbitrarily by the Minister for Defence under section 58B of the Defence Act. I argue for this reason alone that the entire premise of this bill is not correct. The Minister for Defence does not and should not make determinations on ADF pay. In fact, under the Defence Act the power is reserved specifically for the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal—the DFRT—pursuant to section 58H(2)(a) of the Defence Act. Unlike what is said in the explanatory memorandum, the powers of the minister in relation to ADF remuneration of the Defence Act relate to determinations regarding conditions of service to ADF members other than salary—that is, not pay. In the past, these determinations have included housing benefits, relocation support, leave entitlements, the Abbott government's rollout of the National ADF Family Health Program and a range of other nonsalary related allowances.


In fact, the Hawke government, in the Defence Legislation Amendment Act 1984 established the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal, which now comprises three independent members: the vice-president of Fair Work Australia, a person experienced in industrial relations matters and a person who has been a member of the ADF—a truly representative tribunal. This is a fundamental and critical fact that this bill has ignored and which I therefore believe actually renders it invalid. The DFRT determinations are to be made by already taking into account the special skills and capabilities required of ADF members and their unique employment circumstances. This bill, and the wording of it in relation to the tribunal and the minister would itself not only invalidate it but it would also effectively abolish the DFRT.


The third reason that this is a bad bill, well intentioned as it is, is that the definitions in it are far broader than just for the increase in pay rates. When you actually have a look at the Defence Act and you look at the tribunal details, it is very clear that this will not only apply to Defence pay but will also apply to all other meanings of 'salary'—all salary related payments and not just the base pay rate.


As I outlined in my speech on this bill, the proposed section 58ZC would introduce a mandatory formula into all Defence Force pay determinations, and not just those suggested in the bill. In making any salary determination the tribunal would need to include a calculation that converts any amount it decides upon into a percentage increase for the purposes of working out a minimum salary increase, using the new amount and rate of comparison as set out in the proposed new section 58ZC contained in this bill.


What does that actually mean? It is a bit bureaucratic and technical, but—




Senator Gallacher:
  Don't worry! We'll understand it!




Senator REYNOLDS:
  Thank you very much, Senator Gallacher, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President. Additionally, as the WRA also applies to relevant allowances determined by the tribunal, it includes service allowances, and there is no requirement to apply clause 58ZC to that part of ADF remuneration. Therefore, not only could the bill potentially cause additional distortions to the current ADF remuneration arrangements it would actually mean an effective decrease to 1.5 per cent—the current inflation rate—not only for ADF pay rates but for all their service allowances and other conditions of service. So when you look at the detail of this bill, it could reduce ADF pay rates from two per cent to 1.5 per cent and that would actually be across all the other thousands of conditions of service and entitlements.


While I absolutely support the intent of the bill—and I know that Senator Lambie has put it forward with absolutely the best intentions to look after our service personnel—when you actually have a look at the detail of this bill it absolutely has the opposite intent to what she intended—absolutely. It was for those reasons that I could not support the bill then and I cannot support it now. I would urge those opposite, before they continue to ask for this to be debated in the House of Representatives, to actually go back and have a look at the implications of this bill, because it is very clear when you look at the bill, the relevant act and the DFRT guidelines that this would, if passed in the House of Representatives, send our ADF pay back from two per cent to 1.5 per cent and take all of their service allowances and conditions with it.


It is for those reasons that I support the intent of this MPI and the bill that sits behind it, but it is absolutely a most retrograde step for all our men and women in uniform. Thank you very much.

"Gallacher, Sen Alex",ALP,2015-09-16,"



Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (16:26):  I rise to make a contribution in this debate and, unfortunately, just following on from Senator Reynolds. I think Senator Reynolds failed to listen, which is probably not all that unusual in this chamber—sometimes it gets a bit noisy. This bill linked, as a minimum, ADF pay to the higher of either an increase in CPI or parliamentary allowances. So, a minimum of—not 'to'. Also, she has very carefully picked out a statistic that, not surprisingly, was the best possible statistic for her case. So, the June quarter 2014-15 was 1.5 per cent. But, hang on, that was 2014-15. What about 2012-13? That was 2.4 per cent. What about the three per cent before that?




Senator Canavan:
  It's not relevant!




Senator GALLACHER:
  I will tell you why it is relevant, Senator Canavan. The reason it is relevant is that for about 22 years I used to negotiate pay rises. What we used to do was to put the CPI in our back pockets. We used to go to the employer and say, 'This is what the CPI says.' And you know that when you examine what the CPI from the-Australian Bureau of Statistics is, it is a measurement of household expenditure. You only have to wander around the newspapers to find a decent article in The Sydney Morning Herald which lists every category of expenditure. I am sure that Senator Canavan, with his Productivity Commission hat on, knows how carefully it is constructed to give a representative view of what the expenses of a household are in the six states and two territories.


We know—well, I think—that the ADF actually get paid prospectively rather than retrospectively. So we are actually going to try to guess what is going to be in the second and third years. We are not going to pay them retrospectively; we are going to say, 'Okay, we think the CPI for the last three years has done, not 1.5 per cent, but 2.3 per cent.' Senator Reynolds said that people would have got a decrease, when common sense would tell you that you average it over three years if you are doing a three-year agreement—you would have a look at the last three, and the last three were 2.3 per cent. You could articulate that it might be more going forward, or you could articulate that it might be less, but it is a bargain.


The real problem here is that the ADF do not have the same pay structure as people in the wider community do. The ADF serve; they serve this country and have served overseas for 10 or more years in active service. They should not really be put under the pump and worry about their families paying the electricity, the school fees, the petrol and the public transportation costs that they have seen increase. They should not have to worry about that. The finance minister, Senator Cormann, can get out there this morning and say, 'I am open and ready for business. Trust me, Prime Minister, I am as loyal as they come!'


But we all know that the cigar and the glass of wine and the tune Best Day of My Life was the genesis of this episode when they sat down in the May 2014 budget and wrecked the place. They never sat down and said they were going wreck the ADF pay increases, but that was the implication of their terrific—in their view—budget.


It started to filter out and it filtered out to the ADF. Rightly, Senator Lambie and others took the government to task. They absolutely took them to task, so much so that the bill went through the Senate, and it has been put on the backburner because amongst those 150 representatives in that other chamber you are going to struggle to find a lot of people who are going to stand up and do a Senator Reynolds—distort the fact and figures—and try to say that this is a bad deal.


This is putting a base into the argument. They should have the CPI in their back pocket every year because that is what happens on a base. Things go up—transport goes up, education goes up, electricity goes up. I know lots of people in the community who say that the CPI is not enough and that it does not keep pace with actual inflation. I do accept that the Australian Bureau of Statistics does a job, a very thorough job, in trying to get all of the cost-of-living items into a figure, but my contention is that that is a base figure. Most groups in the community want to put that in their back pocket and go for a bit more.


I commend Senator Lambie in her endeavours to shine a light on this despicable effort by the coalition government to save money in these areas. These are people who serve the country and, as Senator Lambie has stated, there are plenty of people, maybe even reservist brigadiers, who get paid very well and who can probably forgo a pay increase. Do not tell me that the grunt, the bloke on the ground, someone in 7RAR, someone who is a sapper with three kids at home, and might be posted in Afghanistan or wherever they are posted, has to worry about whether their family has enough to make ends meet. Do not tell me they should wear any of this nonsense; they should not. They should be paid respectfully and commensurate with their loyalty and service for Australia. Their loyalty and service for Australia should be recognised with a fair and just pay offer each and every year that they serve.


There are a couple of inquiries that I have been involved in, and we know that the Army, the Navy and the Air Force do fantastic work. We know that people are loyal to their service to the Defence Force, to the government and to the service of Australia. We also know that should be enhanced and continued. I would be surprised if any defence minister was not bitterly disappointed at this miserable effort from Senator Cormann and the honourable Joe Hockey when they sat down in May and concocted the best day of their life when they got their cigars and their glasses of wine out. I am sure that they did not actually envisage that they were going to have to eat a bit of humble pie later on by backing down on the effect of their awful work. I am not surprised that Senator Cormann, today, is waiving all that and airbrushing it into history. 'I'm open for business. I'm free. I'll serve any Prime Minister.' I think this Prime Minister would probably have to have a bit of a think, if that was the architect of this Prime Minister's demise and the absolutely humiliating backdown that they have had to cop.


Then we compound it. They will not even debate it in the other place because we know what happened in the debate here. You cannot find anybody who is against Senator Lambie's proposal. I am not against it. I am sure no-one in the chamber it. No-one has spoken against it. If it ever sees the light of day in that other chamber, there will not be too many coalition or Labor people coming out against it. So maybe, just maybe, Senator Lambie has hit the nail right on the head in her attempt to advocate for defence personnel, which I know she is truly passionate about. I have had to endure her arduous questioning of a number of senior defence officials at a number of hearings. Her passion will not go away. The issue will not go away. They should debate it in the other chamber.


They do not think defence people are worth the CPI—that basket of consumer goods that you need to feed your family. If they do not think they are worth that, then say so. Let those thousands of members of the Australian Defence Force hear it in the chamber. But do not come in and be tricky and use one year at 1½ per cent. Go back over the three years when it was 2.3 per cent. Anyway, we are guessing about what it is going to be in the future.


As I said, Mr Acting Deputy President,—I am sure you are aware of it because you did it thousands of times yourself—when you approached negotiations you have the CPI in your back pocket and you went for a bit more. I believe the CPI and a bit more is what defence personnel should get in reward for their loyalty, their service and their dedication to this country. They are often maintaining two households. They are not always at home; they are often deployed. We take care of them as best we can when they are deployed. It is not easy when you are bringing up a family at home and your husband might be doing six months in Afghanistan, or six months in Timor, or working on the floods in Queensland. In the last round of meetings that we had in Queensland, there was a unit that was deployed for the Queensland floods, they had two weeks off and then went to Afghanistan for six months. That family has to make ends meet. They need a car to get around to drop the kids off at school. CPI and a bit better would be very, very handy.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (16:36):  I will have some of what he has had, please. That was a very good speech, and I commend Senator Gallacher on his passion. In fact, I think you should frame that, Senator Gallacher, if that is possible with words. That was a really good speech.


I just want to get up-front and on record that the Greens have the utmost respect for our Australian Defence Force personnel. We respect their service, we respect the sacrifices they are prepared to make and do often make. Most importantly we want to make sure that, if they are to be sent into harm's way, the parliament debates the merits of these missions. This, too, for the Greens is a matter of respect. Of course, we have had this debate in the last week in parliament about war powers legislation. The Greens support Senator Lambie's bill to peg the indexation of Defence Force pay to CPI or to parliamentary pay. My colleague Scott Ludlam rose in this chamber and made a contribution to the second reading debate on this legislation. Senator Lambie's bill would ensure that a prime minister or a government of the day, faced with budget circumstances entirely of their own making—especially one that is impotent in actually raising revenue in this country—could not take for granted a cohort of people who from time to time are called on to risk their lives or serious physical or mental injury in the line of their ordinary course of duty and who do not have industrial representation. It is very important to stress that our Defence Force personnel do not have a union that can get out in front and protect them and their families and their working conditions. They cannot go on strike. They basically have no real recourse in this country. This bill would ensure that the kind of errant approach to their rights that we saw in the first year of our former Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, never happens again.


I would also like to raise the bigger issue, while we are discussing Defence personnel pay and conditions, and that is that the Greens would also like to see all public servants get fair pay and conditions. We need to be cognisant of the fact that public servants right across the board do a good job for all Australians and they deserve fair pay and conditions. We do not like to see unnecessary cuts to both workforce numbers and fair pay and conditions, especially when we have the ability to raise revenue in this country if we make some hard decisions around tax reform.


It is also worth throwing into the mix, in the very few minutes that I have left to speak, that this government spends tens of billions of dollars on the acquisition of Joint Strike Fighters, new submarines and all sorts of other military hardware, and what we are talking about is small bickies. Indexing someone's pay to CPI is small bickies compared to what we go out and spend on defence hardware. It is personnel versus hardware, when of course the most important thing about our Defence Force is the people—the people who actually serve, who go off to war or on peacekeeping missions, to provide disaster relief and to give aid.


I take the opportunity today to note that, for many ADF personnel, life after service is often when they are in most need of government support. Senator Gallacher mentioned some of the inquiries he has been at recently. Senator Lambie was in Brisbane with us only a few weeks ago when we heard some heartbreaking stories from young veterans who have done multiple tours of Afghanistan and who are suffering terribly. They moved the whole committee to tears. 


The Greens supported the government when it introduced a bill originally to index veterans' benefits to CPI, but we opposed it when the government tried to cut income support to the children of veterans. This regulation was ultimately disallowed by the Senate. 


In the last 55 seconds of this contribution, I also raise the subject of commemoration of service—and, Mr Acting Deputy President Sterle, you and I both share an interest in commemorations—and the fact that up to $150 million has been spent on commemorations, while in real-time we are talking about cutting Defence Force pay. It is a bit rich. It is also a bit rich when we are seeing cuts right across the board to the Public Service. So, while we need to commemorate the service of our defence forces, we need to commemorate for the right reasons. It is very important that we put into perspective the amount of money that is being spent in this country on defence hardware and commemoration and that spent on Defence personnel.


The Greens will be supporting Senator Lambie's bill, and I hope that we can carry this forward and actually get some legislation enacted. Congratulations, Senator Lambie.

Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales) (16:41):  I rise today to speak on the matter of public importance introduced into this chamber today by Senator Lambie. At the end of the day, this is a very simple debate. This is about one thing, and that is allowing this bill to be debated in the House. That is all anyone is asking for. We are asking that people either put up or shut up, that they be prepared to defend their positions publicly, on the record. 


I see my good friend Senator Canavan sitting opposite. Senator Canavan is an incredibly impressive man. Through one or two small negotiations with the government, he was able to get somewhere between $2 billion and $4 billion out of them. So I am urging Senator Canavan to use his new-found will, his new-found power, his new-found dominance of the Liberal Party to get this problem fixed. Frankly, all it is going to take is one phone call from Senator Canavan to get this problem fixed! So, if, by 5 pm today, this matter has not been resolved, we all know who we are going to hold responsible! We are going to be holding Senator Canavan responsible for this!




Senator Canavan:
  It's a heavy burden, but I'm prepared to carry it, Senator Dastyari!




Senator DASTYARI:
  Senator Canavan, with great power comes great responsibility!


Senator Lambie has been a proud and consistent supporter of the Australian Defence Force since long before she entered this place. I respect her service and I respect her commitment to her former colleagues. In March this year, the Senate passed Senator Lambie's Defence Amendment (Fair Pay for Members of the ADF) Bill 2014 and it proposed a measure that would ensure that, if inflation increases, ADF personnel will not be worse off. The bill links ADF pay rises, at a minimum, to either an increase in the Consumer Price Index or increases in parliamentary allowances, whichever is the higher. Since then, however, this government has refused to allow this bill to be debated in the other place. I think that is what is so appalling about this. What is being asked for here is not necessarily that everyone agree or even that the bill be agreed to by the House. People are entitled to debate it. But you have to be prepared, you should be prepared and you should be willing to be prepared—




Senator Canavan:
  What's your view?




Senator DASTYARI:
  And I take the interjection from Senator Canavan, the mouse who is now roaring! I am a big supporter of any measure that is about making sure that public servants are given fair pay for the work that they do. Senator Lambie at least has had the guts to put up a proposal and a model and a measure. People can debate the exact details of any legislation, but, frankly, I am going to have a lot more respect for someone who is prepared—you know that saying, put your money where your mouth is? I would say, 'Put your bill where your mouth is.' Senator Canavan, where is your bill on this? Where is the National Party on this issue? 


You are running the government now. We have seen it. It is impressive, I have to say. In one fell swoop, you are effectively holding the government to ransom on so many issues. You can hold the government to ransom on just one more and do the right thing by ADF personnel


The men and women of the Australian Defence Force provide an essential and often dangerous service to all of us. Their work is demanding and, as we know, far too often life-threatening. They put their lives on the line, with dedication and courage, to ensure Australia is safe. Today, more than 2,500 Australian Defence Force personnel are on deployments around the world. We have more than 1,500 personnel in various operations in the Middle East, including Operation Okra, Operation Accordion and Operation Manitou. In Afghanistan, 900 personnel are involved in Operation Highroad. There are Australians deployed in smaller operations in the Sudan, Egypt, Israel and Lebanon. And, as we know, they are deployed on 'on water' matters around Australia.


All Australians recognise the sacrifices that our ADF personnel make. What we are saying in this motion is simply allow them the respect and decency to have a proper, frank and fair debate about their pay. What we are asking for is a government that is strong enough and proud enough to be prepared to have the debate—and that is what this government is not prepared to do.

Senator LAZARUS
 (Queensland) (16:46):  I take great pleasure in talking about the MPI for today. I am very disappointed that the Abbott government has disregarded the will of the Senate by ignoring Senator Lamble's bill in relation to ADF pay. I married into a military family so I do understand the sacrifices our military make to keep our country safe and secure. They spend long periods of time away from their family. They miss key family events and endure postings in extreme and difficult conditions. On a daily basis, the Australian men and women of our Defence Force put their lives on the line to keep our country safe and free. 


There is a common term used by many and one which I believe in, and that is that freedom is not free. It takes the sacrifice of ordinary men and women who do extraordinary things to keep our country safe, secure and free. Sadly, this sacrifice often includes loss of life, physical injury, mental injury and post-traumatic stress. Freedom is not free because there is also a financial cost, because we need to adequately acknowledge and reward our people for their commitment to keeping our country safe and free, both while they are serving and once they retire. 


What cost can we put on the safety, security and freedom of our nation? I am of the view that it is priceless. Most Australians go to work and come home every day, without having to worry about their personal safety. Our Defence Force, our military personnel, go to work every day knowing that their personal safety is not assured. Our military risk their lives to keep our lives safe. It is only fair that the pay and conditions of our military should be linked to the pay and conditions of politicians. 


My home state of Queensland is home to many different Defence Force personnel on bases across the Navy, Army and Air Force. Unlike many people in the workforce, our military do not have the support of a union to represent them, nor are they able to speak out in relation to issues involving pay and conditions. When existing mechanisms designed to act in the best interests of our military fail—and I include the Abbott government and the tribunal in this category—the Parliament of Australia should be the voice of our military to ensure they are appropriately supported and remunerated. It is for this reason the Senate supported Senator Lamble's bill to link the ADF to the pay rises of members of parliament or to CPI, whichever is highest. I reject ill-informed arguments put forward by coalition senators that this is a bad bill. If the coalition think there are issues with the bill then they should act in good faith by suggesting improvements rather than trying to get out of paying our ADF more. I am hopeful, given that the leadership of the government has now changed, that government's operating style will now change and the lower house will actively seek to deal with this important bill as a matter of haste. 


I am encouraged by some of the comments made by Malcolm Turnbull. Our new PM assures us that his government will deliver a consultative and collaborative style of government that respects the intelligence of the electorate. I am sure all people across the electorate of Australia want the government to appropriately reward our ADF for their invaluable contributions to this country. Accordingly, I hope our new Prime Minister, Mr Malcolm Turnbull, ensures this bill is given the priority it deserves. I, along with other senators, who have already spoken on this MPI, including Senators Conroy, Lambie and Xenophon, call on Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to respect the wishes of the people of Australia and the Senate chamber by dealing with the bill before the last sitting period this year so that our ADF can move forward, knowing they are respected, they are appreciated and they are valued and that they are going to receive the pay and conditions they so justly deserve. I congratulate Senator Lambie for standing up for Australia's ADF. It takes courage to do what is right.

That the Senate take note of the report.


I came in on this report a little way into its beginning. I was interested in the subject and, obviously, it was very serious. The report's recommendations reflect that everyone agrees there was an issue. We have recommended some clear and positive ways in which this incident will not happen again. Hopefully, the recommendations will be taken on board.


I would like to thank the secretariat for a wonderful report and all the people involved with Hansard. I note in the government senators' dissenting report that they have referred to the chair as a Green Independent senator.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (17:49):  I would like to speak to this report of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee as well. In advance, I will also be seeking leave to continue my remarks.


Labor senators have provided additional comments to this report and I would encourage those who have followed this matter, which has attracted a fair degree of public interest, to have a look at those comments as well. I thank Senator Lazarus for his contribution, coming in part way through the process to the report. Labor senators have focused on some critical concerns about the politicisation of the Public Service in our remarks, and I would encourage people to look at those.


Let me commence by reminding senators where this all began. In May, counsel assisting the New South Wales coronial inquest into the tragic Martin Place Lindt Cafe siege refer to a letter that the siege perpetrator, Man Haron Monis, had written to the Attorney-General, Senator Brandis. My colleague, the shadow Attorney-General, Mr Dreyfus, and I both noticed that the letter was not referred to in the joint Commonwealth New South Wales review of events leading up to the siege. At budget estimates on 29 May the Attorney-General's Department told us that the letter from Monis to the Attorney-General had both been provided and considered by the siege review.


The next day, the shadow Attorney-General asked the foreign minister, who represents the Attorney in the other place, whether there had been any changes to correspondence handling procedures since Australia's terror threat had been raised to its higher level. There the saga deteriorates considerably. The foreign minister responded, describing the Labor Party as contemptible for daring to ask the question. How dare we question this government on matters related to national security! As Laura Tingle observed, for instance, in the Australian Financial Review:


National security being the new religion, it's a bit rude to ask … questions …


That was the response. Four days later, the foreign minister corrected the record after question time—no apologies; no stepping back from her gross overreach in insulting people for daring to ask questions. There is the timing—four days later—and after question time the shadow Attorney-General was denied the opportunity to ask questions in the House, despite this attack.


Labor, quite reasonably, suspected a carefully orchestrated strategy had been deployed to avoid scrutiny while the House was sitting, and the evidence seen by this committee has confirmed that suspicion. This is what we now know as a result of asking questions. The letter in question was never provided to the siege review. The Attorney-General's Department and the Prime Minister's department knew in February—not May or June, but back in February—that the letter had never been provided to the review. Not only did the Attorney-General's Department not provide the letter in question to the siege review it omitted to provide all correspondence after November 2010, lost behind a second tab on a spreadsheet—all recent correspondence subject to the task force review was overlooked by the Attorney-General's Department.


And there was a sixth correspondence item that did not even make it to the spreadsheet which also was not provided by the Attorney-General's Department to the review. Yet, the attorney's office received unambiguous advice before question time on the Monday of that week, 1 June, that the evidence was incorrect but it allowed four question times to pass before they corrected the record. Meanwhile, on 3 June, the Attorney-General's Department spent a full working day nuancing a few paragraphs on a letter to their minister rather than correcting the record as they knew it needed to be corrected.


Now, the Attorney-General's Department stated in oral testimony that they knew the letter was not provided to the siege review but they had to determine whether it was provided by some other source—a fishing exercise. Mr Moraitis, the Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department, attempted to soothe the committee that his motivation was that he provide an absolutely correct answer. Mr Sheehan, his deputy secretary, assured us almost 40 times that the internal review was necessary and did not delay a necessary correction. But after making these soothing noises at the hearing, a note from the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet was handed across the table. That note contradicted 2½ hours of assurances provided by the Attorney-General's Department, and that was the beginning of the contradictions.


Because of inaccurate summary tables provided by the Attorney-General's Department, the committee sought and obtained correspondence between the departments. We sought the Attorney-General's question time brief. We sought and received roughly 1,000 pages of correspondence and emails. None of the assurances made by Mr Moraitis and Mr Sheehan about the need for an internal review were supported by this documentary evidence. Those assurances were in fact contradicted.


Ms Jones, for example, was so certain about the need to correct the record that she offered on 1 June to break her leave to come into the office and sign a letter for the purpose of correcting the record. We also found that the Attorney-General's deputy chief of staff, Mr Faulks, was advised of Ms Jones's offer to correct the record before question time on that Monday. So why then did it take four days to correct the record?


Material presented to the committee shows two streams of activity on the Monday morning. One was to find out what went wrong and the other was to prepare to correct the record. But, that evening there was a meeting between the Attorney-General and his secretary in which a decision was made to delay correcting the record until after question time at the end of that week. Following the meeting, Deputy Secretary Sheehan provided instructions via email to all relevant officers in the department. In that email he, for the first time, linked the review to correcting the record, and he specifies three business days for the time frame of the review—Thursday afternoon, coinciding with the end of a sitting week.


We were unimpressed to learn during this inquiry that staff in the Attorney-General's Department spent a full business day nuancing a letter to their minister on the topic rather than getting on with the business of informing the parliament that they had made a mistake. It is little wonder that the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet said that the Attorney-General's Department was—and I remind senators—'ducking for cover'.


'No,' Secretary Moraitis protested that his officers were 'running around like headless chooks'. I would describe the Attorney-General's Department's behaviour as that of officers who have been politicised by their minister. The Attorney-General wanted to avoid scrutiny about his own political overreach and that of the foreign minister in the other place, and he had once again co-opted his secretary in that goal.


But in the end the record was corrected. 'So what is the big deal?' some people have asked. Well, we think it matters when we are talking about a government that has made national security 'a new religion'. It matters when we are talking about this minister and a department that has at its heart out national security apparatus. This is about trust in the minister and his officers—trust in their honesty, capability and accountability to this parliament. The Attorney-General and his department knew that they had made a mistake. The foreign minister had made a mistake, but their instincts were to manage the politics rather than to rectify that mistake. How can we trust that response in the future?


Our new Prime Minister has an opportunity to set new standards. Michelle Grattan raised some of the issues with Mr Turnbull's behaviour when he was last leader of the coalition in opposition. But he had the opportunity to learn from some of these issues during—as senators will recall—the Godwin Grech saga. We know that the Attorney-General, through his censures here and other elements of his behaviour, did not learn during that saga. I hope that Mr Turnbull did. Our security and our safety are too important to politicise when the Prime Minister decides on the next Attorney-General.

 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Health) (18:00):  by leave—I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



This Bill will enable a trial phase of new cashless welfare arrangements and a cashless debit card, in response to a key recommendation from Mr Andrew Forrest's Review of Indigenous Jobs and Training.


The cashless debit card is an important recommendation in the Forrest Review report, Creating Parity, as a means of reducing the social harm caused by welfare—fuelled alcohol, gambling and drug abuse.


The main objective of the trial is to test whether restricting discretionary cash can reduce the overall social harm which is caused by welfare-fuelled alcohol, gambling, and drug abuse, particularly against women and children.


The trial will be conducted in up to three locations, and will be limited to 10,000 people. The locations will be selected on the basis of high levels of welfare dependence, where gambling, alcohol and illegal drug abuse are causing unacceptable levels of harm, and there is an openness to participate from within the community.


Ceduna in South Australia will be the first site under the trial to commence. The leadership in the community have publicly called for this reform, and see it as a mechanism to potentially address some of the welfare-fuelled alcohol and drug abuse that affects the community.


On the day the Government announced it would like to proceed with Ceduna as a trial site for the cashless debit card, the Ceduna Community Heads Group—a key leadership group in the community of Ceduna—endorsed the reform and said:


We want to build a future for our younger generation to aspire to and believe we cannot do this if our families are caught up in the destructive cycle of alcohol or drugs that destroys our culture, our lands and our communities.


At the heart of this reform is a change that is being shaped specifically to meet our local needs. It has been a true collaboration to ensure that we can give our mob and our Communities every chance to create real and genuine change in their lives.


We have grasped this initiative; we have helped shape this initiative; and we are confident that this initiative is for the betterment of all people within our region.


We are also in advanced discussions with the leaders in the East Kimberley region. Key leaders in the region, led by Ian Trust of the Wunan Foundation, Ted Hall Jr of the MG Corporation and Desmond Hill of Gelganyem Trust, see the trial as a worthy idea to address many social issues facing their communities. The three men wrote to the Government saying:


We acknowledge that agreeing to the East Kimberley being a trial site for the restricted debit card may seem to some a rather drastic step. However, it is our view that continuing to deliver the same programs we have delivered for the past forty years will do nothing for our people and, besides wasting more time and money, will condemn our children and future generations to a life of poverty and despair. As leaders in the East Kimberley, we cannot accept this.


When key local leaders stand up and call for reform, Parliaments should listen.


Under the trial, 80 per cent of payments received by people on a working age welfare payment, such as newstart allowance, will be placed on the cashless debit card.


Participants in the trial will receive an everyday mainstream debit card, which will be connected to the Visa, MasterCard or EFTPOS platform.


A person will not be able to use this card to access cash or use it at liquor and gambling outlets. Because cash will be limited, the ability to purchase illegal drugs will be restricted as well.


Recognising that we do not live in a cashless society and that people need cash for minor expenses such as children's lunch money, the local footy, or bus fares, the remaining 20 per cent of payments will be available for use at the person's discretion. The 20 per cent cash ration is supported by the Ceduna community.


In trial locations, the cashless debit card will work as similarly as possible to any other bank card. The trial will seek to ensure the card can work at all existing terminals and shops, except those selling restricted products, as well as online where possible. The only difference will be that it will not allow the purchase of alcohol and gambling products or allow cash withdrawals.


The Bill also empowers the Minister to authorise community bodies in trial locations. An authorised community body will be able to reduce the percentage of a person's welfare payment that is placed on the cashless debit card. This recognises that the community has an important role to play in the trial, and in encouraging socially responsible behaviour.


The trial, expected to start in the first quarter of 2016, will make a vital contribution towards informing potential future arrangements for income management, aimed at reducing social harm caused by welfare-fuelled alcohol abuse and drug abuse, especially against women and children.


Income management and the BasicsCard will continue for two additional years to maintain support for existing income management participants while the trial is running. The Social Services Legislation Amendment (No. 2) Bill 2015, introduced on 28 May 2015, will make a number of changes to streamline the income management programme to enable more effective operation of the programme. Income management and the trial will not be run in the same locations. In Ceduna, and any other trial site that is an existing income management location, income management will be switched off before the trial starts.


We acknowledge that, for some people, using a debit card rather than cash to pay for everyday items will be an initial inconvenience. We do not underplay that. However, the potential upside is a transformed community where women are safer, less money is spent on alcohol and gambling, and more money is available for children's needs.


We think, for this reason, this is an opportunity worth trialling.


Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of this bill be adjourned to the first sitting day of the next period of sittings, in accordance with standing order 111.

Senator LINDGREN
 (Queensland) (19:20):  I rise this evening to speak on Uber, the ride-share app that is challenging the current position of the taxi industry, particularly in Queensland. Uber Technologies Incorporated is an American international transportation network company that uses an application, or an app, that a consumer can download and use on their mobile phone. Uber is a digital disrupter that is currently avoiding Commonwealth and state laws. Uber may be popular amongst users, but it is a villain to Queensland taxi drivers, regulators, employment law and government revenue. Even some UberX drivers are now realising how little money they are making—approximately $10.70 an hour once all operating and self-employment costs are taken into account.


Uber—in particular UberX—do not use professional drivers, nor do they use a modified, commercially insured vehicles. Currently in Queensland, it is the Department of Transport and Main Roads that decides who can drive whom around and who administers the law that governs the licences for drivers. In my home state of Queensland, Uber is illegal under the Transport Operations (Passenger Transport) Regulation 2005 in Queensland, which requires a person to have authorisation to operate a public passenger vehicle providing public passenger service.


The previous LNP government issued a cease and desist order to Uber. Between June 2014 and June 2015, Uber drivers in Queensland have received more than $1.7 million in fines. Yet we see Uber continue to grow in popularity, in particular with young consumers and drivers who own late-model vehicles and who are in search of extra income.


As you know, Mr Acting Deputy President, the coalition government believes in enterprise and small business. That is why I find this issue a particularly vexing one. On one hand, I applaud the entrepreneurial spirit of Uber and those seeking to make public transport more efficient and user friendly. But at the same time, I feel for small businesses—the mum-and-dad business taxi owners who have bought a legitimate and legal taxi licence that costs on average $390,000 in my home state of Queensland.


Currently, there are 3,264 cabs in service across Queensland. These cabs are owned by more than 2,800 owners. More than 1,200 companies are taxi operators, while the industry employs more than 15,000 drivers. Around 48 per cent of all these licences in Queensland are held by small operators with fewer than five taxis.


Taxi service licences in a geographical area are sold by competitive tender by the state government. These licences may then be bought and sold as assets. The cost of these licences varies due to the geographical area in which they operate. Furthermore, there are overheads which do not apply to Uber but which apply to taxis before they can operate. These include taxi service licences and accreditations.


Unlike Uber taxis must serve passengers in sequential order, either in terms of when their phone or their app booking is received or where they are in a taxi rank queue. Exceptions are made for wheelchair-accessible taxis, as they must give priority to passengers in a wheelchair or on a mobility scooter. Cabs must also be no more than six years old, or eight years old for a wheelchair-accessible vehicle, and they must have a taximeter installed. Drivers must also provide itemised receipts on request and must accept all methods of electronic payment. They must hold open licences for more than 12 months; pass daily criminal history checks and obtain a medical certificate for motor vehicle driving. They must also pass a national minimum English standards assessment and complete a driver-training course. Every vehicle must have a six-monthly inspection and a subsequent certificate of inspection.


Uber drivers do not have these overheads and regulations, creating an unfair advantage. Their drivers are not required to have a blood alcohol level of zero when driving customers, they do not have to have safeguards for the consumer and a driver is not under any obligation to ensure that they are not fatigued.


Various states and territories have placed obligations and levies on the taxi industry, especially in the area of passenger safety. Members of the Queensland taxi industry must pay a security levy to the state government to address antisocial behaviour at taxi ranks on weekend nights. Other mandated safety costs require every taxi to have three GPS locators installed and an approved security camera system that is installed and operational. Additionally, one of the GPS locaters must be contained within the security camera and be able to withstand high temperatures in case the taxi is ever incinerated. This ensures that any footage and GPS data can still be accessed. These safety features further add to the costs of the service obligations placed on the industry.


I acknowledge that Uber falls under state and territory jurisdictions with regards to passenger transportation laws. I also acknowledge that these laws may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. I understand that the ACT and Western Australian governments have offered a strong indication that Uber is likely to be able to operate after an innovative industry review. I am also advised that Victoria has taken steps to accommodate Uber into its existing regulatory regime, although the service remains illegal. And south of the Tweed, the New South Wales government has announced the launch of an independent task force to examine the future sustainability of taxis, hire cars and other emerging point-to-point transport providers, including ride-sharing models. The task force will also examine the possible impact of any regulatory changes on existing investors and, if necessary, will make recommendations on a possible adjustment package. With some states and territories looking to legalise Uber, it is clear that a national consensus will not be reached. Whilst regulating Uber is of course necessary to maintain public safety and to ensure that Uber and its drivers meet their tax and other obligations, removal of constricting layers of red tape is necessary to enable the small business operators to survive in an ever-competitive market.


Uber is a multinational business based in California, with a value of over US$51 billion. It claims that it does not employ drivers but simply 'partners' with drivers. In geographical areas with over 10,000 people, service contracts for taxis exist between the state and booking companies. All vehicles in the geographical areas are required to be associated with a specific booking company. In Brisbane, this includes Black & White Cabs and Yellow Cabs. Booking companies are obliged by law to provide a universal service. This means that they are required to have a specific number of taxis on the road, spread across a geographical area.


Taxis are required by law not to discriminate. They are to provide services for the disabled and must undertake school pick-ups, compared to UberX, which only takes those who download the app. Booking companies are required to take bookings by telephone as well as electronic means. Unlike Uber taxi call centres employ people, compared to a swipe on a mobile screen.


Maximum fares for taxis are gazetted. There is no maximum gazetted fare for Uber. Surge pricing during peak usage can see users paying three times or more than the usual fare. Taxi fares may be paid using a variety of means, predominantly cash or card, whereas Uber patrons register their credit cards using the app before utilising the service, with the final transaction occurring overseas.


In May 2015 the ATO declared that Uber drivers needed to register for GST from 1 August or face appropriate consequences. It is my understanding that a legal challenge is underway against the ATO in the Federal Court. As noted previously, the billing for an Uber transaction occurs overseas at three per cent tax in Singapore. One can only assume how much, or how little, income tax is paid by Uber in Australia.


To date, the Queensland government has not undertaken a review of ride-sharing services or pointed towards reform in this area. However, Queensland's taxi strategy expires at the end of 2015. What is clear is that a dual approach is required. A number of states are moving to legalise and regulate ride-sharing apps. I call on the Queensland Labor government to even the ledger and to look at strategies that even-up the playing field so that everyone gets a fair go. The taxi industry is an integral part of the wider public transport network, and plays a vital role for the sick, the elderly, the disabled and those who live in areas not serviced by traditional public transport.


They are very good examples of deregulation of the taxi industry internationally, with varying degrees of standards implemented and with benefits for both the taxi industry and consumers. For example, our New Zealand neighbours removed quantitative restrictions on the number of taxi licences in 1989. After deregulation, the number of taxis increased substantially, like in other deregulated markets. The New Zealand experience demonstrates that deregulation or the removal of quantity and price controls with appropriate introduction of quality standards can bring about a restructuring of the industry in a way that benefits both consumers and suppliers alike. A fair go for all is all that I ask for. While competition is desirable in any market, it must occur on a level playing field where all participants are subject to the same market entry requirements.
