"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-05-24,"—I seek leave to move a motion, notice of which was given for Wednesday, 26 May 1999, to exempt a bill from the cut-off order, and to exempt an additional bill.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,1,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-05-24,"—by leave—I am opposed to the change in the line-up for debate in the Senate which is inherent in the proposed motion. I am also concerned that the government is wanting to use this form in this place to interpolate two bills, which have not previously been on the Notice Paper  for discussion, before at least 27 other bills which are before the Senate. While I am prepared to give leave for this motion to be moved, I seek your advice, Madam President, as to whether I will then be able to speak to the motion.
—Yes, Senator Brown. Leave is granted, Senator Campbell.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,1,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-05-24,"—I move:
That the provisions of paragraphs 5 to 7 of standing order 111 not apply to the Broadcasting 
 Services Amendment (Online Services) Bill 1999 and the Telecommunications Laws Amendment (Universal Service Cap) Bill 1999, allowing them to be considered during this period of sittings.
I also table a statement of reasons justifying the need for the Telecommunications Laws Amendment (Universal Service Cap) Bill 1999  to be considered during this sittings and seek leave to have the statement incorporated in Hansard .
Leave granted.
The statement of reasons read as follows—
STATEMENT OF REASONS FOR INTRODUCTION AND PASSAGE IN THE 1999 WINTER SITTINGS
TELECOMMUNICATIONS LAWS AMENDMENT (UNIVERSAL SERVICE CAP) BILL 1999
Purpose
To cap Telstra's Universal Service Obligation cost claim for 1997/98 at $253.32 million and fix it for 1998/99 and 1999/2000 at $253.32 million plus CPI
Reasons for urgency
Passage of the legislation in the Winter sittings is essential to head off the likelihood that the universal service levy which other telecommunication carriers will be required to pay to Telstra will be substantially increased from present levels (quite possibly by 100% or more). This could have significant negative effects on industry stability and investment.
The Minister gave a public commitment in late 1998 that he would take all necessary steps to ensure that the levy would not exceed $253 million plus CPI. Due to the failure of attempts to achieve voluntary agreement with Telstra, the only way to meet the commitment is to legislate.
If the legislation is not passed, the existing arrangements will continue to apply. Under those arrangements, the Australian Communications Authority (ACA) is expected to finalise the assessment in June 1999 and issue levy bills to the industry shortly afterwards in accordance with its statutory duty. It is therefore vital that the legislation should be passed before the ACA issues those bills.
(Circulated by authority of the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts)
—The statement relating to the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Online Services) Bill 1999  was previously tabled on 11 May 1999.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,1,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-05-24,"—The government here is bringing forward two pieces of legislation which it did 
 not get into gear for debate in this period of sittings—that is, before the end of next month—as a matter of urgency. I notice that the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Online Services) Bill 1999 , which is the much discussed legislation about inhibiting pornography on the Internet, is on the Notice Paper  for today.
We are here seeing the fast-tracking of pieces of legislation which are nowhere near as important as other pieces of legislation on the Notice Paper. Let me draw your attention to some of them, Madam President. Working from the bottom up, we have the Taxation Laws Amendment (Political Donations) Bill 1999 . Donations made to political parties which are addressed in that bill ought to lead to healthy discussion in this place. There is the  Copyright Amendment (Computer Programs) Bill 1999 . Apparently that aspect of computer operations is not as important as the inhibition of pornographic material used by online services. The  Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Charges Bill 1998  is legislation which has seen a lot of work but it has been relegated by the fast-tracking of the anti-pornography legislation.
The  Workplace Relations Amendment (Unfair Dismissals) Bill 1998  we have seen before. The  Textile, Clothing and Footwear Strategic Investment Program Bill 1999  and the  Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1999  are important, but we will now be telling that industry with a fair degree of confidence that this legislation will not be dealt with until after the winter session because the government is highjacking debate by bringing on other pieces of legislation.
We must remember, too, that the GST legislation has been put on the backburner while debate takes place with the Australian Democrats. The government sees this as an opportunity to bring on at least one piece of politically expedient legislation.
There is superannuation legislation and there is very important legislation to do with the protection of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander heritage. That will not be debated in this session of the Senate because the government is rescheduling—fast-tracking—legislation and getting around the very sen 
 sible amendments which were made to the forms of this chamber so that senators not only can get their minds around legislation but can consult widely with the Australian public before we come to the point of debate. That is the whole point of section 111 of the standing orders which Senator Campbell has asked be put in abeyance so that this legislation can be fast-tracked.
I would add that there is more to this than time for the public to make submissions to the Senate on such things as the online prohibitions legislation. That does not give the time for proper public input. I see that four hours have been allocated for a bill to do with higher education. Education is apparently not as important as the effort to—
—Yes, it's the VSU bill.
—Suddenly that bill has dropped out of the government's priority list. I guess that is because the government has read the newspapers and has seen that Senator Colston is not in favour of that legislation.
—We want to do them all.
—The honourable National Party senator opposite says that he wants to get up and talk at length on this matter as well, and I will make sure that he gets time after me.
There is quarantine amendment legislation. There is the  Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998 . The government has had this as a priority; it is apparently not as important, however, as the broadcasting online services bill.  A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Bill 1999  with an attendant repeal and consequential amendment bill is suddenly getting a second-rung treatment.
—Stop wasting time.
—The members opposite interjecting ought to be very aware that I am exposing the ease with which the government is manipulating the debate order in this place. It is very important. I am saying that, through this manipulation, very important pieces of legislation are not going to be debated until after we resume in August. The government 
 has found itself caught out on this, and I intend to continue to expose it.
The  Wool International Privatisation Bill 1999  is an important part of the legislation which the government has to deal with. I note, however, that when it comes to damaging the environment, the government's legislation with the complex name of the  Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill 1998 [1999]  and the Environmental Reform (Consequential Provisions) Bill 1998 [1999] remains up there as a priority. Why is that? This legislation is also being fast-tracked by the government because the government wants to shed environmental powers built up over the last half-century back to the states, against the interests of the environment.
It does not escape my notice that, while we are delayed in our program of debating the GST legislation, which was so important last week, government and Democrat members are at this moment out of the chamber discussing this matter of what to do with the environment. I will tell you what they are debating, not in the chamber but outside, Madam President. This is a massive sell-out of the environment by the Democrats aiding and abetting the Howard government to bring in its GST package with the attendant diesel package.
There are people out there who want to see this debate in here, but they are not, and this change of the schedule is part of the reason why they are not. I will tell you why that is, Madam President. It is because people believe that that diesel package is the government's package; it is not, it is the Democrats' package. The Democrats are putting before the government, on schedule, a $1 billion package to foster the consumption of fossil fuels, to worsen the greenhouse gas situation in this country and, to boot, to give a massive injection of funds, a free gift on a silver platter, to the big mining, woodchip and transport corporations. They have the hide to say that they are doing this to aid the poor struggling farmers. The best the farmers will get out of this is a trickle-down, secondary flow-on of the benefit which is going straight to the big transport corporations. And where are they owned? In the cities.
While the detail of that is being sorted out, we have Senator Campbell moving this motion to try to get other pieces of legislation debated which are of secondary importance, at least as far as the online bill is concerned, to much more important pieces of legislation that we should be debating.
I can tell the chamber that we are going to have a full-on debate when the GST legislation, which has been relegated by this move, comes back into this place. We are going to take the Democrats head-on for what they are doing to the Australian environment through this billion dollar gift to the big corporations to burn diesel fuel. We will be taking the Democrats head-on for what they are doing to the interest of the poorer people in this country, the very people they said that they would shelter from a GST on food but who they have already sold out by putting a GST on all food which has been processed in one form or another.
Whereas the Democrats' promise at the election was that food would be free of the GST, the Democrats' delivery puts the GST on a whole range of food which poor Australians—as well as rich Australians, of course—consume, and which every food consumption trend shows they will consume more of in the future. In other words, it is a regressive tax on a basic item not promoted here by the Howard government but introduced by the Democrats before they even got to the table with the Howard government. What a sell-out of the election policy of the party that said that it was going to keep us so-and-sos honest. Having sold out comprehensively on that key promise which they said would make the GST good—they could ameliorate the nasty side of the GST so that Australians would not be damaged by it—here they are leading—
—Madam President, I realise that it is not possible to keep Senator Brown honest so I will not trouble with that, but my point of order is relevance. We are debating a cut-off motion on the online services bill. I am quite happy to listen to Senator Brown demonstrate that he does not know anything about the Democrats' amendments, but I am sure the Australian public would like us to debate some legislation.
—Senator Brown, you should be relating your remarks to the motion that is before the chair and not ranging too widely beyond that.
—Yes and, as you will have heard, Madam President, that is what I am doing. What I am analysing here is the reasons why we are not debating the schedule as it was last week but are having that completely altered. It is not just the government that is in this process; the Democrats are a fundamental reason. We have gone off the GST package because the interest of the Australian people is being sold out not in this chamber but somewhere else in the anterooms, and we will hear a little more about that down the line. I want to assure Senator Bartlett and his Democrat colleagues that they are only just hearing the start of this. They certainly have not heard the finish of their process towards giving Australia a Democrats' GST which it never voted for. So, with that, I say I object to what the government is doing. It is not getting its priorities right, and I am opposed to this motion coming from the government.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,1,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1999-05-24,"—While I think that Senator Brown has made some interesting comments about the relationship between the government and the Democrats, and I think they are matters that do need to be canvassed at some length, I do not necessarily think that we have opportunities at this time to do that. The opposition is supporting the government's motion to exempt from the cut-off these various bills, and I trust that that will be a matter discussed closer to the mark.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,1,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1999-05-24,"—I wish to put on record for the Democrats the fact that we do not support the government's motion that is before us. We will not seek to divide, recognising time constraints and also the fact that the opposition has indicated that they will be supporting the motion. We oppose this motion on two grounds: in relation to the exemption of both the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Online Services) Bill 1999  and the Telecom 
 munications Laws Amendment (Universal Service Cap) Bill 1999 .
We will not go into the merits of the telecommunications bill, because that is not appropriate to do at this stage of the debate. We do not support the substance of that bill nor do we believe that there is any urgency in bringing that bill on for debate. I would like to quote the government's statement of reasons for claiming that this bill is urgent. It says:
Under those arrangements, the Australian Communications Authority (ACA) is expected to finalise the assessment in June 1999 and issue levy bills to the industry shortly afterwards in accordance with its statutory duty.
We believe that this process should be left to occur—that is, that the ACA should make its decision in relation to the USO cost claim and the government should not be intervening. As I mentioned, we will not divide on that issue. In relation to the online services bill, I think most senators would agree that that matter has been introduced to the chamber, referred to a committee and reported on in undue haste. I have had no statement from government—or certainly statements that have been substantiated—giving any reasons for bringing this bill to the chamber and debating it with such urgency. The only reason I have had from government was a single sentence justification referring only to the need:
. . . to meet growing concerns about the potential exposure to children of classified material on the Internet, particularly given the increasing access to on-line services in the Australian community.
I have to say that before the committee process the government failed to substantiate this so-called high level of community concern. But, beyond that, we have seen undue haste applied to the introduction of this bill, the referral of this bill, the reporting date of the committee on this bill and now the debate of this bill in the chamber. There is no reason for that urgency. It is an important bill; it is not an urgent bill. And for that reason we oppose it being exempt from the cut-off rule as well.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,1,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-05-24,"—I just rise to indicate that Greens (WA) will not be supporting the exemption from the cut-off of the two bills 
 mentioned. At the whips meeting this morning it was mentioned that exemption for the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Online Services) Bill 1999  would be asked for as well. At that stage I did not know that both of them would be put in the same motion. That makes it perhaps more imperative that we make a statement in relation to that.
There are issues in relation to the broadcasting services bill which I believe ought to be taken more carefully, and I will bring that out in my second reading contribution. The reality is that there are other processes that are occurring at the moment in relation to the capping process. And we have other considerations, like whether or not the actual amount relates to what is happening with the desire for other services that people are asking for. I believe that the Australian Communications Authority is going through a process, and here we are jumping the gun before that is assessed. So on that issue alone it would seem to be a strange thing for us to bring on now what can be, in effect, a retrospective action in relation to the universal service cap.
In relation to broadcasting services, I think we have made it clear that we do not think it could or should be argued at a time when the government has said it has a very tight program. The government keeps wanting us to sit extra hours, extra days, and, potentially, extra weeks. I would not be in favour of that, considering the way that they are carrying on. Every time they ask us for extra hours we will bring up that they were prepared to take time off their otherwise urgent program to put extra bills into the program. If they turn around and say that they want extra time on the Telstra sale bill, the tax bills or some other bills later on, we will remember that they have taken time and forced this into the program now.
The reality is that I certainly will not be in favour of trying to push this through and continuing on at all hours for the next six weeks, because there will not be a great benefit, I believe, for the Australian people if the people in this chamber are not able to catch up with their work, if the people outside in the community are not able to catch up with the electorate program and if the Depart 
 ment of the Senate and all of the committees are not able to catch up with the work that they need to do for the current and ongoing programs to be successful. So I think the government's arguments are not of sufficient merit to indicate that these bills are urgent enough for us to drop all other things, and I indicate that I will also be voting against the motion.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,1,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1999-05-24,"—I rise to support the contribution that has been made by the Manager of Opposition Business, Senator Carr, and indicate to the Senate that the opposition will be supporting this exemption from the cut-off.
I am provoked to make a brief contribution to this particular debate because of the nature of the speech made a few moments ago by Senator Stott Despoja, who indicated that the Australian Democrats would not be supporting this particular motion before the chair. I do think that we have to make absolutely clear here that the reason the government is bringing forward this particular motion for exemption from the cut-off at this time is that the Australian Democrats are currently in discussions with the government on the issue of the taxation legislation that literally, until 72 hours ago, was the matter that was proposed for debate in the Senate this afternoon.
—The GST.
—Yes, Senator Sherry. That is why I assume the Manager of Government Business is bringing forward this particular motion. The opposition generally accepts, as you would know, Madam President, that it is the government's responsibility to organise its own legislative program. Generally, the opposition takes the view—it is not always the case, but usually we take the view—that it is reasonable for the government to put forward its legislative priorities and for the chamber to deal with them unless there are particular circumstances that mean that the opposition might take a view that other priorities are more important at any particular time. But generally it is accepted around the chamber that the government determines its own legislative program. Here we have a situation where GST negotiations are currently 
 going on behind closed doors between Senator Lees—I do not know whether Senator Stott Despoja is involved in them or not—
—Now we have got to the bottom of it. No, she is not.
—She is apparently not involved in them, Madam President. But, if you are not involved in them, Senator, get involved. That is my suggestion. What is clear is that behind closed doors Senator Lees and some other Australian Democrats are involved in negotiation with Mr Howard, Mr Costello and others. The point here is that that has meant with the Democrats' support—
Government senators interjecting—
—I am not using the word `connivance'; I am using the word `support'. With the Democrats' support, the government has made a decision to take the tax legislation off the legislative program for the Senate today. Everybody knows that that is what has happened. And then—rather tongue-in-cheek, I think—Senator Stott Despoja, as Deputy Leader of the Australian Democrats, got up and said, `We don't support this particular government motion for exemption of the cut-off for a couple of bills.' I have got to say that you cannot have it both ways on these sorts of motions. The reason the motion has come forward is the dealing that is going on between the Democrats and the government.
Senator Campbell is, of course, in a uniquely strong position to understand this. I think that if Mr Howard and Mr Costello are on the ball they will invite Senator Campbell to be involved in the negotiations because he has got first-hand knowledge of the Democrats—he was a member.
Senator Ian Campbell interjecting—
—You probably know more about the Australian Democrats than anyone else in the government. If Mr Howard and Mr Costello are on the ball they will involve you—they will use that experience.
I do not often say this about Senator Stott Despoja's contributions in the chamber, but it was a little transparent to get up and say, `We're happy for the GST legislation not to 
 be debated, but we're not so happy for these particular bills to come forward and be debated.' You cannot have it both ways in this chamber. Some in the chamber genuinely will not accept that, as it always does, the opposition cooperatively works with the government to ensure that we see progress of government legislation. Some might genuinely argue that the opposition has got it wrong in supporting the exemption of these two important pieces of legislation. But on this occasion I really do believe that on these motions the Australian Democrats stand exposed. The proposition is before the chair because of what is happening outside this chamber. Senator Stott Despoja and Senator Bartlett must know that. Millions and millions of Australians know it. I think the less said by the Australian Democrats on this motion the better.
As far as the opposition is concerned, we want to get on with the debate about the important issues that are before the Senate. The government's legislative program is again in tatters, but we will help them out. We will give you the numbers to make sure that we get on with this important piece of legislation. We are happy to debate it now.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,1,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-05-24,"—Senator Faulkner says you cannot have it both ways. The government wants to exempt this legislation from the cut-off, to rush it through, and the Labor Party is running around the country saying: `This legislation hasn't had enough community consultation. This legislation has major flaws. This legislation needs more work.' Yet it is thanks to the Labor Party that this legislation is now going to be debated today, well ahead of any decent degree of community consultation.
Everybody knows there are lots of flaws with this bill; everybody knows it is not workable. Certainly those people who are affected, those people who understand the area of information technology and are going to be the victims of this bill, know it is flawed. They know it is rushed. The Labor Party are happy to run around the country spouting that message yet when it comes to a specific vote on a matter that counts—trying to ensure that this bill doesn't come on until the problems with it are properly examined— 
 they go to water and support the government and so enable the bill to come on straight away. So it appears that it is more the ALP that is trying to have it both ways on this issue.
Somehow or other Senator Faulkner thinks it is a matter of great revelation that the Democrats are discussing tax issues with the government and that is why the tax bills are not on. It is hardly a matter of surprise. It is certainly not something the Democrats would not highlight; it is something we have obviously been quite public about. We have tried to play a constructive role in that debate from day one. From the day the tax proposals were first announced, before the election, we have been keen to try to get a positive outcome for Australia. It is a great shame that the government until last week had chosen not to discuss any of those serious concerns with us. But the fact that they finally are at least gives some opportunity for positive outcomes for Australia to still occur. It is a great shame that did not happen until last week.
Obviously under those circumstances the government is not in a position—having only finally got around to looking at the Democrats' concerns—to give a response to those concerns in the parliament. So in that context the tax legislation cannot be brought on. It is something that the Democrats do not walk away from. Indeed, we are quite proud of having been able to ensure that some of the serious problems with the tax package have been put on the community agenda, on the public agenda, and are being properly considered. If it was not for the Democrats insisting on a proper comprehensive committee inquiry into the tax package, then many of these problems would not have come to light. If it was not for the Democrats, then serious issues such as urban air pollution would never have got on the public agenda, whereas now, significantly, the Prime Minister of this country is recognising and acknowledging the importance of not increasing urban air pollution. If it were not for the role of the Democrats, then those sorts of serious issues would not be given the proper prominence they are now given.
So whilst we are disappointed that it has taken until now for the government to seriously discuss the Democrats' concerns, it is better late than never. In that context we cannot debate that legislation now. To suggest that that is an excuse to bring on this legislation is farcical, to say the least. For Senator Faulkner to draw that argument is obviously ridiculous. The Notice Paper shows about 25 or 26 other pieces of legislation that have all been in this chamber longer than the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Online Services) Bill. All of those have had proper examination and many are of greater importance economically and socially to this country. Clearly, those are the ones the Senate should be discussing—not the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Online Services) Bill, which the ALP itself publicly states has not been given adequate consideration. So it is drawing a long bow indeed to try to make some connection between tax packages and bringing on this specific legislation.
Whilst the public and the broader Senate might not be happy to hear Senator Brown continue on at far greater length than he already has, I am personally quite happy to hear him demonstrate his ignorance in as much length as he wishes to go on with, because it highlights his inadequate understanding of the important issues here and the Democrats' position on them. If it were not for the role of the Democrats in establishing the Senate committee inquiries then these problems, particularly the significant negative environmental impacts, of the government's tax package would not have come to light. I do not know if Senator Brown attended any of the environment committee hearings, and that may be a reason why he is only just coming up to speed with some of the serious problems with the government's tax package that the Democrats have been pointing out for many months. It seems astonishing to me, and an extraordinary situation, that a so-called Green party—presumably meant to be a pro-environment party—is attacking another party, the Democrats, that is trying to achieve a positive environmental outcome.
—He is going to vote against the GST, unlike your lot.
—I am not sure what the point of being in the parliament is for a pro-environment party if you are not trying to get positive environmental outcomes through the parliamentary process. But certainly the Democrats are the ones who have got this issue on the agenda. We are highlighting the environmental negatives of the government's tax package and we are trying to achieve a significant positive environmental outcome for Australia. That is what the Democrats are about—achieving a positive environmental outcome. The Democrats, as we have stated publicly and firmly for many months and have continued to state right through to today—and I am happy to state again—certainly will not support anything that does not deliver a significant positive environmental outcome. Why trying to achieve a positive environmental outcome is a problem for the Green party I am not quite sure.
Senator Brown said he is going to take the Democrats head-on in relation to that. I am quite happy for that. Perhaps those five demonstrators who turned up outside my office in Brisbane yesterday to picket and who had not worked out that, whilst the Democrats work hard, we usually do not turn up on a Sunday, will take us head-on as well. I am quite happy to be taken head-on in relation to trying to achieve a positive environmental outcome for Australia. That is part of the core business of the Democrats, as we have demonstrated  over more than 20 years in this parliament.
So we are the ones who are putting this under the microscope. We have put it under the Senate committee microscope. We have put it on the agenda. If we do not get a positive environmental outcome then we certainly will not be proceeding on this issue. Again, we make no secret of and no apology for the fact that the Democrats are having discussions about that issue with the government at the moment. Why we should be attacked for trying to discuss things with the government to convince the government to produce a positive outcome for the environment baffles me. But, anyway, I am sure we will hear more and more about that over the weeks to come.
Unfortunately, last week was the first time the coalition actually looked at what the Democrats' amendments and concerns are about. It seemed like they were some of the few people in the country who had little understanding of what the Democrats' amendments are about. But it seems that, with Senator Brown, we have found somebody who knows even less about the detail of the Democrats' amendments than the government. Perhaps in the coming time before the tax legislation comes back on we can offer him a briefing about the details we have worked out in consultation with environment groups and experts in pollution and greenhouse issues. He may then become more aware of the issues that we are trying to get on the public agenda.
That is a matter for debate for another time, but certainly at this stage the Democrats believe there is plenty of other legislation we should be debating now that is already on the Notice Paper and that has already been examined. Much of it has already been through Senate committee inquiries. We have seen no justification, not least from the ALP, for why we should be fast-tracking this online services bill. There is no need for it—no urgent social need, no urgent economic need. No reason has been put forward for why this particular legislation should jump the queue. Hopefully, we will not need to listen to any more doublespeak from the ALP about this bill not being given enough community consultation because, obviously, if it was not for their vote, we would have had the opportunity for more consultation on it.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,1,1
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,1999-05-24,"—Today we have heard from the Democrats—the ones that John West rejected, the ones who are not involved at all in the GST negotiations. The only way they can get back in the marketplace is to come into the Senate and object to this. I want to make only one point. What is stunning about this is that it is obvious—and I think it is an obvious move—that a government would withdraw its taxation measures whilst it is in the midst of negotiations. We cannot be overly critical of that.
—You just were.
—You are in the ideal position with your new friends to go and negotiate what to bring on now. Where were your bozos over the last weekend? They were sitting up at Treasury Place negotiating with Mr Costello and Mr Howard. Some of you were staying in hotels around Melbourne hoping to get a tidbit thrown to you, but what were your negotiators doing? They were negotiating about tax. Surely it would have occurred to just one of them, `Well, tax is going to go off next week. What comes on?' There are 25 bills. Surely your negotiators could have suggested to the government, `We wouldn't mind the wool bill or whatever other bill coming on on Monday.'
—They said they had already stitched up a deal with you lot.
—No, they had not. The first we knew about this proposal was when the Manager of Government Business faxed us the new program, and I must commend him for getting it out as quickly as he could because I think he probably sent it to us within half an hour of decision making. We were told that on Thursday.
But what has happened to the great negotiators? All you have to do at the moment, Senator Bartlett, through you, Madam President, is when you say, `Jump', the Liberals will respond, `How high?' You have got them. You are in negotiation. But what do you bozos do? You forget to arrange the program for this week. You ignore it. Talk about the arguments in the paper that the fairies at the bottom of the garden have suddenly become trolls; they are back to fairies at the bottom of the garden again. They overlooked the fact that the Senate is sitting this week. They overlooked the fact that, if they knock this motion off, they go into their favourite debate on the privatisation of Telstra. Is that what you want? That is the effect if you vote against this motion today.
On the general view, the Labor Party has rarely enforced the cut-off motion. We never believed in it particularly in government; that is true. Something like 190 cut-off motions have come before this chamber, and we have voted for about 188 of them. We do reserve the right in certain circumstances to knock it 
 off, either on the basis of lack of consultation or, tactically, because we hate the bill. We are honest about it. One or the other reason will be what we put forward to knock off the cut-off motion, but we do not generally agree with it.
What we really dislike is the smarmy hypocrisy of the old Australian Democrats coming in and saying, `We're in negotiations with the government. We believe the tax bill should be taken off while those negotiations go on, but we were too damned dopey to think of an alternative proposition to put to the government last Thursday and Friday to sort out this week.' The one thing that we dislike in politics more than the adversarial nature is pure unprofessional dopiness. Guilty on all charges.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,1999-05-24,"—On 19 March this year, the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts announced that the government proposed to legislate to regulate Internet content. The opposition, through the medium of the shadow minister for communications, responded at that time in the following terms and made three key points. Firstly, the opposition supported workable and feasible regulation of Internet content which placed realistic road blocks in the way of children being exposed to content unacceptable by community standards.
Secondly, the government's announced proposal was duplicitous because it was not being proposed on its merits but rather to gather support for unrelated government legislation, in particular Telstra privatisation legislation. It deliberately sought to create the impression that the government's announced measure would solve the problem of unacceptable content when the reality is, backed 
 by CSIRO advice and industry analysis, that it is not feasible to regulate such content as over 90 per cent of Internet content is sourced from offshore. Thirdly, the sensible public policy approach to Internet content is to empower parents and schools, particularly by way of information about end use filter devices.
On 21 April this year, the government introduced into the Senate the  Broadcasting Services Amendment (Online Services) Bill 1999  with a view to the legislation being dealt with by the Senate before 1 July this year. In the meantime, at the request of Senator Harradine, the government re-established the Senate Select Committee on Information Technologies with a view to the current bill being referred to and examined in detail by that committee.
The bill was referred and over 20 hours of public hearings were conducted by the Senate Select Committee on Information Technologies. During those hearings, the committee received 104 submissions and heard from 33 witnesses in total. Those witnesses were industry associations, government departments, regulatory agencies, private firms, consumer associations and a range of interest groups with particular perspectives in this debate. Those groups included the Australian Library and Information Association, the CSIRO, Young Media Australia, the Eros Foundation, Australia Online, the Internet Industry Association, NOIE, the Electronic Frontiers Australia and the Australian Information Industry Association. The report of the Senate select committee was tabled in this place on Tuesday, 12 May.
On the introduction of the bill, the opposition indicated its intent to conduct a detailed examination of the legislation throughout the committee process. That intent was carried out and the opposition tabled a significant minority report addressing the following points: firstly, the opposition's approach to Internet regulation; secondly, the need for sensible measures to limit the access of children to harmful material; thirdly, our disappointment at the duplicitous and disruptive approach adopted by the government to this important legislation; and, fourthly, the 
 failure of the government to squarely address the issue that the bill does not solve the problem that the vast majority of offensive material is hosted offshore and hence escapes any regulation by the bill.
A brief description of the legislation is appropriate at this stage. The legislation seeks to regulate content on the Internet through amendments to the Broadcasting Services Act. The legislation introduces a content rating regime for the Internet analogous to that in existence for broadcast and narrowcast technology and it requires the industry to develop an industry code of conduct to address the issue. The legislation empowers the Australian Broadcasting Authority to oversee regulation and adherence to the code and to develop an ABA standard by 1 March 2000 if an industry code is not ratified by 1 January 2000.
The legislation effects a process by which the ABA, on complaint about material, can require Internet service providers to take down X or refused classification rated material hosted onshore and to take all reasonable steps to prevent access to X or refused classification rated material hosted offshore. In respect of R classified onshore content, the ABA must be satisfied that restricted access arrangements, for example, PIN, password or age verifications, are in place. No proposal is made in respect of offshore classified R material. The bill specifies time frames for the take down process and penalties for non-compliance. The bill expressly does not apply to live Internet content such as news groups, chat channels or email.
Initial industry reaction to the legislation can be described as hostile. Major criticisms by industry have included the following: that content regulation is inappropriate for the Internet medium and that, as a matter of principle, there should be no restrictions at all on Internet content; that proposals in respect of offshore content regulation are unworkable; that the proposals would place an onerous economic burden on Internet service providers; and that the proposals would reduce or destroy Australia's attractiveness as an Internet e-commerce jurisdiction.
Following the introduction of the bill and examination of the explanatory memorandum, 
 the opposition identified eight key matters to serve as a framework for ongoing analysis of the bill. The first matter is the duplicity of the government's approach in two key respects: firstly, the linkage to the Telstra legislation; secondly, in respect of the government's public presentation, that the legislation—the bill itself—would, without more, solve the problem. This was, and clearly is, incorrect. For the government to have made this a major policy proposal and to continue to spread disinformation that the bill, if passed substantially in its current form, will solve the problem of children and others gaining access to material that is generally regarded by the community as being offensive or undesirable is a bold-faced lie—a lie that should not be allowed to remain unchallenged in this chamber.
The bill does not solve the problem of offensive material coming from offshore because 90 per cent of that material does come from offshore and this bill does not apply to it. The second key matter that we have adopted is that, in principle, the notion of Internet content regulation would be agreed, but only that which is technically feasible and not so onerous as to reduce the attractiveness of Australia as an Internet industry, e-commerce jurisdiction.
The third principle is the viability and effectiveness of Internet service provider filter arrangements. The fourth principle is the lack of viability of offshore content regulation and the fifth is to support an industry based and industry agreed code of practice as a regulatory vehicle in conjunction with the legislation. The sixth point is to note, for the moment, the government's application of the narrowcasting/broadcasting classification regime for the purposes of the current bill, knowing that decisions might have to be revisited in the future as technology and Internet use develops and spreads. The seventh key point is that an effective and realistic content regulation solution requires the education and improvement of end users, particularly by way of end use filter devices. The eighth and final principle that we have adopted is the need for active government pursuit of international activity and international 
 agreements to address the issue of Internet content coming from offshore into this country.
Industry reaction to the detail of the legislation during the select committee hearings was critical of the short time periods for effective consultation and hostile to much of the ineffective content in the bill. Particular detailed criticisms made at public hearings and via written submissions included that the 24-hour take-down period for offshore content was far too short; the penalty regime of 50 penalty units per day per continuing breach was simply too punitive; and the legislation did not expressly specify what `all reasonable steps' were required to be taken in respect of offshore content.
The opposition will move a second reading amendment addressing our concerns and reservations. The first of these is that the legislation is not being dealt with on its merits, but is linked to a 1 July 1999 timetable, which has caused indecent haste and inadequate consideration of the content of the bill. The second is the duplicity of the government in its presentation to the general public of the effectiveness of its regime to control offshore content—in particular, that the bill deliberately tricks mums and dads. The third is the unworkability of the proposals and the ease with which they can be bypassed. The fourth is to note, but not to unthinkingly accept, the broadcasting or narrowcasting classification regime in respect of the Internet medium, together with an acknowledgment that this may well have to be revisited in the future, particularly in light of whatever changes convergence of technology might bring. Our fifth concern is the need for the Commonwealth to pursue international arrangements in respect of Internet content regulations. The final point we will address in that second reading amendment is that the real solution to the mischief at hand is end use empowerment, which requires an extensive education and information campaign for parents, guardians and schools in respect of the use of the Internet and end use filter devices.
The opposition will move a series of amendments in the committee stage. The first 
 is that the 24-hour take-down period be extended to 48 hours and apply only after a process of real and effective notification of the relevant breach. The second is that the focus of the proposed penalty regime be directed towards deliberate and informed breaches of the act, that is, those breaches that are taken with full knowledge of the act. The third is that `all reasonable steps' be expressly defined to include end use empowerment, information provision and advice on culturally appropriate end use filter devices, and that such reasonable steps generally be technically feasible, commercially viable and cost effective. The fourth is for the ABA to take into account the public interest in not requiring unreasonable steps that would reduce national Internet capacity. The fifth is that the ABA take into account the public interest in ensuring that Australia remains an attractive Internet e-commerce investment jurisdiction by not requiring measures that would unreasonably degrade Internet capacity or utility. The final amendment to be moved by the opposition is that, after an appropriate period of the operation of the legislation, a review of the legislation be allowed, which is itself to be subject to a three-year sunset clause.
So the position of the opposition has been clear from the outset. We do not believe that the government has been sufficiently honest in its approach to this bill. I cannot recall when such an important bill has been the subject of such ongoing and continuing haste. The Internet as a medium introduces new and novel forms of communication. It opens the whole world and copious amounts of information to any person in Australia who can operate a computer. Businesses, consumers, parents and guardians are all caught up in its operation. Real issues of equity have not been considered, let alone discussed or debated, and will not be discussed or debated as we go through the committee stages of this bill.
Many persons in Australia—many parents—are still uncomfortable with the use of technology and the immediate spread of technology into their homes. My own two daughters, aged eight and 11, have regular training and instruction at their schools on computers, IT and the Internet. My children—as do nearly 
 all children—love the ease with which they can gain access to information. Even local libraries now provide relatively easy access to the Internet.
Many parents, though, are uncomfortable with some of these developments. They may not be as computer literate as they would like to be. They are often not aware of the range of material that is readily accessible. They have not had the opportunity to be trained or become familiar with the use of the Internet and associated technology.
—How are you going to fix that?
—Equity issues are still ignored by this bill. A decent computer and printer still costs in the order of $2,000. For parents with children who spend all of their income on the basics of life, access to the Internet, even if desired, is still often cost prohibitive. A glaring omission of this bill is the lack of resource allocation for parent empowerment and community awareness.
Nearly every witness to the Senate IT committee proceedings impressed upon the committee the urgent need for parental education and community awareness. The explanatory memorandum identifies that the government has allocated only $1.9 million for the framework administration of this bill. Of that $1.9 million, nearly three-quarters, or $1.5 million per annum, will be allocated for classifications by the classification board. Only $500,000 is allocated for community awareness and industry liaison. That figure of half a million dollars can be contrasted to the allocation of nearly $20 million to sell the government's new tax package prior to the last election.	Significant upgrading of that figure of half a million dollars for industry liaison, parent empowerment and community awareness would have the capacity to greatly assist Australian parents and those bodies which carry out de facto supervisory role of children.	Despite being pressed in the committee stages, the government refuses to increase that amount or outline the detail of any plans or programs it might have to carry out important community awareness raising.
The opposition does not suggest this needs to be done for all time. A significant upgrading of resource allocation for a defined period of time will probably do the trick. The opposition urges the government to reconsider this aspect of funding because it has the capacity to immediately and greatly assist Australian families and Australian parents.
Madam Acting Deputy President, I take advice whether it is adequate to move the second reading amendment that has been circulated. I so move:
At the end of the motion, add ""but the Senate expresses its concern that:
(a)	 the legislation is being dealt with in indecent haste and with inadequate consideration;
(b)	 the Government's claim that the legislation will `solve the problem' of unacceptable content is not supported by the reality that the vast bulk of internet content is generated outside Australia;
(c)	 the proposals, including the idea of mandatory internet service provider filters, are unworkable and easily by-passed;
(d)	 the application of the narrowcasting classification regime to the regulation of internet content has not been thoroughly analysed and may well require revisiting in the future, in view of rapidly changing and converging technology;
(e)	 efforts should be made by the Government to pursue international agreements on the regulation of internet content;
(f)	 substantially more emphasis should be placed on end-user empowerment through information and education campaigns for parents, schools and guardians about the use of the internet and of end-user filter devices; and
(g)	 the legislation does not include a sunset clause, or provision for review, given the speed of technological change in this area"".
Finally, I should advise that the opposition has tabled a series of amendments and authorises circulation of those amendments in the chamber.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (ONLINE SERVICES) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Tierney, Sen John",LP,1999-05-24,"—I too wish to speak on this matter, a matter with which I have had some ongoing involvement since 1993 when one of the Senate committees first had a look at this issue. It was there that we saw the tremen 
 dous possibilities of the Internet as the main driver of the e-commerce revolution that is now sweeping the country and developing a whole new information economy which will place Australia very well in economic development into the next century.
Like all new industries that suddenly come upon society, we have to have a look at this industry's impact. Over time, governments respond to regulate industries in various ways. All industries, whether they like it or not, are subject to some type of government regulation. Most industries prefer not to be regulated—obviously it is time consuming and there are costs of compliance. But it is necessary for industries to be regulated if the laws of the land are to be upheld. This industry has many legal aspects which we need to address.
I would ask those opposite, with particular reference to Senator Bishop in his last speech, how he really intends to address the key issue here, which is: what do we do about illegal material on the Internet which, if it were shown on any other medium—whether it be print, film, video or TV—would be considered illegal activity?
—The Crimes Act.
—Ah, the senator says, `The Crimes Act.' Excellent. We do have laws and those laws are used to enforce various measures and can perhaps do that very well in terms of some of the media we referred to. I will ask Senator Stott Despoja to tell us how the Crimes Act can be effectively applied in this particular instance. I do not think Constable Plod on his bicycle is going to catch up with the very fast moving Internet.
Senator Schacht interjecting—
—Senator, you have raised the absolute essential point—that the current laws and the way in which they are applied to traditional media are very difficult to apply to this medium. That is why we have to come up with a range of new measures. Let us have a look at what some of this illegal material is that we have to deal with.
—Why don't you give us a graphic description and grab a headline or two? 
—I cannot quite hear what Senator Lundy is interjecting, but she is probably trying to trivialise this and say, `It is just porn.' It is a lot more than that. Certainly we have problems with things like racial vilification, and I commend SBS television's Insight  program last week for putting a major focus on racial vilification as a problem on the Net. There is also extreme violence on the Net. You can get a homemade recipe for making a bomb on the Net. Paedophile rings use the Net for entrapment.
—You are such a sensationalist, Senator Tierney. This is not what this legislation is about.
—I know this is embarrassing, Senator Lundy, but these things exist on the Net at the moment, and they are illegal and the government has a duty to do something about this illegal material. If it were shown in any other medium it would be refused classification.
Senator Schacht interjecting—
—Order! It would assist the debate if Senator Tierney could proceed.
—Thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President. I realise this is embarrassing to the opposition, because they have no answer as to how you are going to enforce illegal material that currently exists on the Net.
No law that we try to enforce in this country is necessarily 100 per cent enforced. That does not mean we do not try. If something like breaking and entering is illegal, we try to enforce that. We do not succeed 100 per cent, but at least we try. I listened carefully to Senator Bishop's speech and I did not hear anything in it that would indicate any sort of enforcement provision against illegal material. It is a difficult and a changing medium in which to bring about any sort of enforcement. The Internet is expanding each year at 100 per cent at the moment—in other words, it is doubling its size each year. Its size is going up exponentially. The technology is changing rapidly. 
—It is a global medium. What makes you think you can control regulation?
—Indeed, CSIRO evidence was very interesting and instructive in this regard. What the CSIRO wrote in a report was contradicted by their later verbal evidence to the committee, because within the six months the technology had changed again.
—That is the biggest backflip I have ever heard.
—No, it isn't, Senator. If you look back at the evidence we first received in 1993 before a Senate committee on this matter, also in 1995, in 1997 and in 1999, on all of those occasions there was evidence given by the industry saying, `Oh no, you can't do anything about this. It is technically impossible to do anything about this.'
—A bit of fast repositioning there by Senator Alston to save a bit of face.
—Order! Senator Lundy, I understand that there are differing views on the subject under discussion but it would assist the debate if Senator Tierney could finish his speech.
—Senator Lundy, you have 20 minutes later on. Could you just retain your babble for a moment. It is not having any effect on anything. We cannot hear what you are saying. You are being very disruptive and you will have 20 minutes a bit later on. I listened in silence—almost. I made one interjection on Senator Bishop but that was it. I was not agreeing with him but I am taking this opportunity now to respond to the points he raised.
As I was saying, we have looked at this matter at a number of hearings, and the technology has changed very rapidly over that time. What was not possible in 1993 is possible now. Things will change, particularly with filtering technologies, to become more sophisticated and more possible in future years. That is why the bill has two provisions at its centre. It is a very flexible bill, an organic bill, which will change with the nature of the industry. People do not have to take down material—I am talking about the 
 Internet    service providers here—if it is not technically feasible and if it is not commercially viable. They have a let-out clause which says, `If you cannot do it, we are not going to force you to do it. But if the technology becomes available and you are aware of these problems, then you do have to do it.' What is more reasonable than that? That is the key provision in the bill, and it fills the gap that is left by the alternatives that are proposed by the opposition and the industry.
What does the industry want to do with this? The industry is happy to develop an industry code of practice—and they should. That is a very important strategy. They should have standards, and they will have those ready by the end of the year. That is to be commended and is supported by this legislation. But they say that the answer is at the switch; the answer is at the other end. They say the answer is in the home and all you need to do is train and educate children properly in this, educate parents properly and use effective filtering technology at that end—such as NannyNet or SurfNet—and that will fix the problem. Well, maybe that is the case if you have a technically savvy household—and I live in one of those; my children are experts in this sort of technology. But there is not a high percentage of those in this country and there is not a high percentage of parents who are ahead of the kids on this matter. As a matter of fact, in the various age groups they find there is a big difference between the 25-plus, the 15 to 25s and the group under 15 years of age in terms of their familiarity with this material and how savvy they are. Therefore, end user control is only a partial solution. It should be encouraged. Money should be spent educating children and parents and there should be the technology for filtering, but it is nowhere near the total answer and people who say that are kidding themselves. As Senator Bishop mentioned, there are also international agreements. They are to be encouraged too. But, again, when you find islands in the Pacific heading up to make a lot of their foreign exchange out of this Internet illegal material, you wonder whether international agreements are going to be all that effective.
What we do need is a whole range of approaches. We need the industry to be more responsible in terms of its codes of practice. We need parents to be more responsible in terms of education and using screening technologies. We need more international agreements. But we also need the industry to be more responsible. It is not the Wild West; it is a very important medium. It will drive e-commerce. But governments have a responsibility to enforce the laws that exist in society on this medium as well as every other medium.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (ONLINE SERVICES) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1999-05-24,"—Senator Tierney has said that there ought to be a system whereby the law is enforced—and nobody can deny that. He has suggested, I think, that parents should be able to see what their children are looking at, particularly young children, and to help them as they will. I do not think this is really a debate about censorship in that sense; it is a debate about what control people should have over their children. It is a debate too about how we use the Internet. People more learned than I will be talking about that later on in this debate. As Senator Bishop quite clearly demonstrated, this is a debate about process, as is many a debate in this chamber.
As Senator Bishop has said, the real concern the opposition has about this legislation is the process that is to be used. As you look at the legislation, it appears more and more that this is legislation brought forward not so much to satisfy the need that it proposes in its terms to meet, but rather, as Senator Bishop has said, to satisfy other needs. That is a bad way of going around making legislation. To put forward legislation to meet a particular problem when it is not the problem that you have primarily in mind but other matters is a bad way to legislate. Senator Tierney has talked about the horrible material that is put over the Internet. No doubt that is there and must be met. The police at the present time are already surveilling the Internet and seeing what can be done about it.
I will give an example of what I mean by saying that this is an issue of process and that the legislation falls down in meeting that. I refer to section 27 of schedule 1 of the bill, 
 which talks about protection from civil proceedings. It reads:
Civil proceedings do not lie against a person in respect of loss, damage or injury of any kind suffered by another person because of any of the following acts done in good faith:
(a)	 the making of a complaint under division 1;
(b)	 the making of a statement to, or the giving of a document or information to, the ABA—
that is, the Australian Broadcasting Authority—
in connection with an investigation under this Division.
What that proposes is simply this: that anybody can make a complaint about a matter that he or she notes on the screen, and then a process is put into operation. It does not matter whether that is a vexatious complaint or a far-fetched complaint or what have you. Anybody that is damaged by that is unable to sue for what he or she may suffer as a result of being reported to the Australian Broadcasting Authority, no matter how slender the material on which the complaint is based. If this legislation was confident that it was fulfilling a real need in a proper way, I would not have thought you would need a particular section which protects people from being sued by people who suffer unjustly by the complaints that are made. It is very easy to make a complaint but oftentimes very hard to answer it.
Just as people who run a program on the Internet have a responsibility, so do those who make complaints about it and who may cause a lot of cost, a lot of anxiety and a lot of trouble to people who are going about their legitimate business and ultimately are found to have been going about their legitimate business. I see from reading the legislation that what happens is that people make a complaint and the ABA must investigate it. True enough, it can decline to investigate the complaint if it thinks it is frivolous or vexatious or not made in good faith or if the ABA has reason to believe that the complaint was made for the purpose or for purposes that include frustrating or undermining the effective administration of schedule 1.
The ABA does have a range of powers which enable it to go about its task in a 
 responsible way. But why is that responsibility not brought in at the first stage of the process, that is, at the complaint stage? This is an invitation for people to make all sorts of complaints, which the legislation itself recognises may be frivolous or vexatious or not made in good faith. If somebody is faced with that sort of accusation and the ABA comes to investigate, that is a real problem for that person and it cultivates a culture of informing, unless it is very carefully watched.
As has been said by the two speakers so far and as will no doubt be said by the speakers after me, no-one wants to encourage the sort of material that has been described as coming over the Internet and everybody wants to equip families with the ability to stop that coming through. But there is another side of that which must always be remembered, that is, we do not want to create a regime where there is oppression by a group of people who go around informing on others on a basis that is not justified. This legislation, as I look at it, is inclined to do that. It is legislation that can be better brought into line by simply making those who make complaints bear more responsibility than this legislation presently does.
If you go on further into the act, clause 37 of schedule 1 of the act talks about the obligation of the ABA to notify an Australian police force—not the Federal Police, but any Australian police force—if it considers that it is sufficiently serious to warrant referral to that force. Again, there is a whole system of informing to get at a vice that could be better got at by other means.
It does seem as if the problems we are going through are not going to be answered in any event by the process that we are going to put into place pursuant to this legislation. The actual process of trying to stop this material coming onto the Internet is going to be very difficult. If, as I do, you believe those who say legislation as broad as this allows a range of complaints to come in such an undisciplined way, that is going to impact on the very lifeblood of the Internet system. There is so much good material that we want to come across on the Internet. What we have to watch in the present debate is that, in 
 trying to put down a particular vice, we do not let loose all sorts of other problems that will not be cured unless we rescind this legislation, if it is put through, and go back and try to do what we are trying to do in a better way.
Senator Tierney has talked about a range of ways to answer these problems. He has talked about family life, and that is perhaps central to the way we ought to try to cure this problem. The problem that a lot of people in families these days have to tolerate, where both parents in the family have to work all sorts of hours just to make a reasonable living, itself impacts upon the ability of families to see what their children are doing. To resort to this legislation without at the same time trying to do something about the way the labour market is now conducted seems to me to be quite an outrage. In other words, we as legislators come up with this sort of legislation, which has all sorts of problems with it, and at the same time run a labour market which compels parents to be out at all times so that they are unable to devote the time and attention to their children that they should be able to.
I think both mother and father can work. I am not suggesting for one minute that they should not, but they should not have to work the long and intense hours that they do under the present system. When the second tier of workplace legislation comes past this chamber, we will be talking about how, more and more, the work force has been driven to contractual arrangements for people to earn a fairly sparse living in terms of normal hours. In other words, to earn a decent amount, people have to work long hours. That takes away not only from the ability of the parents to see what their children are watching but also from the parents' ability to give them the sort of culture and approach to life that overcomes the difficulties that are raised by this legislation.
When you look at it, this is legislation which is going to cause all sorts of problems. It will cause problems in the way it is policed and problems in the way that the Internet is going to be curbed, if it can be curbed. It will cause problems because of what that does not 
 only to the industry that the Internet brings forth but also to the culture that it brings forth. It clearly needs another look. I think you will see, as you examine this, that the legislation is a tortured way and a wrong way of going about trying to get to a very fine object, the very fine object being that parents should be able to prevent the children from seeing the sort of thing that children are not allowed to see or that the parents do not want them to see. Indeed, it goes beyond children. When you think about it, there is some fearful material that nobody should properly look at. In any event, that is another issue. At the moment, the real issue in all this legislation is that it is premature. It is a wrong answer to a problem that has not been properly assessed. The answer has certainly gone nowhere near being the proper answer needed for the problems that are faced.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (ONLINE SERVICES) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1999-05-24,"—On Thursday, 29 April Senator Brown asked me, as the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, a question, part of which I took on notice. I have now received from the Minister for Defence an answer to the remainder of the senator's question, which I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard .
Leave granted.
The answer read as follows—
On Thursday, 29 April 1999 (Hansard  page 3884) Senator Brown asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Defence, the following question without notice
I refer to the Australian Defence Force's s welcome two-year contract with Incat Tasmania worth $38 Million for the supply of a high-speed catamaran to the armed forces. Can the minister tell the senate what the nature of that contact is—sale, lease or otherwise—and whether Tasmanian duties, such as stamp duties, will be paid on that sale or, if not, whether some arrangement will be made to compensate Tasmania for taxes forgone in this very welcome sale by Incat?
The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question which I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard .
(1) At this time, there are two contractual relationships currently being negotiated. The main agreement is the charter agreement which is anticipated will be signed next week and will be supplemented by a contract for maintenance during the period of the charter which will be finalised in the near future.
Charter Agreement
The charter agreement is known as a ""Bareboat"" charter which is a type of demise charter under which possession and control of the vessel is 
 passed to the Commonwealth without master and crew. Under the charter a Naval master and crew will operate the vessel. The contractor may provide some crew for a limited period to provide advice however these would be under Naval control.
The charter agreement is based on the ""Baltic and International Maritime Conference Standard Bareboat Charter"" codenamed BARECON 89 adapted as appropriate. The agreement includes some minor vessel modifications to be carried out by the contractor and the training of a Naval crew. The charter agreement is for an initial period of two (2) years plus three (3) options to extend the charter period as required by the Commonwealth. The agreement may also contain options to purchase the vessel or to upgrade to a larger vessel.
Maintenance Contract
Under the charter agreement it is the charterer's responsibility to maintain the vessel to agreed standards. In keeping with current trends within the Department, it is intended to outsource these maintenance responsibilities.
(2) The extent to which stamp duties apply to a transaction, whether with the Commonwealth or with a commercial entity will depend on the nature of the instrument. As stated above, the contracts currently proposed are not a sale and would only attract nominal duties (in the order of $10 to $20). The position would be the same if a commercial entity entered into an identical contract. No arrangements will therefore need to be made for taxes forgone.
(3) As stated above there are two contractual relationships, the charter agreement and the maintenance contract. However, the total estimated cost of $38.845 million also includes personnel support costs. base support costs and fuel. The summary of cost allocation over the charter period follows:
									  $m
Charter costs				 26.486
Modifications 			  0.430
Personnel support		  1.000
Base support				  0.300
Training						  0.300
Maintenance				  3.375
Fuel							  6.954
Total							 38.845

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-05-24,"—I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:
That the provisions of paragraphs (5) to (7) of standing order 111 not apply to the following bills, allowing them to be considered during this period of sittings:

STATEMENT OF REASONS FOR INTRODUCTION AND PASSAGE IN THE 1999 AUTUMN SITTINGS
FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORM (AMENDMENTS AND TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS) BILL
FINANCIAL SECTOR (TRANSFERS OF BUSINESS) BILL
INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT (RSAs PROVIDED BY REGISTERED ORGANIZATIONS) BILL
Purpose
The Financial Sector Reform (Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill will provide for the implementation of the second stage of the Government's response to the Financial System Inquiry. It amends the Banking Act 1959, the Life Insurance Act 1995 and the Corporations Law to transfer responsibility for the prudential and corporate regulation of building societies, credit unions and friendly societies to the Commonwealth from the States and Territories. The Bill will include supplementary amendments to complement the reforms included in the first stage legislation. The Financial Sector (Transfers of Business) Bill introduces provisions which facilitate the transfer of business between life companies or authorised deposit-taking institutions on either a voluntary or a compulsory basis. The Income Tax Rates (RSAs provided by Registered Organizations) Bill ensures appropriate tax treatment for RSA business of friendly societies and other registered organizations.
Reason for Priority
The Prime Minister wrote to the Premiers and Chief Ministers on 29 November 1998 to seek their support for a draft Financial Sector Regulations Transfer Agreement. The draft Agreement seeks to achieve the transfer by 1 July 1999. Industry groups are keen to progress the transfer of regulatory responsibility for the financial institutions as soon as possible so that a single prudential regulation scheme applies across the financial sector.
Effect if bills are not dealt with in one Sitting
Delay in the passage of the Bills will delay the introduction and passage of the necessary State and Territory legislation to give effect to the regulatory transfer.
A delay may also be to the competitive disadvantage of building societies, credit unions and friendly societies in relation to the other financial institutions, such as banks, superannuation funds and life insurance companies (which are covered under the Bills passed in the 1998 Autumn sittings to provide for the implementation of the first stage of the Government's response to the Financial System Inquiry).  

State and Territory governments may raise concerns in relation to the uncertainty created in relation to their continued regulation of these institutions.

STATEMENT OF REASONS FOR THE SENATE
WOOL INTERNATIONAL PRIVATISATION BILL 1999
Purpose
The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Wool International Act 1993 to convert Wool International from a statutory authority to a Corporations Law company from 1 July 1999.
Reasons for urgency
The former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy announced on 15 October that ownership and responsibility for management of the stockpile would be transferred to the private sector on 1 July 1999. Industry expectation that this will occur is very high.
Failure to privatise the stockpile on or before 1 July 1999 would mean WI would resume sales from the stockpile, with a consequent renewal of the divisive industry debate about the sale schedule, and further calls for government intervention in stockpile sales. A renewal of this debate will further distract the industry from the real issues of lack of demand for wool products, the need for productivity improvements and the need to meet the quality requirements of our customers.
The Bill needs to be passed as soon as possible to allow sufficient time for all activities required for the conversion of Wool International into a Corporations Law company, including the registration of the company with ASIC.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1999-05-24,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I rise to speak briefly to this report, which I recommend to the Senate. It is a complicated program that has been introduced. The aim of it is to compensate the pharmaceutical industry for agreeing to undertake certain activities in relation to production and pricing policies. The government is a monopsonist—so it controls the pricing of a range of goods—and it is worth while for people to have a look at this report.
The $300 million that the government has put into this, however, is nowhere near enough. This is a system that replaces factor F, a very successful policy that was pursued by the previous Labor government in its term of office. Factor F has been recognised right across the country and right across the industry as a benefit to this country. The resources that flowed into the sector and the amount of research and development that was undertaken as a result of the former Labor government's policy stood the test of time and were roundly supported by industry over the years. Yes, there were some problems. Yes, it was possible for there to be improvements in the scheme that existed, but this government set back research and development in this area by years. We have seen that right across the country in all the different industries—the government have set about dumbing down this country. They have attempted on various occasions to disguise this deliberate strategy by arguing that we had this mythical black hole and that we had a need to balance all the competing interests in this country. But they did not want to talk about how little they were prepared to commit to research and 
 development and schemes like factor F which they have now replaced.
Some $300 million over five years is not enough. We have to be committed to making research and development the absolute key strategy. The government continually say that they are interested in trying to improve the standard of living of all Australians, but at the same time they make cuts in the areas which can value add and improve the lot of ordinary working people in this country. They talk about the need to have an export oriented country and say that we must grow through exports. This is something which I believe all parties in this country would support, but when you see the rebadging of programs that they have slashed, that they try to pretend are their own initiatives, that they try to pretend are improvements on the previous system, you tend to get a bit cynical about what it is they are saying.
This audit report into the Pharmaceutical Industry Investment Program shows that there are many problems with this new government's rebadged, reduced and less funded policy. A number of the problems are highlighted in this report. There is a range of principles which the pharmaceutical industry has been attempting to introduce, and I would like to just briefly mention four of them that are specifically referred to here. The first principle states:
The Pharmaceutical Industry Investment Program is intended to increase the total level of research and development activity undertaken in Australia which has a direct link to or is of direct relevance to the pharmaceutical industry. It is not, however, intended to influence the direction of that research and development activity.
Principle 2 states:
The Pharmaceutical Industry Investment Program is intended to increase the total level of pharmaceutical production value added activity undertaken in Australia. In particular, it seeks to encourage high value adding per unit activity over lower value adding per unit activity.
Principle 3 states:
The Pharmaceutical Industry Investment Program is intended to encourage pharmaceutical companies to achieve not only growth in existing activity but also to undertake additional activity which is different in scope from existing activity, or is otherwise new to the company and of `significance' 
 to its operations and/or its position in the global environment.
Finally, principle 4 states:
The Pharmaceutical Industry Investment Program is intended to encourage a sustainable pharmaceutical industry in Australia, undertaking activity which is internationally competitive and of benefit to Australia.
Could anybody disagree with these principles? But, as I said earlier, what we have seen from this government is the reduction of funding for the industry policy that was previously known as factor F. Australia is the poorer and certainly not the wiser for having pursued this policy of pretending that you can just take a program, rebadge it, slash its funds and pretend it is a new initiative. It is very disappointing that this government has such a narrow-minded view of what is necessary to progress the industry, to progress this country and to ensure that our children live in a knowledge based society.
The pharmaceutical industry is an industry which has enormous potential. Pharmaceuticals are needed all around the world at all stages. It is not like expenditure on them is discretionary. Even if you put a GST on them, people will still need them. Even if you put a GST on all of these, even if you burden the pharmaceutical industry with the outrageous compliance costs that the GST is proposing and with the increase in prices to customers, pharmaceuticals will still survive and they will still be produced in this country.
The problem is that this country has a poor track record in producing research and development, and factor F was something that addressed that. We have seen with this report today a highlighting of this government's narrow-mindedness: a government that is more intent on deceiving Australian voters over the GST than on building for our future, building for education, building for training and building with research and development. How can we progress into value adding and the knowledge based society with such a government? I repeat principle 2:
The Pharmaceutical Industry Investment Program is intended to increase the total level of pharmaceutical production value added activity undertaken in Australia—   

there can be no more important principle that must be followed through and implemented—
In particular, it seeks to encourage high value adding per unit activity over lower value adding per unit activity.
This is what it is about. If this country wants to survive and if we want to maintain our living standards, what we must have is a government with some vision, a government that is not trapped in trying to pretend to the Australian people that it has a tax reform for the country. This government went to the last election not with a vision for this country but with a vision for a new tax. That was it, beginning and end—nothing to do with these sorts of principles and nothing to do with value adding in the pharmaceutical industry.
This government stand condemned because they have been unable to drop the blinkers and say, `What do we have to do if we're going to be fair dinkum? Let us amend factor F, let us improve on factor F and let us put more funds into the areas that we can identify.' That is the sort of policy action that this government should have taken.
We have seen Senator Minchin announcing that we are going to have more research and development into all sorts of different things, but under questioning in Senate estimates departmental officials admitted that there is actually less money in R&D at this moment in time. They talked about the ebbs and flows. What they did not want to mention was that at the moment we are in a bit of an ebb in research and development and we are down on projections. More money has gone into these sorts of programs but less money has actually been spent than last year. This is from a government that keeps trying to pretend it has an active industry policy. You have a minister whose personal commitment is to make sure that the government is as economically rationally dry as it can be. You have put him in charge of trying to look beyond the traditional economic rationalist blinkers and saying, `Programs like the factor F or the Pharmaceutical Industry Investment Program are the sorts of programs that we should actually be supporting.'

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1999-05-24,"—The Democrats have grave concerns with the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Online Services) Bill 1999 . We are still a little unsure as to what is driving the government in the implementation of this legislation, which we consider unworkable and as having undesirable aspects in relation to this regulatory regime. This morning, in discussing the exemption of this bill from the cut-off, I referred to the government's failure to establish a need for this legislation and its inability to substantiate some of the reasons it has put forward for this legislation, in particular in relation to community concerns. Since the government has no intention to change its strategy on this proposal at this late 
 stage, I will take this opportunity to outline the Democrats' continuing concerns with this bill and the government's approach.
Before outlining the Democrat concerns, I remind the Senate—particularly in light of Senator Tierney's contribution to this debate—that the Democrats are not advocates of unsuitable Internet material being made available to minors. That view is probably reflected among all honourable senators in this place. However, we are unable to countenance the markedly different treatment of similar materials published in different media. This is an important point for us in debating this legislation. The Democrats do not advocate an entirely laissez-faire approach to the regulation of Internet content, but clearly we have major concerns with the mechanisms proposed by the government and the extent of their interference in legitimate expression.
As we have pointed out on numerous previous occasions, our concerns are divided primarily into two main groups. The first of these relates to the unworkability of the proposals. In particular, we are opposed to the creation of a system of regulation which has no hope of preventing access to inappropriate materials. The very intention of the legislation is to block or stop what is considered inappropriate material. Why create a regulatory regime that does not necessarily have the ability to do just that?
The bill addresses content published on Australian servers and overseas servers in markedly different ways. For Australian content, the bill provides a regime that can work, although at significant cost to the Australian Internet industry. There are major concerns about the interaction between the ABA as the peak regulatory authority and the use of industry codes to create enforcement mechanisms in tune with the legislation. But the big problems with the workability of this proposed legislation are linked to the problem of regulating Internet behaviour beyond our jurisdiction. By now it is recognised in most countries that regulation of the Internet is a jurisdictional problem probably without peer. The jurisdictional problem obviously arises in relation to the treatment of material that originates overseas.
However, instead of developing an approach which would have the possibility of preventing the access of minors to inappropriate material, the government seems to have taken a leaf out of the story of King Canute. Standing on Australia's metaphorical shore and demanding that the tide of content turn back seems a bit far-fetched as a legislative response to Internet regulation. But this is actually what the government is envisaging. For materials hosted overseas the legislation demands that Internet service providers take `reasonable steps to block access to content which would be classified as inappropriate'. I think we should draw the Senate's attention to remarks by the government on this aspect of the legislation. In press releases, media interviews and indeed during the Senate committee process, the government has referred to technical feasibility as the test, but contrary to repeated assurances this is not the test to be applied in the legislation. Overwhelming evidence has been provided showing that the blocking of materials is going to be costly to the Australian Internet industry—both directly and indirectly. More significantly, evidence was provided to the committee investigating this bill which indicated that the blocking mechanisms and approaches suggested were technically flawed. Senator Tierney alluded to some of that evidence as well.
The performance implications are very serious and the proposed blocking would be easily circumvented. Evidence on the performance of blocking technologies indicated overwhelmingly that they were more successful the closer to the user they were implemented. The overall conclusion in evidence presented to the committee in the CSIRO report is:
Content blocking implemented purely by technological means will be ineffective.
The other area of broad concern that the Australian Democrats have with the proposed legislation is the undesirable aspect of many aspects of the proposed content control regime. I have listed some of these concerns before, but I reiterate them for the purpose of this debate. They include: the failure to address civil liberties concerns relating to privacy and freedom of speech and expres 
 sion, the creation of broad discretions and uncertain law enforcement provisions, the different treatment of materials in different media, the almost certain adverse impact on the Internet industry in Australia, the likely deleterious impact on the information economy in Australia and the failure to address concerns about the likelihood of inappropriate and inadvertent blocking of materials and related issues. I will expand on some of these issues of concern.
The Democrats feel compelled to remind the parliament of the place of free speech in our system of government. We must be aware that freedom of speech is what is left after the boundaries have been defined by the courts and the parliament. We do not believe that the government has met the onus required to justify the restrictions proposed under the legislation. During the committee process the comparison was drawn between the proposed regime and the content controls implemented in other countries not often classed as liberal democracies. It should be noted that recent news reports suggest that Canada has now abandoned previous attempts to control content.
We are very concerned about the legal construction of the legislation. In this context, our main concern relates to the broad problem of creating an unenforceable law. We have already indicated that the failure of this unworkable law might lead to further and perhaps more punitive demands for Internet content control. There is also the concern that a largely unenforceable law will lead to undermined confidence in government and further distrust from the Internet community. Believe me, in evidence before the committee and in the many faxes, phone calls and emails we have received from the industry, both in this country and overseas, there is already a level of distrust of this government and uncertainty in those important sectors.
The different treatment of like content also deserves attention. The government has made it quite clear that it views the Internet as analogous to existing media. I note that this bill draws on broadcasting and narrowcasting analogies to explain some of its provisions. The government continually denies the special 
 nature of Internet publishing processes. Internet content is made available by huge numbers of publishers. It is made available on a pull or demand driven model: users must explicitly request material before it is provided. As one of only a few countries in the world with content controls, Australia would become a less desirable place to host or develop Internet content. This and other indirect economic costs would be likely to have significant impact on the development of the whole Internet industry in Australia. Surely that industry is something that we want to encourage and support, not clamp down on or quash. This is in addition to the direct costs of enforcement which I have already referred to.
Alternatives—relying on voluntary client-side blocking, education and adult responsibility—would be unlikely to have such a detrimental impact on the development of the information economy in Australia. It is hard to imagine any group that would benefit economically, except perhaps the multinational creators of family content. The likely shake-up in the Australian Internet industry would lead to a reduction in the diversity and coverage of Internet service providers in Australia. The Democrats view this as a very unfortunate outcome generally but particularly unfortunate for regional and country users of Internet facilities.
Evidence was also given at the Senate select committee about a number of inconsistencies in the funding of the content regulation mechanisms. In particular, the Democrats would like to draw attention to the vastly different classification regimes proposed by the government in the bill for Internet content and the simultaneous move to a user-pays system in film and video classification.
Another of the big concerns about the government's proposal is the need to regulate the use and operation of any filtering technologies. These concerns apply to both client-side and service provider based filtering. Numerous cases and studies confirm that content filters often block material which it would actually be desirable to make available—it is inadvertent blocking of those materials. 
Concerns have been raised about the blocking of sites referring to, say, health issues such as breast cancer. Gay and lesbian sites, especially those for teenagers, are blocked by most filtering programs. Other examples of sites that are blocked include: the anti-racism site, HateWatch; safe sex sites; safe drug use sites; drug sites about feminism; and sites about alternative politics. A very recent analysis of one of the government's favoured technologies has revealed the blocking of the National Party home page and the Mick's Whips e-commerce site. I note in passing that this site has often been used by the leader of the National Party as an example of the success of Australia's information economy. Imagine blocking a National Party home page!
The Australian Democrats believe that any use of filters, whether client-side or ISP based, must be regulated to prevent the imposition of value systems which are not explicit. Users must know exactly what will be blocked and alternatives must be made available which do not promulgate narrow American family values. That is not meant to be an adverse reflection on American society, but just a reflection on where a lot of the content is coming from. Systems which are based on complex weighting schemes, such as that provided by Clairview as an example, should only be employed after a rigorous and open examination of the inherent assumptions that are being made about content. Blocking lists and weighting schemes must be fully disclosed to prevent abuse. In a democracy, censorship mechanisms cannot be as protected as trade secrets.
Given the time available, I would now like to make it very clear what the Democrat position is on this bill. We do not advocate unsuitable Internet material being made available to minors. As I said before, I do not believe any senator or member in this place would advocate such a position. That is not a point of disagreement in this debate. We oppose the restriction of adult access to material which would generally be acceptable to reasonable adults. We oppose the restriction of adult access to Internet content where that content is available in different media. 
 There is no reason for the kind of material that is currently available to adults in a different medium to be blocked on the Internet specifically.
We have found very little evidence of the so-called overwhelming community concern claimed by government as the motivation for this legislation. In fact, evidence before the Senate committee indicated that the Australian public is far more concerned about inappropriate censorship. Evidence also indicates that extreme violence and racism are actually of greater concern than explicit sexual material. Internet users have a number of serious and legitimate concerns about Internet regulation, including hate speech, vilification, defamation, gambling, privacy, security, encryption and the legality of electronic transactions. These issues are not addressed in this bill.
These issues have also not been debated at any length in the Senate select committee, which has responsibility for investigating issues to do with information technology. These issues were indicated by many witnesses as being of more concern than, for example, monitoring or clamping down on sexually explicit material. Perhaps we should be focusing on these areas in the burgeoning information economy as opposed to legislation of this nature.
The government has not demonstrated any problems with the use of existing legislative provisions for dealing with inappropriate content, including section 85ZE of the Crimes Act 1914—which, of course, is a mechanism which is already in place for dealing with illegal or illicit content that may be online. The Democrats remain very concerned about the government's unwillingness to address some of the civil liberties issues raised by this bill. Restrictions on freedom of speech and imprecise enforcement provisions—in some cases privatising law enforcement functions—are serious and should not be dismissed lightly. This bill proposes a scheme of content regulation which treats the Internet very differently from analogous media. Content which is legal in one medium could actually be considered illegal in another.
Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 7.30 p.m. 
—Before the dinner break, I was explaining the Democrats' concerns about this bill, which fall into two categories: philosophical, that is, it may be a constraint on certain civil liberties in a democracy, such as freedom of speech and expression; and its workability, that is, the technical feasibility of the legislation. I was just concluding by articulating clearly to the chamber, for the record, the Democrats' concerns.
We do not believe that Internet content regulation should result in a medium which is brought down to a lowest common denominator. Regulation must take into account the diversity of the Internet and the legitimate and responsible use of that medium by adults. If the bill is to proceed, it should include some guarantees of the privacy of both transactions and the personal details of Internet users. The possibility of logging transactions via proxies would result in a major invasion of privacy, in our opinion.
The evidence overwhelmingly suggests that the proposal to block overseas Internet content is technically flawed. There are major performance implications, and blocking is able to be circumvented. In our opinion, that would have major economic consequences. The Democrats are concerned about inappropriate and inadvertent blocking. This concern applies generally to filters, but of course it is of particular concern where blocking is compulsory. Blocking lists used in filters should be fully disclosed. Secret lists of which materials are to be blocked could lead to abuse, so that whole process must be transparent. Any censorship in a liberal democracy, as I have stated for the record, must be open and it must be accountable.
The creation of an unenforceable law, such as the provisions blocking overseas content, is highly undesirable. The Democrats have numerous concerns about the drafting of the bill as it has been presented to the committee. These include broad discretions, harsh penalties, undefined terms and the possible abuse of provisions. We believe that self-regulation and co-regulation need to be more carefully investigated in the context of content regulation. 
Client-side filtering technologies and differentiated Internet services offer a workable alternative to blocking materials at the source or in transit. Client-side technologies need to be regulated to ensure that appropriate content is not inappropriately or inadvertently blocked. Users need to be fully aware of the assumptions and of the models that are being used to block content.
The Democrats believe that adult responsibility should be a central component of any attempt to control the way in which young people use the Internet. The Australian Democrats would support a system of Internet content regulation that was based on empowerment of responsible adults rather than a command and control censorship mechanism. This would need to include education and the availability of client-side filtering technologies.
The Democrats regret the sensationalist way in which the government has labelled critics of this proposed legislation, including a number of those organisations and witnesses that appeared before the Senate select committee. We believe that this bill has been prepared with undue haste and that consideration should be given to alternative proposals that are based on the education and the empowerment of users, as well as on an understanding of the responsibility of those supervising Internet access for young people. Certainly the Democrats agree that there is a need to address the issue of Internet content, but we have serious problems with the proposals currently before us and we do not believe that the hurried process has been appropriate.
As I said, we have grave concerns about this legislation on two grounds: philosophical, that is, civil liberties questions; and the feasibility and workability of the legislation. I strongly urge senators to reject the legislation before us, to enter into an examination of what would be appropriate and to do it in a way that is not rushed and not part of a trading off process in terms of other legislation or of cross-trading on other issues. Then we could have a regulatory system that suited all users of the Internet but that did not quash, thwart, undermine or erode the burgeoning information economy in Australia.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (ONLINE SERVICES) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-05-24,"—I rise to speak as part of the opposition's response to what is a very quick bill—poorly drafted and brought in here with undue haste. A number of senators were on the committee examining this bill, and they brought down the report which was tabled earlier this month. I congratulate them on grappling with the number of issues in the short time they were given. The issues in the report only begin the debate; they do not conclude the debate.
The opposition has already made it clear that we believe this bill is fundamentally flawed and that it should be significantly amended. My colleague Senator Bishop has indicated the moving of a second reading amendment that reflects our grave concerns about the sloppy way in which this bill has been brought forward and drafted. We have also indicated there will be a number of other technical amendments to the provisions. Some of the draconian provisions in this bill should be amended.
We have outlined that we would support a review of the bill, if it were to be carried by the Senate, and a sunset clause that this bill would last no more than three years and that it would lapse unless the Senate and the Australian parliament reintroduced a bill after ministerial review and further debate. The opposition has made it clear that, in relation to the Internet and all the ancillary services it provides, it is crazy to try to define legislation to regulate the Internet forever and a day when the technology is changing so rapidly.
Earlier today I heard some remarks by Senator Tierney from the government. We know Senator Tierney has a particular obsession about the fact that new technologies may actually make it easier for some people to see something that is, in his view, in bad taste or that does not fit into his moral view of the world. After listening to Senator Tierney I am of the mind that, when someone invented writing 3,000 or 4,000 years ago in the ancient Sumerian civilisation, he would have been	up there saying, `This is terrible. It might be misused. Someone might write a word that I do not like.'
When William Caxton and Gutenberg invented the printing press in the 15th century, which enabled many more people to have access to information, of course it could have been misused and things could have been written that Senator Tierney might not like or might disapprove of. He, again, would have been one of those saying, `This is an evil development.' There were people who were opposed to the development of the printing press and its use to make widespread information available, to make our society in those days better informed. Senator Tierney probably disliked the invention of the telephone because it meant people could ring each other—they might say something over the phone in a form of words that he finds distasteful.
The whole range of the electronic developments in communications this century—radio, television, cinema—has probably put great stress on Senator Tierney that somewhere someone might have seen or heard something that he finds distasteful or does not fit his moral view of the world. About 15 years ago we had the development of the fax—again, rapid information dissemination, better communication. Again, someone might put an inappropriate word or drawing through the fax that he does not like in his view of the world.
Now we have the Internet, the most revolutionary form of direct communication between people that the world has yet seen. It has many opportunities to make the world a better place, to make it less likely that people will go to war because they will be better able to communicate. Societies will have a better understanding and information readily available about themselves. But the only obsession Senator Tierney and those of his ilk have is that there may be some inappropriate words, some nasty pictures or some nasty images that go on the Internet that do not fit with their moral view of the world.
On every one of those developments in the last 4,000 years of new technologies that have improved communication in the world, there has always been, unfortunately, some antisocial activity that has gone with it. But, if we had stopped each of those developments, 
 modern civilisation as we know it would never have developed.
I also want to point out to Senator Tierney and others like him that the Internet is probably now the strongest proponent for the development of human rights and the end of dictatorships and thuggery by governments around the world than any other invention we have since had. It is now impossible for a bunch of thugs of the far Right or the far Left to run a government and keep their people ignorant of what is going on in the rest of the world. The Internet is the final step in breaking down the censorship barriers, the government censorship of ideas, the organisation of ideas that are allowed only if they are in favour of the government of the day or the ruling elite or clique.
I remember in 1989 at the time of Tiananmen Square that the Chinese tried to ban or control access to the fax machine because they discovered that all round the world people at random, including people from this Parliament House, were faxing stories out of their local newspapers to Chinese fax machines showing that they knew what was going on and so those in the pro democracy movement knew that they were being supported. What did the Chinese government try to do? They tried to register every fax machine to make sure that only people whom they approved of would be able to use it. It all collapsed, of course, because they found that their economy could not run on the idea that they could control people who have access to these new communication ideas.
It is the same with the Internet. The political thugs of the world now find it extremely difficult to control the ideas and information. In recent times in Yugoslavia Mr Milosevic has found that he cannot control all the information being circulated in his own country because others from without can circulate into that country via the Internet other stories that give a differing view from what Mr Milosevic wants.
Some time ago, at the time of a previous censorship debate in Australia, a rather famous poster was put out. It said, `The experts agree censorship works,' and it listed Hitler, 
 Stalin and the Ayatollah Khomeini—they tried to use censorship to control their people. We have to accept that there is going to be some awkward or some nasty use of these modern forms of telecommunications and communication such as the Internet, but we should not throw it out. We should not stop it. We should not cut the cable. We should not try to censor it absolutely on the basis that we may be worried that somewhere someone will be upset about a particular image.
What we find extraordinary about this piece of legislation is that it has been rushed into the parliament, badly drafted and badly explained, to meet some sort of agenda of the coalition government. One has only to turn to the second reading speech by the minister to see that. It goes on for pages trying to explain how these new measures will work to control antisocial, nasty things on the Internet. There are pages about how the complaints will be handled. There are pages about how the coregulation will work, about the codes of practice, about how you would lodge a notice with the ABA and about the different responsibilities of the ABA and the Office of Film and Literature Classification.
Anyone who reads the second reading speech and believes that this legislation is going to be anything other than a bureaucratic nightmare is deluding himself or herself. Those people who want to use the Internet for antisocial reasons will not be controlled by this legislation—there are 100 ways around it—but the decent people trying to develop the Internet and to encourage the development of Australia as a clever country will be held down by it. They will be driven crazy by some of these useless, unworkable regulations. As I say, the second reading speech goes on for pages trying to explain how the legislation will work. It will not work simply; it will work in a convoluted, difficult way.
We will be moving amendments to simplify the bill and in particular the sunset clause. My view is that if the sensible amendments—including the sunset clause—to be moved by the opposition are not accepted by the government then this bill should be rejected at the third reading. I believe that will overwhelm 
 ingly be welcomed by the vast majority of Australians who do not like the idea that the state or a government with a narrow-minded view should interfere with their rights.
 I want to refer to the fact that, since the 1971 national conference of the Labor Party, we have had a very important clause to refer to when deciding the policy of the Labor Party in respect of censorship. This clause was drafted by Gough Whitlam, Don Dunstan and Lionel Murphy. It has stood the test of time in determining the balance between the rights of society to protect children, to protect itself from antisocial features or activities, and the rights of adults to be treated in a mature way. Just for the record, the clause reads:
The censorship law to conform with the principle that adults be entitled to read, hear and see what they wish in private and in public, subject to adequate provisions preventing persons being exposed to unsolicited material offensive to them and preventing conduct exploiting, or detrimental to, the interests of children.
This legislation does not achieve the objective of prohibiting material that is detrimental to children. If you read through the clauses of the bill, there are loopholes everywhere. It will not work. As the previous speaker Senator Stott Despoja said, we have to concentrate on empowering adults to understand what the Internet is about. We need to provide an education program so that adults know how to use the Internet in their homes and can prohibit their children from getting access to some of this awful stuff that may be available from time to time.
It is crazy to try to force every Internet service provider and every Internet content provider into some sort of censorship regulated regime. It will not stop the nasty stuff being on the Internet. If we are concerned about antisocial material, illegal material, we should be looking at the operation of the Crimes Act. It is mentioned in the legislation. The Crimes Act deals with such things as—unpleasant as it is to mention them—bestiality and paedophilia. People should be warned that, if they are found receiving and using such material, they are subject to the Crimes Act. But the idea that you put a prohibition or a restriction on everybody because some small 
 minority may misuse the Internet is the wrong way to go. It will not work.
 The joke about all of this is that, while we might try to ban, regulate and prohibit Australian Internet service providers and make it difficult for them to operate in Australia, the Internet will still allow people from overseas to send that awful material into this country and have it available. That is why we have to provide a program of education that will empower people and help them to understand what their obligations are. The idea that the state can do this in this particular case is fraught with danger. I think that, as a mature First World country which respects the right that all our adult citizens have responsibilities and accept them, that is the theme we should follow.
It is unfortunate that from time to time a small minority of senators and House of Representatives members get themselves unduly excited and go barking up the wrong tree, paddling up the wrong creek, trying to hunt down in an obsessive way every untoward suggestion that they do not like. That is an authoritarian state, a state where ideas are regulated, which is what the ultimate outcome will be if this bill is passed. The legislation will not stop paedophilia, bestiality or child pornography being promoted on the Internet because it cannot stop it coming in from overseas. What is this government doing to handle the fact that the Internet is a worldwide system? The government tries to ignore that because it has a different agenda, appealing to a very small minority.
We should be thankful that in this country we have access to the latest electronic developments in communications, which has meant that more people are being empowered. They can get access to information about the way their lives can be run and can run their own lives successfully; they can have access to information; they can tackle institutions that in the past may have ignored them—I think they are all to our advantage. As a First World country we should be accepting this as a major step forward and not seeing this as a threat.
Every time there has been a development in the last several thousand years going right 
 back to the invention of writing someone has always said, `This new development is undermining the social values of the then existing society.' As I have said before, there are plenty of examples where the new technologies have made it difficult for the thugs of the world, the political dictators of the world, to continue on in their own way. I say to those who have had an interest in political human rights that that is a wonderful development. I have served on the human rights subcommittee for some six years and I have been to countries where access to new technology has meant that people are being empowered and now know what is going on.
 I will conclude on one anecdote about this government's attitude to the dissemination of information. Two budgets ago this government cut the funding for Radio Australia. This was one of its most disgraceful decisions because it reduced a communications method for Australians to get information out to the world. I remember that as a member of the human rights delegation to Tibet in 1991 we discovered people in Tibet who were putting their lives at risk for human rights and the defence of Tibetan society. They knew we were there. Why? Because they listened to Radio Australia and to the BBC's overseas service. We were putting information into the local people in that society that would not get through the Chinese controlled media about what was happening in their own society and in their own country. One of the reasons why we should welcome new electronic developments is so that people who are under pressure in Tibet—or in a number of other countries where human rights are under threat—are given that opportunity for empowerment.
This bill is a disgrace to this Australian government. It is being put forward in a tawdry manner. It will not achieve its end, except make us look like a standing joke amongst sensible people in the world who welcome the new electronic developments that will make the world a better place.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (ONLINE SERVICES) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-05-24,"—The Broadcasting Services Amendment (Online Services) Bill brings a new category into the regime administered by the Australian Broadcasting Authority: online 
 services. Online services are being added to a regime that was established to regulate various types of broadcasting. But, online services are not broadcasts.
The Internet is not television, it is not radio and it is not film. It can be all those things, but it is also much more. It is telephone, encyclopedia, meeting place and communication tool. It provides recreation, relaxation and stimulation. It breaks down barriers of distance between city and country. It connects people worldwide. It allows people to do business in ways they have never been able to before and with people they have not dealt with before. In effect, it makes everyone anywhere a potential customer. Clearly it has enormous potential.
But, like any powerful technology, it will have its down side. In the case of the Internet, the downside is said to be the availability of offensive material and the exposure of children to that material. It is this offensive material and material unsuitable for children that the bill seeks to regulate. `What's wrong with that?' you may ask. There is no shortage of arguments about freedom of speech and parental responsibility for what children access. But I will leave it to others to make out those arguments. Instead of arguing against the aim of the bill, I will concentrate on its effect.
The fundamental problem with this bill is that it seeks to treat the Internet as though it were just an extension of existing broadcasting media. In fact, it is different in a number of ways which make this approach to regulation unlikely to work. One difference is that television and radio, whether national, commercial, community or whatever, are broadcast from a single source. The fact that there are relatively few service providers—TV or radio stations—makes it quite feasible to regulate the content. Once a system of classification is in place, the regulator can classify the relatively small number of programs, and the broadcasters tend to stick within the rules because they have enormous investments to protect. The same goes for film. A relatively small number of films come onto the market and they are classified. It is not in the inter 
 ests of distributors or cinemas to buck the system.
The Internet is a different scene altogether. Instead of being a one-way broadcaster to receiver system, it is interactive. Instead of being a passive recipient, the `viewer' engages with the medium and with the material on the medium. The user of the Internet may be creating and consuming Internet content at the same time.
This makes for a much more complex environment with a much more complex series of relationships between the players. With television or film, you have a relatively stable small group of producers and broadcasters making content for a mass market. With the Internet the barriers to entry are low, so the number of participants involved in creating and distributing material is enormous. Techniques which work quite comfortably for regulating a few major corporations no longer apply when dealing with such diversity. Also, these participants could be located anywhere in the world; this leads to further complication for would-be regulators.
Television, radio and film can be regulated for content because there are a relatively small, finite number of distributors and high barriers to market entry. In effect, the regulator is dealing with manageable chunks of content to be distributed by a small number of key players. It is worth doing because the content is available to anyone who happens to turn on their TV.
On the Internet we are not dealing with manageable amounts of content. The volume of material on the net is already overwhelming, and it is growing exponentially. We are not dealing with a small number of producers or distributors. In fact, anyone with a computer and a modem can be a producer, and anyone with a bit of know-how and a small capital outlay can be a distributor—an Internet service provider. In a sense, the bill recognises this. It does not seek to legislate to classify material before it can be put on the net. Instead, it seeks to put the onus on the distributors. But here again it is missing the point. The distributors are providing access to `the highway'.
The highway is the information superhighway, but the analogy with the road system works quite well. There are far too many vehicles on the highway for anyone to check the contents of all vehicles and exclude material that is illegal. We do not make it mandatory for the department of main roads to search the cars and pockets of all drivers out on the road to ensure that no prohibited items are travelling on the road. Yet, this is essentially what we are doing when we put the onus on the Internet service provider.
To ensure that prohibited items do not travel on the road, we say that it is illegal to drive with explosives or drugs. If information comes along that someone has those things in their vehicle or waiting for them at their destination, do we get the department of main roads to close down that stretch of road or the path to that destination? No, what we do is get the police to go after the real culprit.
Essentially, that is what happens now with illegal material or activity on the Internet. It is illegal to make child pornography; it is illegal to distribute child pornography; and it is illegal to download or print off images of child pornography, whether coming from the Internet or anywhere else. The people doing these things are the culprits and it is they who should be prosecuted, not the people who provide the pathways that are used.
The analogy more commonly employed is with other `carriers' like Telstra, Australia Post, couriers and so on. There is plenty of material that is unsuitable for children which gets sent through the post. Should it be checked by the carrier on the basis that it might get opened by a child looking at mummy and daddy's mail? The idea that the carrier should be held responsible for censoring the content of their customer's mail or phone calls is—as Michael Warby in the Canberra Times of 24 May, today, said—`absolutely outrageous and ludicrously expensive'.
The bill will do exactly that for Internet service providers. The bill requires providers to `take down' material or block access to material that has been the subject of complaint. Service providers have 24 hours in 
 which to comply, and the penalties for non-compliance are horrendous.
The opportunities for abuse that this presents are manifold. Services of a particular provider could be targeted to drive them out of business. Even without such malicious intent, many smaller providers will simply go out of business because of the extra workload or because they are unable to comply in time and will get hit with big fines. Some will just go quietly out of business rather than get involved in the complexities of meeting the demands of increased regulation.
The Internet is notoriously anarchic. This is one of its great strengths. For many of the participants, this attempt at censorship will cause them to move overseas to more congenial regulatory environments. This applies particularly to operators of host sites. Why would anyone host a site in Australia, where regulation requires hands-on management of content, when they could do the same thing offshore and not have to worry about paying for classification or monitoring of  content?
The government says the measures are subject to the proviso that they be technologically feasible and commercially viable. But what is commercially viable for Telstra Big Pond may drive smaller players out of business—and could it be that this is what they want? Is this perhaps the intention? Is the government looking after its mates at the big end of town? Surely not.
There is no shortage of industry groups that point out that blocking of content will not work. The CSIRO report which has already been referred to in debate concludes that content blocking implemented purely by technological means will be ineffective. Work-arounds will quickly be devised for any technologically based blocking system and distributed over the Internet instead. This is hardly surprising. The Internet was developed to provide communication in the aftermath of nuclear war. If it would survive nuclear war it would certainly survive attempts by Australian regulators to block off bits of it.
The bill employs two methods of restricting access. The first is a blacklist of banned sites. If a complaint is made about a site, an interim take-down notice is issued and the provider 
 has to close off access to that site and similar material. The site is listed and all providers have to refuse access to the site. This means that any effort to access sites on the Internet will require the provider to check that the site is not on the banned list. By putting another stage in the process of accessing legitimate sites, we slow down the operation of the Net and therefore add to the costs. This really is like shooting yourself in the foot. Every business transaction, every research query and every visit to a game site will be checked against the banned list. The effect will be to make Australia a slightly slower place to do business or to study.
The second way of restricting access is the use of filtering technology. Filtering technology has an important part to play in management of the Internet. It is particularly useful for families who want to limit children's access. It probably does not matter to a particular end user if the filter takes out access to breast cancer sites at the same time as it takes out access to rude bits. But the use of crude filters—and they are necessarily crude—should not be expected of Internet service providers. People who do need access to material that triggers key word filtering will not be able to get it; at least they will not get it easily. They will have to play around with filter evading technology or just move to an Internet service provider based offshore—more loss of business to the Australian economy and the industry.
The arguments can be summed up quite simply. First, it will not work. The Internet is resistant to censorship, which it interprets as damage and finds a way around. Second, it will be expensive. This applies to the added cost of access, the management of blacklists and filters, and the economic cost of decreased competition as small players are driven from the market. It also applies to increased costs for the end user in both time and money. Third, it is a blunt instrument. In attempting to block offensive material, much of value will also be unavailable. Fourth, it isolates Australia. Canada has just concluded a 10-month study of Internet regulation and has decided against new laws. The company 
 Australia will keep in censoring the Internet is not good company.
These arguments have all been widely canvassed elsewhere—at the Senate committee, in the minority reports of the committee, and in correspondence which all senators will have received on this bill. But there is another problem which I do not believe has had the attention it deserves. The bill actually has the potential to militate against prosecution of the producers and users of offensive material. Under the proposed regime, someone complaining of unsuitable material would complain to the Australian Broadcasting Authority, which would issue a banning notice. The address is then circulated to all Internet service providers, which would be required to block the site. Essentially, the problem then becomes one of `out of sight—out of mind'. Note it is `out of sight' not `out of site'. The site is still there; you just cannot see it in Australia.
What happens to, say, ongoing police investigations of the site? What happens to efforts to track down the people behind it? Sure, there is the possibility for police to satisfy the ABA holding off taking action which might prejudice a criminal investigation. But that assumes a degree of continuous information sharing with all Australian police forces and the ABA, which is quite unprecedented. The police would need to know all the sites the ABA were considering banning, or the ABA would need to know all the investigations currently being undertaken by police. Either way, it would be a logistic nightmare. In the meantime, pornographers and would-be bomb makers carry on with their activities. We do not have policing resources to waste like that. The efforts should be aimed at prosecuting offenders, not imposing constraints on the carrier of the signal.
The final point I wish to make on this bill is that it neglects a deep-seated belief that it is the individual who has responsibility for what they do and what they see on the Internet. It is not the business of government to get on the Net in a heavy-handed way to try to dictate what we can and cannot see or do. It is the responsibility of parents to ensure 
 that their children are not accessing unsuitable material. It is not the role of government to be the parents of the rest of us. That is effectively what this bill does. It treats Australians like children and tells us that government knows best. Government, in this case, may not know best. Government has got it badly wrong on this one and, if the bill is passed by the Senate, the Internet itself will prove just how wrong. That is the nature of the beast. In the meantime, Australia will be held up as a laughing stock, and Senator Alston is, I believe, accurately portrayed as the King Canute of our time, blithely trying to turn back the tide.
I would like to indicate that the Greens (WA) will be supporting the second reading amendment which is, I believe, to be moved by Senator Bishop.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (ONLINE SERVICES) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,1999-05-24,"—The Senate Select Committee on Information Technology was re-formed with the specific intention of dealing with the issue of Internet censorship. Its structure was biased towards government opinions from the outset and, regardless of the numerous submissions which demonstrated the unworkability of the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Online Services) Bill 1999 , the report that the committee produced unsurprisingly concurred with the government's initial position. This contrasted sharply with the Labor opposition's analysis and the views presented in our minority report.
In this debate there are two primary interest groups: those who are online, notably, the information `haves', and those who are not online, the information `have nots'. Despite three years of governance under the coalition, the divide between these two groups in our society has become only wider. They have professed that their legislation will make the Internet a safe zone for minors—a zone free from pornography, free from bomb-making recipes and free from other social nasties. They have led those people who are not online to believe that technological solutions currently exist which would implement these changes without compromising the quality or delivery of online content suitable for viewing by minors. In doing this, however, the 
 government has permanently marginalised the online community.
Through the placing of the onerous burden of this legislation on the sector instead of empowering end users to deal with the accessibility and nature of online content the government has alienated the online constituency. On the one hand, the actions of this government, in directing the debate at social values rather than at technical feasibility, have created a situation where it has been prepared to allow very little attention to be given to the Australian community with hardly any political debate at all about the social implications of the Net—the social policy that so fundamentally underpins where we need to go forward as a society in relation to the Internet—and at the same time it has appealed to this same group of people, who mostly need to learn about what these implications are and, most importantly, to be given the opportunity to participate in an active and comprehensive way in the information society. The government is trying to have it both ways. The other side of the argument is technical feasibility. Anyone who is involved in the political debates surrounding the Internet and its implications knows how easy it is to hide behind technical jargon to baffle those who have an interest in social policy.
With respect to this bill, the government has chosen to move in a direction where it appeals to those in the community who are not full participants in the online debate. However, it seems to reassure them with a bill that is technically flawed. The ALP's position in response to this strategy has been one of damage control. We have put forward amendments that will seek to make this bill at least workable and honest in the first instance, recognising that the government's intention is not able to be fully implemented by virtue of this legislation. The ALP's position of damage control has arisen out of our sense of social responsibility towards those in our community, be they online or not. From the start of not only this debate but our period in opposition to this coalition government we have continually stated the need for the issue of equity of access to the Internet and to new information technologies to be at the forefront 
 of these debates, not at the back-end where this coalition government is so intent on placing them.
On the day that this bill was introduced, a virtual storm erupted in cyberspace, and the potential amongst the Australian community for an online democracy—or cyberdemocracy —was recognised. This followed the pattern of international debates around the issue of censorship online, and many Australians seized the opportunity for the first time to take part directly in the political debate that ensued. The floodgates opened and emails poured forth, and every citizen was given real-time access to his or her political representatives. The hierarchy of political lobbyists versus community members and their accessibility to politicians was completely dismantled.
In contrast with the government's lack of consultation on this bill with the online community, Labor has actively sought the opinions of Internet users. On my own site we posted a survey which asked certain questions. Do you support the intent of the bill? Do you not support the intent of the bill? Do you support the intent of the bill but not support the methodologies proposed in the legislation? The responses to these were overwhelmingly against the position that the government had presented in the bill but, interestingly, there was not outright opposition to the intent, as the government would have many in this place believe. In fact, the online community is concerned about the availability of unsuitable material to minors in this country, and they indicated that to me clearly.
This group of informed voters have the knowledge, the expertise, the experience and the insight to know that the government's proposals—the technical back-end to its bill—were completely unworkable and as such a con for those in the community who were seeking reassurance that they would be protected. Overwhelmingly, the online constituency does not support the government's approach. What they do support is the position put forward by Labor. They support the empowerment of end users. That means education, the opportunity to participate in the information society and the ability for end 
 users to take control of the situation and make decisions according to their social values and to choose how to raise their children.
However, with respect to this bill, it is clear that the government is charged with a moral conservatism that has presented itself in this chamber in a very narrow way. It has presented itself amidst a cynical government strategy to bring forth a bill for debate that the committee was hardly given the time to explore. The  Broadcasting Services Amendment (Online Services) Bill 1999  has had the fastest conceivable passage in this place, particularly in the context of some of the major debates confronting the federal parliament, including the GST, Telstra and, of course, the appropriation bills relating to the budget that has just been handed down.
Throughout this debate, the Liberal government has used provocative language and attempted to portray the public debate as being either pro-porn or anti-porn. This attempt at dumbing down the debate and manipulating the public through emotive claims like, `Your children will be exposed to drugs, paedophilia and bomb making unless this bill is passed,' is both condescending and foolish. Labor will not be drawn into the government's spin. We have approached this bill, since its introduction, with the belief that if the government's aim is to restrict the access of minors to unsuitable online content then the best and most effective way to do this is through informed and educated control of the Internet at end user level.
The approach that the government has used in relation to the online services bill has meant that the cultural implications of the use of filtering technologies and the impacts of these in relation to civil liberties have been completely ignored. Current filtering techniques are wide open to what we could call `collateral damage', and that is the term that is used to describe the inadvertent blocking of appropriate Internet content. This situation arises when key words, such as `breast', that are often used to identify pornographic or other sites unsuitable for viewing by minors trigger the blocking of sites which may in fact contain community or health information of 
 high educational value on issues such as breast cancer.
Since the inception of this bill, I have had numerous representations made to me on behalf of a range of community based organisations that deal with issues such as HIV-AIDS, cancer of the breast or prostate, and legal and illicit drug information provision. One common concern that has been expressed to me by all of these groups is the potential that this bill will lead to the blocking of access of minors and other users to material which is highly educative and has the potential to save lives. Representations were made to the Senate Select Committee on Information Technologies with respect to this. In particular, the statement made by the Australian Council for Lesbian and Gay Rights best illustrates this point. They said:
The ACLGR believes that the application of these proposals will result in entrenched inappropriate blocking and deletion of information of interest and assistance to the lesbian and gay community. We are concerned about blocking of access to information that is health and welfare related.
Labor has long held the view that the social challenges presented by the Internet need far more attention than the compressed and flawed inquiry that we have been involved in with respect to this bill. The very issue of convergence of media, computing and telecommunications and its social implications with regard to content warrant a far deeper analysis from a social policy perspective than this inquiry.
How typical it is that in the midst of all of these interesting debates—and there have been speakers in this chamber prior to me this evening who have alluded to this in some depth—the only time that we have a comprehensive debate about the Internet and content and its social implications is in the context of a censorship bill. The government lends itself to extended rhetoric about the importance of the economic growth of electronic commerce and what that will bring to Australia's industry, to our providers of businesses and services and to the global economy—you are all familiar with the rhetoric—yet the first legislative debate we have here is not about digital signatures and fundamental mechanisms to facilitate the global economy and Australia's 
 participation in it but is about censoring the Net.
I believe the impact of this bill will grow in the way that the bill imposes itself upon what should be one of the most exciting and growing industry sectors and social movements occurring in the country at this point in time. What seems to be a bill that is somewhat a constraint in relation to the presentation of content unsuitable for minors has effectively positioned Australia as a pariah in the global online community. Why? Far more at this stage, Australia has now given the global online community the perception that it is not interested in the potential of this new medium. We have given the perception that, in fact, a moral conservative agenda is far more important to economic growth and social expansion. We have given the perception to the global community that Australia is backward looking and is retrograde in its attempt to participate in policy development in the new century. Through this bill, we have now given the perception that we have a government that, above all else, is prepared to compromise our very future for a short-term and politically expedient agenda.
How sad a day it is that we find ourselves in this position. How sad a day it is that we have come to this point when even the Internet industry was progressing rapidly towards an outcome with respect to its code. It was not like the government had to operate in an environment of complete inertia. But it chose, knowingly, to move forward in a way which would alienate the sector which, it argued, it was trying to provoke into some action. It is worth while reflecting on some evidence given to the committee. I think it sums up this point. Patrick Fair of IIA had the following to say:
We were expecting a gentler approach which allowed the code to do its work without very onerous penalties and without a heavy-handed corralling of the conduct of our members. This is another example of heavy-handed legislation working against small businesses, finding more red tape, more special conditions and more difficult technical requirements which will make the efficient growth of the Internet and electronic services in this country less feasible. 

The IIA, like Labor, recognises the fact that this bill will have a negative impact on the emerging e-commerce industry in Australia and on our ability to compete internationally in the provision of Internet based services. I quote from Mr Marzbani's evidence:
If you wanted to hurt the Internet, and you wanted to hurt Internet electronic commerce, this would be one of the best ways to start.
If this bill passes it will be a disaster for the Internet industry in this country. Again, Mr Marzbani said:
Since the nascent Internet e-commerce market could play a very important place in the future economy of Australia, even the slightest obstacle to Australia's participation in the global Internet e-commerce markets at this critical point in time should be avoided at all costs.
These points reinforce my earlier statements about the critical timing of Australia's participation in the global electronic environment. Greg Taylor, the Vice Chair of Electronic Frontiers Australia, said that this bill:
. . . will create congestion and bottlenecks which will impede the flow of Internet traffic. It will increase costs and threaten the economic viability of ISP's. It will reduce the freedom of all adult Australians to choose what they read. It will turn Australia into a paternalistic regime with characteristics on a par with countries like China, Burma and Iran.
More than anything else, I believe that this bill demonstrates the stratified nature of social experience within the federal parliament. Representation for those in our community who have their comfort zone online is minimal, highlighting in the first instance a generation gap that, with each passing day, isolates young people in this country more than ever. It is Australia's young people for whom the Internet is a social and cultural experience. They will view this legislation and this government's approach with complete contempt, as it deserves. The Net is not something to be constrained or controlled. It is not evil. It is a tool for social progression and, to young Australians and many other online citizens, the Internet is the epitome of freedom and offers the promise of a new dignity both with respect to political activity and the democracies of the future.

"Ferris, Sen Jeannie",LP,1999-05-24,"—I hardly know where to start tonight. We have had the most extraordinary and colourful contributions. They almost belie description. We had Senator Schacht mentioning Tiananmen Square and the tragedies of that, Luddites and political thuggery. He was suggesting that we were stepping back into the medieval times. We had Senator Margetts invoking King Canute. I can only suggest that if Senator Margetts had come to any of the hearings she might have been a little more informed about some of the questions she raised and some of the answers that lay in the evidence. We had Senator Lundy discussing the total unworkability and technically flawed nature of the bill, invoking Iran, China and Burma, and calling it a disaster and totally unworkable.
If the  Broadcasting Services Amendment (Online Services) Bill 1999  is all of these things, why are those opposite so strongly opposed to it? If it is not going to work, it is technically flawed and its intention cannot be fully delivered—as Senator Lundy said tonight—why are they so energetically opposed to it? Why did Senator Lundy, on her email, invoke cooking up a cyberstorm? If this bill is undeliverable in its current form, why was all this energy invoked tonight and on other occasions over the last few weeks to suggest that the bill is going to fail?
This legislation has been introduced as a result of years of consultation between governments and the community—going back to the previous government—on the best way to manage the regulation of this developing technology. On this occasion we are talking about the best way to ensure that the Internet—I agree that it is probably the most revolutionary piece of new technology since the invention of the telephone—is appropriately regulated so that all users are protected from some of the more obnoxious aspects of the content available on the Internet.
Let us reconsider and reflect for a moment on the evidence that was presented by the Eros Foundation. What Fiona Patten told the committee was that she, along with many others in the community, did not believe that what is regulated offline should not be regu 
 lated online. When we are invoking evidence about doom, gloom, disaster and the sky falling in, it is important to take into account that some social libertarians gave evidence to the committee which in principle agreed with the position that the government is trying to take here—to protect families from some of the more obnoxious aspects of the Internet.
There are very few families in Australia who would disagree. Young Media Australia, which claims to speak for hundreds of families, agreed very strongly. Despite some of the quite fanciful contributions already made today about the way in which the Internet will be damaged irreparably by this legislation, there is absolutely no doubt that Australian families are very reassured about the intent of this legislation. I wish that Senator Schacht had been around when the material was being published about the home pages of those two young murderers at the Littleton High School. Any parent who knew that their child had access to those two home pages would feel justifiably reassured by the knowledge that, in this country when this bill is passed, they need not worry about their children's access to the Internet.
This bill will enable the online environment to operate as a three-way partnership between parents, government and industry, with parents taking a reasonable degree of responsibility and the industry doing the same, against an appropriate legislative framework. Most importantly, this legislation provides clear guidelines for the protection of all Australians from illegal and highly offensive material.
As chair of the Select Committee on Information Technologies which took evidence on this legislation, I had absolutely no doubt that emerging technologies can be accommodated within this framework. As witnesses explained to committee members, what is not possible today may well be possible tomorrow. A number of witnesses who appeared before the committee reflected the vigorous debate which has been taking place within the Internet community about this legislation. That opposition has been well canvassed tonight and due to time constraints I do not propose to traverse it again here.
One of the points that has been made tonight repeatedly by previous speakers has been the suggestion that parents should be responsible for the regulation of Internet access for children. Goodness me, I know many families whose children aged five to seven have access to a computer and are highly computer literate but where their parents have not yet mastered that skill. It is unreasonable to suggest that those parents should take total responsibility for what their child watches, whether they are five, seven, 10 or 15, when they themselves have not yet had the opportunity to master that skill. It totally overlooks the intent of this legislation.
There is little doubt that the bill covers a dynamic area of community development and as it continues to evolve the government may need to revisit this legislation. But it is a genuine attempt to recognise that this technology cannot continue to operate in its currently unregulated form and that the legislation we are debating today could well form the basis for complementary legislation in other countries where communities are equally concerned about what can be so easily accessed on the Net today in Australia.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (ONLINE SERVICES) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-05-24,"—The opposition of the Greens to the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Online Services) Bill 1999  comes not just as a result of the provisions in the legislation but more particularly as a result of the failure of the process. The extraordinary diversity of community views about not only content on the Internet and elsewhere available to the public but how restriction—if any at all—should be levied was not able to express itself in the short time available. There is a failure of political process here. I think the government, particularly Senator Alston, believed that bringing on the inquiry and this piece of legislation and giving it precedence over a whole range of major pieces of legislation would garner the support of the independent senators in the run-up to the debate about the GST package and the sale of Telstra. I have said as much in this chamber before. Interestingly, Senator Harradine has pointed out that, if that was the government's aim, they were going about it the wrong way. I note that he 
 is apparently, up until now, not contributing to the second reading debate. He is indicating that the bill does not meet his requirements.
So we have a failure of political motive in rushing this legislation—poorly prepared, poorly canvassed as far as the Australian public is concerned—into the chamber for the wrong reasons. It is a failure of political process. We ought to stand against that sort of failure and political expediency, particularly where it does not work—and it manifestly has not worked in this situation. I join with earlier speakers in saying that the Greens have got concerns about the invasion of particularly the minds of youngsters with untoward material, in particular gratuitous and repeated violence. In this country we are under an appalling avalanche of violent material not least from the United States, which has a different culture to Australia. If we could do something about that repetitive, unrelenting and gratuitous violence dished up as entertainment, we would be advancing the interests of this society far better than in this poor quality attempt to censor in particular sexual licentiousness.
That is the motivating force behind the government's move and Senator Alston's move to trammel the Internet. As you will know, Mr Acting Deputy President, a similar hasty and poorly thought-out effort in Canada is now on the rocks because it does not work adequately. Australia ought to take the lead in innovation in this area and reflect the views of the wider community instead of trying to repeat mistakes that have been made elsewhere.
Tomorrow I will be bringing in a motion for the Senate's consideration on what to do about Internet gambling. I want to make sure that we get the process right here and that there is time for the public to have input into this matter. If we are to have adequate input, we need to have adequate information going in front of it. I am hoping that the Senate will weigh very carefully my proposal for an inquiry which will not be truncated or limited by political expediency but which will go out and get maximum return from the public to see what we can do about limiting the deleterious effects of gambling.
I am not talking here about banning gambling on the Internet. I am talking about making sure that it does not create undue damage and hardship to individuals and to families in the Australian community. I want to make sure that we have a full and open debate about the potential for overseas gambling enterprises, legal and illegal—which are being blocked from establishing themselves in the United States, for example—to set up in Australia where we have no control on Internet gambling services and, de facto, are giving a message of encouragement to gambling houses in the United States to come here and set up. That circumstance requires that we take action, but it also requires that we get it right, that it be an agenda of its own, set because we are concerned to contain the damage from Internet gambling which effectively brings casino facilities to the living rooms of Australians with computer facilities. We want to ameliorate the damage and not allow it to go willy-nilly without a community consensus on how it might best be controlled.
Let me come back to the legislation before us. Because I am speaking late in this second reading debate, I will not repeat the list of concerns that other speakers on this side of the house have. As senators will have heard, they are many and they are matters of great importance. I suppose I could sum it up by saying that this process, because it has not been well thought out, opens up the ability of some people in our society to quite unwarrantedly intrude on the rights of other people in our society—I am talking about adults here—to see, hear, read and watch what they wish. My attention has been drawn to a story on page 21 of today's Daily Telegraph headed `Lesbian soap plot ill-timed'. The story says:
A lesbian relationship on the TV soap Breakers is under investigation after an MP complained to the Australian Broadcasting Authority.
As you will know, the Australian Broadcasting Authority is intimately involved—
—No pun intended!
—That is right. The ABA is intimately involved in matters to do with 
 this legislation that we are now dealing with. The article goes on:
Liberal Senator Karen Synon—
from Victoria—
wrote to the ABA querying the screening of the locally produced Network Ten drama at 3.30 weekday afternoons when young children may be switching over from Play School.
Senator Synon was concerned the depiction of a lesbian relationship as normal during children's viewing times was inappropriate. She asked the ABA to provide her with information on its guidelines for children's timeslots.
And so on. Horror of horrors, this article also says:
Apart from Lucy and Kelly's lesbian affair, another regular Breakers character, Vince, is gay.
Here we have the opinion of somebody on the other side of the house that lesbian and gay relationships are not part of what our society should see as normal. I take the totally contrary point of view and say that such relationships are an absolutely normal part of the spectrum of our society, and a very important contributing part of Australian society as it is. It adds a great deal through the wonder of the variety of life that such relationships bring to society—and, of course, it involves freedom for those individuals who are in lesbian or gay relationships.
To want to censor such relationships as part of the spectrum being depicted on television programs—we are not talking here about licentious or lascivious presentations but ordinary presentations of people going about loving relationships—is to confuse the whole issue of what censorship is about. That intrudes on the right of other people to see the spectrum of society as they would want to, which is usual, and censors the very make-up of people. I cannot help but feel that part of the government motivation behind this bill is to move in and censor what other people may consider as their right, as part of their life, as part of their freedom and liberty as Australians. It is being done in a ham-fisted way for all the reasons that are being presented in this debate.
It would have been much better had the Select Committee on Information Technologies had time to get a full input from the full 
 range of Australians interested in this matter and to have come up with a much better formulation which enabled those people in society who want censorship to have it but which left those people who want to be free of censorship to be free of it. In so many ways this legislation intrudes upon the rights of the latter group to service the intrusive impulses of the former group. That is why I do not support it.
There is something to be learnt from this faulty process. I hope that when we move to look at online gambling there will be a much better process. The perils for our community in not holding back the enormous impulse by big gambling houses—legal and illegal—to take people for a ride through Internet gambling is a problem of greater urgency for our community and a problem of great importance for our parliament to be taking up. All these matters should of course be dealt with. I think the priorities are wrong here and the outcome is not adequate in this situation.
I know there are amendments to be put forward. The Greens will be taking each of those amendments and evaluating them to see what we can do to improve on this unacceptable legislation.
I finish by saying that this process of Senate scrutiny has not been becoming and has not been adequate. That is simply because it was not given adequate time to take in what the public, the experts and the overseas experience could have given to a committee to come up with a much better resolution than the one put forward here in this legislation by the government. I will be entering into the committee stage of this debate. I do not know what the outcome will be. I hope the Senate turns this legislation down, frankly, and that we get it right before we deal with it. Failing that, we will be doing everything we can to remove the more deleterious aspects of this legislation in the ensuing debate.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (ONLINE SERVICES) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1999-05-24,"—First of all, let me deal with that issue Senator Brown raised—the issue of Internet gambling. Senator Brown does not have to lecture the rest of us about that. We have been very concerned about that for some considerable time. In fact, I have had discus 
 sions with persons from various states in Australia on that particular matter. It is even more important now that the recent announcement has been made by a particular group that they are getting into the online business. That is a matter that has been raised and it is under active consideration by the Senate Select Committee on Information Technologies. Senator Brown should know that discussions have been taking place on the Select Committee on Information Technologies committee about the best form of words for the reference so that it will be effective. So there will be an inquiry by the information technologies committee.
People have been saying that it is very important for that committee to address a range of things. That committee has addressed a range of things, including the question of privacy. That is a matter on which the chair of the committee has prepared a draft chair's report. We have not been inactive in those matters, and I would hope that our meeting on Thursday will be able to settle on terms of reference for an Internet gambling reference.
At this hour of the night I am not going to examine some of the contributions that have been made here because I do not think they deserve a serious response, particularly that of Senator Schacht. I recommend that people read Senator Schacht's contribution to this debate.
—It was laughable.
—It certainly was laughable. If somebody wants a public discourse on the principles of censorship or on other matters that he raised, then let us have a public discourse, a meeting of minds if that is possible, but to suggest that what is being proposed here, with the best will in the world, is going back to the Luddites or to the beginning of the printing press and so forth demeans debate in this chamber. My view is that the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Online Services) Bill 1999 , if enacted, will be an improvement on the current largely unregulated environment and thus deserves support.
I hope people understand that, over many years, ministers from both sides of politics have been saying that something needs to be 
 done about the Internet in respect of the types of prohibited material that are envisaged in this sort of legislation. I remember that when Mr Lavarch was Attorney-General he made a very strong statement as a result of the concerns that were expressed to him over a considerable period of time. Other ministers have also expressed concern about this matter. Nevertheless, there are suggestions that nothing should be done about it because nothing can be done about it. I think that is a defeatist attitude. While people are entitled to contribute to that attitude, it is strange indeed to give as a reason for doing nothing the fact that something is impossible, especially given advancements in filtering technologies.
There has been an extraordinary outcry from certain representatives of the Internet industry. Having read what was in the Financial Review of two Saturdays ago, I am disinclined to believe much that some of the people in the Internet industry say. It was unbelievable. I invite honourable senators to read it. If they believe what some people in the Internet industry say from here on in, they are very gullible indeed.
Given the number of announcements that have been made over a period of time, the Internet industry must have expected that something would be done by government. Not only that, but the Senate Select Committee on Information Technologies and its predecessors have, since 1993, been having inquiries about this matter. They have made two or three reports. Surely the Internet industry cannot say that it was not warned or did not know that there was a need for regulation in the absence of its doing nothing about it. Because industry has not done anything about it, our homes are invaded by groups—including pimps and prostitutes—pushing their porn, causing parents a great deal of concern. They are exploiting the medium in order to make a huge amount of money. That is something that we should not ignore; nor, I believe, should the Internet organisations ignore it.
I have very great concerns about some aspects of the operational effectiveness of this measure, but I do believe that something needs to be done to prevent extremely violent 
 material, pornographic material, illegal material and refused classification material being accessed in the home environment. We need to protect children. The bill falls considerably short of the recommendations made by our committee and its predecessors. Representatives of the Internet industry should have realised this, because they gave evidence to us. In 1995, in its first recommendation, our committee said:
It should be an offence to use a computer service to transmit, obtain possession of, demonstrate, advertise or request the transmission of material equivalent to RC, R and X categories.
That was essentially repeated in the first recommendation of June 1997. This measure before us does not follow the recommendations in respect of either the content to be regulated or the method of regulation.
I turn to a submission made to the committee's most recent inquiry. That submission states that the bill places too much reliance on the willingness of the Internet industry to self-regulate and on the capacity of the Australian Broadcasting Authority to provide timely and effective intervention if self-regulation fails. It also says that the stronger measures that are required include the establishment of a specific online content regulator that holds a direct relationship with Internet content and service providers, perhaps through a licensing system. I have a very strong view that such a licensing system would be more effective than that proposed under the legislation. As a condition of licensing, certain obligations could be imposed upon the industry and enforced.
Surely Internet service providers do have an obligation to their customers. For example, surely they ought to have an obligation to provide their customers with filtering technologies both at PC level and in the carriage infrastructure. It may well be argued—and I hope it is argued—by the minister that is the very thing that the government believes ought to be part of the code of practice provided for in the legislation. So it ought to be. If that is so, and if there is cooperation, maybe there will not be a need at some time in the future to impose licences and licence conditions on the industry.
There are a number of other things to be considered by the committee which have not been considered by some of those making contributions, not the least of which is that we have to have regard to the fact that you are going to have a convergence of technologies very soon. Broadcasting operators, for example, are expecting to integrate Internet and digital broadcasting technologies to deliver entertainment content into the home. Another example of convergence of broadcasting telecommunications and gambling can be seen in the nationwide promotion of `win a million dollars' television programs. The programs provide for viewers to enter the competition by dialling a 1900 number. Highly lucrative entry fees are imposed in the form of a charge on the telephone bill, which is then shared between the broadcaster and the telecommunications company.
There are a whole range of possibilities with the convergence of technologies, so I suppose the decision of the government in respect of prohibited content and potentially prohibited content to relate that to what is provided in at least one area—subscription television—is not such a bad idea. The government does have something of a non sequitur, if you like, in that with Australian provided R-rated material the bill requires an adult verification procedure, whereas that is not so for material coming from overseas. Frankly, something needs to be done about that so that we can move towards dealing with that problem.
I would also mention in passing that I am very concerned about the fact that there are a huge number of interactive violent computer games on the Internet. I think the OFLC must have a very good look at some of the very violent games they are allowing through and that would thus continue to be allowed in the Internet area.
At the end of the day, I will support this measure, but I have to say that parents should not be lulled into a false sense of security by the passage of this bill. It is an improvement. I congratulate the government for taking the initiative. It is not the way that I would necessarily have gone but the government, in its wisdom, has decided that this is the way 
 to go. I repeat that I am going to support the measure. I do congratulate the minister and the government for trying to do something about a matter which is of considerable concern to a large number of persons in Australia, particularly parents.
Parents must be reminded that they and others responsible for children will need to exercise vigilance. They should be empowered to do so through a massive education campaign and through technological support. I agree with what Senator Mark Bishop said in respect of this. There needs to be a massive education campaign. Obviously the industry itself, in developing the codes of practice, should have that as a very high priority. If we were to have legislation, properly amended, plus a massive education campaign in conjunction with effective filtering technologies, it would ultimately ensure an environment in which computer use would grow. It would also put a damper on the exploiters of the Net.
Finally, I have to repeat what I have said on a number of occasions: the ABA may not be the appropriate institution to carry forward this particular measure. The ABA is a passive regulator. Again today the ABA said something disconcerting for the structure of our society. I doubt the news media got it wrong. I would be interested to see what the ABA chair has to say about a statement from an ABA spokesman which appeared in an article by Emma-Kate Symons in the Daily Telegraph today. I digress. The ABA really is on trial, and so is the Internet industry. I hope there is cooperation to see that this measure does work.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (ONLINE SERVICES) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1999-05-24,"—in reply—I thank honourable senators for their contributions to the debate. As a starting point, there seems to be quite a substantial disconnect between the attitudes of the community at large and some elements of the industry in particular, and Senator Harradine referred to what could only be described as a furious counter-reaction from some people. But it is very interesting to note that there has been little or no criticism from the community at large.
I have not seen letters to the editor complaining about this initiative. Indeed, I have seen surveys out of the US—and I imagine they would not be much different here—showing that something like 80 per cent of parents expect action to be taken in respect of the Internet to protect their children from unsafe or offensive material and, of those, around 63 per cent are Internet users. So it is not the case at all that it is only those who do not understand the technology who have the concerns; it is very much those who are familiar with it who recognise the very serious problems that are inherent in a new medium.
One of the things we ought to be trying to do is to promote the safe use of the Internet because of all the enormous social and economic benefits that flow from the new technology. I am sure there is some hesitation on the part of children and parents to get further immersed in the Internet whilst they can keep surfing and coming across, either accidentally or on purpose, material that any right thinking citizen would regard as unacceptable.
I might have mentioned this before, but I saw a vox pop in the Herald Sun a few weeks ago where five kids, 21 or younger, said the government ought to do something about pornography on the Internet. Several of them were particularly concerned about their younger brothers and sisters having access to that material. We should not for a moment be misled into thinking that somehow this is a narrow view of some in society. I think it is overwhelmingly the mainstream view.
There are some elements in the industry that also recognise that something needs to be done. It is not just in Australia or America; it is happening all around the world where these sorts of concerns are very similar in their expressions because the technology is almost identical. Here in Australia there are some civil libertarians not condescending to detail—and I have read a number of articles in newspapers by people who seem to thrive on getting hysterical. The high-water mark of it in the parliament is someone like Senator Schacht, who is a classic example of why he is no longer a serious frontbencher. He does not do the homework. He is interested in the 
 politics of trotting out why these things are horrific and that no-one has paid enough attention, but it was abundantly clear from his contribution that he has not looked in any detail at some of the technical aspects or how you ought to go about tackling these problems, because his starting and finishing point was that nothing ought to be done. That is a very big cop-out.
It is a major social problem. People expect us to do what we can, and this bill represents the government's best attempt to tackle what is a very important issue. We all recognise that technology is constantly changing. There may well be new applications in the near future that might either help or hinder the chase. But the fact is that we have tried to design an organic system that will allow for codes of practice to be developed by industry to respond to new technologies and implement those technologies in such a way that it will not cripple the industry but will provide the maximum level of protection that can be made available.
These issues have not been raised in haste. The bill has been brought forward after some three years or more of discussions within the industry. The Internet Association has been conscientiously developing codes of practice, but I think it is fair to say it would concede it has not made a great deal of progress. As always, what does tend to happen is that some of the major players, the large ISPs, who have the facilities and access to the latest technologies are more than happy to sign on—indeed are more than happy to promote their own filtering devices and hopefully to flog software packages to all and sundry—but others simply see this as an additional industry impost which they would like to avoid, if possible.
That is not a position that we think is responsible. We have, therefore, put down a framework which we think will allow for the necessary initiatives to be taken by the industry in the first instance, but we do not expect the ABA to be a passive regulator. We do have powers contained in the bill which will enable the relevant minister to ultimately require adherence to codes of practice and, therefore, to ensure that everyone is caught up 
 where that becomes necessary. I accept the proposition that everyone is on trial. In a sense, the technologies are on trial, but this parliament should not be, as long as it espouses the appropriate principles and does its best to ensure that technology serves those principles.
There has been some suggestion that the penalties are too harsh, but there is a graduated range of penalties, and we certainly do not expect that people will be copping the maximum in the first instance. Certainly, one would expect some teething difficulties, and undoubtedly there will be some problems with implementation in the first instance. We expect those to be accommodated sympathetically but, at the same time, where it becomes apparent that some players in the industry are simply thumbing their noses at the new regime, we would expect appropriate penalties to be applied.
Civil liberties arguments are usually expressed in the abstract, and they were again here tonight. What we have simply done as a starting point is to say that what is legal in the offline world ought to be legal in the online world, but that where illegal or offensive material is proscribed in the offline world then it similarly ought to be proscribed as much as possible in the online world. We think it is possible to draw analogies between the different media. We believe that we have managed to strike a sensible middle course. We have recognised that, on the one hand, we have some regimes by virtue of state and territory regulations that allow access to highly offensive adult material but, on the other hand, we have taken a much stricter approach to free-to-air television because it is much more family oriented. Given the overwhelming preponderance of young children who access the Internet, we ought to be in a sense leaning more in that direction than the other.
Those who claim that the legislation is unworkable are usually those who have not looked at the overall schema, because quite clearly it does not represent a snapshot attempt at any one point in time. It provides a basis on which ongoing actions can and should be taken. We would expect that any 
 new technologies and new applications that arrive will be implemented as much as possible. That is not an unworkable situation. It is a recognition that, as things currently stand, it may be very difficult to apply the same adults only approach to R-rated material onshore as to offshore.
To pick up on a point Senator Harradine made, we are not simply saying, `Here is a non sequitur. We will have two different regimes.' We propose to move an amendment that will provide a statement of intent designed to demonstrate that it is the view of the parliament that, wherever possible, that material should be accessed by adults only and that, if and when the technology becomes available to do that, we would expect the legislation to reflect it. That will be part and parcel of the review that we believe should be undertaken by 1 January 2003, which is about 3½ years away. That will also enable a proper scrutiny to be made of the latest technological developments.
We do not for a moment throw in the towel on that front. We simply say that, given that you cannot readily distinguish between R-rated and X-rated material coming in from offshore, particularly where it is all contained within the one web site or portal, then it may well be you have to have a differential approach at this stage. But ideally we would like to have the same treatment accorded both internationally and domestically.
As far as streaming is concerned, again we are conscious of the problem that is constituted by ephemeral material but, given it will be fairly constant in its theme and content, we believe it ought to be possible—at least after complaints have been made—to verify the nature of that material and to ensure that if material continues to be repeated along the same themes then action can be taken. Whilst you are not banning precisely the same film or content, you are banning something that is very similar. I think that addresses the vice that we are concerned about.
It is not the case that we leave everything to the government and we ignore user education or parental empowerment. We think that is part and parcel of a sensible regime and that responsible service providers and content 
 providers would similarly encourage parents and educators to take whatever action they can to protect children. But given that parents are often not around—either because they are at work, because they are not familiar with the technology or because kids simply have their PCs in their bedrooms and do not have their parents looking over their shoulders—it is pretty unrealistic to think that parents can simply sit back and be confident that everyone will do the right thing. You need the combination of the two. The approach we have taken reflects the importance we place on both strands of policy.
I do not think there is anything else I would want to add at this stage. I thank all senators for their contributions.

"Gibson, Sen Brian",LP,1999-05-24,"—I rise tonight to speak about national competition policy and its advantages for the Australian community. In 1995 the Labor government, supported by the coalition in opposition and all state and territory governments, implemented the most broad ranging program of micro-economic reform ever attempted in Australia to that time. It was designed to improve Australia's economic performance by bringing higher productivity to the government sector, in particular, and also to the non-corporate sector. The encouragement of competition in Australia has been a bipartisan policy in order to encourage efficiency and fairness in the community.
The 1974 Trade Practices Act is the statute which oversees this competition. It originally only applied to incorporated business—that is, to companies only. But since 1995, through the national competition policy, the Trade Practices Act now applies to government businesses and to unincorporated businesses through the competition principles agreement and the conduct code agreement. The aim of this policy was to introduce competition to virtually all sectors of the Australian economy. Why? Because competition means reduced prices and better service for consumers and increased welfare for everybody. This is another area where some key policies and practices had been preventing Australia from reaching its economic potential. The results were inappropriate regulation and red tape and government monopolies which provided poor service and kept prices high. Those policies had weakened the incentives for people to be innovative and self-reliant.
The 1995 national competition policy reform package was a breakthrough. It provides Australia with a chance to harness resources more effectively, more efficiently and more productively. Higher productivity and economic growth are the only ways to get higher sustainable wages and better job prospects. These policies will give consumers an idea of the true cost of providing services and are also an essential guide to investments by both the private and government sectors for the benefit of all. All state and territory governments showed they were committed to it in 1995, including the coalition opposition in Canberra. We supported this policy because it was good for Australia in the long run.
Contrast this with the situation today. I remind the Senate that when Labor were in power we supported each of their four major economic reforms: freeing up the Australian dollar, freeing up the finance markets, lowering tariffs and competition policy. None of these policies were taken to the electorate before they were actioned but we, the coalition, supported them because they were good for all Australians. Contrast that with the position today and tax reform. Tax reform has been a long-term issue—Asprey in 1975, Hawke in 1986 and Hewson in 1993. Both sides of politics know that tax reform is needed in Australia. Yet, unlike our attitude when Labor were in power, they do not want to act in the long-term interests of Australia, for our children and our grandchildren. They oppose tax reform for their short-term political goals. What a shame.
But I digress. Back to competition policy, the projected gains from national competition policy are impressive. The estimates at the time were that the annual gain in real GDP would amount to about 5.5 per cent—about $30 billion a year in today's dollars. Wages were projected to be three per cent higher than they would otherwise be and it was predicted that an additional 30,000 jobs would be generated. After three years, the results are already impressive. Electricity bills in contestable markets of Sydney and Melbourne have fallen by around 30 per cent, the price per kilowatt hour is half that of non-contestable markets in Hobart and Perth, the national 
 electricity market has been working since December last year and all users in the eastern states will be able to choose their own supplier by the year 2001.
Gas prices for major industrial users fell by 50 per cent after deregulation of the Western Australian market in 1995. Gas access charges are set to fall by 60 per cent by the year 2000 in New South Wales. The cost of international telephone calls has fallen by 50 per cent in real terms in the past six years and the cost of STD phone calls has fallen by 40 per cent over the same period. Last week Telstra announced further drops in call prices for both STD and international calls. Consumers in New South Wales have saved at least $86 million as conveyancing costs fell by 17 per cent between 1994 and 1996 when the legal profession's monopoly was removed. In Queensland, 10 of the 17 largest councils have implemented two-part tariffs for water, resulting in an average saving in water usage of 20 per cent in the first year. Rail freight rates for the Perth-Melbourne route fell by 40 per cent and service quality and transit times improved after the introduction of competition. Freight prices for grain in Western Australia dropped by 21 per cent in real terms after deregulation in 1992-93. Freight rates for coal in the Hunter Valley dropped by 25 per cent over three years and a further 10 per cent fall is scheduled in the next 12 months.
Despite the success of competition policy reforms, there are still some people, some interest groups and some politicians who would choose to abandon it. As the Productivity Commission draft report on this topic—published this month—says, there is general confusion about the causes of rural decline in both population and economic activity. The decline has been in progress for many regions of Australia for many years. The key factors behind this have been, firstly, declining terms of trade for agricultural and mining products. In agriculture, the real prices of products have been down by over half over the past 40 years. For mining products, the prices are down but by nowhere near as much as for agriculture. The second factor has been greatly increased productivity. I remind the Senate that Bert Kelly, the modest member, 
 used to say that if you want to stop rural population decline you should ban tractors. Hence the share of agriculture and mining has dropped from 20 per cent of GDP 50 years ago to eight per cent today.
National competition policy brings the Trade Practices Act to government monopolies, such as energy and transport, which had been characterised in the past by poor management, overmanning, poor service and inappropriate pricing. It also provides for access reform for common infrastructure such as rail and pipelines. It also proposes, and is implementing, structural reform of government businesses. For instance, New South Wales rail is broken up into seven parts and the Victorian ports authority has also been broken up. Another key direction is the review of anticompetition legislation.
As both the National Competition Council and the Productivity Commission have pointed out, better communication of the aims of national competition policy are required. The results are often forgotten. The lower prices and the better service are just taken for granted. It behoves all of us as politicians to make sure that we take every opportunity to let the community know of the benefits of competition and its extension to government and other enterprises. Everyone will be better off.
Australia must continue to adapt to change. We are a small fish in a big ocean and if we want our children and our grandchildren to prosper we must have a more competitive economy. Finally, where changes are necessary, governments must strive to be compassionate with people or groups that are affected by change. In conclusion, I commend to the Senate the annual report of the National Competition Council and the draft report of the Productivity Commission on the impact of competition policy and reforms on rural and regional Australia. I congratulate both of those organisations on the work they have done.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>National Competition Policy</title>,Adjournment,17,1
