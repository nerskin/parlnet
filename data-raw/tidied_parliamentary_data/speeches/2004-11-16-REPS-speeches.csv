"McArthur, Stewart, MP",LP,2004-11-16,"—It is my great privilege to nominate David Hawker, the member for Wannon, as the new Speaker for the 41st Parliament. I move:
That the honourable member for Wannon do take the chair of this House as Speaker.
As members would be aware, David Hawker has represented the seat of Wannon for 21 years. He first joined this parliament in 1983 upon the by-election caused by the retirement of former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser. By way of history, the former Prime Minister was the member for Wannon for 28 years. He won the election in 1955, having lost the election in 1952 by a handful of votes. So the former Prime Minister understood the necessity of winning the last few votes—even down in Wannon, which is now a safer seat under David Hawker. Former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser and David Hawker have represented the seat of Wannon for 49 years.
I remind the House that the centre of political gravity has moved to western Victoria for these few fleeting moments, because the member for Corangamite will be escorting the new Speaker, supported by the member for Mallee. I want to ensure that this parliament understands where the real political decisions will be made in the next few moments.
By way of political historical perspective, former Speaker Neil Andrew joined this parliament as the member for Wakefield in 1983, David Hawker joined this parliament as the member for Wannon in the by-election in 1983, as I said, and Stewart McArthur joined this parliament as the member for Corangamite in February 1984. We became very good friends in the ensuing years. Friends are sometimes hard to find in this parliament, as some members would know. The three of us spent 13 long years in opposition and during that time we became quite well versed in electing Leaders of the Opposition. We learnt a lot about politics and about the parliament as three good friends on the opposition benches during those 13 long years. We would hope that current members of the opposition will stay on the opposition benches for a longer period.
David Hawker is a very good local member for Wannon. Wannon encompasses a number of regional cities and towns. He claims that Hamilton, the centre of Wannon, is the wool capital of the world. Some of us would challenge that particular view. Warrnambool, Ararat and many other smaller towns are in Wannon. As members on both sides would know, in these big rural electorates the electors think you have to be everywhere all the time. David Hawker has been a very outstanding local member. He has been everywhere. He has served the people. He has done an outstanding job as their representative. He has even represented my home town of Camperdown in quite a good manner, although I am really the de facto member of that particular town.
Some of you may not recall that in the middle 1980s David Hawker was an advocate for the free market of domestic wheat—and some of you may think that a fairly difficult topic. The advocacy of David Hawker, with the assistance of the then government, freed up the domestic wheat market. That was a very big debate and David Hawker was the No. 1 advocate on the opposition side. I put on the record his remarkable contribution to that at times quite acrimonious debate. David Hawker, as Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration, has brought the Reserve Bank and the Reserve Bank Governor to the parliament and to the Australian people. That has exposed that very important policy-making group to open parliamentary debate. David Hawker comes to the Speaker's job having had experience on the Speaker's panel. 
David Hawker, by any measure, is a fair and honourable man. He is supported very strongly by his wife, Penny, who is in the chamber, along with his family. This is a very historic moment for David Hawker, who has spent many years in the parliament representing the seat of Wannon and his people. It is my very great pleasure on behalf of all members to propose David Hawker as the Speaker of the House of Representatives in the 41st Parliament.
Honourable members—Hear, hear!
—It is my uncomfortable duty to remind the House that it is strictly not in order to speak in favour of the candidates unless the election is contested. Is the motion seconded?
—I have heard your injunction, Mr Clerk. I have the great honour and privilege to second that motion. I would like the chamber to recall the fact that the motion was moved by the member for Corangamite and supported by the member for Mallee, the two nearest electoral neighbours to the member for Wannon. A very important aspect to today, as the member for Corangamite has said, is the significance of this region of Victoria. It is a great honour to second the motion. David Hawker is an honourable man. I am looking forward now to continuing order in this place under the stewardship of this candidate.
—Does the honourable member for Wannon accept the nomination?
—Mr Clerk, I do—with some reluctance.
—Is there any further proposal? There being no further proposal, the time for proposals has expired. I declare that the honourable member proposed, the member for Wannon, has been elected as Speaker.
Honourable members—Hear, hear!
—I wish to express my grateful thanks for the high honour that the House has chosen to confer on me today.
The Speaker having seated himself in the chair—",REPS,<title>SPEAKER</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,5,1
"Howard, John, MP",LP,2004-11-16,"—Mr Speaker, may I, on behalf of the government and I know on behalf of all members of the House and indeed the wider community of people interested in and concerned about the operation of government in this country, extend to you my very warm congratulations. You are a person who has served the people of Wannon with great commitment since you were elected in a by-election early in 1983. You have been a very good steward of interests inside your party. You are a person who is warmly regarded on a personal basis by all of your colleagues in the Liberal and National parties, and I believe that that sentiment is shared across the chamber. The reality of political life is that, over a period of time, some people who are in this House for a long number of years develop friendships and respect on both sides, some do not. You belong to the former category—somebody who has developed friendships and respect on both sides of the House.
The role that you now assume in the House is a role that requires, in your own words—and they have been used before, but they are nonetheless appropriate—that you be firm but fair. That will be the expectation of the government. Parliament is a place for both government and opposition. Parliament is a place where there should be robust debate. There should be robust debate in the Australian tradition, but there should also be intelligent debate and a measure of discipline consistent with the proper exchange of ideas so that this chamber is representative of Australian democracy. 
All of us have a responsibility to ensure that the repute of parliament is as high as possible. I think the quality of people who come into this place is very high. In my experience of just over 30 years I have found that most people who come into this place on both sides come with a desire to improve things, with very strong views and with very strong values. Some leave a mark; some do not. But we all have a joint responsibility to elevate, as much as we can, the repute of this place, because in the end this place—this chamber along with the Senate—is the ultimate guarantor of democracy and the way of life that we believe in.
I said to the newly elected members of the Liberal Party at our party gathering yesterday that today is a very special moment in their lives, as it is in the lives of new members on the other side—and I take this opportunity to welcome all new members. In the just over 100 years of the Federation of the Australian Commonwealth a relatively small number of people—numbered in the hundreds—have had the privilege and honour of sitting in this place. To be a member of the national parliament of Australia is itself an incredible honour and one that should be treasured, whatever your political views are and whatever your sentiments are about the issues that come to be debated here.
I particularly say to all of the new members: you will never forget this day. It is a very important day. In many cases, it is the culmination of a lot of hard work, not just during your election campaign but over a number of years. I have never forgotten my first day in parliament, and I know that those who have come here today will never forget their first day in parliament. It is a real honour. Every day I am in this place I regard it as an honour. For you, Mr Speaker, I know it is a moment of great legitimate personal satisfaction, and you have a right to feel pleased and satisfied. I know you will do your job with great commitment and fairness. I extend to you, your wife, Penny, and the other members of your family my very good personal wishes. You will have the total support of the government in the discharge of your responsibilities, and I know that you assume them with the great goodwill and respect of all members of this chamber.",REPS,<title>SPEAKER</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,5,1
"Latham, Mark, MP",ALP,2004-11-16,"—Mr Speaker, I join with the Prime Minister in conveying my congratulations and those of the Australian Labor Party to you on your elevation to the chair. We on this side of the House know you well from your long service in the chamber. I, in particular, know you well from your chairmanship of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration. You always took a cooperative and commonsense approach that was admired by all the members of the committee on both sides of politics. You achieved a degree of bipartisanship in your role as chair of that committee that does you great credit. It was not always an easy committee to chair. I remember the member for Warringah used to fire it up in the mid-nineties in the grilling of the Reserve Bank governor. But post 1996 you achieved a level of consensus that was much admired around the committee table. You are well known and respected across the parliament, as the Prime Minister pointed out. You come from a distinguished Victorian constituency that has now returned a Liberal Party Prime Minister and a Liberal Party Speaker in the House of Representatives. 
On this side of the chamber we welcome the result of the Liberal Party room ballot, not least of all because we can still hear points of order from the member for Mackellar on the other side of the chamber. From our perspective, we have two for the price of one: we have a Liberal Party Speaker and we have his shadow sitting over there, ready to point out how things can be usefully improved in the House at any time. I tried to help the member for Mackellar by endorsing publicly the person who I thought was her main opponent, the member for Cook. Mr Speaker, it is just a reminder that you should be thankful I said nothing good about you prior to the ballot! I kept my comments until this particular forum now, after your installation in the chair.
You have also broken the Liberal Party mould. In 1996 the Prime Minister told us and the Australian people that we would have an independent Speaker in this chamber and he proceeded to install those who had been Liberal Party chief whips, the former members for Casey and Wakefield. You have not been a former chief whip. I think you served as a deputy whip for a number of years in opposition. We also trust that you will maintain the interest in parliamentary reform demonstrated by your immediate predecessor, Neil Andrew. He was keen on higher standards in the chamber. As the Prime Minister pointed out, that is important. As a reformed bad boy myself, I can assure you of all the cooperation, support and discipline that is needed to ensure that we bring the highest possible parliamentary standards here, and of course you will have the support of Labor Party members in that vital task. 
We believe in the primacy of the parliament over the executive government. We believe in reversing the trend of recent times where the role of the parliament has been downgraded. We believe that the independence of the Speaker is fundamental to that important task in the interests of the Australian people. We say that the Speaker should not be a political appointment. We say that it should be a role beyond politics—an independent Speaker—and we have outlined previously, the member for Hotham and I, how that independence can be achieved by alternating between Labor Party and coalition members.
—Is the member for Mackellar keen on the role of an independent Speaker? We are glad to hear that, and we would be glad to support your independence in the future, Mr Speaker, if at any time you choose to leave the party room and remain free of partisan politics in this forum. We have also suggested on our side of the chamber useful parliamentary reforms such as time limits on questions and answers, and supplementary questions, which were entertained by Speaker Halverson for many years, and we look forward to your consideration of these parliamentary reforms under your banner of `firm but fair'. The fairness, of course, is to ensure that the opposition gets a fair go, and the supplementary questions and other reforms that we have suggested can play a useful role in that respect.
We know that you will be true to your high hopes and promise in this new and important role. I conclude with the words of the person who thoroughly defined the role of the Speaker in the Westminster system, Speaker Lenthall. When Speaker Lenthall sat in the House of Commons and came under the harassment of the King's men and was asked to dob in some of his colleagues he replied, `I have neither eyes to see nor mouth to speak nor ears to hear except as the parliament directs me.' He was firm but fair to all members of parliament. He put the primacy of the parliament above all other considerations. So, Mr Speaker, we look forward to your role in the chair with a sense of fairness and openness that we need as members of the House of Representatives, as representatives of the people, to serve our constituents and to return the great trust and honour that they placed in us at the recent elections. 
I join with the Prime Minister in conveying my congratulations to all the new members here. It is indeed a great honour to serve in the House of Representatives, to be elected by the Australian people in this great democratic forum. It is an honour that nobody ever forgets. It is an honour that nobody should take lightly. It is an honour we all hope to discharge in the current parliamentary term as well as we can under your guidance in this chamber, with parliamentary reform, with a sense of fairness and with a sense of service for the great Australian people. So congratulations, David; we very much look forward to working with you.",REPS,<title>SPEAKER</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,5,1
"Anderson, John, MP",NATS,2004-11-16,"—Mr Speaker, I am delighted to join with the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in congratulating you, in wishing you well in the role and in saying to you that I know, given the 16 years that I have known you and the many times that I have had the opportunity to be with you in your electorate and in this place, the views expressed by the member for Corangamite and the member for Mallee are absolutely right. You are a very hardworking local member, respected for your decency, and I know that you will bring forward that quality in the very important role now given to you.
I know that you will recognise the importance of allowing robust debate in this place. We ought not to be squeamish about robust debate. It would be a great shame if the people who were elected to this place did not believe in and have a passion for their views on how better to advance the country. The point is, of course, that robust debate should be conducted in a way that does not spill over into personal abuse or a lack of respect for others. I know by your demeanour, by your personal qualities, that you will be keen to ensure that the House is conducted along lines that respect those points.
I join with the Prime Minister in particular in not only wishing you well in this role but also acknowledging that it is a partnership. Penny is here with you today, I understand, and we extend our best wishes to her and to her family. 
I also join with the Prime Minister in welcoming new members. I think I am right in saying that, in the 104 years or so since we became a nation, only a tad over a thousand people have served in this parliament, which is remarkable. We are indeed privileged—we are few in number—but we bear a great responsibility as an extension of that privilege and we ought to be mindful of it. Mr Speaker, again I wish you well—and, as a wheat grower, I think that on the domestic deregulation in the 1980s we had it right.",REPS,<title>SPEAKER</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,5,1
"Andren, Peter, MP",IND,2004-11-16,"—Mr Speaker, on behalf of the crossbenchers and the Independents, I would like to congratulate you on your rise to such an honourable position. With no comment at all on your capabilities, which I am sure will honour this place, I would just wonder whether or not it might be preferable in future parliaments to allow the parliament to be the first receiver of the news of the nomination of the governing side's choice rather than for it to be announced to the media the night before, because it does make something of a nonsense of the constitutional requirement that the parliament elect a Speaker to this place.
On behalf of the member for New England and the member for Kennedy— 
Honourable members—Where is he?
—He is out whipping up some new candidates for the next election! He is indisposed. I am not quite sure what the problem is and, if he is not well, I am sure all members wish Mr Katter the best of health. 
Might I say that I endorse the comments of the Leader of the Opposition, particularly around investigating time limits on questions. Indeed, on the idea of a supplementary question, the way the other place conducts question time is an object lesson for what I believe should occur here. I ask you, Mr Speaker, to be mindful, when questions are asked about alternative policies, that it not be used for a free go for a ministerial statement that should be directed and delivered in another part of the parliamentary forum. In saying that, can I just correct some of the grammar I hear around here about the word `alternate' being used instead of `alternative'. If we had alternate policies, it would be a very interesting place.",REPS,<title>SPEAKER</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,5,1
"Costello, Peter, MP",LP,2004-11-16,"—Mr Speaker, may I add my congratulations to you on a thoroughly deserved appointment and a unanimous appointment here today. You have been, as has been remarked, somebody who has been marked by decency throughout the whole of your political career. I was very intrigued when I heard the member for Corangamite say that there had only been two members for Wannon in essentially the last 50 years. I can remember you telling me about one of your elections where in a small country town there were about 70 or 80 voters. They were nearly all agricultural producers and there was a school, and each year a teacher would be sent out from Melbourne to do their first year of teaching. In the general election, out of the 80 registered voters you got 79, and the locals were upset that you only got 79 this time and refused to speak to the teacher for the next two years! It has been an electorate which I believe has been exceptionally well served by you. 
You have on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration established a new role. When we came to government and when it was formalised for testimony of the Reserve Bank governor, you were the person who presided over making that institution transparent and I think you did it with decency, which gave you bipartisan respect. I think you bring all of those qualities to the speakership. Undoubtedly the parliament will function best when the Speaker is able to preserve a low visibility in a way which will preserve the functions of questions, answers and accountability. We have great confidence, by reason of your experience and your personality, that you will be very well fitted to do that. 
To Penny and to the family, who are here today, this is a very proud moment for you as well as for the honourable member for Wannon, and I add my congratulations on your appointment.",REPS,<title>SPEAKER</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,5,1
"Macklin, Jenny, MP",ALP,2004-11-16,"—I too want to add my congratulations to you, Mr Speaker. I know that on many occasions we have good reason to give the government a hard time, but on the election of the government I congratulate the Prime Minister and the government, as well as adding my congratulations to all of the new members. One of the most important tasks of any opposition is to hold the government accountable. We certainly intend to do that, and we intend to do it with vigour. Some of the things that so many people have already spoken about when remarking on your qualities are your demeanour, the way in which you intend to be fair and the way in which you have carried yourself since you have been in this parliament. As we work very hard to hold the government accountable, we will be looking very much to you to maintain that fairness so that we can do the job that we have been given here in this parliament. ",REPS,<title>SPEAKER</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,5,1
"SPEAKER, The",N/A,2004-11-16,"—I again thank all honourable members for this great honour. I would like to express my sincere thanks first of all to the member for Corangamite for his very kind words. Yes, it is true that Wannon did extend into Camperdown, and he still has great difficulty in recognising where the boundary is, I think. Nonetheless, I have certainly appreciated his support and friendship over many years and his always very frank comments. I also thank the honourable member for Mallee for his support, which is much more than just today. We have worked together on many common issues and it is something that I have appreciated over many years. 
I would like to thank the honourable Prime Minister for his very kind words. I certainly appreciate the way they were put and the expression of them. To the Leader of the Opposition, thank you. Yes, we have worked together on the Economics, Finance and Public Administration Committee and I have certainly appreciated the contribution that you have made to the committee. I think all honourable members should know that I think it was a good example of how a committee could work together with members of both government and opposition and achieve some constructive outcomes. I would like also to thank the Deputy Prime Minister, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the Treasurer for their kind remarks. The sentiments that were expressed give me great encouragement. I also thank the many colleagues and friends from both sides who have congratulated me in anticipation of this moment.
I say to the honourable member for Calare that some of the points he raised are probably first of all for consideration and secondly should be considered by the parliament itself, not just by the Speaker.
I would like to pay tribute to the former member for Wakefield, the Hon. Neil Andrew, for six years of very conscientious effort to uphold the dignity, the impartiality and the standing of the office of Speaker and also of the House. Neil, the member for Gippsland and I were the lonely coalition class of 1983—shortly after, as we have already heard, to be joined by the member for Corangamite. To the Labor class of 2004, I say that I think we can relate to some of your feelings. 
I would also like to thank my wife, Penny, and our family. Three of our four children, one grandchild and our son-in-law are here today, and I thank them for their very strong support over many, many years and for their encouragement to continue as the member for Wannon. I am mindful that the electors of Wannon hold high expectations given that the previous member for Wannon, as was mentioned, was the former Prime Minister the Rt Hon. Malcolm Fraser. I believe that my elevation today will be seen as, in some way, reward for their ongoing loyal support. I am also mindful of my own family's commitment to parliamentary public life before me, which includes another member for Wakefield, my late cousin the Hon. Charles Hawker, and before that the elevation to Speaker in the South Australian parliament in 1860 of my great-grandfather, the Hon. George Hawker. I have seen reports that George Hawker was considered `courteous and fair'; I hope I can continue in that style. 
On the opening today of the 41st Parliament, I congratulate all members on their election or re-election as the case may be. As the Prime Minister has pointed out, it is indeed a great privilege and an honour to serve in the national parliament, and I am sure all members will find it and continue to find it very rewarding. As we debate the issues of national importance, we should never forget that the things that unite us are far greater than the things that divide us. As parliamentarians we should be mindful, as has been said, that the eyes of the nation are on us as we strive to make ours a better country. We all have a responsibility to repay the trust of our citizens by discharging our duties in a way worthy of respect. Again I thank all members and assure members from both sides that I will do my utmost to facilitate this through the honour you have given me today. Finally, can I just say that my door is always open. ",REPS,<title>SPEAKER</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,5,1
"Neville, Paul, MP",NATS,2004-11-16,"—It is my pleasure to nominate Ian Raymond Causley, the member for Page, for the position of Deputy Speaker for the 41st Parliament. As honourable members would be aware, Ian Causley was elected to the House of Representatives in 1996. He brings with him a wealth of life experience, as well as valuable experience in the role of Deputy Speaker. He has a true empathy for rural Australia stemming from an extensive background in farming and business. He is a fourth-generation cane grower and somewhat of a legend in the New South Wales sugar industry. He has served as President of the Clarence River Cane Growers Association, as a former director of the New South Wales Sugar Milling Cooperative and as a past member of the New South Wales Cane Growers Council. He brought his experience with him when he entered the New South Wales parliament in 1984 as the member for Clarence. During his time in the New South Wales parliament he held the positions of Minister for Natural Resources, Minister for Water Resources, Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and Minister for Mines. Although the Fahey government was defeated in 1995, Ian Causley retained the seat of Clarence until he resigned to enter federal parliament. 
He has had the unique experience of representing the Clarence Valley and Northern Rivers in the state and federal parliaments for some 20 years. Ian Causley carries with him the real-life experiences of a self-made man, together with the empathy that goes with that role. He has been a canecutter, timber worker, farmer, grower organisation executive, publican, state member and state minister. He has had three years experience in the role of Deputy Speaker. He is affable, approachable, fair and firm and does not suffer fools gladly—on which note I commend him to the House.",REPS,<title>DEPUTY SPEAKER</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,14,1
"Gash, Joanna, MP",LP,2004-11-16,"—I take much pleasure in seconding the nomination of the member for Page for the position of Deputy Speaker. Much has already been said about Ian Causley by the member for Hinkler. However, I would like to talk about a side to Ian Causley that is not often mentioned yet is something all of us in this House need to follow—that is, allowing time for family and friends. Whilst the member for Page is very qualified for the role of Deputy Speaker, he is also a husband, a father of four children and a grandfather of seven, and he always makes time for them. He is also a former union man, for the information of those people opposite. He is a former member of the AWU. To all members of this House I say: be assured that Ian always has the time to explain those mysteries of politics that sometimes we are afraid to ask about. He is very professional, and I wish him continued success in this most important role.",REPS,<title>DEPUTY SPEAKER</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,14,1
"Price, Roger, MP",ALP,2004-11-16,"—I nominate Mr Harry Jenkins, the member for Scullin, as Deputy Speaker. I count him amongst my friends, yet this proposal is not clouded by friendship. I consider it a privilege to nominate him. Harry Jenkins is a distinguished member of this chamber, having been elected in 1986. He has served as Deputy Speaker, chairman of committees and Second Deputy Speaker. He is the longest serving and best qualified amongst the serving chairs of this chamber. He is a person of sober habits, but very approachable, who takes an interest in all members. He has loyally served and been schooled by two Labor Speakers and three coalition Speakers, no matter how unexpectedly brief or long the latters' terms of office have been.
Mr Jenkins uses his extensive knowledge of standing orders and precedent to bring good order in this House, and he uses his ample reserves of politeness, tact and good humour to enforce those standing orders and precedents. In fact, his rulings are grounded in the standing orders. This of itself can sometimes be a novel approach. When all else fails, he is very firm. I believe that he has conducted himself as a presiding officer with great distinction and to the satisfaction of all on both sides of this House. He cares deeply about this parliament and its traditions, but he is also prepared to embrace change so that it can best meet the needs of members and the expectations of the people we seek to serve. I can vouch for the fact that Mr Jenkins has not crisscrossed this country in pursuit of this high office. Nor has he gladhanded, cajoled, hectored or even badgered any coalition members, let alone members of the Labor Party or Independents. 
I believe he has conducted himself as a presiding officer with great distinction. It is in his nature that he allows his outstanding record to speak for itself. Every member of this House, from the newest members to the holders of high office, has an equal vote and responsibility to elect the Deputy Speaker. In fact, it will be the only chance members get to vote in this House on these matters. I urge all honourable members to cast their vote for the best and most experienced candidate, who will fulfil the role of Deputy Speaker with distinction. In my view, that person is without doubt Mr Jenkins. I commend him and his candidacy to all honourable members and I trust that all honourable members will exercise their votes wisely and in his favour.",REPS,<title>DEPUTY SPEAKER</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,14,1
"Grierson, Sharon, MP",ALP,2004-11-16,"—First, let me add my congratulations on your election, Mr Speaker. As each of us is judged by the standards of debate and conduct of the House, I wish you well in encouraging rigorous debate that truly reflects the ideas and ideals of the Australian people. I note from your nominee's comments this morning that you have experienced 13 years in opposition, which is a record we on this side of the House are determined not to match. No doubt your presence in the chair, Mr Speaker, will be a great motivator to us.
I rise to second the nomination of a very fine man for the position of Deputy Speaker—the member for Scullin, Harry Jenkins, who is a colleague of all of us. Mr Speaker, Harry does not hail from your emerging political fiefdom in western Victoria. Instead, he is a true gentleman from the egalitarian heart of North Melbourne. In your acceptance remarks this morning, Mr Speaker, you detailed your family's commitment to public life. Harry Jenkins also embodies that genetic predisposition to serve the public with selfless dedication which we see here often. He proudly followed his father to this place as the member for Scullin and into the Speaker's chair as Deputy Speaker and Second Deputy Speaker. In those capacities Harry has earned our respect, admiration and affection. We know him on both sides of the House as someone who brings dignity, integrity, courtesy and commonsense to this place. He is someone who respects the traditions of this parliament but remains grounded by his firm belief in justice and humanity for all Australians.
In the Speaker's chair, the member for Scullin is always fair. He is capable of firm direction, wise counsel and wry wit. As a committee member he is regarded as constructive and conscientious. As our delegate to or host of international neighbours he is always a fine ambassador for this parliament. It is time for a brave move by this new parliament. It is time to collectively make a bipartisan decision that would see an opposition member elected as Deputy Speaker. That would be a decision that would result in a Speaker and Deputy Speaker combined to truly represent all members of parliament and be truly capable of exhibiting independence in exercising direction over this chamber. Such a decision would demonstrate our willingness to put the Australian people and the activities of the people's House—the House of Representatives—before partisan political agendas. No doubt, it would win the acclaim of the Australian people. I urge every member in this chamber to elect Harry Jenkins, the member for Scullin, as Deputy Speaker of the 41st Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia. 
—In accordance with standing order 11, the bells will be rung and a ballot will be taken. 
The bells having been rung and a ballot having been taken—
—Order! The result of the ballot is: Mr Causley, 82 votes; Mr Jenkins, 60 votes. Mr Causley is elected Deputy Speaker and Mr Jenkins shall be the Second Deputy Speaker.",REPS,<title>DEPUTY SPEAKER</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,14,1
"Howard, John, MP",LP,2004-11-16,"—I would like to congratulate both of the successful candidates. These are good ballots; both people get something out of them. Both get a prize—I know one is a little better than the other. Both of them are widely respected in this parliament. The member for Page is a very distinguished parliamentarian. He is a very fine Deputy Speaker, he has a very good grasp of the standing orders and he is regarded as fair and dispassionate.
The member for Scullin qualifies for precisely the same description. He comes from a distinguished line of those who have been presiding officers. He is regarded as a fair man and somebody who does his best and does it very well when he is in the chair. I simply say to both of them: congratulations. I know you will both do a very good job and we look forward to experiencing your calm, firm, fair and dispassionate rulings.",REPS,<title>DEPUTY SPEAKER</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,14,1
"Latham, Mark, MP",ALP,2004-11-16,"—Mr Speaker, it was interesting when you explained earlier on that your great-grandfather was a Speaker in the South Australian parliament in 1860. You must be very proud of that. On this side of the House, we have a similar pride in Harry Jenkins. His father was a very fine Speaker in this House of Representatives. The current member for Scullin has moved in that tradition. He has been Deputy Speaker for many years and served with great distinction from our time in government to now in opposition. He is well respected and liked around the parliament. He is a real gentleman in his manner in the chair, in his constituency and in the parliamentary building. He has very sound relations with members on both sides of the House.
I also pass on my congratulations to the member for Page, who is a National Party member in the traditional style. On this side of the House he is sometimes known as a colourful character. But we like him and we respect him. We know that he does a good job in the chair, and we look forward to more of that fine service in the future. I am sure between the three of you, Mr Speaker and with your two deputy speakers, you will make a very effective team here in the House, along with members of the Speaker's panel—the very important Speaker's panel that does so much of the work in the quieter times in the House. You yourself, Mr Speaker, have benefited from that apprenticeship. We look forward to and congratulate those who will come forward on the Speaker's panel in due course to join the member for Page and the member for Scullin.",REPS,<title>DEPUTY SPEAKER</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,14,1
"Anderson, John, MP",NATS,2004-11-16,"—I would like to join with the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in congratulating the member for Page. I think that he will be, as indeed he was in the last parliament, an insightful, quick and tough adjudicator of proceedings in this place. I know that he enjoys respect on both sides of the House. I extend to him and his wife, June, who is in the gallery, my congratulations and best wishes. I do the same to the member for Scullin. I acknowledge again that he does indeed stand in a proud tradition. I wish him well and congratulate him too. ",REPS,<title>DEPUTY SPEAKER</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,14,1
"Causley, Ian, MP",NATS,2004-11-16,"—I take this opportunity to thank the parliament for electing me the Deputy Speaker of this parliament. Unlike the member for Scullin I do not have any politics in my background. I grew up on the Clarence River and probably had some schooling in agricultural politics, but that was the only background that I had. I must say, though, that I was very carefully and very quickly instructed in the New South Wales parliament by the then Premier Neville Wran and Speaker Laurie Kelly, so any knowledge I have of the standing orders obviously comes from that direction.
Mr Speaker, I would like to thank members for their cooperation in the past because, as you realise, the Deputy Speaker does have the job, along with the Clerk, of ensuring that the speaking lists are all prepared and that the chair lists are all ready for the operation of the parliament. It is with the cooperation of members that that occurs, and I thank you for that. I am sure that that can happen in the future. As I have often said to members, I do not make the rules; I try to enforce the rules as fairly and as equitably as I possibly can to ensure that all members of this parliament have an equal right to speak and have equal rights of participation. I thank the member for Hinkler and the member for Gilmore for their nomination. I also thank the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and my leader, the Leader of The Nationals, for their congratulations.",REPS,<title>DEPUTY SPEAKER</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,14,1
"Jenkins, Harry, MP",ALP,2004-11-16,"—I thank the House for electing me Second Deputy Speaker of the 41st Parliament. I especially thank my colleagues from the federal caucus for nominating me as their candidate. I thank the Chief Opposition Whip and the member for Newcastle for their words of nomination and seconding. It was a deliberate attempt by me to inveigle the member for Chifley to be involved in this, because he has been a little bit less than charitable on previous occasions when I have run second in these ballots, in saying that perhaps the job has not been done properly. His fingerprints are well and truly on this result! I thank the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Prime Minister for their remarks. I am not often a great devotee of political spin, but through you, Mr Speaker, I say to the Prime Minister that I appreciate being described as the `successful candidate'. My psyche at the moment needs that sort of massaging!
 To you, Mr Speaker, congratulations on your elevation to your office. Obviously you displayed some skill and acumen as a politician yesterday within the ballot that took place in the parliamentary Liberal Party. Also, I know that you are not only a politician but a true parliamentarian. People who have watched you operate in the House on behalf of your constituency and on the issues that you have championed know that. Your respect for the committee system is also something that is very important. Mr Speaker, I look forward to working with you and the honourable member for Page, the Deputy Speaker, who has my congratulations, as a team that can do our best to make sure that this place works properly, that it reflects the hopes and aspirations that all of Australia has for robust debate on issues of national importance.",REPS,<title>DEPUTY SPEAKER</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,14,1
