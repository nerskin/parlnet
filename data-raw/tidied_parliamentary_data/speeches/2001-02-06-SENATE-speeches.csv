"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2001-02-06,"—My question is to Senator Kemp, Acting Minister for Finance and Administration. Why did the government, in deciding to proceed with its IT outsourcing initiative in 1997, ignore the advice of 22 government departments and agencies, all of whom identified serious problems with the government's proposals? Isn't it true that these departments warned the government against the centralised control model of IT outsourcing and disputed the government's claims of $1 billion in cost savings? Haven't these criticisms been vindicated by both the Auditor-General and Mr Humphry? Can the minister explain why it took the government three years to heed the overwhelming advice of its own departments and agencies?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Information Technology: Outsourcing</title>,Questions Without Notice,1,1,question
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2001-02-06,"—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. Can the minister confirm that the views of the many government departments and agencies that had serious reservations about the IT outsourcing initiative have now been vindicated by both the Auditor-General and Mr Humphry? Can the minister therefore confirm that the government will be ignoring the vindictive implication by Mr Fahey that secretaries to departments who fail to proceed with IT outsourcing will have their performance pay cut?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Information Technology: Outsourcing</title>,Questions Without Notice,1,1,question
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2001-02-06,"—Thank you to Senator Lundy for that question. Senator Lundy referred to the Humphry review. I am not sure whether Senator Lundy has in fact read that carefully because the truth of the matter is—
—I do not think you have because the actual review, Senator, was very critical of the Labor Party's approaches in this area.
—Senator Kemp, your remarks should not be directed across the chamber.
—Among other things, and the review said many things, it said:
The Initiative developed from a range of Government policies focusing on information technology outsourcing dating back to the early 1990's. Although various efforts were made to encourage agencies to outsource their IT infrastructure very few outsourced ...
In other words, while the Labor Party was in government, while Senator Lundy's colleagues were in government, they adopted a policy of outsourcing but the fact of the matter is that very few agencies in fact outsourced. He went on to say:
...very few arrangements had been put in place up to the commencement of the Initiative. While there are differing views as to why there was little acceptance of IT outsourcing during the first half of the nineties—
that is during the Labor term of office—
it is widely accepted that agencies' inertia and resistance to change contributed significantly to the delays.
That provides the background for the initiative that the government took. There was a Labor Party policy and yes, from time to time there are Labor Party policies. This policy was in fact failing to deliver and so the government, as Senator Lundy mentioned, announced that it would put into effect new arrangements. Since the original initiative there has been a review and the government is responding to that review. From what Senator Lundy said in relation to savings—that was one of the issues that Senator Lundy raised—one would have thought that in fact there were no savings at all from the outsourcing initiative. That is not true. It is an irrefutable fact that the IT outsourcing contracts let to date have delivered significant savings, Senator Lundy, to Australian taxpayers—by any measure. This was of course referred to in the Humphry review, which noted:
There is broad agreement that ... the Initiative has delivered significant savings ...
That is what the review found, Senator Lundy. This fact was also confirmed in a recent Senate estimates hearings by the Auditor-General, who stated that on the face of ANAO's arithmetic, there have still been significant savings from IT outsourcing.
So the proposition that Senator Lundy puts to the Senate—that there were no savings from IT outsourcing—is in fact quite baseless. I am sorry, Senator Lundy. You do not appear to me to have read the Humphry report with the detail that one would have expected from you. The fact of the matter is that the government has projected, on the basis of methodologies determined in accordance with expert advice and following consultation with agencies—including, I might say, the Department of Finance and Administration and Treasury—that IT outsourcing contracts let to date should save taxpayers around $365 million over five years. That is the advice that I have received. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Information Technology: Outsourcing</title>,Questions Without Notice,1,1,answer
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2001-02-06,"—I regret to say that I do not think Senator Lundy listened carefully to the detail in the response that I gave to her. I explained to her that there was an IT outsourcing policy under Labor and that—surprise, surprise—that policy had failed. I then explained to Senator Lundy the procedures which Mr Fahey put in place to advance IT outsourcing. I then mentioned that there was a review and that the Humphry review confirmed that there were savings from IT outsourcing. The Humphry review also proposed certain changes. The government looks very closely at constructive suggestions, Senator Lundy, unlike the pathetic attempt at political point scoring that we often receive from you. Following the government's response to the recommendations of the Humphry review, agency heads now have responsibility for overseeing their agency's IT outsourcing and maximising the potential benefits from that outsourcing.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2001-02-06,"—On 7 December 2000, Senator Ludwig asked me a question in relation to Civil Aviation Order 48 in my capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, Mr Anderson. Mr Anderson sought advice from the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. The information CASA has provided is relatively extensive, and accordingly I table it for the information of Senator Ludwig and other honourable senators.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Aviation: Safety</title>,Questions Without Notice,2,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2001-02-06,"—by leaveI wish to respond to an order made by the Senate on 4 October last following a notice of motion moved by Senator Cook that, as Minister representing the Treasurer, I table certain documents within 19 sitting days. On 1 December I made a short statement in relation to this order and I indicated that we were working through the documents to see what the government might be able to make available. I mentioned at that time that Senator Murray had written to me on the day that the Senate made the order. He advised that the Democrats supported the motion but believed that no information should be released which affects the strategic pursuit of tax avoidance and tax minimisation, which names individual taxpayers or which would impede or harm the recovery of substantial tax amounts that are due.
The documents in question are internal management and operational working documents of the Australian Taxation Office. It is therefore not possible for me to comply with the Senate request for a number of reasons. The documents are part of the strategic, administration and corporate assurance processes within the ATO and they contribute to internal review and discussion. Governments have never made such working documents public. In the government's view, disclosure of these documents would compromise the ATO's compliance and enforcement strategies and its internal reporting procedures and would therefore be contrary to the public interest. I am advised in relation to two of the review documents sought that the ATO has already made public what it can make public through speeches and other processes.
 As a responsible government we are committed to the democratic principles of transparent and accountable government. It should not be forgotten that the ATO is accountable to the government, to the parliament and to the Australian people. It reports both publicly and to the parliament in the commissioner's annual report, Senate estimates processes and other parliamentary committee processes. It is also subject to audit process by the Australian National Audit Office and to scrutiny by the Commonwealth Ombudsman. 
Within this strong framework of transparency and accountability, it is important to protect the integrity of the internal workings of the ATO to ensure that it can undertake its statutory and administration role. No doubt that is why, historically, it is unusual for the Senate to order production of the internal working documents of an independent agency such as the ATO. That is why the freedom of information processes provide exemptions for internal working documents and for documents concerning the operations of agencies. That is why Senator Murray took the very important step of writing to me to clarify the basis on which he supported Senator Cook's motion. In the government's view, disclosure of the documents sought would affect the tax office's strategic pursuit, and therefore impede or harm the recovery, of a substantial amount of tax. Therefore, I am unable on this occasion to comply with the Senate's request. 
It is worth noting that the approach taken in relation to this issue is consistent with actions taken by previous Labor governments. In June 1992 Senator Gareth Evans, the then Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, spoke of wrestling with the very difficult and sensitive responsibilities he had, on the one hand, to the Senate and to the public interest to disclose as much material as he reasonably could and, on the other hand, to his country and to other individuals and interests that might be prejudiced by unreasonable disclosure. In December 1993, in relation to another matter, Senator Evans spoke about how making a working document public would undermine the proper functioning of government. He highlighted the fact that working documents may be used in the process of reaching a decision but do not govern or dictate the decision. I consider that position to be the most responsible position, and it is consistent with Senator Murray's letter to me of 4 October.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION</title>,<title>Return to Order</title>,Miscellaneous,3,1,speech
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2001-02-06,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the statement.
Madam President, I was out of the chamber at the beginning of the minister's remarks and I was not aware that he was going to choose this moment to make those remarks.
—I spoke to your people.
—The minister interjects across the chamber, out of his place, that he spoke to my people. I accept your word on that, Minister. You may have spoken to my people but I will of course check. What I am saying now is that I was not aware that you were going to make those remarks today and, as a consequence, to some extent I may not be in a position to provide a fulsome reply to what you have said. 
The return to order that this chamber has sought from the government on taxation matters is a serious question. It is not often that a parliament says to a government, `We would like all of the documents about this case because, essentially, it is in the public interest that we pursue these issues and it is in the public interest that all the documents be on the table so that the parliament, and through the parliament the people of Australia, can form its own views about the conduct of'—in this case—`the government on taxation.' I need not say it because it is self-enforcing, but taxation is a fundamental issue that touches all Australians and, as such, all Australians have an interest in it.
My freedom of information request identified 1,910 pages, and they wanted to charge me $19,000 in order to have access to them. So when I sought them directly as a freedom of information request, the information was available at a charge. All I had to do was cough up $19,000 and the information could have become public and the community could have been enlightened. But when through the forms of the parliament the information is sought, it suddenly is not available; it becomes `a working document' and a veil of secrecy is drawn over it, obscuring from the view of the public the contents of essential information about the tax system. The first comment that is obvious here is that there is inconsistency in the conduct of the government. When you make an approach at one level it is available at a price, but if the parliament seeks the information it is available at no price and can never be obtained.
I missed the opening words of the minister's explanation to this chamber, so I am not in a position to respond to all that he has said. However, I will examine the record and see what other excuses he has offered. I was present to hear the concluding paragraphs of what he said, and he referred, inter alia, to remarks by the former Deputy Leader of the Labor Party in the Senate, Senator Gareth Evans, in which Senator Evans expressed his concerns about making available to the public documents which were sought by the parliament but which, in his judgment—reasonably, he thought—might endanger the public interest if they were available. That was the tenor of the remarks of the minister. I may not have it word perfect, but that was certainly the impression he sought to convey.
I make this observation to begin: Senator Evans was, at the relevant time, the foreign minister. The issue that he was contending with was Australia's foreign relations: our relations with countries and interests in the rest of the world. I do not, at this short notice, have an opportunity to check the reference, but I will back it in that the sort of information being sought conceivably could have endangered our national interest and put the security of the realm at risk. Someone as deliberative and as careful as Senator Evans was about the right of the community to know and about freedom of information would have tortured himself to stretch the point if he were in any doubt and would favour the public interest and the right to know if there was an on-balance decision about what should be applied here. But this concerns tax, and it does not concern an individual taxpayer. So it is not possible, from the information we are seeking, to identify an individual and to publicly pry into the privacy of an individual's tax affairs. That is not what we are after. This is about group behaviour and about the behaviour of the government and the tax office. 
We are all taxpayers and the government takes our money and uses it—this government would assert it is in the national interest; I would argue that it has a distorted set of priorities in that it is essentially out of touch with what real Australians think. Nonetheless, the theory is that the government takes the money of individual Australians, aggregates it and spends it in the national interest. A fundamental of taxation and a fundamental right of the individual in surrendering funds to a government as tax is to know that the management of those funds is properly conducted and that the money is spent in a publicly accountable and transparent way. So when we ask for this information, what does the minister say? He says, `I won't tell you.' If he will not tell us, he will not tell the people who are the subject of the taxation.
This is a crazy situation. This is a government out of control. This is the sort of thing you get in banana republics, when governments are contemptuous of the community and of the parliament, when they sit in their ivory towers and say, `We will take your money but we will not tell you what we are doing with it, and we damn well won't be accountable to how we manage it and what the proper affairs are.' The minister has now left the chamber, which is a mild snub to the interests of this issue— but that is the minister we have grown to know, albeit not to clasp to our bosom as someone we necessarily love; nonetheless, due to the forms of this place, we are required to respect him. 
To cite a reference from Senator Evans, as foreign minister, talking about endangering the national interest—knowing that Senator Evans is a well-known person who stood up for the rights of individuals, who pioneered legislation and argued all through his professional life about freedom of association—and to cover up on taxation, seems to me to be, at best, a very long stretch indeed. If I am wrong about that, if I have misrepresented the government, I will have no compunction about apologising to them for that. But it would be consistent with the behaviour of this government and of this minister—and utterly consistent with the behaviour of Senator Evans over many years—for that to be a reasonable observation to make, that there is indeed some effort here to manipulate the bureaucracy and the language of the bureaucracy and to draw a veil over information necessary to the community.
I am disappointed in the actions of the government. As I said, I will go back and read the full text of this and reserve the right to return to it.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2001-02-06,"—by leaveI move:
That the Senate records its deep regret at the death, on 10 December 2000, of James Anthony Mulvihill, a senator for New South Wales from 1965 to 1983, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.
James Anthony Mulvihill, otherwise known as Tony, was born in 1919 at North Ryde, New South Wales. Prior to his career in politics, he served in the New South Wales Railways Department. He was elected Assistant Secretary of the New South Wales Branch of the ALP in 1957 and held this position until 1964. In that year, he was elected a New South Wales senator and held this position from 1 July 1965 until his retirement in 1983. During his career, he chaired the Commonwealth Immigration Advisory Council, the Senate Environment Committee and the Federal Parliamentary Manpower Committee. 
He was the patron of the Australian Native Dog Society, having his own purebred dingo as a pet. He worked tirelessly to improve the public image of the dingo. Tony Mulvihill was also a passionate environmentalist, with campaigns to save the Cape Barren geese, the hairy-nosed wombat and the Leadbeater's possum among his causes. A plaque was erected in his honour after he battled to have the uranium waste disposal in the Alligator Rivers region in the Northern Territory dealt with properly rather than letting it seep into local rivers. He was also instrumental in the erection of a monument in Tumut in 1978 in recognition of lives that were lost in the building of the Snowy Mountains scheme. He showed a keen interest in migrants and became a member of many migrant clubs, including the Italian, Greek and Polish clubs. He was a keen sportsman, playing rugby league in the Eastern Suburbs Rugby League Reserve Grade. He was also patron of the Australian Tug of War Association.
My service crossed Tony's in this place by a couple of years. I remember him as a decent, `old-style' Labor member—always good to deal with, always friendly but with strong beliefs that were the basis of his work in this place. On behalf of the government, I extend to his family and friends our most sincere sympathy in their bereavement.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Mulvihill, Mr James Anthony</title>",Condolences,4,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2001-02-06,"—Let me associate the opposition with this condolence motion. Tony Mulvihill was an only child. He was born in 1919 into a working-class family in North Ryde in Sydney. He left school with an Intermediate Certificate. He never managed to get an apprenticeship, but he was a real goer. He became a railway worker. He worked as a fireman, machinist, boilermaker's assistant and a crane driver. He was elected as chief shop steward at the Chullora railway yards.
After the Second World War, he joined the Australian Labor Party. He was a delegate to the Labor Council of New South Wales, representing the Australian Railways Union. While I never served in parliament with Tony Mulvihill, I knew him for 30 years. He was one of the characters and personalities that you sometimes find in politics—most often, I think, associated with the Labor Party. He was a senator from 1965 to 1983. He served on the opposition front bench for two years after Labor's defeat in the 1975 general election, and he served as spokesman on the environment. I think that was very appropriate because Tony Mulvihill was a conservationist. It is probably true that he was the first real conservationist to sit in this chamber. It is also true that at times in the 1960s he was ridiculed for espousing pro-conservation views. He was a great advocate for the establishment of Kakadu National Park and an advocate for the park's protection from uranium waste. He argued the case for the protection of the dingo. As we have heard, he was the patron of the wild dog association. He stridently defended the good name of the dingo to all and sundry. He argued to protect the Cape Barren goose, the hairy-nosed wombat, the Leadbeater's possum and the red kangaroo. In fact, he earned the nickname `the red kangaroo' after campaigning for the protection of that animal when he became concerned about its possible extinction.
I recall that that nickname caused an amazing fracas in the Labor Party back in April 1977 in Sydney. A throwaway newspaper, called City Extra, which was circulating in the inner city of Sydney, libelled Tony on the front page in its first and only issue, as I recall. It was an extraordinary article that said, `To hell with the unemployed.' It claimed that state ALP leaders had ruthlessly adopted a policy calling for a return to large-scale migration of more than 100,000 per year. The article attacked Tony and was quite famous in the Labor Party at the time. People were trying to scrounge copies of this throwaway newspaper. As you can see, I successfully scrounged a copy of it. The journalist, if you can call him that, said:
City Extra rang Senator Mulvihill to get his side of the story. He said, `Anything you've got to say, you talk to the officers,' and slammed the phone down. We don't know whether he means police officers or what.
Of course, I know what he meant—he meant the party officers in New South Wales. Tony was saying, `Anything you've got to say about the New South Wales state ALP leaders, refer it to the party officers,' as you would. This became famous because there was a photograph of Tony on the front page of the City Extra with the caption—this comes back to the issue of the red kangaroo—`Senator Mulvihill, known as the “red kangaroo” in political circles for his erratic, communistic behaviour.' As I said, Tony was libelled on the front page of the newspaper. Sadly for Tony, when he took this libel case—which he won, of course—he found that the publisher of the City Extra was a bankrupt, so it was a little bit of a Pyrrhic victory, we would have to say.
It is also true to say, and should be recorded in this condolence debate, that Tony Mulvihill championed the cause of ethnic minorities from his time in the Chullora railway workshops. His work with the Yugoslav community, particularly in Sydney, was very well known, but he was highly regarded in many ethnic communities in the state of New South Wales and beyond the borders of New South Wales. He chaired the Commonwealth Immigration Advisory Council. 
I think it is important in a debate like this to also record that Tony Mulvihill was a significant figure in the New South Wales Labor Party in the fifties, the sixties and the seventies. After the split in the mid-1950s, Tony served on the caretaker executive. He was unanimously elected assistant general secretary after Jack Kane was sacked. I think his clashes with Jack Kane in that period were legendary, but it was quite some effort to achieve that office in that way at that time. Along with figures such as Fred Campbell, Bill Colbourne and Charlie Oliver, Tony Mulvihill was a very significant machine figure and did a lot to ensure that the New South Wales Labor Party remained united and to ensure the stability of the New South Wales Labor government. 
John Armitage, who was a close friend of Tony's and a former federal member for Chifley in the House of Representatives, told me some time ago that soon after Tony became assistant general secretary three irate wharfies were menacing the then General Secretary, Bill Colbourne, in room 32 in the Sydney trades hall. Tony's reaction was probably a bit typical: he jumped the counter, grabbed one of the wharfies by the throat and shouted, `Don't you touch my mate!' Times were tough back then and, according to John, this was a very significant incident because it really did a lot to cement the relationship between Tony Mulvihill and Bill Colbourne, which, as I said, made a very significant difference to the unity of the Labor Party in those difficult times. 
Tony Mulvihill fought out his struggles in the Labor Party full bore, as he did with political challenges in this chamber and in the broader community. I remember Tony Mulvihill appearing before an ALP disputes committee in the mid-1970s. I was a member of the disputes committee at that time. Tony laid an internal party charge against an opponent in the Lowe federal electorate council of the ALP. That charge was one of bringing the Labor Party into disrepute. You might wonder what that was.
—Senator Forshaw was also a member of that committee at the time, and Senator Forshaw would recall that the `chargee' was accused by Tony of being discovered—how shall I describe this—in flagrante delicto under a table at the local RSL club. 
—This was in an RSL club, Senator Boswell; it was not at a Labor Party meeting. Tony's submission to the committee was that you could not be expected to win the marginal seat of Lowe if your party members behaved so inappropriately in an RSL club. He won the dispute. 
—It was unanimous, I think.
—I do not think it was unanimous, Senator Forshaw. I recall the hearing. Tony was provoked by members of the committee, like me, and some of the witnesses. 
—How did you vote?
—Against him. I cannot remember all of the details now, Senator Hill, but I do remember that it was one of the funniest experiences of my life. Tony was a key stalwart in later years for the Labor Party in the Lowe federal electorate. He engaged in the many tight campaigns that were held in that seat over the decades. He was a tough, tough fighter for the Labor Party. I cannot say that Tony did not hold grudges, because he did hold the odd grudge. In fact, there was one memorable Senate speech when he made it absolutely clear that he was in the business of settling scores. If anyone has not seen Tony's speech of 14 December 1982, page 3492 of Hansard, I commend the speech as a good read. Let me quote a little of it. It reads:
I take the Senate back to my first dealings with—
a family—
who lived in Concord. My story has a small beginning. It began on a Sunday morning. I had a fox terrier dog named Jeff. I know that people such as Senator Douglas McClelland who is a dog lover will appreciate this aspect. I went along to my place of worship. The three—
unnamed, in my contribution—
boys were in the churchyard. They were always vicious. They took umbrage because my dog followed me into the church. Whatever denomination people are, I do not believe it was the end of the world because that inoffensive dog wanted to follow me into the church.
According to Tony, one individual was:
the greatest degenerate of any member of the trade union movement in New South Wales—
and he—
laid my dog out with a brick. I picked up a piece of three by two in order to even things up because there were three—
of them—
and only myself. It was unfortunate that, with the dog lying in a pool of blood, the father of the boys, who was a policeman, threatened to arrest me. Of course, there was only one victor and it was not me. I carried the dog the half mile to my home. I said to my mother: `One day I will even that up'. 
He did that on 14 December 1982. It is a great read and I commend it to you. He does say in his speech that the facts are sordid, but he completes his speech with these words:
I conclude by saying that I have kept faith. My dog's honour has been cleared. I say to the ... family: I do not know what part of Sydney you live in now; but I have squared the account tonight.
And he did, I can assure you.
Tony Mulvihill was a very colourful character. I actually think it is fair to say in the nicest possible way that he was an eccentric. It is important to remember at times like this what an important figure in the Labor Party and the labour movement Tony Mulvihill was, particularly after the split in the mid-1950s. I will not just remember the odd vitriolic speech he made about those of us on the Left of the Labor Party at the New South Wales administrative committee or the annual conference—one or two barbs over the years were directed in my general direction. I will remember a champion of the underdog, someone I really did come to realise was a person of great courage, a great Labor loyalist and a real personality.
Tony suffered a long illness before his death, but as you would expect he was a fighter to the end. To Tony's family, particularly to Pam and to his friends, on behalf of the Labor Party we offer our sincere condolences.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Mulvihill, Mr James Anthony</title>",Condolences,4,1,speech
"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,2001-02-06,"—On behalf of the Democrats I would also like to offer our condolences to the family and the many friends of former Senator Tony Mulvihill. I was working in the Old Parliament House from 1978 till the time we moved up here. I well remember Tony Mulvihill popping into former Senator Colin Mason's office—I used to work for Colin—to mostly discuss environmental campaigns. I would like to mention a couple of those. A few of them have been mentioned already by Senator Hill and Senator Faulkner but there are many things I would like to add. Way back before it was fashionable Tony Mulvihill played a key role in most of the early environmental battles fought in Australia. The one I remember most was the campaign to have Kakadu declared a national park. He was absolutely passionate about it and absolutely determined that Kakadu would be declared a national park, and of course it eventually was. He campaigned to prevent the alienation of public lands. That is something he kept campaigning on after he left parliament. There was never an end to that one.
He was Labor's shadow minister for the environment for two years—in 1976 and 1977. He consistently raised matters relating to the conservation of our endangered species. This was much to the derision of many of his colleagues and many media representatives. He really was a visionary with regard to environmental protection in Australia. The issues he campaigned on then are of course mainstream now, and it is a credit to him that he persisted with those efforts. I remember a survey some years back—I think it was a contingent value method survey—that showed that Australians would have been prepared to dip into their own pockets and fork out something like $25 each to buy and therefore save Kakadu had it not been declared a national park. Clearly, Tony Mulvihill understood very early the deep and abiding sense of care that most Australians feel towards our wilderness areas, forests and threatened species. He was determined to have that recognised by the parliament even though he was ridiculed—Senator Faulkner was right in that. It was not a popular thing to do in those early years, but he was absolutely determined and he was absolutely right. Senator Mulvihill campaigned for the protection of Cape Barren geese, the booby population on Christmas Island, kangaroos and, as we have heard, the dingo.
Because it is such a famous speech and everybody remembers it I was going to remind senators of the 14 December 1982 speech that Senator Faulkner has just mentioned. Senator Faulkner did it much better than I would, so I would just like to recommend that speech to people as well. If you have not noted that, it is on page 3492 of the Senate Hansard of 1982. It was an absolute ripper of a speech. Never forgive and never forget was something that really did apply to Tony Mulvihill. It probably does not apply too much to many Labor Party people now, but it sure applied to Tony and he well and truly got back. 
When I heard that Tony had died I was also reminded of the time when he was quite upset with a witness to a committee. That time was popularly referred to around Parliament House as the time Tony Mulvihill tried to table the witness. I do not know what happened to that witness and I hate to think where he ended up.
There are two things I most remember Tony Mulvihill for. Firstly, for being a campaigner for the environment and threatened species. It is a substantial gift to give to Australia. The fact that Kakadu was declared a national park was largely as a result of what he did and he should always be remembered for that. Secondly, I remember him as a larger than life character whom I know Colin was always happy to see when he popped into the office to have a cup of tea and talk about environmental things. He was also larger than life in the things that Senator Faulkner has told us about—his speech about Jeff the fox terrier—and in his tabling of a witness. They were not the only things he did around here that will never be forgotten. He should never be forgotten because of what he did for the environment and how he persisted through ridicule and everything else. He knew he was right, he was right and he persisted. In the end we have all come to agree with everything he thought back in the 1960s and 1970s.

"Boswell, Sen Ron",NP,2001-02-06,"—I too would like to associate my National Party colleagues with the condolence motion moved by Senator Hill and the government and to make just a few remarks. Senator Mulvihill left parliament in 1983. I was one of the few people that came in in 1983, so I never had the good fortune to meet Senator Mulvihill, but in my days as a travelling salesman and representative before I came into the Senate I used to listen to the parliamentary debates as I drove around from town to town, and Tony Mulvihill was a very consistent contributor to those debates. I used to listen to him in those days, and in fact I can remember that particular speech that Senator Faulkner referred to—I remember either listening to it or reading about it.
No doubt, Tony Mulvihill was a great ALP stalwart and character, and political parties rely on those characters to go into history. They become a part of the fabric of the political party, and I think it does us all good to have those types of people that we can refer to in the various political parties. He was a great contributor to the ALP in some of those years which must have been pretty hard. In 1974 and 1975, when the Labor Party had a serious loss of members, he no doubt played his role in their reconstruction. I convey to his family our condolences for their loss.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Mulvihill, Mr James Anthony</title>",Condolences,4,1,speech
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2001-02-06,"—I also rise to make some brief comments about the sad passing of former Senator Tony Mulvihill. I of course, like other senators from the Labor Party, particularly in New South Wales, knew Tony Mulvihill essentially through his role in the New South Wales Labor Party. Listening to Senator Faulkner's speech earlier reminded me that Tony obviously taught many of us that invaluable lesson—`never forget!'  Senator Faulkner's remarks about those cases before the disputes committee, which I also served on, came back to me very quickly. Tony was certainly a person who, when he put his energies into something, really did it in a very full and forceful manner, as he did on that occasion.
Whilst as a young member of the Labor Party I knew Tony Mulvihill and watched him get into stoushes at state conferences, I came to know him better after I was appointed to the Senate in 1994. He used to drop into my office in Phillip Street to have a chat and a cup of tea or coffee. He was particularly fond of doing that because my secretary at that time was a woman called Marion Grace, whom I am sure many senators will remember. Marion had worked for many Labor politicians, starting out with Dan Curtin, then working for people like Les Johnson and Tony Mulvihill, and then subsequently Senator Richardson. When I replaced Graham Richardson, Marion worked for me. I have to say that it was a great pleasure for me to be able to sit and listen to Tony chat with Marion about old times and also to hear his advice and his counsel about political issues. He was also quite renowned for sending scraps of newspaper articles, whether they be from current newspapers or previous newspapers, to me and other Labor MPs on a regular basis with his views on the issues of the day or on aspects of Labor history that were of importance to him.
As has also been referred to, Tony was an active Labor Party figure not just in the New South Wales ALP office and as a senator but also particularly in the Lowe electorate. My wife's grandparents, Michael and May Purcell, who are both deceased now, were great stalwarts of the Labor Party and of the Concord community, which is in Lowe. Tony was a great friend of their family. My wife tells me that, when they were kids visiting their grandparents' place, Tony often dropped in and would go and buy all the children an ice cream, and of course they thought that was a great thrill.
Over more recent years, I came to know Tony a lot better and had a bit more to do with him. He quite regularly contacted my office and Marion, in particular, to pursue some matter in the immigration area, which he was so involved in and did so much work for members of ethnic communities, even after he left the parliament. He also did of course have those other interests that have been referred to as eccentricities.
I remember one of the first occasions that he came up to me after I was appointed to the Senate was at a New South Wales ALP annual conference. He said, `I've got to talk to you,' and he grabbed me and took me outside to a Johnno's coffee shop where he proceeded to tell me that he was the patron of the Australian Women's Tug of War Association and that they needed some money. I said, `You have heard of the sports grants?' and that I did not think that that was possible but I would see what I could do. There was Tony enthusiastically supporting the need for more money and support for the Australian Women's Tug of War Association.
It is a sad loss. Tony was one of those great characters, one of those great figures, of the Australian Labor Party, and that makes his passing one that we all feel deeply. I know that we will all remember him as having made a great contribution to this parliament, to our party, to the Australian nation and to the Australian character.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Mulvihill, Mr James Anthony</title>",Condolences,4,1,speech
"West, Sen Sue",ALP,2001-02-06,"—I too would like to associate myself with this condolence motion in respect of Tony. I remember him. I have been a member of the party for 26 years so I remember Tony for that length of time. He was never one to care about fashion. Tony was a fighter and a supporter of the underdog, the underprivileged, the minority and those groups that were discriminated against. He was somebody who remembered everything. He never forgot—he always repaid his debts as he saw them, a la Senator Faulkner's reading of his final speech to this place.
He had another love and that was of women's athletics, particularly women's field events in the throwing area, the discus and the shot putt.
—Gael Martin.
—Gael Martin—that is right. Gael Mulvihill as she originally was; Gael Martin as she later was. He fought very hard for women's sport to get the media coverage that it deserved, did not get, and still does not get, although it certainly has improved. He had a commitment to following the careers of those women in sports which were not the glamour events. He was interested in them and loved to support them. I will always remember him at annual conferences. My late father was an athletics coach, so Tony would feel compelled at each annual conference to come up and give my father and me, if I was around, the latest information on what was happening or, more to the point, what was not happening as far as the appropriate recognition for women's field events was concerned.
He was someone who had an absolute commitment to the ALP, its philosophies and its ideologies. He was loyal to the party at all times. He was usually loyal to the Right faction when I knew him but on occasions he did some things that put you at a disadvantage. I will never forget being proxied in my first national conference—back when we had six delegates from each state or something small—for my first session. I had been given strict riding instructions—as he was the senior person from our side there I was to go with him but always go with the committee. He was on this particular committee but Tony stands up and moves an amendment on which there has to be a vote. My colleague and I, who were both first timers, were saying, `What do we do, Tony?' He said, `You do what you want to do!' The chair was having a great deal of amusement at this and Graham Richardson came flying back into the chamber saying, `What the expletive is going on here?' and we were saying, `What do we do?' So Tony certainly was an eccentric—somebody who would do his own thing and let you do your own thing too. He was somebody who, as I say, had an absolute commitment to the Labor Party and who was always ready to give you information and advice and to remind you of the ancient history of the party. I express my condolences to Pam and the family and to his friends.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Mulvihill, Mr James Anthony</title>",Condolences,4,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-02-06,"—On behalf of the Greens, I would like to support the motion and also express condolences on the passing of former Senator Tony Mulvihill. I did but know him in passing and was grateful for his parliamentary support for the saving of the Franklin River back at the end of his career and before my career in this place. I have noted his prodigious support of particularly wildlife at a time when it was not fashionable and I concur with Senator Faulkner that he was somewhat of an elder figure or early starter in being a parliamentary representative of the rapidly growing concern for the environment, in particular wildlife, that has been shown by the Australian nation as a whole. Other members have mentioned his particular support for the causes of the dingoes, wombats, seals on the other side of the world in Ireland, Leadbeater possums in Victoria and Cape Barren geese. I think we should recollect that just two decades ago Cape Barren geese were on the verge of extinction—they were down to a couple of hundred. Now they are on menus of certain dining places and they are found from South Australia through to the south-east island outposts of Tasmania—and in great numbers. That did not just happen. It happened because people like Senator Mulvihill spoke up for them at a time when they were indeed facing extinction and needed some breathing space and land in which to be safe and secure and to recover from the brink of extinction.
I note also from 1982 Hansard, but this time from 18 February, a little of what Senator Mulvihill had to say at the time and I want to put that back on the record:
Every time I play a game of golf at Massey Park on Exile Bay in my own area, I see the pelicans gliding into the river. I think it was a Senate committee that exposed not only the damage that the Australian Gas Light Co. was doing to that river—
he is talking about the Parramatta River here—
but also the fact that State government authorities in New South Wales were not talking to each other. As a result of our vigilance, the river pollution was reduced to an absolute minimum. Pelicans have now come back to the Parramatta River. These are vivid illustrations. I know that Senator Missen—
and we will remember Senator Missen also as a very great advocate on the other side of this chamber for the environment—
is on my side 100 per cent on these matters. I am not utopian. I know that in my own State there are occasions when one has to say to the present government: `You will not get all you want for the border ranges national park but you will get something'. The powerful Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment went to Senator Missen's State several times to the forests—
that is to Victoria. He went on:
Three years before the Victorian State authorities had given evidence about the Leadbeater possum and forest enclaves of old gums. We were told: `Yes, it will be all right'. Two years later we knew that it was not all right. Senator Melzer, a very active senator from Victoria, and I went back to this area on a sub-committee and the authorities admitted that they had been a bit sluggish. I do not know that the Victorian sawmillers are affected simply because of a few forest enclaves—
He is referring to the protection of them. Then he had this to say—and I think it is very important, because he equated conservation movements with unions:
I join with all my colleagues in this place in defence of the cause of conservation by saying that as in everything else there have to be restraints at times. Perhaps I can use a better analogy. Some people—fortunately there are few of them—want to emasculate completely the trade union movement. If that happened I know what would happen to industrial safety conditions for example. The same situation applies to conservation groups. If we did not have them we would not have had the achievements we have seen.
I think that is a voice we could well do with back here in the Senate. On occasions, I wish he were here with us again. His record stands for itself. It is a very positive one as far as the environment is concerned. In that respect, he is somebody whom we miss.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Mulvihill, Mr James Anthony</title>",Condolences,4,1,speech
"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2001-02-06,"—I rise also to speak on the condolence motion for Senator Tony Mulvihill. Last Friday the New South Wales administrative committee of the Labor Party met, and we also made a similar resolution. There were a number of men there who recalled fondly—and some not so fondly—Tony's contribution to the labour movement and the Labor Party. To follow on from what Senator Brown said, I think I should put it on the record that Tony Mulvihill was a very proud trade unionist. He was chief shop steward at the railway goods yard out at Chullora and he was also a delegate to the labour council.
One of the defining periods in his political life, other than his period of environmental concerns, was well documented in a famous book about the Labor Party entitled The Split by Robert Murray. A number of activists in the Labor Party in New South Wales were concerned about the direction of the party—not only in New South Wales but nationally—and that led to a great split in our party. At the time, Tony Mulvihill was involved in a group which became known as the combined branches and unions steering committee. When I joined the Labor Party in 1971, that was the name of the left-wing group in New South Wales. That subsequently changed, and now I think it is called the socialist left. But Tony and another famous labour activist, Kath Anderson, were very much involved in the original steering committee. I think Senator Faulkner men-tioned that a dispute that Tony Mulvihill intervened in between three wharfies and BillColbourne may have started him on the right course. I do not know.
A number of people who I have spoken to, or members of my staff have spoken to, have given me some interesting anecdotes about Tony. I remember, as president of the party, sometimes having to try to escape around Sussex Street and Goulburn Street. Tony, in his later years, would be prosecuting or persecuting someone for something they had done in a branch somewhere or whatever else, and he would stake out the coffee shop across the road just to see whether you would come out. He would give you a bit of advice on how we were running the party or where we were taking things. But he was, as has been said, a very aggressive man when it came to causes that he was championing or people he was after. I think Senator Ray may recall that in his last speech to parliament he did make it a point to square up. I suppose that was the period of the Irish Catholics within the labour movement, who were never forgotten and never forgiven either.
Tony was not a flashy dresser, as I think most of us recall. That was not what motivated him. What motivated him was his commitments, whether it was his trade union, the environment or, as has been said, migrants generally and Yugoslav migrants in particular. His colleagues included Johnno Johnson, who is a member of the New South Wales upper house; Garry McIlwaine, who used to be a member of parliament in New South Wales; and Michael Maher. I know they fondly recall their association with Tony Mulvihill and miss him.
I was advised today that Tony Mulvihill was famous for sending out Mulvigrams. This is what I have been told. Whenever someone or something came up which he did not like, Tony would persecute the Labor minister responsible with a telegram—or what became known as a Mulvigram. If he was not given a response within three days, he would Mulvigram anybody and everybody to let the entire labour movement know of his displeasure. If any material in one of his many Mulvigrams had the potential to be defamatory, he would ask his lawyer for advice and then he would send the Mulvigram.
There is an excellent obituary piece in the Sydney Morning Herald of Tuesday, 19 December last year written by Cynthia Banham. She says at the end—and I think it is appropriate to quote this:
When he was 47, Mulvihill married Pamela O'Connell. They later divorced, having had no children, but remained close friends. For most of his life he lived in Concord but when his health deteriorated 18 months ago, Pamela, who lived in Wentworth Falls, found him a place in a Katoomba nursing home so she could visit him.
I think that should be noted and appreciated. We have talked today about the passing of a unique Australian and, for us in the Labor Party and the labour movement, one of our great loyalists and one of our great standard-bearers.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Mulvihill, Mr James Anthony</title>",Condolences,4,1,speech
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2001-02-06,"—I served in the Senate with Tony Mulvihill for only three years. Very early in my career, he gave me some good advice. He said, `Son, never flash outside the off stump.' It was only a couple of weeks later that I realised Tony never followed this advice himself, as in the case of the saying `Those who cannot do, teach'. I do not think it has been noted particularly today that he had a remarkable recall of political events. It was absolutely outstanding. I do not know if anyone ever sought out Tony Mulvihill for oral history, but I was browsing in the library in about 1982 and I came across the book on the minutes of the New South Wales special conference in 1957. This was after the Labor split. Just to kill a bit of time, I read through it.
I found where Tony Mulvihill voted against the incumbent faction. I thought that this was a good piece of information to have, so I fronted Tony and asked, `Why did you vote in 1957 against the incumbent group in New South Wales?' Thirty minutes later, I had had a complete description of the circumstances of that vote and what led to that vote. Most of us have trouble remembering what we were involved in five years ago in politics. He had a remarkable memory of his own involvement. Not only that, he had a remarkable memory for the history of this parliament. I know of a good trivia question which virtually no-one can get. There has been only one case in this parliament of a father entering the parliament, having had his son serve here for nine years beforehand and then die. I used to trick a lot of people with this question—Bill Hayden and a lot of others. I asked Tony Mulvihill this question one day and he named the two members, Baker, the seats they held and the years they held them. He had an incredible knowledge of the history of this parliament.
It has been mentioned that Tony Mulvihill was a patron of many causes. Some have been mentioned, but tug of war was one of his great loves. I still have in my Canberra rented residence a tug of war medal that he sent me for some battle I fought in the Labor Party. He decided to reward me by sending me a tug of war medal. He was very pleased that tug of war was once an Olympic sport and was totally confounded by the fact that it was no longer an Olympic sport.
Tony Mulvihill was a deputy chair in this chamber. I remember watching television one night in the old house. The one thing Tony Mulvihill never ever learnt was that there is a little button that turns off the sound when you are in the chair. He had been in the chair for an hour, the relief chairman came and Tony said: `Thank God you're here. I'm dying for a ...' I delete the expletive. That went right through the building but, fortunately, we were not live to air anywhere else. I had some regret when Tony left, because he definitely had the worst set of ties of any senator. It was sometimes possible to tell where he had browsed that day for lunch. He had these horrible ties. It put a lot of pressure on me and on Senator Boswell when he left—as in which one of us could front with the worst tie. We have been well overtaken now, fortunately, by new recruits to the chamber.
Once Tony left this place, he missed it. The former member for Lowe Michael Maher very kindly involved him in his office. Tony would come in for a day and a half and do constituency work for Michael. These may seem very generous acts of both Tony and Michael, but it actually doubled Michael Maher's workload. Michael would sit in his office and Tony would be in the office next door, so Michael could hear what was happening. I will give an example of what used to happen: a constituent came in with an inquiry and saw Tony, and all Michael could hear was Tony saying: `You're nothing more than a whingeing Pom. Christ, it was only 10 quid to get out here. That was the worst money we ever spent.' This is in a marginal seat on a knife edge. Then Michael had to go and reinterview all these constituents and try to bring them back across. Nevertheless, Tony did miss this place and he did do that constituency work.
The worst message you could ever get from Tony Mulvihill in one of the Mulvigrams was that he had admonished someone, because you never knew whether it meant he had written them an abusive letter, made an abusive phone call or gone the knuckle on them. He was a complex individual. He was volatile, litigious and, as Senator Hutchins mentioned, sometimes overly aggressive. Some of those qualities we would not admire in a person, but it all came together to make a very good individual. Whatever his faults were, when you put the package together you found a caring individual who lived life to the full, who was passionate about causes and who really loved political life—the interchange and the sociability of it all. As Senator Faulkner said, despite all the eccentricity, it should never be forgotten that Tony Mulvihill was a serious player. We tend to remember the eccentricity and not the seriousness. I am glad that today Senator Faulkner and others have put on the record that he was also a very serious political player. I offer my condolences to the family.

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2001-02-06,"—Before I address the urgency motion, let me do an unusual thing and seek leave to amend the motion. In discussions with Senator Lyn Allison of the Australian Democrats, I would like to amend the motion to now read:
The failure of the Howard Government to implement energy and transport policies which would significantly reduce Australia's dependence on petroleum products and to honour its promise that the GST would not push up the price of petrol which has resulted in the Government collecting a fuel tax windfall from the pockets of struggling Australian motorists.
Leave not granted.
—I therefore move: 
That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:
The failure of the Howard Government to honour its promise that the GST would not push up the price of petrol which has resulted in the Government collecting a fuel tax windfall from the pockets of struggling Australian motorists.
I note that leave has not been granted to amend my motion, and I am sure the Australian Democrats will be suitably offended.
—But you are happier.
—No, I am not happier. If you listen to the terms of the proposed amendment, it was not inconsistent with the motion at all. But this does betray the defensiveness of the Liberal and National parties. They do not want to risk this chamber having the opportunity to carry a motion of urgency by a majority.
—I rise on a point of order. Senator Cook has just changed his urgency motion. I have not got a copy of the motion; nobody has a copy of the motion. At least he should give us—
 (Senator Hogg)—There is no point of order. It has not been changed. You refused leave.
—I have refused leave, but obviously Senator Cook has the numbers. I would like to know what we are going to debate in the next 15 minutes.
—Senator Boswell, if you refused leave, the motion has not been amended. As I understand it, Senator Cook is now arguing the original motion that was circulated in the chamber, and there is no amendment there.
—Very good, that is exactly what he should be doing.
—Thank you for your advice, Senator Boswell!
—Thank you, Senator Boswell, for making it emphatic that the National Party do not want this chamber to carry a resolution which condemns the government of Australia for taking a windfall gain of tax out of the pockets of Australian motorists and hurting country Australians, and particularly farmers, more than anyone else. The National Party, which is supposed to be the late, great party defending the interests of rural Australians, is now stopping this debate from proceeding to a majority. Well, cold comfort, because back in the community, where you are answerable to your constituency, we will make it plain that National Party voters should be Labor Party voters at the next election if they want justice on fuel prices. Despite the fact that the National Farmers Federation has commended and supported the Labor Party in trying to block the 1 February indexation of fuel prices, the National Party, against the interests of its rural and farming constituency, supports higher prices for petrol in the bush. That issue is now beyond dispute, and I will refer back to this part of Hansard to prove what I have said to your rural constituents, Senator Boswell, at the necessary time. 
On 16 October last year—nearly four months ago—I put on notice 36 questions to the Minister representing the Treasurer in this place. If those 36 questions were answered, it would enable me, any other senator and, most importantly, any other Australian to work out how much extra tax the government has collected from Australians because of higher petrol prices. For almost four months those questions have sat on the Notice Paper waiting for an answer, and over that time the government has not deemed it fit to reply. This is a government that waves around its charter of budget honesty. `Let's get the facts out on the table about election promises,' it says. It is a government which is gutless and unable to tell the electors of Australia how much tax they are paying because of higher petrol prices.
—They are hiding it.
—They are hiding it; it is indeed a cover-up, Senator Sherry. We think Australians are entitled to know how much tax, and how much extra tax, the government has collected. In the absence of any official forecast, let me turn to what the Australian Automobile Association says the windfall is; that is, the amount of tax collected beyond what was predicted in the current budget. The Australian Automobile Association, which represents automobile associations in the states—the NRMA in New South Wales, the RACV in Victoria, the RACQ in Queensland, the RAA in South Australia, the RAC in Western Australia, and the automobile associations in Tasmania—estimates that the government has put its hand through the petrol bowser and into the pocket of Australian motorists to the tune of $1.34 billion a year. That, they say, is their best estimate of the windfall.
On 1 February this year, this government allowed an indexation of excise on petroleum to go ahead—an indexation valued at 1.56c per litre but, when you add the GST, in reality it is 1.72c per litre or $500 million extra tax payable by Australian motorists through the bowser per year. When you cite it as a litre amount, as the Prime Minister does, it does not sound so great, but when you cite it as a revenue haul to the government—half a billion dollars—it is a significant slug to Australian taxpayers. The government wants to pass it on; we want to stop it, and a few minutes ago I announced that tomorrow, in accordance with the standing orders, I will introduce a bill to do so. Those on the other side of this chamber who affect concern for Australian small business, which is struggling under a bleak outlook for the economy, the threat of recession, the BAS, and the cost weight of higher prices, will have a chance to provide relief for them. And those on the other side of this chamber who affect any concern for Australian families—who are running the kids to and from school, using the family car to go to and from work, and taking the annual motoring holiday in Australia—and for elderly Australians who are reliant on services delivered to their home because they are too frail to go out to hospital or other services, know that the costs of higher petroleum permeate the household budgets of all Australians and push them higher. 
Those on the other side of this chamber who affect concern for country Australians should heed the words of the National Farmers Federation, which supports our bill. They should heed those words, because the GST is a percentage tax and prices in the country are higher than prices in the city. By the application of that tax, country Australians pay more tax than city Australians, and the gap is widening and worsening for country Australians. Those on the other side of the chamber who affect concern for the bush and for regional Australia are the ones who are taxing them more. The GST, applied to petrol, is a tax on distance. Country Australians fill up their tanks more often, travel further, do not have resort to public transport, and pay more taxes on their petrol as a consequence. What did Mr Howard say? Mr Howard, hand on heart in a scripted speech—not ad lib—with forethought and consideration, said, `The GST will not put up petrol prices.' Is that a promise he has kept? It is not, and one of the reasons why the government is now running scared in the regions is that country Australians know that petrol prices are higher under the GST than they were before and that the GST is to blame.
One of the other elements of the GST that is part of this hidden tax, and another reason why the bill I will introduce will kill the tax is this: from 1 July last year, the GST applied in Australia. On 1 February this year, the amount of excise the government charges motorists at the pump as its partake of petrol taxes rose by the amount of the CPI increase from 1 July last year to 31 December last year. So, for that six-month period, the GST price hike—the GST spike to inflation—is embedded in that CPI increase which applies on 1 February to petrol taxes, thereby starting an upward spiral of inflation based on the GST's impact on prices.
Last November in this chamber I moved that we set up an inquiry into petrol prices in Australia, and the Liberal and National parties, with the Democrats, voted it down. As a consequence, the Labor Party held their own inquiry. We have not completed it yet, but so far we have been to 34 centres around Australia and heard evidence from 180 different witnesses, many of whom could be described as heartland National Party and heartland Liberal Party voters. Having been exposed to that body of public opinion, I can tell you with some authority that the people of Australia—and particularly people in the bush—are hurting because of higher petrol prices. They do not regard the roads program as a substitute. The roads program is not a substitute.
The roads program is costed at $1.6 billion over four years. The amount of windfall gain, according to the Automobile Association, is $1.34 billion per year. If the roads program accurately handed back the windfall gain, the roads program would be worth in excess of $5 billion, not $1.6 billion. The mistake Mr Howard has made is to believe that $1.6 billion compensates for something that costs more than $5 billion. It does not. The people of Australia want lower petrol prices and a decent roads program. That is what the NFF says. That is what the Labor Party say. In 34 locations around Australia, that is what 180 witnesses have said to our inquiry as well. If you in government do not heed that voice, then at the ballot box you in government will become you in opposition. You are out of touch now. You have forgotten your base and you are punishing them with higher taxes.

"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,2001-02-06,"—Is it any wonder that we have seen this unconvincing little performance from Senator Cook? It is unconvincing in many ways. The fact remains that Senator Cook believes in indexation of fuel excise. After all, his party introduced it. His party said that we would have half-yearly CPI indexation of fuel excise. As a matter of fact, his party introduced fuel excise, so they are not only responsible for the introduction of fuel excise but also responsible for the twice-yearly indexation. It was their policy, and the current government is only continuing a policy that was the Labor Party's policy for 13 years. Not only that, Senator Cook is also strongly in favour of the GST, because when his leader was asked whether he would take the GST off—
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. My point of order, with the greatest respect to all of the senators in this chamber, is that I want to save the senator on the floor from unconsciously misrepresenting himself. He has said that I am strongly in favour of the GST. I have consistently voted in this chamber against the GST, and I authored a report condemning the GST. That is the record.
 (Senator Chapman)—There is no point of order.
—If you are not in favour of a GST, when you introduce your bill tomorrow perhaps you could include a proposition to remove the GST totally from petrol. Perhaps you could give us that guarantee tomorrow morning. If you are so opposed to a GST, bring in a bill tomorrow morning that says you will remove the GST from petrol so the people you are so anxious to protect in the long term—if ever you got into government again—would be protected from a GST on fuel. But you will not do that, because your leader has said he will not take away the GST on fuel and he will not do away with indexation on fuel excise—and of course he will not do away with fuel excise. He had plenty of opportunities when he was interviewed by Neil Mitchell only yesterday.
—What an interview!
—What an interview. I tried very hard to read the interview, but it was almost impossible to read because of some of the language. When asked whether he would take the GST off petrol, Mr Beazley said, `I don't think we would give that contemplation.' I am still trying to work out exactly what Mr Beazley meant. The Labor Party are in a state of complete confusion when it comes to the issue of petrol taxation. They have no idea what they want to do. All they are trying to do is to get some cheap political capital from trying to freeze a one-off indexation which protects their fuel excise—which they introduced in the first place and which was not part of Liberal Party policy. They put in place a policy of twice-yearly indexation, and they intend to keep it in place. There was no mention by Mr Beazley of removing the twice-yearly indexation, which was their policy, which they put in place and which they intend to keep in place. There was no mention by Mr Beazley of removing the twice-yearly indexation of fuel excise, adjusted to the CPI. There was no mention by Mr Beazley or Senator Cook of removing the GST component of the fuel taxation. 
The Labor Party are in a state of confusion. They are telling the government that it should cut petrol excise, but they refuse to commit themselves to a cut in excise as part of the Labor Party's policy. In other words, the Labor Party have a policy and a plan for what the Howard government should do, but they have absolutely no policy or no plan for what they would do in government. Mr Acting Deputy President, I can tell you what they would do: they would retain fuel excise. They would retain the twice-yearly indexation and they would retain the GST. This little stunt by Senator Cook of introducing a private member's bill is exactly that: a political stunt to try to curry some short-term political favour for their own advantage.
We need to remember when it comes to indexation that, as a one-off, the indexation on 1 February was a four per cent CPI rate—much lower than the anticipated CPI impact. While the Labor Party were in office for 13 years they had 23 indexations of fuel excise. Of those 23, seven were greater than four per cent. Did the Labor Party freeze it? Did they offer any compensation to those people in far-flung Australia Senator Cook says are going to be impacted so much by this four per cent increase? In August 1983, they had a 4.3 per cent indexation and in February 1987 they had a 5.6 per cent indexation. Was there any thought of compensation for country people? Not one little bit. When the Keating government was in power it increased petrol excise by 5c a litre and the wholesale sales tax by two per cent across the board, and there was no attempt whatsoever to remove those tax rises from the CPI for the purpose of calculating excise indexation. So I repeat: the Labor Party have no intention of cutting the excise, no intention of rolling back the GST on petrol if they get into government and no intention of abolishing fuel excise.
The best way to minimise excise indexation is to have low inflation. Under this government, the inflation average has been under three per cent for the whole period of this government. For the whole of the time that Labor were in government, inflation averaged twice as much as that—it averaged six per cent. That had a far greater effect on the price of petrol than anything that this government has done since 1996, including the impact of the GST. Labor ran inflation at an average of six per cent, and every time there was a rise in the fuel excise rate because of a CPI indexation it went up on average by twice as much percentage wise compared to what has happened since the coalition came into government. Did Senator Cook address any of those issues? When he visited all of these country areas during his own little inquiry into petrol pricing did he say to all those people, `I'm from the Labor Party'?
—Yes.
—Did he say, `I introduced fuel excise. I was a member of the Labor government. I introduced a fuel excise and that is why you pay a fuel excise today'? Did Senator Cook say to these people, `Not only did I introduce the fuel excise, but I made sure that it had a CPI indexation twice every year'? Did Senator Cook and his committee say to these people—this heartland of National Party and Liberal Party people—`I'm from the Labor Party. I introduced the fuel excise and I also made sure that twice every year you had an indexation. Because as a government we were unable to control inflation—we had an inflation average more than twice that of the current coalition government—we made sure that your fuel excise increases were at a greater rate than the current  government'? Did he also say, `I'm from the Labor Party and I now support a GST. We are not going to remove the GST component. I support twice-yearly indexation and I support the introduction of the fuel excise because I was part of a government that introduced it'?
If the Labor Party are going to be genuine with rural Australia, they need to make sure they state all of those facts every time they have a hearing and take evidence. There is no point in just seeking short-term political popularity by saying that, because the inflation rate is four per cent this time—bearing in mind that when they were in government they had seven occasions when it was greater than four per cent but no compensation and no freeze—they want a one-off and once-only freeze. The Labor Party of Australia have to come clean with the Australian people and tell them what their policy would be if they were ever elected to government; otherwise, anything they say in this area cannot be believed and any way they try to gain any short-term benefit politically will be seen by those people as the Labor Party trying to convince them that they are acting in their interest. The coalition government has not changed any provisions dealing with indexation. The indexation on fuel excise was done under Labor's legislation. This coalition government has not in any way changed fuel indexation. 
Mr Beazley went on in the interview to say—and it was almost unintelligible—`If you want to take the excise off petrol then you need to nominate which school you are going to close.' Have you ever heard a more ridiculous statement? In other words, the funding of schools is directly related to whether or not we take the excise off fuel. So, if you take the excise off petrol, you need to nominate which schools you are going to close. The simple fact is that Labor have no intention of cutting the excise, because they are going to need more and more money for all of their big spending promises.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2001-02-06,"—The Democrats join with the opposition in debating this matter of urgency. I must say that it is regrettable that the government would not allow the amendment to the motion. We think this is important, but there are more important issues to consider when we look at the price of petrol. The Prime Minister said very clearly that the GST itself would not be the cause of any increase in the cost of petrol; yet last July the government increased taxes on petrol by 1½c a litre. That was a breach of a direct election promise that petrol would not rise as a result of the GST. We said at the time that it was a broken promise and a promise that should have been honoured. It is true that oil companies will probably achieve cost savings from tax reform over the next few years and 1.5c a litre could have been clawed back, but that is not going to happen overnight. 
The Democrats agree with the Prime Minister that this 1.5c a litre is very small compared with the increases in petrol prices of 20c a litre and more that have been due to the price of a barrel of oil, over which Australia has little control. In fact, this 1.5c a litre works out to be less than 50c a week, about $20 a year, for the average motorist. But, as I said, a promise is a promise and the Democrats did warn some time ago that an adjustment to the excise arrangements would need to be made. Of course the ALP introduced an import parity pricing policy for crude oil discovered after 1975. They did that to encourage the exploration for, and development of, Australian crude oil, as well as to have a handy mechanism for attracting more government revenue. The ALP introduced the indexation arrangements on excise that, on 1 February, added another 1.7c a litre to fuel costs; Labor did not discount the indexation when they increased petrol taxes in 1993. The Democrats do not want to criticise that measure, but it is important to get it on the record just in case Labor might be using this debate to suggest they have always been in there defending the interests of the little Aussie motorist battler.
I do not want to downplay the importance of affordable fuel prices to people on low incomes or to those who must travel long distances on a regular basis. For those people, increasing petrol costs are a very serious drain on their budget and there is real hardship being felt, particularly in rural areas. The Democrats are acutely aware that people on low incomes cannot afford the latest, most fuel efficient vehicles, and in many cases cannot even maintain their vehicles, which, of course, can deliver significant fuel efficiencies. The problem is that this government, and the Labor government before it, has still not heeded the warnings about the need to reduce the consumption of petrol and other petroleum products. Not only will we have to do this in a greenhouse gas constrained environment; there is not an endless supply of oil reserves. This is presumably why we are digging up shale adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef world heritage area in order to crush and to extract the oil. That is a very expensive and greenhouse intensive process.
Other countries have used government policy and legislation to encourage smaller, more fuel efficient vehicles, better public transport and alternative fuels. We have largely ignored those opportunities in this country. Anyone who has travelled to Europe or the UK in recent times will be struck by the absence of large cars. Yet we are still producing them here, still driving them and, of course, the huge increase in the number of four-wheel drive vehicles on the road is taking us in completely the wrong direction in this respect. Australia has a 20 per cent higher use of fuel per capita than other OECD countries because our reliance on motor vehicle transport, both for passengers and freight, is too high, and this is even the case for urban travel. So we cannot find an excuse for ourselves on the basis of distance. Ninety-two per cent of urban passenger transport is undertaken by motor vehicle, and car kilometres travelled in Australia doubled between 1975 and 1995. There are good reasons for Australia reducing its use of oil and finding local alternatives such as natural gas. Only 40 per cent of Australia's oil consumption is sourced locally and it is estimated that, by 2010, Australia will be producing less than a quarter of the current production here. Oil imports could add an extra $4 billion to Australia's current account deficit by 2010.
The Democrats asked the ALP to amend this motion because we recognise that there is an urgent need for governments to develop much more comprehensive, integrated answers to the problem of increasing petrol costs. The National Greenhouse Strategy says that efficient transport and sustainable urban planning are a major priority for the government and that the government seeks to promote an integrated, best practice approach to transport. These are fine words but we have not actually seen much action on the ground to achieve that best practice. About the only transport related moves have all come out of the tax package as a result of Democrat initiatives and negotiations such as fuel emission standards, gas conversion, alternative fuels grants and the removal of excise for rail and the like. I encourage the government to take a look at the Senate environment committee's report on Australia's greenhouse future. There are numerous recommendations in that report that would not only assist in meeting our Kyoto and National Greenhouse Strategy commitments but also reduce transport costs for all Australians. One point that I would like to draw on is the fact that this would cost taxpayers very little. In fact it would deliver considerable savings.
Every year in Australia around 90,000 vehicles are purchased by governments for their own fleets. Apart from a small number of LPG vehicles, all are petrol vehicles and the vast majority are, I understand, six-cylinder vehicles. There are no incentives for public servants or parliamentarians to drive small cars or cars that run on alternative fuels. Both the car and the petrol are publicly funded, so fuel efficiency is not an issue. Add to that the large fleet of corporate vehicles on the road whose drivers are similarly not personally affected by fuel costs and you have a very large number of vehicles indeed making up the total number of cars on the road that use more fuel than they should. The greenhouse report suggests that we use tax laws to build in those incentives. It also recommended that rail and public transport should be better funded, that there should be a pool of transport funding and that road and other forms of transport should compete on criteria that are transparent and give the best outcome for the environment.
But there is another way which could provide an Australian car fleet with cars that are much cheaper to run. CSIRO, in association with Holden, produced the prototype ECOmmodore—a hybrid electric-petrol vehicle that runs on 50 per cent of the petrol that a conventional Commodore uses. It uses a small four-cylinder engine and an electric motor to drive the front wheels. These power sources work in tandem to attain performance levels comparable to those of the current Commodore. The CSIRO was also part of a consortium of 100 Australian companies that developed the hybrid aXcessaustralia concept car, which would produce 10 per cent of the emissions of the average car while reducing fuel consumption by half. Toyota's Prius is also a hybrid car with similar cost savings. None of these vehicles will be made available in Australia in the foreseeable future, in spite of the fact that, as I understand it, Holden could have its ECOmmodore on the production line within a few months and with a relatively small outlay. The reason these hybrid cars are not available to motorists is that there is no incentive in place. The technology is known; we could manufacture them in Australia.
The Democrats would like to see the Australian government using their buying power—that is, in connection with their 90,000 vehicles every year—to provide that incentive. Taxpayers would save in reduced fuel costs, the small extra cost of the vehicles would be retrieved in their resale after three years, and there are simply no losers in this proposal. Over time this would provide Australians with a considerable fleet of vehicles running on half as much fuel, as well as with the choice that motorists would make. Government fleets could also be converted to natural gas. My new electorate car runs on natural gas, and I would encourage all senators and members to consider making this their choice next time they need to change their car. It is time for us all to be looking at alternatives to petrol. Petrol is getting more costly, with or without the 1.5c per litre excise increase.
It is our view that is it is time for governments to show leadership on this issue. There are very many useful steps that can be taken both to reduce the costs of transport in the medium and long term and to reduce our reliance on petroleum products.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Petrol Prices</title>,Matters of Urgency,12,1,speech
"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,2001-02-06,"—I cannot really let some of Senator Ferguson's comments go. It is a shame that he has left the chamber and is not here to hear the entirety of the debate, particularly given that he is from South Australia and a part of South Australia which is very much regional—in fact, rural. But there was one thing that Senator Ferguson did not tell us; he did not talk about the federal government's promise, the promise that John Howard made. We are signalling here today that we are going to try to fix up not our mess, not the Labor Party's mess, but the coalition's mess. That is what we are here to do.
Obviously the whole situation with regard to petrol, from our perspective—but, more importantly, far more importantly, from the perspective of regional Australians and people who live in rural communities—is this: it is yet another broken promise from this government. The Prime Minister made that promise on 13 August 1998. In his address to the nation—it was not just any old interview; it was actually an address to the nation—he said, `The GST will not increase the price of petrol for the ordinary motorist.' When he said that, he was obviously giving a non-core promise. A non-core promise: that is a phrase which has gone into the everyday language of Australians. Often—and other senators probably have this same experience—you hear people talking and using the phrase `core and non-core'. Mr Howard may go down in history as the great inventor of the phrase: is that core or non-core? So we have a situation here where, in an address to the nation—not just any old media interview—scripted and well prepared, he made that promise.
Twice this promise has been broken: the first time when the government failed to deliver on its pledge from the Treasurer, Mr Peter Costello, to cut excise by `an amount equivalent to the GST'; and now by signalling its intention not to support the Labor Party's private member's bill to waive the 1 February indexation that has added another 1.7c per litre to the price at the pump. This latest increase is quite out of the ordinary. It is three times the normal indexation average and the highest since 1983.
The Labor Party in 13 years of government did not pass on an excise increase several times, depending on the circumstances. In fact, there was at least one occasion when we did not do that. We put our money where our mouth was. We did not even introduce the GST. We did not introduce the GST, and it is because of the introduction of the GST that this private member's bill is here.
—Senator Mason clearly thinks the price of petrol is hilariously funny. Senator Mason, I can tell you that in Queensland, where I spent most of my time on the petrol inquiry, they were not laughing; they were not laughing in relation to the price of petrol at all. I would exhort you to go and talk to your constituents in relation to this matter.
—I do.
—If you do, then we can expect you on Thursday to make the five steps to courage and vote in favour of the private member's bill. Now we have Senator Boswell, the Leader of the National Party in the Senate, also laughing. He thinks that this private member's bill is something to laugh at. I would also say the same thing to Senator Boswell. Senator Boswell, as a member of the National Party, should know what people in regional and rural Australia think about this government in relation to the price of petrol. In fact, we know he does because of the endless press commentary that came out of the coalition's day long party meeting yesterday with, I understand, 45 speakers. Obviously all that happened was that people talked at John Howard; he did not talk to them. As I understand, a number of those speakers talked about petrol.
There are 12 coalition MPs on the record in relation to this issue, saying that something should be done about the price of petrol; saying that they are getting the blowtorch applied to them by their constituents; saying that the government should consider that this excise should be phased in. I am very sorry to say to Senator Boswell that, of that dirty dozen, those 12 coalition MPs, only two were members of the National Party—only two.
—Only two?
—You would think, wouldn't you, Senator Sherry, that from a party that has prided itself on representing rural and regional Australia there would be more than two out of 12 with a bit of courage. You really would.
—You really would.
—You really would. Senator Boswell will have the opportunity, as will his colleagues, to support the Labor Party's private member's bill when it comes on in the chamber on Thursday.
Let us look at the reality of the situation—and Senator Cook I think put it very well. Despite the Senate's refusal to agree to the Labor Party's petrol inquiry—and two of my colleagues, both Labor senators who are here in the chamber at present were involved in that process—I have to say that I personally found the exercise and listening to the evidence from witnesses very distressing and I have to say particularly in Queensland. Some of the stories we heard were very distressing. We heard stories which I very much remember in, for example, Rockhampton, of truck drivers who were driving more than 100 hours a week in order to try and keep up with costs in terms of repayments on their rigs. We had stories of the Meals on Wheels organisations in regional Queensland that simply could not get people to volunteer to deliver meals, because of the cost of petrol. This is not what we are saying; this is not what the Labor Party is making up: this is what the people of Queensland told us in relation to petrol. We said to them quite up-front—and this is to Senator Mason, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President—`Our proposal will only reduce the price of petrol by around 2c; do you think that's enough? Is it worth undertaking this exercise?' They said yes. I came out and was very direct with people—and they said yes. I said, `Well, John Howard doesn't.' He is okay on the price of milk. In fact, we saw him saying—
—Here's another issue.
—Yes, here is another issue. Recently on ABC Radio, in relation to the fall of a few cents per litre in the price of milk, he said, `To a lot of people who are on stretched budgets, any fall in the price of something like milk is very welcome.' It is obviously all right to reduce the price of milk, but who cares if the price of petrol reduces by 2c a litre—according to Mr Howard?
The people we spoke to said, `Yes, we want the reduction; we want a freeze on excise.' If you are a truck driver, driving rigs 100 hours a week, 2c a litre is a lot of money. If you live in the back of Queensland, as a number of the people we spoke to do, and you drive two and three hours routinely to take your kids to sport, 2c a litre is a lot of money. This is something that is facing average Australians, and regional Australians in particular, every single day of their lives, and I challenge not just simply the 12 who have actually had the guts to come and say something but some of the senators in here to consider what is happening in regional Australia, to vote with their hearts, and to cross the floor and support the Labor Party's private member's bill.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Petrol Prices</title>,Matters of Urgency,12,1,speech
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NP,2001-02-06,"—After being in politics for something like 18 years—I am in my 19th year at the moment—you expect hypocrisy in this house, but today takes the cake. Let me put this motion into perspective: today we are saying the total excise index rise was four per cent, which relates to an increase of 1.5c a litre on fuel. If there was no GST—and this is what the ALP's motion has put up: to remove the excise on the GST—we would be saving 1c a litre. I acknowledge that petrol prices are a problem. I am the first to acknowledge that they impact on regional and rural Australia, but we are arguing about 1c a litre—
—No, we are not.
—Yes, we are. Your urgency motion is saying: remove 1c a litre. That is the light on the hill; that is the vision of the Labor Party—1c a litre—and we come in here and debate 1c a litre. That is the great vision of the ALP; that is the big picture of the ALP; we are going to save 1c a litre. This urgency motion should have never even got up, because your own leader emasculated it yesterday on 3AW when he said that a Labor Party government would not remove fuel excise, nor would it remove the GST on fuel, nor would it remove the indexation on fuel. And then, when he got into a very hard debate with the radio commentator, he said, `If you took the excise off fuel, what particular school would you like me to close?' Your motion today falls to the floor because your leader does not even support it; that is how ridiculous it is. We are debating 1c a litre. The price of fuel goes up and down. In Queensland, where there is no tax on fuel, it can fluctuate by between 15c and 12c. It can even fluctuate by 5c a day: it can be 5c lower in the afternoon than in the morning. So 1c a litre, while it is important, is not the end of the world.
This government has put $1.6 billion into roads—jobs will be created and the roads will be there forever. That is what this government has done. So you go out there with your mates who are running your Labor Party committee and, no doubt, ring up the local branch of the ALP and say, `Listen, we have a troop coming into town tomorrow. Provide us with a few witnesses.' Of course they will provide you with a few witnesses, and that is what they have done. The ALP committee going out there to investigate petrol prices is just unbelievable.
The hypocrisy of the situation is this: a year ago this parliament had a discussion on fuel, and we discussed a 6.7c litre reduction and a 17c litre reduction on fuel for heavy vehicles, that is, a 24c litre reduction for fuel going into trucks that service rural and regional Australia and trucks that transport cattle. And where were you people when we wanted to reduce the price of fuel by 24c a litre? You voted against it. You voted against a 6.7c reduction, and then you followed it up and voted against a 17c reduction on heavy fuel. And then you have the rank hypocrisy to come into this place and argue about 1c when you rejected a 24c litre reduction. Do you expect people to support you when you do those sorts of things? You are an absolutely policy-lazy opposition, and you will remain in opposition for many years, because what is your policy on this? You are going to continue with the excise on fuel; you are going to continue with the indexation; you are going to continue with the policy of the GST. You are arguing that we failed to reduce petrol prices by 1c a litre, but in fact you voted against a 24c a litre discount on fuel for heavy transport. Mr Acting Deputy President, I ask you: what validity does this motion carry? It carries absolutely none. Even the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, has said that he would not remove fuel indexation, nor would he remove the GST on fuel, nor would he remove the excise on fuel.
Opposed to that, the Liberal-National Party government has put in $500 million to equalise fuel prices between the cities and rural Australia. If it had been up to us, there would have been discounts on fuel for quarrying, for building, for mining—all these sorts of things—but you rejected that. So don't you come in here crying crocodile tears that we are not going to support a reduction of 1c when you refused a reduction of 24c. If you can sell that message to rural Australia, you will be the greatest salesmen of all time. But they will reject you, like they have always rejected you, and they always will reject you, because the ALP just do not talk sense.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Petrol Prices</title>,Matters of Urgency,12,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-02-06,"—For those who are listening who are not familiar with Senator Boswell, he happens to represent the state of Queensland and be the leader of the National Party. And for those attempting to understand his somewhat rambling contribution, it was a series of excuses as to why the National Party stands for higher fuel prices in this country—that is effectively what Senator Boswell was arguing. Also, at the beginning of this debate, Senator Boswell refused leave for the Australian Democrats to amend the motion that we are considering, because Senator Boswell and the National Party are petrified about the issue of high fuel prices as it impacts on the people they supposedly represent in rural and regional Australia.
The nub of the issue, the central issue we are dealing with here today, is the promise Mr Howard made as Prime Minister, as leader of the Liberal-National Party government, that petrol prices would not increase as a result of the GST. That was the commitment that Mr Howard gave in the run-up to the last election. He has broken the commitment, and broken it by considerably more than the 1c a litre that Senator Boswell claims is the increase. It is interesting that Senator Boswell actually admits that Mr Howard has broken his promise, but he fobs it off by saying, `Well, it is only 1c a litre.' It is more than 1c a litre.
I will explain how much Mr Howard has broken his promise to the Australian people that fuel prices would not go up as a result of the GST and I am going to quote figures not from members of the Australian Labor Party but from the Australian Automobile Association, which has been critical of the Australian Labor Party in the past. The Australian Automobile Association says in its latest publication that since July last year, when the GST was introduced, the Commonwealth fuel excise has risen by 3.6c directly as a consequence of the GST, with rises that included the 1.5c in July last year and then a further 1.1c on 1 February as a result of the latest indexation increase. And the reason that that indexation increase is important is because the considerable majority of the inflation increase in the last quarter resulted from the GST. So the total, Senator Boswell, is not 1c; it is actually 2.6c, on average.
Senator Boswell talked about some sort of equalisation fund. Down in Tassie where I live, on the north-west coast of Tasmania, fuel prices are close to $1 a litre, Senator Boswell. Yet, with your so-called equalisation fund, in Sydney and Melbourne apparently fuel prices are 10c to 12c lower. I do not know what your equalisation fund is doing but we have not seen any narrowing of the differential in fuel prices in Tasmania.
The point I make is that it is at least 2.6c a litre higher. In rural and regional areas of Australia, which Senator Boswell and the National Party supposedly represent, it is higher because the base price of fuel is higher and the GST, being a percentage tax, actually imposes a greater burden than 2.6c a litre. In addition, you would think Senator Boswell and the National Party would care about people in rural and regional Australia, because fuel prices there are not just higher but the people who live there drive further. Secondly, public transport, if they have got it, is fairly limited. Where I live, on the north-west coast of Tasmania, the majority of people have no access to public transport. Thirdly, incomes are lower in rural and regional Australia. So the impact in rural and regional Australia of higher fuel prices resulting from the GST is quite devastating.
What do the National Party do about it? Absolutely nothing. What is very important—and they do not mention this in the debate—is that when the Labor Party was in government it did discount the excise where special circumstances warranted it. The government is fond of saying 23 occasions. On one occasion it did discount it as a result of special circumstances. I cannot think of a better reason as a result of the last inflation increase which was driven by the GST why that $1 billion should not be returned to the Australian people.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2001-02-06,"—Senator Cook certainly has courage. I do not think anyone believes the Labor Party actually takes off taxes. No-one believes that. In fact, as my good friend Senator Kemp always reminds the Senate, in Senator Cook's parliamentary career his second most important statement was: the Labor Party is a high tax party. So for the Australian Labor Party to get up and say, `We are going to cut taxes,' goes against their philosophy and Senator Cook's greatest contribution to the life of the Australian nation.
This is an important issue. Fuel prices are hurting. Senator Sherry and Senator Mackay are right: in Queensland, where I come from, it is a big issue. The fact is that fuel prices at the pump are set by world parity pricing, the world price of crude oil and the strong American dollar. That's what sets the price of petrol at the pump.
This is a cheap display of political opportunism and populism by the Australian Labor Party. The Labor Party opposed taxation reform because they thought they could win a few cheap votes. That is why they opposed it when they knew taxation reform was necessary. They opposed taxation reform and supported the retention of the wholesale sales tax policy, when they knew it was the appropriate policy for the Australian people. For 20 years, we had a debate about it in this country and, when it came to the crunch, they squibbed.
Here again we have an issue on which the Australian Labor Party are trying to make a cheap point. Mr Beazley has had five years to work out a policy platform and a policy direction for the Australian Labor Party and he has come up with nothing. His motley crew, the Right of the ALP, the soulless, believe in nothing. The Left believe in everything, but everything they believe in is wrong. The Centre Left, which I think is where Senator Cook comes from, that rare bird of paradise which I understand is nearly extinct, has the cherry pickers or the management consultants of Labor. At best, Labor at the moment are a cheap, poor, anaemic reflection of the Liberal Party. They stand for nothing.
When I joined the Liberal Party back in the 1980s, we were in opposition. We were in opposition for a while, but no-one ever said that we stood for nothing. We always stood for one hell of a lot, and we changed the policy direction in this country—so much so that 20 years later even people on the Left like Senator Bolkus now adopt the policies that we fought for. That is the greatest thing we did. After five years the Labor Party still stand for nothing. They are a cheap and anaemic reflection of the Liberal Party, standing for absolutely nothing.
I want to go to a bit of history. Senator Sherry spoke about the Labor Party's performance on petrol when they were in office. Let us go back to 1983. When Labor came into office in 1983, petrol excise was 6.155c per litre. Thirteen years later, when they left office, excise was 35c per litre—an increase of 28c or 450 per cent. Labor introduced indexation in 1983, and not once during their term did Labor compensate motorists for their consumer price indexation increase or their discretionary increases in fuel excise. The thing about the Labor Party is that you do not listen to what they say—they say a lot of things; you do not listen to what Senator Cook or Senator Sherry says—but you remember what they did. 
When they were in office, the CPI increase on petrol was 450 per cent. In contrast with the Liberal Party and this government, on five occasions during their term in office Labor legislated to increase the petrol excise over and above the consumer price index to raise more money, to raise more taxes. Yet Senator Cook says, `We'll take the tax off.' No Australian listening today believes the Labor Party will take off taxes. The Labor Party do not take taxes off. Labor have opposed all the measures, as Senator Boswell said, introduced by the government to help keep fuel prices down. That is what Labor have done. It is not what they say; it is what they have done. They have even opposed our attempts to introduce more competition into the petrol industry, which would have benefited motorists.
If Labor had succeeded in voting down taxation reform and fuel concessions, firstly, petrol would be around 10 per cent more expensive for farm and other businesses. Secondly, as my friend Senator Boswell said, diesel would be around 24c a litre more expensive for heavy vehicles. Thirdly, diesel would be taxed at around 44c more for rail and for marine transport. It is important to note this: the Commonwealth government, the coalition government, does not benefit from higher petrol prices. The excise rate stays the same. Regardless of whether the retail price is, for example, 90c, $1 or $1.50, the excise remains the same—at 39c per litre. The indexation of the petrol excise does not provide a windfall to the Commonwealth government. In fact, for every dollar of extra revenue raised through indexing excise, around $2.40 is paid out through higher pensions and other government allowances also linked to indexing.
The point here is clear. Remember what the ALP did when they were in government: not only did they land this country with a $10 billion deficit in their last year in office but there was debt of $80 billion over their last 10 years. Remember what they did on petrol. They raised excise phenomenally—450 per cent during the life of the Labor government. (Time expired)

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-02-06,"—I think now is an appropriate time to make two comments about this debate and to indicate the opposition's attitude to House of Representatives amendment No.1. This is the last stage of a long-drawn-out process. Though the opposition are supporting House amendment No.1, I indicate that we are extremely disappointed with the way this debate has turned in recent days. What we have before us is basically another deal between the government and the Australian Democrats. In the context of all similar deals in the past, we have the environment being the loser. 
Here we go again in 2001. You would have thought that in the break they might have gone back to the electorate and had a bit of a principle recharge. You would have thought that they would have had a signal from the electorate to try and keep this government honest on the environment. They have been giving out some signals during the break. There have been some statements that would have raised some hope in the broader community that the Australian Democrats would stick to some principles when it came to issues such as this. But on day one of the new millennium we start off with the Australian Democrats selling out again. Senator Bartlett, we remember the rhetoric of your predecessors. The principal cause of the Democrats was to keep the bastards honest. They were the self-proclaimed guardian angels of the system. They were purer than the main parties. They would not engage in these private, secret deals; they would stand on principle.
Those were the stated objectives and the raison d'etre of the Democrats in the past. What we have here, once again, is a junking of all those principles. You have gone and done another deal. In doing another deal, you have sold out the Sydney Harbour lands. You will be letting this fundamentally flawed bill through and selling out on basic principles. What I think really upsets people is that you have devalued the currency of dealing. You have sold out in an enormously amateurish way. It was your leader who said over the break: `Labor and Liberal are getting too close together. We are there providing an alternative.' You are not providing an alternative. On day one in this Senate, in this year, in the last session before we go to an election, you have signalled to the electorate very strongly that you do not provide an alternative for the electorate. At least Senator Brown does; you do not. You provide to the electorate a definition of the Australian Democrats as the sidekicks of the coalition—the third arm of the coalition. From keeping the bastards honest, we now have the `Meg the cheat' party selling out, as we saw last year and the year before, on basic, fundamental issues like the GST and the environment legislation. You are selling out again on an issue like this when you do not have to.
Let us go to the issues in this legislation before us. We got such statements from Senator Bartlett towards the end of last year:
Sydney Harbour is NOT—
with `not' in capitals— 
for sale. The Democrats are willing to pass the amended Sydney Harbour Federation Trust Bill on the condition that all former defence lands in and around the harbour remain in public ownership with adequate public access to all.
He went on to say:
The sale of public harbour foreshore lands is non-negotiable. The passage of the bill is contingent on the `no-sale' clauses we have insisted on and the bill, hopefully, will pass early in the Centenary of Federation year.
Quite tellingly, he said in his press statement:
Sydney Harbour is an Australian icon ...
Indeed it is. But he went on to say:
... the Australian Democrats have insisted all along that the foreshore lands and islands must not be sold and that public access must be maximised.
What you have done in your most recent deal and arrangement with the government is to ensure the capacity for sale without parliamentary scrutiny. I will go to that point later on. You started from a position of no sale, then you jumped to a position of sale with some parliamentary scrutiny and now the latest instalment of the deal between you and the government is `forget the parliamentary scrutiny altogether'.
It would have been good to have started this year with a strong stand on an environmental issue, particularly in respect of the legislation before us today. It would have been good to have forced the government to have accepted a lot more in terms of protection of the land that we are talking about. Given the historical and environmental values of the lands that we are talking about, it would have been great to have forced the Prime Minister to meet one of the commitments he made before the last election, and that was to ensure that this land was not sold and was transferred to the New South Wales regime in trust for the people of New South Wales—in trust for the people of Australia. It would have been good, but in a private, secret deal—the reasons for which we cannot understand—you have basically said to Senator Hill, `Just do us over again.' And in doing so, you have made mockery of your own leader. A spokesman for Democrats leader Meg Lees, on 30 June last year, said:
Open space is an increasingly precious resource and this a one-off opportunity to protect it. Once it's gone, it's gone.
`Once it's gone, it's gone.' That is what you are doing here. I will not go through the other quotes. It would be a bit laborious to go through them. But what you have done here has been to flick off the capacity for sale of this land to the minister. Your first set of amendments that we saw were bad enough, because in those amendments you had a clause—and it is repeated here in the circulated amendments today—that allows the `transfer of the freehold interest of any land mentioned in schedule 2 without the written approval of the minister'. Now you are allowing for a schedule 2 and unlike the previous set of amendments you are not insisting that the decision to include land in schedule 2 be made a disallowable decision by either house of parliament. You are allowing the minister to embark upon a process to allow for the sale of land in the subject areas that we talking about—land that has been identified over the years, and confirmed by the Senate environment committee, as land that should be maintained in public hands. Just as a continuing sign of the inconsistency the Democrats show in this area, what they are saying by their amendments is that the minister may be able to start a process to sell the land without public scrutiny but if the minister or the trust was to decide that leases could be granted over the land subject to this legislation, then those leases would be disallowable by the parliament. You are implanting in your legislative prescription for this land an incentive to sell rather than lease. You might shake your head but they are the amendments that have been circulated to us, Senator Bartlett. Under those amendments, leases can be subject to parliamentary scrutiny and disallowance; sale cannot be. So not only is it a sell-out but it is one that provides in your package with the government an incentive to government and the trust to sell rather than to lease.
I suppose for me there is a certain degree of regret in that this is also a missed opportunity again—a missed opportunity to implant in this legislation a statement of vision, foresight and objective that really reflects the true environmental and heritage nature of this land and its true significance. But what we have finished up with, instead of a statement of vision and foresight, is the sort of statement that you would expect from the sort of suburban lawyer that John Howard used to be—a statement from the sort of suburban lawyer that he was and could have been at Wollstonecraft before he came into parliament. We go backwards. We do not show the vision and we do not show the foresight. Once again, we miss the opportunity to celebrate where Australia has come from and where it is going to. In this deal, you basically give the tick to a broken promise and you also give a tick to flawed legislation. We have enormous problems with the deal that the Australian Democrats have done with the coalition government, not merely because of what it does to this legislation but also in that it signals that, on another issue of the environment, the Australian Democrats—no matter how much they try to con their constituents and no matter how much they claim to be a real alternative to the major parties—have sold out once again.",SENATE,<title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,25,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2001-02-06,"—I think I also, under the heading of the preamble, should make a few preliminary comments as unfortunately we are not going to get far tonight. That was, unfortunately, the usual disappointing, carping contribution that fails to appreciate the historical significance of what we have before us in the Senate tonight. And it is from a background of the ALP's intention to develop significant parts of this land—the land that we intend to give to the people of Australia in posterity for its natural values and its cultural values—for housing. They intended to sell it off for short-term economic gain. In contrast, we are ensuring that future governments of Australia cannot do that. We are offering a new protection for this land for future generations of Australians, something the ALP was not prepared to do. That is the point that Senator Bolkus seems to have totally overlooked.
We could carry out the functions that we are undertaking at the moment—planning, remediation and the like—without this legislation. What we cannot do without this legislation is to transfer the land to a body that will be restrained. We will not be able to sell it off for other objectives. We will have specific purposes and objectives for that land—to restore it, to conserve it and to prepare it for its ultimate transfer, principally to a state government authority, to be held in posterity. I would have thought that anyone who was at all objective would say what a great thing that is, not only for the people of Sydney but for all Australians. But, ever since we introduced this bill with those objectives, all the Labor Party has done is obstruct its passage. One can only speculate as to why. Presumably it is in part because Labor does not want to see the government recognised as the government that was prepared to transfer the Sydney Harbour land for this purpose. Perhaps it is in part because the New South Wales government wishes to control the planning of the processes in relation to this land and Mr Beazley feels he is beholden to the New South Wales government in some way. Goodness only knows what the full agenda of the ALP is, but it is certainly not consistent with the noble goal of this piece of legislation.
Madam Chair, since the bill was last before us—and you will recall it was substantially amended—the government have sought to make concessions that we believe are not inconsistent with the government's purpose but would nevertheless improve the workings of the trust we have set up. These concessions would give the community a greater role in the planning process for each of the pieces of land, would improve the workings of the trust and would add some further areas of security as well. The requirement to establish a sustainable financial base has been dropped from the functions. This is something that other sides in this place have said might distract the trust from its primary objective in relation to the land. We have met that requirement. We have provided for individual properties to be named in the preamble and for boundaries to be listed in the schedules.
Listing of the properties was something that the other sides in this place called for constantly. We have provided that all land on schedule 1—which is almost all of the land—will remain in public ownership so that the public, through the schedule process, knows which land can be disposed of and which land cannot be. Land on schedule 2 can be sold only when the approved plan has identified sale as the preferred option and the land has been identified as having significant environmental or heritage values. The same applies to any land not listed on either schedule. The trust must not give security over any land mentioned in schedule 1. The determination of a lease longer than 25 years is now a disallowable instrument. The membership of the trust has been expanded from six to eight, comprising two New South Wales nominees, which was always the case, a representative of indigenous interests, an elected member of an affected council—that is, someone who is a current elected member would be nominated to be on the council—plus the three Commonwealth members and the chairs.
Some meetings of the trust must now be open to the public. The minutes of meetings will be publicly available. Movers and seconders will be acknowledged in the minutes but how each member votes will not be. Trust members have to declare a pecuniary interest in particular matters at meetings and must not take part in any consideration of or vote on the matter. Management plans will now be called `plans' and their content has been changed to pick up ideas from the Senate's amendments. Plan areas will not require ministerial approval and must cover whole sites, one or more. Public notices have been broadened and plans, draft and final, will be available for inspection. Submissions on plans will be publicly available where appropriate. The minister must seek and consider comments on a draft plan from the New South Wales minister. The minister is required to consider comments from advisory committees. The composition of the community advisory committee is more closely defined to ensure that they include local community and local government. The role of these committees and the trust's obligations to them are defined. The trust is to establish procedures for the committees following consultation with them.
We have made very significant changes since the bill was last before the Senate in an effort to accommodate the best of the changes that either came out of the Senate debate or were subsequently communicated to us by stakeholders. Since then, we have decided to go even further—thus our proposed amendments and the explanatory memorandum that I tabled a few minutes ago. These extra amendments to the bill are to further accommodate community concerns and to clarify certain clauses. Membership of the trust has increased by one to a total of eight members, including the chair. The Commonwealth will select an elected member of an affected council. The trust must include a condition of transfer of trust land mentioned in schedule 1 or land identified in a plan as having significant environmental or heritage values to ensure that it remains in public ownership. 
In case you are not concentrating, Madam Chair, a condition of the transfer of that land to a state authority will be that they will not dispose of it—not that I do not trust New South Wales, but we nevertheless think it is an extra precaution that could be written into this legislation. The trust is not required to make publicly available submissions on draft plans where releases of a submission might significantly damage the environmental or heritage values of the land, which could be particularly important in relation to indigenous issues. Trust members are not personally liable to civil or criminal action in respect of the trust making a submission publicly available. The trust may undertake other work before a plan is developed but only as long as the work has a temporary impact on the area. The relationship between the trust and the community advisory committees and the process for determining the matters in relation to which a committee is to give advice and recommendations is clarified. The trust will not be obliged to establish a technical advisory committee unless one is actually required. Amendments to the schedules are the result of clarification of land title details and a resurvey by Defence at Middle Harbour, Georges Heights. The other proposed amendments are simply minor corrections to the legal drafting or consequential amendments.
So you can see how the far the government has gone in an effort to accommodate the wishes of the Senate and to accommodate the concerns of genuine community interest groups—which, I have always acknowledged, passionately believe in this land, and that is great to see—and the particular interests and concerns of the local government councils in the area. What we are putting to the Senate tonight is a bill that has been significantly improved by this process and I think it can provide all the reasonable safeguards that a reasonable person would expect. It will enable the land to be transferred to the trust, which is the major event that needs to take place, and for the trust to continue with its task. There are some exciting developments ahead of us in that area. I think it is only next month that the draft plans in relation to each of the sites are to be published. That is going to be an event of great interest to stakeholders. I understand there are some very exciting possibilities being foreshadowed through that process.
I urge the Senate tonight to allow the land to be transferred to this independent statutory trust, to support the trust in getting on with its job and to ensure that in this year of our Centenary of Federation this land is repaired, conserved and put in a state that can be enjoyed and appreciated not only by present but also future generations of Australians.",SENATE,<title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,25,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-02-06,"—Senator Bolkus says it is a new year, but we are certainly hearing the same old tired rhetoric from the ALP. As Senator Bolkus has said, this is a one-off opportunity to protect these very important lands, and for that reason I find it all the more baffling that the ALP is willing to throw away that one-off opportunity. Let us remember what we actually face now. We now face the situation where the government do not have to do anything at all. They already have these lands in their possession. This legislation, as significantly amended, now provides—
—You're caving in.
—We are not caving in to anything at all. We have totally strengthened this whole trust. We are actually protecting these lands. Senator Bolkus said that we are now allowing it to be sold. This legislation prevents them being sold. They could be sold tomorrow unless this legislation is put in place. 
—They do. This legislation, as amended—
—It prevents the sale. Virtually all the land is prevented from sale by these amendments. Read the amendments. The amendments that the government have put forward are the Democrat amendments, and they would not be in place if it were not for that role.

"McGauran, Sen Julian",NP,2001-02-06,"—In the adjournment debate I want to speak on the matter of petrol pricing. We saw today Mr Beazley claiming in the Daily Telegraph that he was going to out the coalition MPs with regard to petrol pricing. The question that has to be asked of the Labor Party is: what is your policy should you gain government? Given that this is an election year, it is not too much to ask the Labor Party for a policy on this issue. If you were to gain government before the end of this year—there will be a federal election before the end of this year—would you reverse this government's policy? 
We are willing to stand and go to the election on this policy. It is a tough policy but it is a well-calculated policy. We simply believe that the funds gained by excise are better spent with regard to road funding. Therefore, that is our decision. What is yours? If you were to gain government would you reverse that part of the indexation? That is a policy that you introduced yourselves when you first entered government in 1983, which gained a 500 per cent tax increase in excise during your term of government. The clock is definitely ticking on a Labor government in this election year.
—I will sit down in a minute, Senator Calvert. You have to tell your people what will be your policy with regard to petrol excise and indexation. As I say, in an election year it is not too much to ask. Senator Bolkus, perhaps, given that there are not many people speaking in the adjournment debate, you can take the opportunity to articulate the possible policy that Labor will go to the election with, or are you simply policy lazy?",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Fuel Prices</title>,Adjournment,26,1,speech
