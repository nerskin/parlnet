"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2015-03-03,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (12:31):  Mr President, I seek leave to move a motion relating to the deployment of Australian troops.


Leave not granted.




Senator MILNE:
  Pursuant to contingent notice of motion, I move:


That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent me moving a motion to provide for the consideration of a matter—namely, a motion relating to the deployment of Australian troops.


For the interest of the Senate, I did have that motion distributed and it was to be that parliamentary approval should be required for Australian forces to be deployed to Iraq. I believe this is a matter of urgency, which is why I have moved for a suspension of standing orders to have it debated.


We have a situation in Australia where going to war is a captain's call, and that is wrong. We are talking about the lives of Australian service men and women, and they are being deployed because the Prime Minister of the day decides that is what he wants to do. In this case, the captain's call is even worse because he made it and then decided not to tell the Australian people about it because a journalist wrote a story in a newspaper saying that he considered sending 3,500 Australian troops to unilaterally invade northern Iraq. So he put off telling the Australian people because he did not want to suffer the backlash from that article. He had to hose that down.


Meanwhile, he goes to New Zealand and allows the New Zealand Prime Minister to announce the joint force that will be going to Iraq. The Prime Minister of New Zealand said there would be 143 New Zealanders. And here we finally find out, after a delay, after they have dealt with the adverse story in The Australian, where one journalist stopped a nation from being told that another 300 troops are going to go to Iraq. So now we have a situation of: 200 Special Forces personnel; 400 in the Air Force over there now; and we are going to have another 300. That is 900 Australian service men and women on the Prime Minister Tony Abbott's captain's call. We are still suffering from the captain's call that former Prime Minister John Howard made in 2003 sending us into the war in Iraq based on a lie.


The Labor Party is going along with this and saying they support it. They put a ridiculous caveat on it that, if the Iraqi security forces engage in unacceptable conduct or if the Iraqi government adopts unacceptable policies, Australia should withdraw. We know now they are engaged in unacceptable conduct. We know that the mess that is the Iraqi Security Forces is fighting alongside Shiite militias which are conducting massacres; 72 innocent people were killed just last week as a result of Shiite militias engaged in bad behaviour.


ISIS has engaged in appalling behaviour as well; let me very clear about that. We are talking about barbaric behaviour on both sides. We also know Iranian generals are fighting with the militias that we will be fighting alongside. We also know those militias are better paid and better weaponed than the security forces we are supposed to be going there for. The question that the Australian people need answered is: why are they going there, for how long, to what purpose, to what end? The Prime Minister has never made that clear and he still cannot.


It started out as humanitarian aid—and I said then that this would become mission creep. This will see us engaged in a quagmire in Iraq on the back of a captain's call. We have a Prime Minister who is a pugilist who knows nothing other than hitting out and he is sending Australian troops, men and women, into Iraq. We are now going to have 900 of them there—and to what end? For what purpose? As to their engagement with the Shiite militias, what does that mean for Australian troops? We are already in a quagmire and a mess in Iraq, and this is only going to make it worse.


We have already had the military out there saying that the situation we are in right now is that you have to build capability and confidence. They are saying the morale of Iraqi Security Forces is decimated and undermined; their units are fragmented. And we think we can fix that, do we? Do we seriously think engaging with militias and seeing them engage in inhumane and disgraceful behaviour, alongside ISIS doing exactly the same, is going to sort out the Middle East?


This is a bad call, and the parliament should decide. This should not be up to a Prime Minister. The community out there honestly thinks that the parliament sends Australian troops. We do not. The Prime Minister makes the call, the captain's call. It is ill-considered; it has not been explained. It is wrong. (Time expired)

"Fifield, Sen Mitch",LP,2015-03-03,"



Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Social Services) (12:36):  I should indicate at the outset the reasons why the government denied leave for Senator Milne to move her substantive motion, which is the same reason the government will be voting against the motion to suspend standing orders. There are several reasons. The first and by no means the primary reason is that, yes, Senator Milne did circulate this motion through the chamber moments before the Senate sat but there was no reasonable period of notice given to the other senators in this place to consider what it was that the Greens were putting forward.


We do have an order of business in this place. We do have allocated time for government business. We do have allocated time as well for private senators' business. We do have allocated time for a range of contributions from colleagues in this place, and a very good reason always needs to be put forward if those arrangements are to be disturbed. My first point is that I do not think that the appropriate courtesies and notice have been observed in relation to this matter nor do I think a decent rationale has been put forward to change the arrangements for today.


The second and perhaps more significant reason for denying leave and opposing the motion to suspend standing orders moved my Senator Milne is the very long established convention and practice observed by both the coalition government and by also the Australian Labor Party in government—and I do not want to pre-empt whatever the Prime Minister will be saying today—that the deployment of Australian Defence Force personnel in whatever capacity and in whatever way is a decision for the executive government of the day. We do not have the system of the United States here where the congress needs to endorse or give approval to certain actions in relation to armed service personnel. We have a different system here.


We follow the Westminster conventions in this place. As I said, it is something that has been observed by both Labor governments and coalition governments that the Australian Defence Force personnel and their deployment is a decision from the executive government of the day. Now that is not to say that it is not appropriate for those deployments to be debated and discussed in the chambers of the Australian parliament. That is not to say that it is not appropriate for there to be the parliamentary scrutiny and questioning of those decisions. We have the forums and the formats of question time in both places. We have a range of other parliamentary mechanisms where these matters can be examined and debated. And there have been occasions where there has been the provision of the opportunity to debate the decisions of government. But we have not and do not accept as a government that there is or should be a requirement for parliamentary approval for the deployment of Australian Defence Force personnel. That is the practice and I think it is appropriate in the context of our particular system of government.


So it is for those reasons that the government denied leave for the Australian Greens to move their substantive motion and it is also for those reasons that the government will not be supporting the motion to suspend standing orders. We do not think the case has been made and we do not support the concept that parliamentary approval is or should be required. These are matters, appropriately, for the elected government of the day.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2015-03-03,"



Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (12:41):  I indicate that Labor will not be supporting this suspension as it has not supported previous suspensions. I would like to begin by expressing Labor's support for the ADF personnel currently involved in operations in Iraq and the wider Middle East. Like they always do, our ADF personnel serving with dedication and distinction. They are having an impact in the international efforts against Daesh. Our RAAF pilots have completed 167 missions, releasing over 200 weapons. Our other Air Force assets including refuellers, command and control aircraft, and heavy lift aircraft are providing valuable support for the international mission. Our special forces are now on the ground in Iraq advising and assisting the Iraqi armed forces. The Chief of the Defence Force, Air Chief Marshal Binskin, told Senate estimates last week that our contribution is making a difference against Daesh:


… for all intents and purposes … their major push and their major strategic message of being able to establish a caliphate is in question.


Let me repeat, Labor supports the current commitment to fighting Daesh in Iraq. If there is a change to the size or make up of Australia's military contribution to Iraq, the government has promised to fully brief the opposition. Any changes to the mission should be fully explained to the Australian people by the Prime Minister.


As Labor has said before, the role of parliament is to debate issues of concern, particularly when it comes to whether Australia deploys its defence forces. Labor supports the role of parliament as a place of debate but that should not be confused with requiring parliamentary approval for military deployments. The role of the parliament in approving military action is fraught with danger. The government must retain maximum flexibility to respond to threats to Australia's national security quickly and efficiently. Requiring parliamentary approval prior to deploying ADF personnel and assets could unnecessarily increase the risk to the deployment. Furthermore, the government of the day has access to classified information which the parliament does not. Executive government remains the most appropriate body to exercise civilian control of the Australian Defence Force. And we fully expect the government to provide opportunities to debate this deployment in the coming weeks and months.


Just last week the defence minister provided an update on operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and the Middle East. That is appropriate and it ensures an important level of transparency to any ADF deployment. Regular statements to parliament by the government is something that Labor initiated and it is something that this government is continuing As I have said, it is appropriate for the parliament to debate government decisions that involve the deployment of ADF personnel, but that should be done in a considered way. We do not believe that this is a considered way and we do not support this suspension motion.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2015-03-03,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (12:45):  I rise to support the suspension motion. What we see in front of us is, by its very definition, precisely the kind of mission creep that was predicted at the outset—here in Australia, in the United States and in the United Kingdom. Nobody, from the Prime Minister's office down, has ever made clear what the primary objective of the mission is. What is the rationale? What is the desired end state? What does success look like? I strongly take issue with Senator Conroy's comments—although they are reflected by those of Senator Fifield—that because the executive has access to classified intelligence materials the decision somehow lies outside this place. These are not tactical decisions; these are very political decisions. In a democracy, the decision to deploy is not a military decision. It is a decision that should be taken democratically.


Senator Fifield let the cat out of the bag a short time ago. President Obama had to go to congress and Prime Minister Cameron had to go to Westminster because, in part, of the debacle of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. That invasion was presided over by a substantial fraction of Abbott government frontbenchers, not a single one of whom has uttered a word of contrition or apology for that catastrophe; nonetheless they are demanding that we be led blindfolded into another deployment. The very same people who presided over that disaster are now leading us into another. These are political decisions. Once the political decision has been made—as it has been in Washington, as it has been in London—then the considerations are turned over to the military. That is where your classified intelligence material comes into play. Politicians should not get involved in specifics of deployments. Those are military and strategic decisions; this is a political one.


What we have heard from Senator Conroy and Senator Fifield is, effectively, a declaration of incompetence. You are willing to let the Prime Minister stand up in front of as many flags as he can muster—in desperate search of a bounce in the polls—to announce a deployment. You would not be willing to put your name on the voting register as having supported that deployment when it all goes horribly sideways, as it did after 2003. As Prime Minister Abbott has identified, the Iraqi authorities need to give consent for Australian troop deployments and positioning in Iraq. So effectively it is everybody except us. Australia just goes traipsing along behind our great and powerful ally, the United States, as we have done with so many disastrous deployments. It is everyone except Australia.


Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President: Senator Fifield, if not now then when? Should we wait for a prime ministerial press conference? Should we wait for the PM to array himself in front of an extraordinary display of flags in response to announcements that have been leaked and foreshadowed in the media by other leaders for weeks? You expect the parliament to behave like that, in the face of one of the most significant decisions, if not the most significant decision, that a legislature or an executive can make. I strongly disagree, Senator Fifield—through you, Mr Acting Deputy President. The time for that debate is now and the place for it is here—not in the context of some prime ministerial brain snap that may or may not have happened, no matter how well intentioned. That debate should happen in the open air, in the light of day, in an elected parliament. That is what this place is for. Other democracies may have grown up enough, either through the war power invested in congress hundreds of years ago or much more recently in the instance of Westminster, with respect to reacting to the debacle of Iraq. There is now a convention. It is not put to a vote, but senators here will be well aware that the royal military was prevented from being put into the fight in Syria by a debate in Westminster. That is how mature democracies make these decisions, not on the basis of plans drawn up on the backs of envelopes by prime ministers desperate for a lift in the polls. That is not how deployments should occur in modern democracies.




Senator Fifield:
  That is offensive.




Senator LUDLAM:
  I will tell you what is offensive, Senator Fifield, and that is simply being told that we have to trust this Prime Minister on the most significant decision that a nation can make, against the backdrop of a series of disastrous captain's calls. It is about time we grew up and submitted these discussions, debate and, ultimately, decisions to those elected MPs who would then need to live with the decisions that they make.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2015-03-03,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (12:50):  I will make a brief contribution indicating that I do support this motion. This is an important issue. It is a pity that leave was not granted to deal with this important issue. I want to restate what I said on 1 September last year in this place: there ought to be a measure of parliamentary approval. Senator Ludlam is right. We are behind the United States and the United Kingdom when it comes to dealing with troop deployments. Picking up on Senator Conroy's point, we do need to consider that there may be circumstances when there is an urgent need for deployment of troops that may not be subject to immediate parliamentary approval, but there ought to be a mechanism or a trigger in place to ensure that parliamentary approval is dealt with. That is why I think that is important.


Let us look at the issue of the invasion of Iraq in 2003. It overthrew the brutal regime of Saddam Hussein and then, recklessly, the coalition forces dismissed the entire army and dismantled the Ba'ath party. These last two events fuelled an insurgency, ignited a vicious civil war between the Shiites and the Sunnis, increased Iran's influence and, most tragically of all, led to hundreds of thousands of deaths. Meanwhile, at regional level, tensions between the Sunnis and Shiites have increased. For instance, Saudi Arabia backed the crushing of the Arab Spring in order to defeat the Shiites, particularly in Bahrain. This is a very delicate geopolitical situation but we have to deal with these issues in the parliament. That is what parliament is for; it is not for telling the military what to do or how to do it but in terms of our long-term involvement and in terms of being constantly vigilant in terms of mission creep. Otherwise we are headed for another disaster.


I put it unambiguously that Islamic State—ISIS or Daesh, as they are also called more appropriately—is an evil organisation. They have been responsible for callous atrocities, and I support what the government has done to date in order to crush ISIS and to ensure that the people that they have occupied are emancipated. But we must learn from the catastrophic consequences of George W Bush's handling of Iraq. We must ensure that these minor incremental increases do not turn into a full-scale war.


Finally, I want to make this absolutely clear: I wish our troops well. I am sure they have done us proud and will continue to do us proud. The issue here is having parliamentary scrutiny of the most grave decision any government can make, which is to send our trips to war.

"Fawcett, Sen David",LP,2015-03-03,"



Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (12:53):  Firstly, I just want to refute and take exception to the comment by Senator Ludlam that this has any relationship to polls. I think that is a statement that people in Mosul, that people in the Raqqa province and that the Coptic community who have seen members of their community beheaded recently would take exception to. They would take exception to the statement that there is no crisis over there, there is no worldwide attention needed to defeat these forces. Yet he is linking Australia's response as a responsible, international citizen to support the resolution of this and the re-establishment of sovereign control of Iraq by the Iraqi government to somehow trying to reduce that to a crass, domestic, political situation. I refute that and I do not accept that.


He also mentioned the lessons of Iraq. If there is one lesson we should be learning it is that when you are dealing in areas like that where there are long held, centuries old tensions between communities—whether they be religiously based, ethnically based, geographically based—we need to be empowering those people to seek a resolution, preferably diplomatically but, if needs be, through military means. At its essence, this is a training mission. The whole purpose of this deployment is a training mission to help the Iraqi forces, at their invitation, so that they can re-establish sovereign control of their own nation. This is not like Australia sending an invading force. This is a training mission to go and help them. So if we are going to learn anything from the Iraq conflict, the Greens should be welcoming the fact that Australia is seeking to help build the capacity of the Iraqi military and government to re-establish their own control.


We also have the statement from the Leader of the Greens who is talking about this being a captain's call or a captain's pick. It ignores the fact that there is a system within our form of government whereby it is not just the Prime Minister, it is also the National Security Committee of cabinet and cabinet who approve decisions that are made that result in a deployment of Australian troops. The suggestion that somehow—as Senator Xenophon, who I have a high degree of respect for, indicated—we should have a situation where, in an emergency, people could be deployed and then we could have a debate and the parliament might seek to overturn that ignores the reality of what it means once you have placed men and women in harm's way.


That is part of a plan, normally part of a coalition, and to then seek to extract them exposes them to more risk than it does to follow through with a considered plan. Our government does not act without advice from the Defence Force, from the professionals who have, at their disposal, a range of intelligence that is not available to members of parliament, except to those who have the appropriate clearances and are on roles like the National Security Committee of cabinet. It is certainly not available to the media or to the public. Those people are informing the government about options, and a debate before a deployment is potentially dangerous to our troops.


I looked with some horror at the media questioning of the government before we deployed some ADF and other assets to support the recovery of Australians who were killed in the incident over Ukraine. The persistent and detailed questioning from media around exactly who was being deployed, where they were being deployed and what they were being deployed for was actually putting Australians in that place at risk. If you extrapolate what happened in that small example to a broader example of a deployment of a force, it is not appropriate, it is not safe and it is not the precedent in this country which has served us well over many years for this parliament to usurp the ability of the cabinet to make that decision that, where it is in Australia's best interest, our Defence Force should be deployed.

"Lambie, Sen Jacqui",Ind.,2015-03-03,"



Senator LAMBIE
 (Tasmania) (12:57):  I rise to speak to the motion before the Senate regarding the deployment of the ADF personnel to overseas conflicts. While I support the Greens motion to have a debate about the current military deployment, I do not support the Green's proposal to change the way the decision-making process is made to send the troops overseas. All I propose to change is the decision makers, who have clearly made the wrong call in sending our troops back overseas again. Some people are having difficulty in grasping this following fact: despite all the terror attacks, despite the fact that our official terrorism alert is high, which means that an attack by an enemy is likely, we are at war.


Firstly, I would like at least the Liberal Party to be big enough to say it as it is: we are at war. Let us just say it. Let us be honest. It is a war that we did not want. It is a war that other people have declared on us because they do not like our freedom, our democracy and our way of life, and they do not like the fact that our women and gay people have the same rights as men. They do not like the fact that we do not worship and pray to the same god that they worship and pray to. Therefore, they want to kill and enslave us.


Secondly, for anybody that does not know, out of all the troops that we have—which is about enough full-time troops to half fill the MCG, and then we have reserves on top of that—if you take everything away, we have about 3,000 combat troops. Three thousand combat troops in the last 12 years have shared this war between them. Some of them have done six to 10 tours. That means they have already spent five or six years in the war zone. Some of them we are sending back on anti-psychotic drugs.


We are not ready for this war because we stopped spending what we should have spent out of our GDP. That is what the problem is, and we just have not been restocking for years. This is caused by both major sides of politics. And now you are going to send these men and women back into the war zone. Not only that, you still have not returned the 1.5 per cent pay rise that you ripped out of them, that you stole from them. But you can stand in front of their faces and tell them they are going back to war. What sort of men does that make on your cabinet, let alone your PM?


But, for the worst of this, let's go into Veterans' Affairs. Let's go into the theory of 'don't send them to war when you cannot look after them when they return'. Right now you people have put in place a system—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Williams
):  Senator Lambie, direct your comments through the chair, please. Continue on.




Senator LAMBIE:
  Acting Deputy President, the Liberal Party set up a system which is called 'offsetting'. It is under three different acts, so now when these men return you are ripping them off. They are not getting paid out in full for their injuries and they are suffering. You know about this but you still refuse to fix it. You know this offsetting is an issue. Veterans' Affairs is in chaos, but you are prepared to sit there and you are prepared to send these men back into war. Well, you know what? I suggest you go and clean up a little bit, because you are out of order. How easy it is for you people to sit over there and say: 'Guess what, men? You're going back into war.'



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Lambie, please direct your comments through the chair.




Senator LAMBIE:
  Like I said, that is after you rip 1.5 per cent of their pay rise off them, off their families. How is their morale going? That is how you are going to send them back into war. You should be bloody proud of yourselves! As a matter of fact, you should be absolutely ashamed of yourselves. It is an absolute disgrace.

After paragraph


43A(2)(f)



   Insert:


   (fa) Regional South Australia.


I spoke largely to this during my second reading contribution. Essentially, these amendments would require local content in South Australia, because South Australia was never included in the context of broadcasting legislation to have local content and local news bulletins in particular. The legislation did not include Western Australia or the Northern Territory because of a number of regional factors. South Australia lost regional television services in the south-east of South Australia and in the Riverland, but I am completely open as to whether there ought to be additional safeguards in Western Australia. There is quite a different media market there in terms of the size of that state and the population distribution. But this is basically saying that if regional communities had local television content—I know the importance of local coverage in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and Tasmania—they are all covered by the broadcasting act, but South Australia has been omitted. This is about rectifying that. I have had discussions, as recently as yesterday, with Harold Mitchell from Free TV to express my concerns about the need for commercial broadcasters to provide local coverage. I have had discussions with Bruce Gordon, the owner of WIN Television, about this issue as well. Losing their local content has been a real body blow for the communities in the south-east of South Australia, in Mount Gambier and surrounding communities, in the Riverland, Renmark, Loxton, Berri, Barmera and other surrounding communities. Losing their half hour news service has been a real body blow to that community infrastructure and that dissemination of information. This is what these amendments seek to deal with, that is why I am here and that is why I am moving them.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2015-03-03,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (13:13):  I would like to ask the mover of the amendments why he thinks this is necessary. This is a question that has come up over a long period of time in this chamber. It is a question of whether the parliament should regulate to indicate how broadcasting stations and media outlets should operate their businesses. I have always been of the view that if people want that sort of service they will watch the TV or listen to the radio that provides that service and the increased number of viewers or listeners will then make that a very attractive proposition for advertisers. So advertisers will flock to the stations that do that, and, because of the interest shown by locals, the service will happen. But, if there is not viewer or listener support for a locally produced news outlet, then no advertisers are going to support it and life will move on.


So really my question to the mover is: why should this be regulated? Why wouldn't the market forces demand that this happen if it were wanted? Is this what viewers in this part of South Australia that Senator Xenophon speaks about want? If it is what they want, you would think that the advertisers would come in and support such an issue. I do not know the particular area that Senator Xenophon talks about, although the amendment does seem sort of specific to an area. I am not sure whether we can pass laws here for a specific part of our country, but no doubt Senator Xenophon has considered that.


I do remember that, when the issue arose in Queensland some years ago and there was an attempt made to regulate or legislate to provide for these services, the broadcasting outlets involved indicated that none of their listeners particularly wanted to do this and therefore they were not interested in doing it. But more importantly—they were commercial radio stations—none of the advertisers were interested, because it became a turn-off for the local area. I am curious, having only just come into this debate, about Senator Xenophon's reasons for raising this. I would be very interested to hear them. I am sure he has thought about these things, so I will listen intently to the answers he gives.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (13:17):  When crossbenchers move amendments, there is often not enough questioning about them, so I genuinely am grateful to Senator Macdonald. In terms of the history of this, section 43A of the Broadcasting Services Act places an obligation on holders of regional aggregated commercial television broadcasting licences to produce a minimum level of material of local significance to each area. That has been the history of the legislation for some 23 years. The policy rationale for that, as I understand it, was that, by virtue of getting a commercial television licence—the gift of a licence, if you like—there ought to be certain community service obligations, in a sense. That was the case in New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria—not Tasmania, but Tasmania was subsequently included, as I understand. South Australia—and, I think, WA and the Northern Territory—were subject to a review. That review of ACMA, or consideration of the markets in South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory, was intended to take place following this, because the areas listed under subsection 43A(2) excluded Tasmania, which was added in 2008. They were originally set out in the act in the late 1980s. I apologise for that. It was in the late 1980s, so this has been going for quite a few years. The review never actually occurred. That is referred to in the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal's Broadcasting in Australia 1989 report, Sydney July 1990, at page 3. I do not have that in front of me, but that is the reference for it. So it did not occur.


The trigger for these amendments and for the previous bill I introduced was back in February 2013 when WIN TV decided to remove their local news bulletins in the south-east of South Australia, centred around Mount Gambier, and in the Riverland of South Australia, centred around their Loxton studio. At that stage, there had already been an aggregation of news services, so about half was from the south-east and half was from the Riverland, because of cost-cutting. I have had discussions about Bruce Gordon, the legendary Australian, the owner of WIN. I am not referring to Bruce Gordon in respect of this, but my understanding from speaking to those in television is that, because there was a requirement to have local content on the eastern seaboard but not one to have it in South Australia, it was much easier for there to be a rationalisation to get rid of the bulletins in South Australia's Riverland and in the south-east. I hope that explains to Senator Macdonald the history of that.


The issue of what consumers want is this. Advertisers are concerned about how many viewers are listed as watching a particular program. We have requirements in terms of local content more broadly. Advertisers are interested in how many viewers there are—the bang for their buck, in terms of advertising. I understand that. I am not being critical of them. Market failure is perhaps not the right way to put it, but it is a case where there was a community demand for those programs in terms of local sports coverage and local government coverage. Local politicians, state and federal, got good coverage about local issues. Particularly during the drought in South Australia, the Riverland WIN TV had a key role. WIN TV's local bulletin in the south-east of South Australia covered forestry issues exceptionally well, whereas the metropolitan media did not.


What I was trying to do through these amendments was to remedy what I saw as an anomaly under section 43A of the act: that other states were included, but South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory missed out—although there are regional differences between WA and the Northern Territory. That is the basis of the amendments: that there is a case of, if not market failure, market distortion by not including South Australia in 43A, the amendment that gave protection to local coverage. Senator Macdonald, it is always a pleasure to get a question from you. I hope I have answered it in part at least.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (13:21):  Senator Xenophon, with respect to you and others of my colleagues, I think you hit the nail on the head when you said politicians, state and federal, want to be able to get their message across. I say with the greatest respect to former colleagues of mine that I have the feeling that their great interest in this was not so much in community demand but in their wish to be able to have a dedicated medium to distribute their message.




Senator Xenophon:
  There's nothing wrong with that.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  There is nothing wrong with that, I agree, but perhaps the viewing public are not quite so keen. Of course, the private owners that have to pay for these things but cannot get advertisers because no viewers really want it might not quite have the same view.


You talk about section 43A. I confess to not knowing if that is still in force and applying to Queensland. I can only say from my own experience in the regional market of Townsville—and I could say Cairns as well, and indeed Rockhampton and Mackay—that both WIN and the Seven Network compete for the local news. And why? Their research shows that, if they can capture the viewing audience for the Channel Seven news in Townsville, people will stick on Channel Seven and go through, because it is such a popular show. It is not popular because Ewen Jones, Warren Entsch and I regularly appear on these—




Senator Fifield:
  No!




Senator Colbeck:
  You undersell yourselves.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Well, you may be surprised, Minister and Senator Colbeck, but it is not the fact that we are on those, and I must say that both Mr Entsch and Mr Jones appear much more regularly than I. That is not what gives it the attraction to the TV stations and then to the advertisers. It is because people do like to know what is happening in their area in Townsville and Cairns.


I am surprised that you are telling me that in a part of Western Australia that I am not terribly familiar with—it is a lovely part of South Australia; I am sorry. There are lovely people there and lots going for it, but I would have thought that commercial forces would have applied in Mount Gambier as they do in Townsville, Cairns, Mackay and Rockhampton. That is the bit that I hesitate on when you—




Senator Hanson-Young:
  Why do you hate people in Mount Gambier so much?

Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I beg your pardon?



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  There is plenty of opportunity to go back and forth. We are in committee.

  Another silly comment from Senator Hanson-Young.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Senator Macdonald, I will ask you—




Senator Hanson-Young:
  Why don't you shush me?



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Order, Senator Hanson-Young! I will not make any comment on the comment, but I will ask you not to respond to it nonetheless.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Thank you, Mr Temporary Chairman. I must say, though, that Senator Hanson-Young has form. I chaired a committee meeting recently where, as chairman, I had to put up with a continual series of interjections from Senator Hanson-Young, and Senator Wong, I might say—continuously interjecting, contrary to standing orders, to the extent that I asked Senator Hanson-Young to leave the room.




Senator Ludlam:
  Mr Temporary Chairman, on a point of order, I just ask you to call Senator Macdonald to the question that is before the chair so we can get on with this debate.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Thank you. I think the senator has a point, Senator Macdonald. We will come back to the amendments that are before the committee.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Thank you, Mr Temporary Chairman. The interjection was—




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  He's ignoring you, Mr Chairman.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Sorry?




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  He's ignoring the chair. He said, 'Get back to the point.'




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Well, the interjection was: why do I hate Mount Gambier? It was such a stupid, irrelevant interjection and accusation against me that I want to respond to it. If you want to ask Senator Hanson-Young to withdraw the interjection then I will not need to answer it.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Senator Macdonald, as I said, responding to interjections is disorderly. I have asked Senator Hanson-Young not to interject, and she would help the situation if she were to no longer interject. Senator Macdonald, in dealing with the amendments, if you want to deal with the broad subject matter, you can, but I would ask you not to respond to interjections and I would ask you to focus on the amendments which are before the committee.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Thank you, Mr Chairman. When you have stupid, irrelevant interjections like that, they have to be answered. I am sorry. They are on the record and they need to be answered, because I can assure you, Mr Temporary Chairman, that Senator Hanson-Young will have a media release out within half an hour saying, 'Liberal senator attacks Mount Gambier'. If she had listened, which she rarely does, she would have heard me say to Senator Xenophon just a fraction before that it was a lovely part of the world. I indicated that I was not terribly familiar with that area, but from what I have seen of it over the years it is a lovely part of the world. There are lovely people there. It is a very important part of the Australian regional economy.


But I am drawing the likeness to Senator Xenophon's attention. In Townsville, Cairns, Mackay and Rockhampton, which I am familiar with—and, I am sure, in many other parts of regional Australia—you do not need to regulate for this. If there are regulations—I am not sure that there are, but if there are—they are certainly not needed in those places, because again I repeat that the Channel Seven and Channel Nine affiliates, WIN and Prime or Channel Seven, actually compete for the local news, because it is good for viewer participation. Viewers do watch the local news. That attracts advertisers, and that, of course, attracts the businesses that run these organisations. I repeat that I am not familiar with the Mount Gambier area, but if there were a demand in the Mount Gambier area then one would think that the first people to know about that would be WIN Television, and the second lot of people to know about it would be the advertisers. If the viewer demand is not there then one would wonder why the federal parliament should be regulating to provide a service that clearly nobody wants.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2015-03-03,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (13:29):  I will just respond to Senator Macdonald's comments and, I think, additional questions inherent in that. There are a few things. Firstly, producing local television is always expensive. That is why you get the ABC and commercial networks buying stuff from overseas. For instance, for Channel Ten, I do not know how much The Bold and the Beautiful actually costs to bring into the country, but presumably it is not very much compared to, say, producing their flagship current affairs shows or news program, The Project.


One of the issues has been that this is a case where the market has been modified by virtue of the operation of section 43A in the context of those requirements for local content. We know that the Seven Network's Today Tonight program is no longer running on the eastern seaboard but has been kept alive and is still doing very well in Western Australia and South Australia. This is not because of any legislative requirements but because television stations will try and save money. I am not having a go at them for that, but the consequence is that local television production costs more than a program beamed in from Sydney or Melbourne. There is an anomaly in the legislation, in my view, given the way section 43A was operating. And there was an intention for it to be further reviewed but that review was never completed. I have made reference to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal's 1989 report Broadcasting in Australia. All I am trying to do with this amendment is to bring at least South Australia in line to deal with that particular issue.


The other issue is that producing local television content is quite different now than 20 or 30 years ago. A Betacam costs about $100,000. You can have broadcast quality equipment for $6,000 or $7,000, which journalists in the Southern Cross Network use out of Port Lincoln, Whyalla, Port Augusta and Port Pirie, and they seem to be able to put together a very comprehensive news bulletin. So I think the media has changed and it is just convenient to drop South Australia from that by virtue of a lack of a requirement in section 43A. I hope that answers Senator MacDonald's questions, but I think he has raised some very important issues. In terms of local advertisers, as long as they have got the viewers there they do not care whether they are watching The Bold and the Beautiful or the local news bulletin; what they are interested in is the number of eyes on the television set.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (13:32):  I thank Senator Xenophon for those answers. I acknowledge his passion for his electorate and the place where he gets votes. His passion for South Australia almost matches that of my colleagues on this side from South Australia—and one of them has just walked into the room. With respect, you almost get tired of the way they continually advocate for, promote and support South Australia. They are fabulous supporters of and advocates for South Australia—and Senator Xenophon is another one in that same category. Having said that, Senator Xenophon, I have heard what you have said. Thank you for your answers, but I am afraid you have not convinced me, so I will be voting against the amendment.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (13:33):  The Australian Greens will be supporting Senator Xenophon's amendment. I did listen to Senator Macdonald's contribution because I guess the committee stage is precisely so that these sorts of questions can be asked of the movers of amendments. For Senator Macdonald's benefit, a similar situation prevails in regional Western Australia. These networks have to be heavily regulated or they would barely exist at all—whether it be broadcast radio or broadcast television. Quite a strong framework of legislation remains in place around things like local content and the media regulations that were in part installed by a former iteration of your government, Senator Macdonald. My understanding of the amendments that Senator Xenophon has brought forward is that the very regulatory framework that prevails in regional Queensland, which does provide for a measure of local content—news, current affairs and so on—is lacking in the parts of regional Australia that Senator Xenophon has highlighted. This amendment will go some way towards enforcing a similar measure of regulation.


In a country as heavily urbanised as Australia it means that the representation that comes into this place will be predominantly representing urban or peri-urban electorates. I think it is important we keep in mind that, in regional areas, locally produced regional media can be a tremendously important voice. And that is partly why we stand up so strongly for regional ABC broadcasters—because, in some instances, commercial players simply cannot maintain that service. So we will be supporting this amendment when it is committed to a vote.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Social Services) (13:34):  I have enjoyed the contributions of my colleagues in the committee stage and I think it demonstrates one of the many virtues of the way this place operates. I think Senator Xenophon's proposition for an amendment to add regional South Australia to the list of commercial television licence areas that are subject to local content licence conditions has been well canvassed. While the government clearly does support the provision of local news and content to the people of South Australia, we believe the amendment proposed by Senator Xenophon is not necessary.


In 2013 the ACMA conducted an inquiry into the provision of local content in South Australia. It found that in Mount Gambier and the Riverland, the two licence areas where commercial television licensees do not produce local content, 86 per cent of residents were generally satisfied with the level of local content available. This included local content sourced from state based television news produced in Adelaide, services produced by the ABC and via commercial radio, print and online news sources. The ACMA concluded that the local content obligations were operating effectively and that there was no clear case for an extension of local content obligations to additional regional areas given the high level of satisfaction reported by residents in regard to their access to local content, the high cost of providing local content and the adverse financial impact this would have on the relevant licensees.


Senator Xenophon was not expecting government support on his amendment, and I confirm that.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (13:36):  I am not intending to have a division. I am grateful that the opposition, the Greens and the government have indicated their positions. In relation to that ACMA report, there were criticisms about the methodology and the questions asked. I can tell you that, in the local communities of Mount Gambier, in the south-east and in the Riverland, there was a real sense of loss felt when those local bulletins went. It was not just political coverage—far from it—but sports and local coverage of issues of interest to the local communities. There was a powerful sense of loss of community. I do not think the ACMA survey was the be all and end all in its methodology and some of the questions asked.


Having said that, I am grateful for my colleagues indicating where they stand on this. I know the amendments will be defeated, but at least we have had that debate at this stage. But it will not go away. I still hope that Bruce Gordon one day will change his mind and bring back local content to the south-east and the Riverland.

   (fa) Regional South Australia.


I spoke largely to this during my second reading contribution. Essentially, these amendments would require local content in South Australia, because South Australia was never included in the context of broadcasting legislation to have local content and local news bulletins in particular. The legislation did not include Western Australia or the Northern Territory because of a number of regional factors. South Australia lost regional television services in the south-east of South Australia and in the Riverland, but I am completely open as to whether there ought to be additional safeguards in Western Australia. There is quite a different media market there in terms of the size of that state and the population distribution. But this is basically saying that if regional communities had local television content—I know the importance of local coverage in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and Tasmania—they are all covered by the broadcasting act, but South Australia has been omitted. This is about rectifying that. I have had discussions, as recently as yesterday, with Harold Mitchell from Free TV to express my concerns about the need for commercial broadcasters to provide local coverage. I have had discussions with Bruce Gordon, the owner of WIN Television, about this issue as well. Losing their local content has been a real body blow for the communities in the south-east of South Australia, in Mount Gambier and surrounding communities, in the Riverland, Renmark, Loxton, Berri, Barmera and other surrounding communities. Losing their half hour news service has been a real body blow to that community infrastructure and that dissemination of information. This is what these amendments seek to deal with, that is why I am here and that is why I am moving them.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2015-03-03,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (13:13):  I would like to ask the mover of the amendments why he thinks this is necessary. This is a question that has come up over a long period of time in this chamber. It is a question of whether the parliament should regulate to indicate how broadcasting stations and media outlets should operate their businesses. I have always been of the view that if people want that sort of service they will watch the TV or listen to the radio that provides that service and the increased number of viewers or listeners will then make that a very attractive proposition for advertisers. So advertisers will flock to the stations that do that, and, because of the interest shown by locals, the service will happen. But, if there is not viewer or listener support for a locally produced news outlet, then no advertisers are going to support it and life will move on.


So really my question to the mover is: why should this be regulated? Why wouldn't the market forces demand that this happen if it were wanted? Is this what viewers in this part of South Australia that Senator Xenophon speaks about want? If it is what they want, you would think that the advertisers would come in and support such an issue. I do not know the particular area that Senator Xenophon talks about, although the amendment does seem sort of specific to an area. I am not sure whether we can pass laws here for a specific part of our country, but no doubt Senator Xenophon has considered that.


I do remember that, when the issue arose in Queensland some years ago and there was an attempt made to regulate or legislate to provide for these services, the broadcasting outlets involved indicated that none of their listeners particularly wanted to do this and therefore they were not interested in doing it. But more importantly—they were commercial radio stations—none of the advertisers were interested, because it became a turn-off for the local area. I am curious, having only just come into this debate, about Senator Xenophon's reasons for raising this. I would be very interested to hear them. I am sure he has thought about these things, so I will listen intently to the answers he gives.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (13:17):  When crossbenchers move amendments, there is often not enough questioning about them, so I genuinely am grateful to Senator Macdonald. In terms of the history of this, section 43A of the Broadcasting Services Act places an obligation on holders of regional aggregated commercial television broadcasting licences to produce a minimum level of material of local significance to each area. That has been the history of the legislation for some 23 years. The policy rationale for that, as I understand it, was that, by virtue of getting a commercial television licence—the gift of a licence, if you like—there ought to be certain community service obligations, in a sense. That was the case in New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria—not Tasmania, but Tasmania was subsequently included, as I understand. South Australia—and, I think, WA and the Northern Territory—were subject to a review. That review of ACMA, or consideration of the markets in South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory, was intended to take place following this, because the areas listed under subsection 43A(2) excluded Tasmania, which was added in 2008. They were originally set out in the act in the late 1980s. I apologise for that. It was in the late 1980s, so this has been going for quite a few years. The review never actually occurred. That is referred to in the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal's Broadcasting in Australia 1989 report, Sydney July 1990, at page 3. I do not have that in front of me, but that is the reference for it. So it did not occur.


The trigger for these amendments and for the previous bill I introduced was back in February 2013 when WIN TV decided to remove their local news bulletins in the south-east of South Australia, centred around Mount Gambier, and in the Riverland of South Australia, centred around their Loxton studio. At that stage, there had already been an aggregation of news services, so about half was from the south-east and half was from the Riverland, because of cost-cutting. I have had discussions about Bruce Gordon, the legendary Australian, the owner of WIN. I am not referring to Bruce Gordon in respect of this, but my understanding from speaking to those in television is that, because there was a requirement to have local content on the eastern seaboard but not one to have it in South Australia, it was much easier for there to be a rationalisation to get rid of the bulletins in South Australia's Riverland and in the south-east. I hope that explains to Senator Macdonald the history of that.


The issue of what consumers want is this. Advertisers are concerned about how many viewers are listed as watching a particular program. We have requirements in terms of local content more broadly. Advertisers are interested in how many viewers there are—the bang for their buck, in terms of advertising. I understand that. I am not being critical of them. Market failure is perhaps not the right way to put it, but it is a case where there was a community demand for those programs in terms of local sports coverage and local government coverage. Local politicians, state and federal, got good coverage about local issues. Particularly during the drought in South Australia, the Riverland WIN TV had a key role. WIN TV's local bulletin in the south-east of South Australia covered forestry issues exceptionally well, whereas the metropolitan media did not.


What I was trying to do through these amendments was to remedy what I saw as an anomaly under section 43A of the act: that other states were included, but South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory missed out—although there are regional differences between WA and the Northern Territory.

There is an anomaly in the legislation, in my view, given the way section 43A was operating. And there was an intention for it to be further reviewed but that review was never completed. I have made reference to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal's 1989 report Broadcasting in Australia. All I am trying to do with this amendment is to bring at least South Australia in line to deal with that particular issue.


The other issue is that producing local television content is quite different now than 20 or 30 years ago. A Betacam costs about $100,000. You can have broadcast quality equipment for $6,000 or $7,000, which journalists in the Southern Cross Network use out of Port Lincoln, Whyalla, Port Augusta and Port Pirie, and they seem to be able to put together a very comprehensive news bulletin. So I think the media has changed and it is just convenient to drop South Australia from that by virtue of a lack of a requirement in section 43A. I hope that answers Senator MacDonald's questions, but I think he has raised some very important issues. In terms of local advertisers, as long as they have got the viewers there they do not care whether they are watching The Bold and the Beautiful or the local news bulletin; what they are interested in is the number of eyes on the television set.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (13:32):  I thank Senator Xenophon for those answers. I acknowledge his passion for his electorate and the place where he gets votes. His passion for South Australia almost matches that of my colleagues on this side from South Australia—and one of them has just walked into the room. With respect, you almost get tired of the way they continually advocate for, promote and support South Australia. They are fabulous supporters of and advocates for South Australia—and Senator Xenophon is another one in that same category. Having said that, Senator Xenophon, I have heard what you have said. Thank you for your answers, but I am afraid you have not convinced me, so I will be voting against the amendment.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (13:33):  The Australian Greens will be supporting Senator Xenophon's amendment. I did listen to Senator Macdonald's contribution because I guess the committee stage is precisely so that these sorts of questions can be asked of the movers of amendments. For Senator Macdonald's benefit, a similar situation prevails in regional Western Australia. These networks have to be heavily regulated or they would barely exist at all—whether it be broadcast radio or broadcast television. Quite a strong framework of legislation remains in place around things like local content and the media regulations that were in part installed by a former iteration of your government, Senator Macdonald. My understanding of the amendments that Senator Xenophon has brought forward is that the very regulatory framework that prevails in regional Queensland, which does provide for a measure of local content—news, current affairs and so on—is lacking in the parts of regional Australia that Senator Xenophon has highlighted. This amendment will go some way towards enforcing a similar measure of regulation.


In a country as heavily urbanised as Australia it means that the representation that comes into this place will be predominantly representing urban or peri-urban electorates. I think it is important we keep in mind that, in regional areas, locally produced regional media can be a tremendously important voice. And that is partly why we stand up so strongly for regional ABC broadcasters—because, in some instances, commercial players simply cannot maintain that service. So we will be supporting this amendment when it is committed to a vote.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Social Services) (13:34):  I have enjoyed the contributions of my colleagues in the committee stage and I think it demonstrates one of the many virtues of the way this place operates. I think Senator Xenophon's proposition for an amendment to add regional South Australia to the list of commercial television licence areas that are subject to local content licence conditions has been well canvassed. While the government clearly does support the provision of local news and content to the people of South Australia, we believe the amendment proposed by Senator Xenophon is not necessary.


In 2013 the ACMA conducted an inquiry into the provision of local content in South Australia. It found that in Mount Gambier and the Riverland, the two licence areas where commercial television licensees do not produce local content, 86 per cent of residents were generally satisfied with the level of local content available. This included local content sourced from state based television news produced in Adelaide, services produced by the ABC and via commercial radio, print and online news sources. The ACMA concluded that the local content obligations were operating effectively and that there was no clear case for an extension of local content obligations to additional regional areas given the high level of satisfaction reported by residents in regard to their access to local content, the high cost of providing local content and the adverse financial impact this would have on the relevant licensees.


Senator Xenophon was not expecting government support on his amendment, and I confirm that.

 (South Australia) (13:36):  I am not intending to have a division. I am grateful that the opposition, the Greens and the government have indicated their positions. In relation to that ACMA report, there were criticisms about the methodology and the questions asked. I can tell you that, in the local communities of Mount Gambier, in the south-east and in the Riverland, there was a real sense of loss felt when those local bulletins went. It was not just political coverage—far from it—but sports and local coverage of issues of interest to the local communities. There was a powerful sense of loss of community. I do not think the ACMA survey was the be all and end all in its methodology and some of the questions asked.


Having said that, I am grateful for my colleagues indicating where they stand on this. I know the amendments will be defeated, but at least we have had that debate at this stage. But it will not go away. I still hope that Bruce Gordon one day will change his mind and bring back local content to the south-east and the Riverland.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2015-03-03,"



Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (13:40):  The opposition supports the Tax and Superannuation Laws Amendment (2014 Measures No. 7) Bill 2014 and the Excess Exploration Credit Tax Bill 2014. There are obviously a number of schedules in the bills before the parliament which deal with a range of issues such as the making of excess non-concessional superannuation contributions, the management of tax investigation and complaint-handling functions, the exemption of certain compensation payments from CGT, and other matters. In my remarks today I want to briefly focus on schedule 6, which introduces an exploration development incentive to encourage investment in small mineral exploration companies which are undertaking greenfield mineral exploration in Australia. It provides Australian resident shareholders of junior explorers with a refundable tax offset.


I will make some observations about this point. This is a measure which has been mooted for many years in Australia. In fact, there are several of these facilities which are already in place. I note that the minister's second reading speech in the other place alluded to the fact that these measures are designed in part to reverse the slump in exploration for mineral resources, and I want to make just a couple of points about that. Obviously, the opposition recognises the importance of exploration activities to Australia's resources sector and to our economy more broadly. These activities not only drive the exploration economy but obviously also are critical to the development and ultimately the production and export of these resources. We also understand the length of time which is associated with many of these projects. Western Mining found uranium in Olympic Dam, in South Australia, my home state, I think in the early 1970s, 1974 or thereabouts, and we recall that the first ore was not extracted until the mid-1980s.


When the Labor government was in office, there was an estimated $270 billion in committed capital investments, and direct employment in resource operations across our country was some 250,000 people. In the first year of this government, we have seen this reduced to employment of under 230,000. We have seen significant decreases in mining exploration. If the government were in opposition now, no doubt it would rail as to why this was entirely the government's fault. I would make this point: the exploration cycle, the exploration economy, is largely driven by the commodity cycle, and no amount of partisan posturing by those opposite can get away from the fundamental economics, which are these. The incentive to explore, for example for iron ore, is high when the iron price is high, and clearly, when the iron ore price is dropping to the levels we have seen, there is not only pressure to contain costs but also less financial incentive and economic incentive for exploration activity.


In Australia we had a flow-through share scheme similar to this in the 1950s, which was subsequently curtailed in 1973. Another scheme was introduced in the late seventies under the Fraser government. It was wound up in 1985. Those schemes over that period were based on providing tax deduction on funds invested in resources companies for the purpose of exploration. The scheme was abolished because it was used for tax avoidance, and inquiries found that it contributed little towards mineral exploration. The flow-through share scheme, which operated in the period 1978 to 1985, was predicated on the provision of a rebate.


Labor is supporting the measure before the chamber. We want to make clear that we want this measure to work. We also recognise, however, the economics and the cost pressures which are currently facing the industry. These are amply demonstrated by the Resources and Energy Quarterly issued by the Department of Industry last year, which showed that exploration expenditure declined by some 29 per cent year on year in the September quarter as lower commodity prices encouraged firms to look at cost reduction, including reduced exploration activity, across the mineral sector. The report says:


With lower commodity prices forecast in 2014-15, a rebound in exploration expenditure appears unlikely in the short term. While minerals exploration declined, exploration for petroleum increased.


That fact was driven by many different factors, some associated with coal seam gas extraction on the east coast. The report also notes:


... the rapid decline in oil prices may affect petroleum exploration expenditure over the remainder of 2014-15.


Exploration at new deposits fell 47 per cent compared with the September quarter of 2013, while exploration at existing deposits fell 18 per cent. In the September quarter alone, exploration expenditure in Western Australia fell 25 per cent, year on year, to less than $860 million. The only jurisdiction showing a difference to that was the Northern Territory, where exploration expenditure increased by 43 per cent. Every other state has shown large declines in exploration expenditure.


The exploration economy is ultimately driven by global markets and prices. Whilst a tax break may make policy sense and economic sense, fundamentally the economics of global markets and prices will be the fundamental drivers of exploration activity.


The slump in the price of iron ore and the significant increase in Australian supply—which have been well documented—have reduced the incentive to search for new deposits. Based on forecast lower prices in 2015, projected expenditure for exploration for iron ore may not rebound in the short term.


If we look at other commodity groups we see similar stories. If we look at coal, we see Australia's coal exports in thermal coal under pressure on price and on industries and businesses performing. But Australia's coal exploration expenditure in the September quarter was around $80 million—about one per cent lower than the preceding quarter and 27 per cent lower than the September quarter 2013. Lower coal prices self-evidently reduced the incentive to invest in exploration during 2014.


It is interesting to note that partisan politics by some in this place and in the other place have seen government senators and members assert that exploration has fallen off because of the former Labor government's policy settings. That is inaccurate, and it is another example of this government's partisan politics, demonstrating their willingness to engage in a fear campaign and in political partisanship rather than understanding the economic issues at hand. The real reason exploration dollars have been held back is that commodity prices have fallen.


Ultimately, exploration activities are not driven by the taxation regime—a point made ably by my colleague Mr Gray in the other place. Exploration activities are driven by a belief that there are minerals out there which can be found and that there are customers who need those minerals, and by a great belief in the mission that our explorers have to do their jobs as well as they can and as safely as they can.


Minerals exploration in Australia has been supported by innovative and creative programs that have been put together by Geoscience Australia and, through Geoscience Australia, by state government exploration programs. In South Australia, the PACE program drove the discovery of the Carrapateena resource in 2006. It is an impressive resource discovery—a copper-gold formation near the Woomera Prohibited Area and near Roxby Downs in northern South Australia. It is one of the discoveries that we hope will drive new minerals production through the coming decade and, hopefully, for 20 years. But, obviously, it was not discovered as a consequence of a tax break. It was discovered because of the prize or the outcome, because of the economics, because of the international commodity price cycle, because of the belief by minerals explorers that their understanding of the geology was superior, and by their scientific conviction that they could find a resource in the area in which they were looking. This is the spirit that drives exploration.


Labor will watch with great interest how the mechanism before the chamber works in practice. It is a thoughtfully constructed mechanism. It is also expensive. It costs a significant amount of money, but it is a mechanism that we hope will add some incentive to an industry that is currently facing some challenges for the economic reasons that I have outlined.


Exploration for minerals does drive significant economic development. It is one of the most substantial ways in which regional development can occur. The discovery of nickel, gold or copper, the discovery of a new iron ore belt or the discovery of uranium can drive the construction of a town, a locality or a region. It is work that has enabled many lives to be enriched. It has enabled prosperity through employment for local communities and because of investment in infrastructure and the like.


The opposition does support these bills before the Senate. We look forward to their prompt passage.

Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia) (13:50):  I am also grateful for the opportunity this afternoon to make a contribution on these bills today, because their provisions give effect to a very important aspect of public policy for my home state of Western Australia—namely, the exploration development incentive.


This is consistent with a promise the coalition made prior to the 2013 federal election, to provide an incentive to undertake exploration for mineral resources. I think all of us in this place have an understanding of just how important the mining sector is to our economy, although the Greens never miss an opportunity to try and damage that sector. I note, disappointingly, that they are opposing this legislation today.


Together with the Labor Party, the Greens spent six years finding ways to frustrate Australia's mining and resources sector. Their showpiece, of course, was the shambolic, discredited and now, thankfully, abolished mining tax. Labor's mining tax failed to go close to raising—




Senator Wong:
  There was less exploration under you.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Seselja
):  Order! Senator Wong, you have had your opportunity. Now Senator Smith has his opportunity.




Senator SMITH:
  I am excited that the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate is paying such close attention to my speech this afternoon, and I look forward to her conversion as more of my evidence—




Senator Wong:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, a point of order: there is less exploration under your government than under ours.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  We do not need frivolous points of order. You know that is not a point of order.




Senator SMITH:
  As I was saying, Labor's mining tax failed to go close to raising the levels of revenue the former government anticipated—although of course that did not stop Labor from locking in billions of dollars in spending on the basis of that unrealised revenue, including cynical pre-election promises made to regional communities across my home state of Western Australia. Labor made promises to regional communities that they would receive significant new infrastructure projects, all the while knowing that there was no money there to fund them. The cynicism was sickening.


Abolishing the mining tax will save the budget around $50 billion over the next decade. The exploration development incentive contained in this bill is a recognition that mining is a capital-intensive undertaking. It is high risk, and if the sector is to continue growing and creating jobs we need to provide some support to smaller mining companies, particularly when they are commencing their operations. There is some history to this issue, of course. The Henry tax review, no less, recommended that if earlier access to tax benefits from exploration expenses is provided then it should take the form of a refundable tax offset at the company level for exploration expenses incurred by Australian small listed exploration companies, with the offset set at the company income tax rate. Smaller miners have long called for a recognition in taxation arrangements of the long lead times between investment, exploration and production. Small exploration companies often must wait many years before tax losses from exploration expenses can be utilised. Many will never generate sufficient income to utilise their losses.


This government is committed to doing something to assist in a responsible, economically effective manner. The tax offsets provided though the incentive set out in this bill are capped at $100 million over three years. Schedule 6 of the bill provides refundable tax offsets to shareholders of small mineral exploration companies undertaking greenfields exploration activities. The discovery of new resources is, self-evidently, vital for the future of the mining and resources sector, certainly in my home state of Western Australia but across the whole country no less, as existing resources are depleted.


Exploration is high-risk, but it can also be of very high reward in terms of job creation and in terms of revenue flowing to government through royalties. The exploration development incentive is a recognition of this important fact. It is an investment in the future of Australia's mining sector. The plain fact is that smaller mining companies have been experiencing difficulties in raising the sort of capital they need to continue exploration activities. And of course exploration underpins development. You cannot have minerals and resource development unless you have minerals and resource exploration. Greenfields exploration has fallen as a proportion of total exploration from 40 per cent to 33 per cent over the last decade. The exploration development incentive is a show of good faith by this government in the mining and resources sector. We understand that our continued economic prosperity is dependent on the ability of smaller companies to make new mineral discoveries.


I cannot stress how important this commitment will be to my home state of Western Australia, and I am pleased that it has been welcomed by the Association of Mining and Exploration Companies, who have noted:


The EDI will encourage much-needed investment in greenfields exploration which is at historic lows. It will also create jobs for exploration support services such as drilling contractors and geoscientists.


Along with the repeal of the carbon tax and the mining tax, the establishment of the exploration development incentive is another demonstration of the government's commitment to a sustainable, profitable and job-creating mining and resources sector that will continue to contribute to the nation's economic health for decades to come.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (13:56):  Perhaps I can get in a few quick comments in response to Senator Smith talking about it being necessary for mining exploration companies, be they oil and gas or be they other minerals, to have a free ride on behalf of the Australian taxpayer. Having been a stockbroker in a former life, I understand risk return quite well, and I know that most of these companies raise capital from their shareholders and are in a high-risk business. And anybody who buys equity in their shares understands that it is a very large risk-reward pay-off.


Why the Australian taxpayer should be taking that risk on behalf of mining exploration companies is totally beyond the Greens. We see corporate welfare right across the board with the Liberal-Nationals party. Let us have a look at the big picture in the Australian mining industry. We have had accelerated depreciation for capital, material and exploration in place for some time now. We have seen fuel tax credits and the removal of the mineral resources rent tax, which let the big miners off the hook. While we are trying to slug poorer Australians, who can least afford it, we let the big miners off the hook. We have had the carbon price removed—the carbon price that taxes the dirty polluters that are causing externalities that are leading to the rapid demise of our planet, and we have seen fugitive emissions from fuel use. And now, on top of this, we are in disbelief that we are letting high-risk mining explorers off the hook as well by giving them subsidies from the Australian taxpayer.


Let me ask this question: if I go out and explore for gold and 300 metres under the surface I find some rich mineralisation and my share price goes through the roof, do I give that money back to the Australian taxpayer? No, I do not. I buy myself a 50-foot boat, I get a mooring at Rottnest and I live the good life for a long time. I do not give that money back to the Australian taxpayer. So, let's get this straight: no more corporate welfare for the mining industry.

Exploration is high-risk, but it can also be of very high reward in terms of job creation and in terms of revenue flowing to government through royalties. The exploration development incentive is a recognition of this important fact. It is an investment in the future of Australia's mining sector. The plain fact is that smaller mining companies have been experiencing difficulties in raising the sort of capital they need to continue exploration activities. And of course exploration underpins development. You cannot have minerals and resource development unless you have minerals and resource exploration. Greenfields exploration has fallen as a proportion of total exploration from 40 per cent to 33 per cent over the last decade. The exploration development incentive is a show of good faith by this government in the mining and resources sector. We understand that our continued economic prosperity is dependent on the ability of smaller companies to make new mineral discoveries.


I cannot stress how important this commitment will be to my home state of Western Australia, and I am pleased that it has been welcomed by the Association of Mining and Exploration Companies, who have noted:


The EDI will encourage much-needed investment in greenfields exploration which is at historic lows. It will also create jobs for exploration support services such as drilling contractors and geoscientists.


Along with the repeal of the carbon tax and the mining tax, the establishment of the exploration development incentive is another demonstration of the government's commitment to a sustainable, profitable and job-creating mining and resources sector that will continue to contribute to the nation's economic health for decades to come.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (13:56):  Perhaps I can get in a few quick comments in response to Senator Smith talking about it being necessary for mining exploration companies, be they oil and gas or be they other minerals, to have a free ride on behalf of the Australian taxpayer. Having been a stockbroker in a former life, I understand risk return quite well, and I know that most of these companies raise capital from their shareholders and are in a high-risk business. And anybody who buys equity in their shares understands that it is a very large risk-reward pay-off.


Why the Australian taxpayer should be taking that risk on behalf of mining exploration companies is totally beyond the Greens. We see corporate welfare right across the board with the Liberal-Nationals party. Let us have a look at the big picture in the Australian mining industry. We have had accelerated depreciation for capital, material and exploration in place for some time now. We have seen fuel tax credits and the removal of the mineral resources rent tax, which let the big miners off the hook. While we are trying to slug poorer Australians, who can least afford it, we let the big miners off the hook. We have had the carbon price removed—the carbon price that taxes the dirty polluters that are causing externalities that are leading to the rapid demise of our planet, and we have seen fugitive emissions from fuel use. And now, on top of this, we are in disbelief that we are letting high-risk mining explorers off the hook as well by giving them subsidies from the Australian taxpayer.


Let me ask this question: if I go out and explore for gold and 300 metres under the surface I find some rich mineralisation and my share price goes through the roof, do I give that money back to the Australian taxpayer? No, I do not. I buy myself a 50-foot boat, I get a mooring at Rottnest and I live the good life for a long time. I do not give that money back to the Australian taxpayer. So, let's get this straight: no more corporate welfare for the mining industry.

 (Tasmania—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service and Minister for Employment) (14:01):  I recall somebody in this chamber saying that the emissions trading scheme and the carbon tax was the greatest moral challenge of our time, and then we saw them dump it. Senator Wong hardly comes with any credibility to this debate. Governments do from time to time change their position—




Senator Moore:
  Mr President, I rise on a point of order on direct relevance to the question asked by Senator Wong. We have not got near an answer—we have heard about previous governments.



The PRESIDENT:  The minister has more than half of his time left to answer the question. I remind the minister of the question.




Senator ABETZ:
  In relation to Medicare, we make no apology for saying that we are concerned about its sustainability, especially in circumstances where spending on Medicare has more than doubled in the last decade, from $8 billion in 2004 to $20 billion today, and it is expected to climb even higher, to $34 billion, by 2024. That is the trajectory and any responsible government would seek to deal—




Senator Moore:
  Mr President, I again raise a point of order on direct relevance. The question was about the Prime Minister's claim about the GP tax. We have not got close to that, and there are six seconds left.

Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service and Minister for Employment) (14:03):  The short answer to that is no. Prime Minister Abbott was an exceptionally good minister for health and a very, very good friend of Medicare. Everybody in Australia who has any depth of knowledge in the health area acknowledges that. Of course those opposite do not have that depth of knowledge and that is why we have these immature squeaks of laughter from them when those facts are laid on the table. The government and the Prime Minister are absolutely concerned to make sure that Medicare is sustainable into the future. The big question is, what is Labor's answer to this dilemma or indeed any other dilemma that the Australian people face in the budgetary context? It is borrow, borrow, borrow, borrow and to hell with the next generation. They are not concerned about deferring today's responsibilities to the next generation but we are concerned about that. We want to ensure that the budget parameters, in health as well, are within the confines of a responsible budget. (Time expired)

Senator McLUCAS
 (Queensland) (15:04):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Employment (Senator Abetz) to a question without notice asked by Senator Wong today relating to co-payments for medical services.


Today we saw the next chapter in the saga of dysfunction and chaos that is the Abbott government. What we heard announced this morning by Minister Ley was not designed for the health of our country. It was not designed to improve our health system or to make sure that our doctors are treating patients in a timely way. It was designed for one thing and one thing only. It was designed to save the job of the Prime Minister. Mr Abbott is so desperate to keep his leadership on life support and to save his skin in the next leadership spill that he has made what is, in fact, the fourth policy change in the health financing space since coming into government. This is the only reason Mr Abbott is suggesting changes to the GP tax. He thinks this is the way to keep the support of the backbenchers who are ready—we know from reading the papers—to get rid of him.


Whatever the government tells us today, the truth is that Mr Abbott and this government remain committed to imposing a GP tax on our community. This morning Minister Ley was asked a question—a very similar question to the one Senator Wong asked of Senator Abetz—about whether the policy intent, to impose a GP tax on the Australian community, was a good one. Her words, and I wrote them down myself—I am not reading from a transcript—were, 'The policy intent was and remains a good one.' That makes it very clear. That is a bit different from the answer that Minister Abetz gave to Senator Wong when she asked, 'Does the Prime Minister stand by his claim that his unfair GP tax is ""good policy""?' Senator Abetz avoided answering that question, but Minister Ley did answer it. She said, 'The policy intent was and remains a good one.' The Australian people are now warned. We know what is about to happen; we know what is coming down. We know that, one way or another, this Liberal government will impose a payment on Australians attending the doctor. We have heard it called a number of things. It was a 'small co-payment' from some. Then we heard the 'value' description, where we had to put a 'value signal' on going to the doctor


That is gone now today, apparently. But what we have seen is the minister saying that today we will remove the $5 tax on going to the doctor, and we will consult more.


The Senate Select Committee on Health has been consulting too. They have heard that doctors have been spending hours upon hours having to respond to the now four policy positions of this government when it comes to the price of going to the doctor. We have seen the $7 GP tax, we have seen the $20 cut, we have seen the $5 tax and we have seen the four years worth of cuts to Medicare rebates. This has resulted in chaos and dysfunction in the Liberal Party—we have all seen that. But it has also resulted in chaos and dysfunction and work being done in the small businesses that are doctors' surgeries right across this country. We have also seen, though, another impact as well. Not only have we seen doctors having to respond to four different policy positions of the government, we now know that there have been delays in people attending doctors. We know that there have been delays in people undertaking the right level of pathology that their doctors are telling them to do.



We need a policy that has Medicare at its heart. We want a policy that will deliver good quality health outcomes to our community. We want a policy that values the universality of Medicare. We want a policy that Labor will support, and that is a Medicare which is sustainable. It is an absolute furphy to say that Medicare in its current iteration is unsustainable. Rather than quote whole figures, let's start having a look at Medicare expenses as a proportion of GDP. (Time expired)

(ii) farming has occurred on the Liverpool Plains for generations and the agricultural productivity of the area is up to 40 per cent above the national average for all farming regions of Australia,


(iii) highly productive agricultural land, like that of the Liverpool Plains, is a finite resource,

The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator FIFIELD:
  On behalf of the environment minister, I say it is not the place of the Senate to dictate land-use decisions in New South Wales. Australia's government involvement in this project is limited to matters of national environmental significance and, appropriately, the project is being assessed in accordance with requirements of national environmental law.


Minister Hunt has visited the Liverpool Plains and is keenly aware of the community's concerns. On Friday, Minister Hunt announced he would stop the clock on Australian government assessment of the project and requested additional advice from the Independent Expert Scientific Committee on Coal Seam Gas and Large Coal Mining Development.


This will ensure that any decision made under national environmental law is based on the best available science. Minister Hunt takes his responsibility under the national environmental law very seriously and seeking this further information will ensure that the assessment is robust and based on the best possible scientific information. The minister has assured the community that no decision will be made until he has had time to fully consider all relevant information.

Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (15:57):  by leave—Senator Day and I have sought today's 10-minute allocation for the crossbench. We are the sponsors of the bill on this matter. We have been allocated none of the crossbench allocation for speaking in urgency motions or MPIs since we started in the Senate in July. By contrast, the Greens have been allocated 54 of the 80 minutes of MPI and urgency motion time since December and a higher proportion in the previous period.


We would be comfortable with the Greens receiving an allocation of today's crossbench time based on their proportion of the crossbench, but we need an agreement that this occur in each MPI and urgency debate—including those where they propose the topic. To date, the position of the Greens has been to use all the crossbench allocation for MPIs and urgency debates when they propose the topic and half the allocation when they do not propose the topic. This is not proportionality.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2015-03-03,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (15:58):  by leave—The amount of time that is allocated for the crossbench during MPIs is 10 minutes. The Greens make up over half the crossbench. We have five minutes allocated during this particular time and the rest of the crossbench gets the other five minutes. It is up to them to work out how to deal with it.


I will note that yesterday was our MPI, and of the 20 minutes that we were due we used nine and gave the rest to the crossbench. So, there is time allocated for the crossbench. It is not the Greens' job to organise the rest of the crossbench; that is up to them—how they allocate their five minutes. But we chose to use the five minutes that we are due as the proportion of the crossbench time.



The PRESIDENT:  What has been presented to me is a list with allocated speaking times for all but two of the list, and the two on the list are the two crossbench allocations of time. So what you are indicating to me—and, again, if it is the will of the Senate—is that we allocate five minutes to each of those two crossbench times? Is that what is being suggested? Because at the moment it is blank, which would have meant the call would have been given to a crossbench senator and the first crossbench senator could have spoken for any amount of time up to 10 minutes. So, unless I have any objection from the Senate, I take it that the list that has been circulated with times where it does not include times for crossbench is a five-minute allocation for two crossbench senators. There is a total of 10 minutes, but on the list presented to me there are two segments for crossbenches.




Senator SIEWERT:
  A point of clarification: it is up to the rest of the crossbench to decide how they want to contribute the other five minutes. If Senators Leyonhjelm and Day want to share that, I suggest that is up to them.



The PRESIDENT:  I will again seek advice. You are suggesting one of those items should be Greens rather than crossbench. Is there any objection to that? For further clarification, I will make the first allocation to the Greens party and the second allocation where it says crossbench to crossbench senators. I assume we will have some indication from crossbenches during the debate as to who the call will go to. Is everyone comfortable with those arrangements? I will now call Senator Singh.

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2015-03-03,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (16:01):  I speak to this matter of public importance because it is clearly about the Abbott government's confused and chaotic approach to hate speech but on top of that the division within the coalition on its approach to hate speech. None of us in this Senate will forget Senator Brandis's now infamous claims that 'People do have a right to be bigots, you know.' I am sure that Senator Brandis's coalition colleagues will never forget this clumsy and offensive remark that he made at that time. Senator Brandis's judgement at that time came under attack from that very moment on as he attempted to implement his foolish commitment to destroying section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act.


But what we have had since that time is chaos and confusion on the side of the government—so much so that we had the backflip on Senator Brandis's commitment that he and his colleague Andrew Bolt wanted to see change in the Racial Discrimination Act last year. There was a backflip on that put in place by pressure from the Prime Minister, and since that time it has seemed the government wants to go even harder to restrict freedom of speech for certain ethnic groups in our community.


You have that going on in one side of the executive of the government. On the other side you have coalition members—backbenchers like Senator Smith, for example—



Senator Edwards interjecting—




Senator SINGH:
  and Senator Edwards, as he points to himself—wanting to bring it all back on again with section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. We all recall very clearly how categorical the Attorney-General was that a government should never, in the interests of freedom of speech, be in the business of penalising people who hold objectionable views, in saying so absolutely ignoring section 18D of our Racial Discrimination Act. Having said that, now what we have is the government's acceptance of objectionable views that does not extend to objectionable views expressed by certain ethnic groups—notably, for example, the Muslim community. To quote Mike Seccombe in The Saturday Paper:


""People do have a right to be bigots, you know."" But only, it now appears, if they are government-friendly bigots.


When will this government say what it means and do what it says? We have had backflip after backflip if we want to talk about the GP tax or paid parental leave. Now there is section 18C, which we thought perhaps was dead, buried and cremated just like we thought Work Choices was, but it does not take long before it starts raising its ugly head again. They are all over the place on this issue.


We know clearly that after coming into government Senator Brandis published an exposure draft of his bigots' charter. Media reports followed, soon revealing that he had not originally intended to adopt a consultative approach to winding back section 18C at all; rather, Senator Brandis's preference was to ram legislation through the parliament without even a hint of public consultation. Well, the public consultation that he then put in place was pretty much a joke anyway. But, having said that, the broader community took him at his word and participated in that public consultation in a fairly big way, so much so that the Attorney-General got bombarded with so many submissions—submissions that he never released publicly, though some of the submitters themselves did—and we know clearly that the overwhelming majority of those submissions were against changes to 18C. It was that pressure by so many ethnic communities, so many people in the broader community, the legal fraternity and the NGO sector that led to Prime Minister Tony Abbott intervening on Senator Brandis's grand plan to wind back section 18C and ditch the whole thing.


We have had a ditching of the whole thing since August, but now we know the rumblings are there. Now we know that it is back on the agenda, isn't it, Senator Edwards? Isn't it, Senator Smith? And we know that we have the support of the crossbench in doing so. Senator Brandis needs to come into this chamber and make clear what this government's policy on racial discrimination laws in this country is. Where are they today? What is the weather today? Is it raining? Is it sunshine? Because it seems to change on a daily basis, just like every other policy issue this government puts in place. They are not fit to govern because they are a rabble. They do not know what they stand for; they are all over the place. In the meantime, it is people of various different racial backgrounds who are the victims of this government's delusional approach when it comes to racial discrimination laws. It is Labor's hope that our current racial discrimination laws—which include section 18C and section 18D, which addresses freedom of speech—remain as is. As they have continued to work for a number of years now, they do not need to be touched.


We in the Labor Party believe that Australia's political leaders ought to focus their energies on bringing people together—on inclusiveness and protecting the social cohesion that underpins our proud and successful multicultural country. That is what leaders should be doing, not trying to create division among various community groups; not trying to create division amongst the broader community. It is really disappointing to hear some voices from within the coalition who seem to feel their energies are better directed at prosecuting an agenda of intolerance, bigotry, fear and hatred than an agenda of inclusiveness, compassion and equality.


Section 18C has been used to combat the vilest forms of hate speech. Those coalition senators should read some of the case law in this area and realise that. Hate speech is behaviour the Labor Party believes has no place in a civilised society. I will refresh those coalition senators' memories on some of that case law. There is the case of Jones v Tobin, when section 18C was used to combat infamous Holocaust denier Frederick Tobin who sickeningly claimed that there is serious doubt that the Holocaust actually occurred. Shame! That case law used section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. Before coalition senators come into this place with a bill which removes that provision, they need to read back through that case law and think seriously about what they are trying to do to this country by removing those protections as they currently stand.


The Labor Party does not believe this sickening attack has any place in Australian society. If coalition senators want to vote to support Frederick Tobin and his ilk, then the Australian people will judge them accordingly. The Labor Party opposes this type of behaviour. Today, coalition senators in this place must decide how they see this provision in that light. They must reflect on that case law when they are reflecting on their position and their beliefs, and their so-called 'principled' position on racial discrimination law. They could also, perhaps, talk to the Attorney and the Prime Minister, because the last thing the Australian community heard from them was that section 18C was off the table.


So where is the coalition on this position? It is in a completely different place to the Labor Party, which stands for inclusion and for section 18C remaining in our Racial Discrimination Act.

"Edwards, Sen Sean",LP,2015-03-03,"



Senator EDWARDS
 (South Australia) (16:11):  It strikes me that Senator Singh, across on the other side of the chamber, is relying a lot on theatre and melodrama to make up for a lot of ignorance. The mere contention—




Senator Singh:
  Mr President, I rise on a point of order. I find that objectionable. That is an objectionable comment made by Senator Edwards and he should know better than that, especially in addressing that comment to me.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Back
):  Is the point of order on the word 'ignorance', Senator Singh?




Senator Singh:
  Yes.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Certainly. Senator Edwards, I invite you to change that word in your vocabulary.




Senator EDWARDS:
  I withdraw the word 'ignorance' and would perhaps insert the words 'lack of knowledge'.


What an extraordinary outburst. I am on the record and, indeed, have written about this subject. Obviously I was disappointed when the government decided not to proceed with these changes but I know that, in a good government and a pragmatic government, you get on with the big priorities and that is the way in which the leadership of the government saw it.


Senator Moore, you remind us today just how much the Labor Party has become a party of impressions. You see, they are very good on the other side over there, in Labor, of creating the impression that they stand for things, but they are not very good at following through with principled policymaking. They create the impression they support workers, but driving down economic growth hardly creates jobs. They create the impression that they support Defence, but cutting 10 per cent from its budget is hardly consistent with that. And they create the impression they support free speech, but alas—the evidence is they do no such thing.


Labor projected all of the rhetoric which created the impression they supported Charlie Hebdo and its murdered staff in the cause of free speech, but in practice they support the very legislation that would prevent that magazine from being published. On this side of the chamber our rhetoric matches our actions. We appreciate that free speech is a serious issue and one that requires a serious response; and where free speech overlaps with national security imperatives it is even more serious.


These are matters we would prefer to tackle on a bipartisan basis, if that is not beyond the Labor Party. When our enemies weaponise words and information to use against us, there is no place for playing politics. The facts are that there are people in our community who are preaching hatred and violence. They do so aiming to influence our young men and women to travel overseas to fight with or support terrorist groups who are in battle with this nation's armed forces, and they do so with the aim of influencing them to commit violence here in Australia too. To this end the Prime Minister and senior ministers regularly condemn hate preachers with their words and their actions.


The government introduced the foreign fighters bill last year, which included strong prohibitions against the advocacy of terrorism. The Attorney-General announced not two weeks ago that the government will provide nearly $18 million in funding to combat the lies and the propaganda that terrorist groups and their advocates circulate online. This will empower the government and community members themselves to directly challenge propaganda with the full force of the law at their side. The Combating Terrorist Propaganda Online initiative will limit the impact of extremist narratives on domestic audiences by reducing the support that terrorist groups garner on the internet and via social media.


We will establish a social media monitoring and analysis capability in order to better understand extremist narratives and how they influence Australians. The measures will also help reduce access to extremist material online through the recently launched 'report online extremism' tool. And we will work the with the Australian Communications and Media Authority, the private sector and international partners to take down or otherwise address extremist content.


So the government is taking a dynamic approach to its communications to better contest the online environment. This will include promoting material online that challenges the claims of terrorists and shares the benefits of Australia's diversity, inclusion, democracy and social values. This is not work that governments can do alone.  As the Prime Minister said recently:


The terrorist threat is rising at home and abroad – and it's becoming harder to combat.


… … …


By any measure, the threat to Australia is worsening.


… … …


The number of foreign fighters is up.


The number of known sympathisers and supporters of extremism is up.


The number of potential home grown terrorists is rising.


… … …


There is no grievance here that can be addressed; there is no cause here that can be satisfied; it is the demand to submit - or die.


And so the government and communities are already working to help susceptible individuals reject terrorist propaganda, by questioning the assertions, inconsistencies and false allegations and by bringing to light the brutality of extremist groups. There will also be stronger prohibitions on vilifying, intimidating or inciting hatred. These changes will empower us to directly challenge terrorist propaganda.


The government is deeply committed to its freedom agenda, which includes advancing measures to protect freedom of speech, freedom of religion and other traditional rights and liberties. The government is working closely with the community to combat radicalisation and extremism through the promotion of acceptance and tolerance.


We believe in an Australia where everybody is free to speak their mind. We believe in an Australia in which rights are accompanied by responsibilities. We believe in an Australia in which there is absolutely no place for racism, and all of our citizens live in a harmonious and mutually respectful society. Unlike those opposite, not only do we tell you what we believe in—all of this—but we are acting to see that it happens.


I hope that the contributions to the rest of this debate can be a little more balanced and less prejudicial than the last contribution we had from Labor, from Senator Singh. Thank you.

"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2015-03-03,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria) (16:20):  We hear a lot about freedom and individual liberties in this place. We hear about how critical they are and how important they are for a democracy such as ours. It is usually from the conservative side of politics. Whenever a reform is introduced that might come up against the notion of freedom and liberty, terms like 'nanny state' are thrown around. We hear it time and time again.


We saw recently the unedifying spectacle of changes to the Racial Discrimination Act—not because of any concern from the community but because of course our friends at the IPA and mates at News Corporation wanted to see changes to our hate speech laws. But that issue was so imp. It was a touchstone issue for the conservative side of politics. It was fundamental to our democracy. We have to protect freedom of speech at every opportunity. We have to make sure that people have the right to say what they think, even if it provides offence to others. This is such a core principle that we are prepared to fight a campaign on an unpopular issue to see this law changed.


But let me tell you a test of principle is not being able to make an argument in a chamber like this when you have not been under pressure. A test of how committed you are to a core principle is whether you can stick by that principle when you are under pressure, when you have your back against the wall. That is a test of principle. And, on that test, this government has comprehensively failed.


This was such a touchstone issue such an important issue for this government that when this Prime Minister found himself under fire found his leadership threatened, where does he go?


He goes into the gutter. What does he pull out of his bag of tricks? Let's start banging the terrorism drum. Let's start talking about those Muslims out there and their hate speech. Let's talk about the importance of sending our troops overseas because we are under threat. Let's stoke fear and division in the community, because now it is not a principle of freedom and liberty—it is a principle of political survival. And political survival will trump everything when it comes to this government.


We had the disgraceful words of the Prime Minister, who, in response to the really difficult issue of terrorism—one that everyone in this place is grappling with—sends a message out to the Islamic community calling them liars, saying that what they need to do is not just say that they are opposed to terrorism but mean it, because the subtext is: 'You don't—you support it and you're stoking it.' How disgraceful. How disgraceful for a Prime Minister, whose job it is to lead this country, to come out and accuse those people, whose sons and daughters are being corrupted by what we are currently seeing and some of whom are leaving their families to combat this extraordinarily despicable war in the Middle East, of contributing to that, of condoning it. What a despicable act from a Prime Minister whose job it should be to unite the community, to provide some calm and reassurance and to bring us together.


Of course, hate speech is now no longer a problem. Ensuring that people have got the ability to express how they feel is no longer a core principle. What is more important is that we crack down on those people who we think are promoting this sort of activity. Do you know why? Because it is okay to be a bigot, but not if you are a Muslim. If you are a Muslim, we have got a different set of laws for you. We have got one set of laws for our mates at News Corp and the IPA, and we have got a different set of laws for those of you who find yourself the target of this government's policy. Principle is not expedient. If you are committed to the principle of free speech, then you stick to that through thick and thin. You stick to it whether your job depends upon it or whether you are sailing well in the polls.


This government has failed that test. It has demonstrated that when it comes to its own political survival it will say or do anything, even if that means going against the very core beliefs that it argued in this place only a short time ago. Either you believe in freedom or you do not. And this government has shown that, when the circumstances change, it too will change on those core beliefs. Freedom and liberty are only something to be supported when the circumstances demand it. (Time expired)

"Peris, Sen Nova",ALP,2015-03-03,"



Senator PERIS
 (Northern Territory) (16:25):  I also rise to talk to the matter of public importance on the Abbott government's confused and chaotic approach to hate speech provisions in the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. It really saddens me that we are still having to discuss this issue. It saddens me that last year when the Australian parliament was having a debate about whether it was okay to be a bigot, whether we needed to protect the rights of bigots, that the government said we did. The Attorney-General of Australia justified changing the Racial Discrimination Act because we needed to protect the rights of bigots. I really thought that this country had moved far beyond this and it saddens me that we are still forced to debate this issue.


For those of you who have forgotten, I will go back and quickly recap what has just brought us here. Last year the Abbott government announced that they would repeal section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act and there was enormous widespread opposition from thousands of community groups across this country. In fact, the only support came from groups and individuals who have never suffered racial discrimination. I heard Senator Edwards talking previously, saying that this is about free speech. I can remind him that, under pressure, the Attorney-General said in response to a question which I asked him in this chamber: 'People do have a right to be bigots.' Right then and there the cat was let out of the bag. This was not about protecting free speech; it was about protecting hate speech. And the Attorney-General defended the rights of Australians to be bigots.


I accept that the Attorney-General has suffered abuse; perhaps we all have. He feels he has suffered vilification at times, but he has never suffered racial vilification. He will never know what it is like to be abused because of the colour of your skin or because you belong to an ethnic minority group. He will never know what it is like and he has only listened to the people who will never know what it is like.


I have talked previously in the house about the devastating impact that racial abuse can have, and I could go on and on and on for days. For three months after the Attorney made the statement, the government continued to push ahead with the case. They continued to argue that the laws should be changed. In fact, I actually wrote to the Prime Minister, pointing out that his insistence to push ahead with changes to section 18C was compromising progress towards constitutional recognition. And guess what? The Prime Minister dismissed everything that I outlined in that letter. The government continued to argue that the laws should be changed, but the public continued to argue that the laws were a green light to racism and, finally, the Prime Minister caved in to the public pressure. But he did not say that the changes he was proposing were wrong. He even admitted that he rang Andrew Bolt to apologise for not implementing them. It was just about politics. He just said that the timing was wrong, because he wanted everyone to be part of Team Australia. We know that he still wanted to protect the rights of bigots—just not now. Perhaps later. But what he was doing was giving the green light to race hate speech.


Where are we right now? We are back at the drawing board and we now have a whole lot of government senators promising to continue to support the watering down of this legislation. Of all the things that the government have done, it is this that they choose to rebel on. They are not going to cross the floor on Medicare or higher education fees or cuts to the poorest people in society, but they will cross the floor to support the fight to protect bigots. It speaks volumes about their priorities. It also shows that they have given the nod—perhaps a wink. They know that they have permission to cross the floor, that it will perhaps be good for their career later on, and that they are not really opposing the Prime Minister. They know that, despite what he might say publicly, they have the support of the Prime Minister to continue to vote for the watering down of racial discrimination laws. The message that has been sent is very clear. They are telling their supporters not to worry: 'we still want to protect the rights of bigots.'


We have seen the hypocrisy of late. The government have announced that, in the name of national security, they want to crack down on free speech. They are essentially saying that if you are a member of a minority group you do not get the right of free speech, but you can have all the free speech you like if you are attacking a minority group. That is the message this government is sending.


There are senators in this place who have outlined their intention to vote in support of watering down these racial discrimination laws. I think that it is shameful; but, sadly, I am not surprised. As I have said, I find it really disappointing that this parliament is even having this debate. This community has moved on. Sporting associations and sporting bodies in Australia and internationally have all moved on. They all have rules against racial discrimination in any form and they run the highest public campaigns across this country. This parliament is the opposite. We are still debating whether bigots have rights. What an international embarrassment we will be as a parliament to endorse bigotry.


The Racial Discrimination Act has served Australia well for 20 years. It sends a message of respect, it sends a message of support, it sends a message of inclusiveness and it sends a message of harmony. Those who support the watering down of racial discrimination laws are spreading a message of bigotry and hatred, and shame on them. I support the current laws. I do not support the rights of bigots. I support a tolerant society and I really hope that this parliament does what the community wants us to do, and that is to show some respect for each other.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2015-03-03,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (16:31):  It is extraordinary coming into this debate, I have to say. You get words like 'hate speech', 'bigots' and 'racist'. Most of them have been directed at me over the last two or three years, and I have had to deal with them. The point I make is that these words are an excuse for not actually debating a substantive topic.


I have to say that there is a modicum of hypocrisy coming from some of those opposite who talk about hate speech and not protecting the rights of bigots and from those who say that somehow we are oppressing minorities and allowing only the majority to have this unfettered freedom of speech. I reject that in its entirety, just as I reject the terms 'bigots', 'racists' and any other epithets and slurs they want to throw at us. What I do support is what Senator Di Natale said—it might surprise you, Mr Acting Deputy President. He said, 'It's very easy to jump on a bandwagon when it's convenient but it is very tough to stick to principle when it seems that people are opposed to you or it is an unpopular principle.' I am quite proud of the fact that I have stuck to principle at every turn. I have stood in this place and called out the hate preachers for many years. I have called them out when they have been out there talking about 'uncovered meat' and justifying the rape of young Australian women. I called them out when some South Australia sheikh said, 'Oh Allah, count the Buddhists and the Hindus one by one. Oh Allah, count them and kill them to the very last one.' I consider that unacceptable. It is unacceptable to advocate violence against someone on the basis of their religion.


What I do not consider unacceptable is the fact that you are able to be critical of someone. You are able to say something that someone else may find offensive or insulting. That is a subjective term. And why are we subjecting ourselves to this arbitrary decision when someone says, 'I'm offended by what you've got to say'? The offence is quite often conjured up just to stop someone from saying something that they do not want to hear. That is what has happened in the debate around the hate preachers in some of the mosques. That is what has happened in some of the debate around tackling some of the extremists that are taking up in this country. That is what happens when you call it out and say, 'We are wasting money by throwing it into circumstances where people are not lifting themselves out of poverty or making a better contribution to society.' You get called a racist or a bigot. Or someone has taken offence. When someone like Andrew Bolt, who I am proud to call a friend, says that there are people gaming the system, he is taken to court over it and he is found guilty because someone took offence. That is absolutely wrong.


I stood with the Attorney when he put forward his changes to 18C. I thought they went a bit far—I have to tell you that—but it was a starting point for negotiation. It was a starting point for community discussion. But it was drowned in these accusations of bigotry and racism. I reject that in its entirety. That is why, when the government decided not to pursue it because of the vocal minority that was up in arms about it—those in the Twittersphere and elsewhere—I joined with Senator Dean Smith, Senator Leyonhjelm and Senator Bob Day in sponsoring a very simple repeal of two words of section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act: 'insult' and 'offend'. Somehow, that is racism. Somehow, saying that I do not want 'insult' and 'offend' in the act means that I am a bigot. That is simply not true, and it is not true because it has a cross-section of support. People like Paul Howes have said, 'That's a reasonable change.' You know, those notable right-wingers out there, like Julian Burnside QC, who said, 'That seems reasonable.' Greg Barns—who has been a candidate for every political party in the country, I think—has said, 'Yeah, that's okay.' A whole range of people across the political spectrum have said, 'This is a reasonable and sensible amendment to section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act.' But we will not hear that from those who are interested in perpetuating this cult of victimhood, this sense that somehow, because someone says something you do not like and you find offensive, you should be able to take them to a tribunal. This is a failing and it is a failing of debate in this country if we cannot stand up and have an honest and straightforward discussion without the sorts of slurs that have been put forward in this chamber and out there in the public domain.


What passes for debate in this country and what passes for media reporting in this country is, more often than not, some outraged leftie on Twitter who has been quoted by the media saying look how upset Cory Bernardi has made everyone today, because there is some anonymous desk jockey filing 140 characters of smear and abuse. That is not meaningful debate in the long-term interests of the country. We must be able to have serious conversations about the issues that are impacting us that risk offending people—and they do risk offending people.


We are somewhat protected from it in this place because we have this thing called parliamentary privilege where we can say basically what we like. We wear the wrath of it in the public sphere, but we cannot be taken to court over it. We have to use that judiciously. We have to use it appropriately. Sometimes we get it right and sometimes we get it wrong, but we know we are never going to front up to court over it. But the point I make is this: the rest of the country does not have that same privilege. If someone makes a comment that simply upsets someone because they have annoyed them or they have pestered or they have somehow made them feel uncomfortable, they can find themselves before some quasi-tribunal. This is absolutely wrong. It is devoid of common sense.


I do not agree that we should have unfettered free speech, because then we would have people like Sheikh Sharif Hussein in South Australia who is praying to god that all the Hindus and Buddhists would be killed. I think it is wrong to be preaching that sort of stuff out there. We should be countering it in the court of public opinion. Unfortunately, we are not able to, because when you pick up this and you write to them and you say, 'What are you doing?' you get called a racist or a bigot or some other slur. That is what is fundamentally wrong. We cannot call out the hate preachers where they are.


When we are talking about hate, many times it is in the eye of the beholder. If we want to look at the hypocrisy, it was only in recent years the Greens decided the Murdoch press was somehow the hate press and were preaching hatred against the Greens and they wanted to enact some sort of government mechanism to limit the freedom of the press. I find that anathema. We have opportunities, if you are maligned by the press, to pursue it through the courts, as anyone else would, for defamation, but not simply because you are upset or somehow offended by what they have got to say. This is the hypocrisy that we are seeing in this chamber today. If we want to have a serious debate, let's have a discussion without the slurs. Let's have a discussion without the epithets. Let's have a discussion about what is in the national interest.

"Day, Sen Bob",FFP,2015-03-03,"



Senator DAY
 (South Australia) (16:40):  There have been a number of motions and other matters in this place that I could have supported were it not for the way they were drafted. I oppose this because it talks about 'hate speech', an emotionally charged phrase if there ever was one, a phrase deliberately designed to misrepresent what this debate is about. This debate is not about hate speech; it is about free speech. Calling socially unacceptable comments 'hate speech' is itself a restriction on free speech. I do have a concern about the direction the government is moving on free speech. The government has moved from a pre-election promise to promote free speech to a post-election position of doing nothing and to recent statements that perhaps it will look to even further restrict free speech.


The private senators' bill that I and senators Leyonhjelm, Bernardi and Smith co-sponsored represents a sensible move to address free speech concerns in the Racial Discrimination Act. If the government has now decided that it is withdrawing the benefit of the doubt and going to the DRS, the decision review system, instead, the sensible ruling would be to take my approach, and that of my co-sponsors, and remove the contentious 'offend' and 'insult' provisions altogether. Our bill does not wipe out section 18C. It leaves the other parts like 'humiliate' and 'intimidate' alone.


An example of what my co-sponsors and I are on about is the recent case where the Prime Minister singled out a certain Islamic group for critique and, potentially, legal sanctions. Yet, if you look at an interview on Lateline with a spokesperson for that group, you will see the great public benefit gained by allowing that organisation to have as much free speech as it wants. Professional, forensic interviews and critiques of the positions advocated by that group will expose to the public the very disturbing aspects of their beliefs and the serious problems with their statements and whether or not they sit well with the Australian people. Banning that group's freedom to speak, however, is not the answer.


Family First has consistently supported national security bills in this place as it believes these are the best methods to guard against those who promote and support terrorist activity. When people act or conspire to commit criminal acts at home or abroad, then we have criminal laws to deal with them. It is unacceptable, however, to have criminal laws dealing with matters of debate and speech. Since my co-sponsors, whom I again thank today for their support—and I notice that Senator Smith is here in the chamber—and I tabled a bill to reform section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act, we have seen some appalling further attacks on free speech in Europe. People have paid with their lives for the freedom to speak as they find. As my wife's Auntie Esther used to say, 'I speak as I find.' If we support free speech—one of the foundations of this place—then the right thing to do is to remove the prohibitions against it.

"Dastyari, Sen Sam",ALP,2015-03-03,"



Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales) (16:43):  I rise to support the matter of public importance, and I do so quite conscious of the fact that, while my views may differ on this from those of others in the chamber, I acknowledge that the intention of those who disagree with me on this, in many cases, does come from a good place. It comes from a belief that they are, at times, promoting the principle of freedom of speech. What concerns me is the reality of what changes to section 18C will do, as opposed to simply the theoretical, rhetorical position. But let me begin.


I think the principle of freedom of speech is a very important one. The principle of being able to have an environment in which different people can propose opposing views, and views that are not always the same, is something we should be very proud of and something we should enshrine. What concerns me when governments go down the path of changing things like the Racial Discrimination Act is what message that sends to the outside community. I appreciate and respect that some may argue that the message it sends is that we are going to be a tolerant society with freedom of speech. But the reality is it gives a green light to a handful of bigots, a handful of those full of hate and a handful of those who want to denigrate and mock others to behave in an appalling way.


One of the many things that makes this country so fantastic is that we are a country of migrants. We are a country that is built on the idea people are able to come here from around the world, are able to maintain their culture, are able to maintain their identity, are able to maintain their language and be Australian at the same time. That is an incredibly important principle and a principle that we need to protect. The danger, when you go down the path of tampering with things like the Racial Discrimination Act, is that you start sending a signal to those out there who want to misuse this kind of language, who want to promote hate. You start sending a message that is okay to be a bigot. I really worry about what the long-term consequences of that are.


You only have to talk to the migrant communities across the country to realise we are so lucky to be able to live in a tolerant, open, free society with over 260 different ethnic communities and languages interacting with one another in Sydney alone, which really is a cultural melting pot. We are so lucky to live in that environment. There is a small minority though who promote hate. There is a small minority who promote racist views, who make the lives of those migrants harder and harder.


When you speak to the community leaders, when you speak to the parents, when you speak to the mums and dads who come from migrant backgrounds, the reason why they are so concerned about all of this is because they are not seeing it through the prism of theoretical debate in the nation's parliament about the principle of freedom of speech. They are seeing it through the reality of what kind of a green light it sends for what is said to their child in the playground.


I think there is a real disconnect that we have to make sure we bridge in this debate. Let us not kid ourselves, those 76 of us who have the privilege of being in this chamber are incredibly lucky. We have an incredible opportunity and an incredible platform. That is not a benefit that most people have and that is why when we have this debate we make sure we understand the disconnect between where we are now, how we have the debate, the theoretical debate we have about this idea of freedom of speech and the reality of what watering down something like the Racial Discrimination Act will be the message that sends and the symbol that sends.


I was here for Senator Day's contribution. While the principle is something that is laudable and important, the reality of what happens when you start watering down something like the Racial Discrimination Act is that it sends a message. I worry that the message it sends is that it is okay to be a bigot, that it is okay to promote racist views, that it is okay to promote views the majority of Australians do not hold. I think the concern out there in the community about is legitimate and is real because they are the parents, they are the families, that they are communities that have to deal with the consequence of those views being promoted.

Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia) (16:49):  I am also pleased to speak this afternoon on the motion, which reads:




The Abbott Government
'
s confused and chaotic approach to hate speech provisions in the Racial Discrimination Act 1975.



Might I thank Senator Dastyari for his calm and reflective comments in what is a very important debate. It is an important debate because it is easy to drift into accusations and unpleasantness about people's motives. Right up front, I would like to acknowledge Senator Dastyari's contribution because he refrained from that and he pointed to the fact that senators like myself and others approach this issue with great sincerity.


Before Senator Dastyari spoke, I was inclined to talk about Labor's actions this afternoon being one of playing politics with this issue because it is not a secret that within the coalition there are various views amongst senators and members, myself included, about where the appropriate balance is to be struck between free speech and protecting people from shameful and hurtful comments. It is a debate about where the balance is to be struck.


I argue that where it is struck at the moment is not right, is inappropriate. In a few moments, I am going to share with you others that share my view who you would not expect to hear from—Julian Burnside, for example; Sara Josef, for example—but I will come to that point in a moment. It is important to say up-front that my position is different from the government. So as a government senator, let me be clear what the government's position is.


The Prime Minister and senior ministers regularly make strong statements condemning hate preachers and the poison they spread amongst the community. That is an undisputed fact. The government has introduced foreign fighters legislation that has included strong prohibitions against the advocation of terrorism. The Attorney-General did announce on 20 February 2015 that the government would be providing nearly $18 million to combat the lies and propaganda the terrorist groups are spreading throughout our community, particularly online. This will empower the government and community members to directly challenge terrorist propaganda. Importantly, the Prime Minister also announced in February this year that the government will be taking strong action against hate preachers including stronger prohibitions on vilifying, intimidating or inciting racial and religious hatred. These strong prohibitions, these initiatives of the government, on hate speech will clamp down on organisations and individuals who breed hate and incite violence. The government of course is giving consideration to the criminalisation of this conduct and it is important to note that the government is not considering amendments to section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 as, in its view, the RDA is a civil regime. So that is the position of the government.


My position of course is slightly different. I suspect this is where we would have ended up if the very genuinely inspired consultation process of the government had been allowed to run its course. We would have ended up with a proposition to remove the words 'offend' and 'insult'. And why would we have ended up there? Because prominent Australians were already there. Human rights activists and lawyers were already at that position. Let me just share with you, briefly, what Justice Robert French had to say. That name will be familiar to you, Mr Acting Deputy President Back, because he is a very esteemed Western Australian lawyer. He is of course now the Chief Justice of the High Court of this Commonwealth. In Bropho v HREOC, Justice French said:


The lower registers of the preceding definitions [in 18C] and in particular those of 'offend' and 'insult' seem a long way removed from the mischief to which Art 4 of CERD is directed. They also seem a long way from some of the evils to which Part IIA [of the RDA] is directed as described in the Second Reading Speech.


The now Chief Justice of the High Court previously said, 'Before we engage in this debate, where we have ended up with Senator Day's, Senator Leyonhjelm's, Senator Smith's and Senator Bernardi's private senators' bill is a responsible position to be. That is compelling for me. I suspect that in a more tempered debate it would be compelling for many Australians.' Let me add to that—and this is from someone whom I would not regularly quote—what Julian Burnside had to say. He is a prominent human rights lawyer and he has publicly said:


… the mere fact that you insult or offend someone probably should not, of itself, give rise to legal liability. My personal views is that 18C probably reached a bit far so a bit of fine-tuning would probably be OK.


The Australia Human Rights Commission said in its submission to the now abandoned consultation process about reforming 18C and its comment on the exposure draft of the Freedom of Speech (Repeal of S. 18C) Bill 2014 considered that:


 … the legislation could be clarified so that it more plainly reflects the way in which it has been interpreted in practice.


In the limited time that is available to me, let me just add one more supporter, the very respected human rights lawyer Professor Sarah Joseph, Director of the Castan Centre for Human Rights Law at Monash University, who has said:


… the prohibitions on that which offends and insults, even on the basis of race, go too far. Feelings of offence and insult are not serious enough to justify restrictions on the human right to freedom of speech … It is true that the terms ""offence"" and ""insult"" have been interpreted so that they mean more than ""mere"" offence and insult. It is arguable that judicial interpretation has saved these provisions from actually breaching the right to free speech. However, the law should mean what it says. If ""offence"" and ""insult""' do not mean what they say, the prohibitions should go.


I am not renowned for my patience, but on this issue I will be patient because I have every confidence that, one by one, senators in this place will realise the wisdom of this approach to free speech. I do not doubt for a second that there will be some road blocks and people will try to make political mischief, but I am confident that community opinion will change in the favour and in the direction of the private senator's bill, which is sponsored by Senators Day, Leyonhjelm, Bernardi and me. Thank you.

Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia) (16:58):  On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, I present the 19th report of the 44th Parliament, Human rights scrutiny report.


Ordered that the report be printed.




Senator SMITH:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


I rise to speak on the tabling of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights 19th report of the 44th parliament.


This report provides the committee's view on the compatibility with human rights as defined in the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Act 2011 of bills introduced during the period 9 to 12 February 2015; one bill introduced on 3 December 2014; and legislative instruments received during the period 23 January 2015 to 12 February 2015. The report also includes consideration of legislation previously deferred by the committee, as well as responses to issues raised by the committee in previous reports.


Of the nine bills considered in this report, four are assessed as not raising human rights concerns and five raise matters requiring further correspondence with ministers. The committee has deferred its consideration of the remaining bills.


A number of the bills considered are scheduled for debate during the sitting week commencing 2 March 2015, including:


the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2014-2015; and


the Defence Legislation Amendment (Military Justice Enhancements—Inspector-General ADF) Bill 2014.


As always, the report outlines the committee's examination of the compatibility of these bills with our human rights obligations, and I encourage my fellow senators and others to examine the committee's report to better inform their consideration of proposed legislation.


As senators would be aware, the committee's purpose is to enhance understanding of and respect for human rights in Australia's domestic context and to ensure appropriate recognition of human rights issues in legislative and policy development.


The committee seeks to achieve these outcomes through constructive engagement with proponents of legislation, and this is primarily done through a dialogue model in which the committee corresponds with relevant ministers and officials to identity and explore questions of human rights compatibility. The committee then reports its findings and recommendations, and in doing so strives to provide reports that clearly signpost the committee's analytical framework and the content of various human rights. The reports are intended to simply and succinctly set out the human rights analysis of legislation, and ultimately provide clear assessments of the compatibility of legislation that are accessible to members of parliament and to the public more broadly.


In this regard, I would like to draw attention to the committee's consideration of the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Psychoactive Substances and Other Measures) Bill 2014, about which the committee provides its concluding analysis in this report. This bill made a number of amendments to relevant acts to improve Commonwealth criminal justice arrangements, including in relation to the regulating of psychoactive substances that are designed and manufactured to mimic the effects of illicit drugs.


These substances have presented particular challenges to law enforcement because, while they can be banned as they are identified, manufacturers have been able to easily alter their chemical composition to avoid the law.


To address this problem, the bill introduced new offences for importing substances presented to be serious drug alternatives and for importing psychoactive substances. However, to address the ease with which these substances may be created and altered, these offences were drafted to include both a reverse evidentiary burden—whereby the defendant is required to provide evidence that they can rely on a prescribed exception to the importation offences—and an extremely broad definition of what constitutes a 'psychoactive substance'.


While the committee noted the extremely challenging nature of responding to the emergence of new psychoactive substances, the committee raised a number of issues relating to the right to a fair trial and fair hearing rights and quality of law considerations.


The committee also raised a number of issues in relation to other measures in the bill, including in relation to the imposition of mandatory minimum sentences for certain firearm trafficking and their potential limitation of the right not to be arbitrarily detained and the right to a fair trial and fair hearing rights—rights I would regard as being in the classical liberal context.


The committee's concluding remarks on these and other issues exemplify the benefits of the human rights scrutiny dialogue and the way in which it can both inform the legislative process and improve legislative outcomes.


For example, in relation to the new offences, the report notes that the information provided in the minister's responses constructively and comprehensively addressed the matters raised by the human rights committee, such that the committee could conclude that the offences are compatible with fair trial and fair hearing rights and quality of law considerations.


In respect of concerns raised in relation to the imposition of certain mandatory minimum sentences, the minister undertook to make a clarifying amendment to the EM for the bill, which the committee regards as having provided some greater protection of judicial discretion in sentencing.


Another case which I believe reflects on the ultimate purpose and benefit of human rights scrutiny can be seen in last Friday's report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security in relation to the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment (Data Retention) Bill 2014. The committee reported on this bill in its Fifteenth report of the 44th Parliament (tabled on 14 November 2014), and will soon report on a response recently received from the Attorney-General in relation to the matters raised by the committee.


It is gratifying for the committee to see that the substance of its analysis and concerns were clearly used to inform a number of the submissions to the inquiry conducted by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, and this serves as but one example that the human rights committee's scrutiny dialogue is one that is able to inform and reform the parliament and the public in the broadest sense.


In this regard, it is important to remember that the greater recognition of human rights in the policy and legislative process is well served through an inclusive human rights scrutiny dialogue model, and that the advancement of human rights should not be regarded as only belonging within the preserve of human rights practitioners and international courts, tribunals and other bodies.


In conclusion, I would just like to put on record my sincere appreciation for the tremendous work and professionalism of all those involved in the work of the human rights committee. I acknowledge the work of the deputy chair, Mr Laurie Ferguson, and all my other Senate and House colleagues; the committee secretary, Mr Ivan Powell; the committee's legal adviser, Professor Simon Rice; and the very, very diligent officials of the committee, Mr Matthew Corrigan, Ms Zoe Hutchinson, Ms Anita Coles; and all the staff in the committee secretariat. With these comments, I commend the committee's Nineteenth report of the 44th Parliament.

 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (17:32):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



Today I introduce a Bill to amend the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 to cease the operation of the Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee (or CAMAC) and its legal committee.


The cessation of CAMAC will also result in the formal termination of CAMAC's legal committee which was formally established in September 1991.


However, the business environment has changed from 1989 when the agency was first established as the Corporations and Securities Advisory Committee.


The professionalism and capacity of industry representative groups is now much stronger, and business is quite capable of putting its views to government without the need for an additional layer of taxpayer‑funded bureaucracy.


This Bill fulfils a commitment made by the Government in the 2014-15 Budget to abolish CAMAC and its legal committee as part of the effort to achieve a smaller and more rational government footprint.


CAMAC and its legal committee are 2 of the 36 government bodies the Abbott Government has committed to abolishing as part of our Smaller Government reforms.


The Abbott Government is acting early to deliver a smaller and more rational government, and contribute to fiscal repair and to the sustainability of government operations.


Ceasing the operation of small bodies and committees generates savings beyond merely the saving of the annual appropriation.


The ongoing operation of small agencies absorbs resources across the broader Commonwealth public service, including through the oversight costs incurred by responsible departments, central agencies and integrity agencies.


This Bill terminates the operation of CAMAC by repealing Part 9 of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act and making a number of consequential amendments to that Act.


The cessation of CAMAC will take effect from the 28th day after the Bill receives Royal Assent.


Part 2 of Schedule 1 of this Bill provides for the transitional and saving arrangements necessary to facilitate the cessation of CAMAC.


The transitional and saving provisions provide for things such as:


continuing CAMAC's assets and liabilities after cessation as if they belong to the Commonwealth;


substituting the Commonwealth for CAMAC in relation to contracts and other instruments; in relation to things that CAMAC did, or does, before its cessation; and in relation to any legal proceedings that may be on foot at the time CAMAC ceases to operate; and


providing for the transfer of CAMAC's records to the Treasury and for the continued protection of information.


I am confident industry will continue to be vocal in expressing its views to Government on the operation of the corporations laws.


The Treasury will act as an adviser and coordinator of advice, given its role as a policy agency. Treasury will continue to advise the Government in relation to corporate law, financial markets and financial services following the cessation of CAMAC. That advice will continue to be informed by regular engagement with relevant experts and with industry.


In addition, ASIC will continue to be empowered under its enabling legislation to make recommendations to the Government about any matter connected with:


a proposal to make or amend the corporations legislation;


the operation or administration of the corporations legislation;


companies or a segment of the financial products and financial services industry; or


the efficiency of the financial markets.


Finally, the Government retains the ability to refer matters regarding the corporate regulatory framework to other Government research and advisory bodies such as the Productivity Commission and the Australian Law Reform Commission.


With this Bill the Government is fulfilling its commitment to abolish CAMAC and its legal committee as part of the effort to achieve a smaller and more rational government footprint.


The full details of these measure are contained in the explanatory memorandum.


I thank CAMAC's past and current members, as well as its staff.


I commend the Bill to the House.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2015-03-03,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (17:34):  I know you will all be very disappointed that my colleague Senator Whish-Wilson was not able to continue from where he left off, which of course was parking his boat next to something on Rottnest Island! But I do wish to make a serious contribution to this debate. I want to indicate that with regard to this Tax and Superannuation Laws Amendment (2014 Measures No. 7) Bill 2014 the Greens will be opposing schedule 1 and schedule 6. When we get to committee we will be seeking to have those voted on separately and will oppose them. I wish to speak to those issues now and indicate why we are opposing them.


Schedule 1 relates to excess superannuation contributions, and this is very much the frustration the Greens have that the Abbott government talks constantly about the budget problems, talks constantly about making life harder for ordinary people—everything from the GP co-payments and the like—and here we have a proposal once again to let the big end of town off scot-free. It is just wrong. What is being proposed here is that, if a person exceeds the legal cap on their non-concessional superannuation contributions, they be virtually let off scot-free. I just think it is wrong.


The substance for this is that the government is in its explanatory memorandum assuming that many of the relevant tax law violations are inadvertent. The government argues that people just somehow overlook it, make a mistake, exceed the contribution and—oh dear!—they should not then have to suffer any real penalty for that. I keep making the point, as I did in the tax estimates the other day, that if a person gets into trouble with Centrelink or gets a pension overpaid for a period of time then before they know it they are in the courts, but when it is the big end of town it is always assumed, 'Oh, it must've been inadvertent; we mustn't do anything that would cause them any difficulty.' Industry Super Australia had a look at that and they have said that they are concerned that the legislation, in its current form, would undermine incentives to comply with the tax laws and further threaten the sustainability of superannuation tax concessions, including by exposing superannuation to gaming behaviour. They say that very few people are in a position to violate the non-concessional contributions cap—that is, the $180,000 extra that you can put in. There are not many people who have $180,000 extra to put into their superannuation so, in the case of voluntary contributions, we are talking about a small number of very wealthy people, and the legislation would enable those few people to engage in gaming behaviour. In this game there would be a number of ways to win.


First of all, the tax office may not detect or enforce a tax liability against excess contributions. If that happens, individuals who breach the law get to enjoy significant tax concessions on earnings and income arising from these unlawful contributions. However, if a violation is detected and the tax office seeks to impose a tax liability, individuals who breach the law are then given a free pass: they can have the excess contribution returned to them with no penalty. How is this fair? The law is the law. If you breach the law, you should pay the penalty. Everybody else does. Why is it that, for high-income earners, it is assumed that it is just inadvertent and they should get the money back—that they should get it out of their fund and pay no penalty for what they have done? That is what this is. That is why it is so wrong.


In fact, the legislation creates perverse incentives by giving an individual who has broken the law the option to choose to withdraw the excess contribution, which returns the individual who has breached the law to an approximation of the same position they would have been in had they not violated the cap; plus they get any earnings that accrue between the assessment date and the withdrawal date, compounded over time. They can also pay the penalty and keep the concessional treatment on earnings and retirement income. Further arbitrage opportunities are available under the proposed legislation because earnings for tax purposes are calculated by reference to a formula that is the average general interest charge for the relevant financial year, rather than the actual earnings received; and as a result, if the constructed earnings are less than the actual earnings, a further benefit is possible.


This is a ridiculous piece of legislation you are bringing in here which once again gives the wink and the nod to the big end of town. It is simply wrong to suggest that it is inadvertent because most individuals in a position to exceed the non-concessional contributions cap are likely to be receiving professional advice and tax preparation assistance. Let's face it—if they have that much surplus cash to put into super, they are going to be getting their tax done. This goes back to the financial services industry and all the problems we have with that.


If there is a legitimate concern around inadvertent violations, more moderately targeted reforms could be contemplated. But I do not accept that we should be presuming this is accidental or inadvertent and that there should be no penalty. That is why we should recognise that it is wrong and a mistake.


Everybody should be equal under the law. That should be a fundamental premise in Australia. Everyone is equal under the law. If there is a law which says that you cannot get the pension if you have a certain amount of money or if certain changes apply and you breach that, then you suffer the consequences; but equally, if the big end of town stacks up this money in their super beyond the cap they are allowed, they should pay a penalty when they are found out. Why is it that we assume rich people make mistakes to their financial advantage inadvertently, but poorer people are clearly not innocent and have done so for some criminal intent? That is wrong, and that is why the Greens will be strongly opposing schedule 1 of this particular tax bill. It shows again that the Abbott government cannot help itself. Where the rich are concerned, no penalties apply. Where other people are concerned, every penalty applies and the book is thrown at them. It is wrong.


The other schedule we will be opposing today is about the destruction of the environment and using public funds to benefit mining companies. That is exactly what exploration tax credits do. What this schedule does is provide tax credits for junior mining companies—essentially, mining start-ups that have no current investment from which to redirect existing profits into further exploration. It is giving these mining start-ups a credit when they are exploring greenfield areas. In other words, this is about new miners on new exploration projects. Guess what? They are trying to get into every protected area around the country. We would be offering a tax credit for these miners to open up areas that ought to be protected. The fact of the matter is that frequently they go in and destroy these areas. State governments fall over themselves to give them licenses, a royalty holiday and every concession under the sun. They go in and wreck the place; they go broke; and then they leave. They never meet the bond, if there was one, to rehabilitate the area.




Senator O'Sullivan:
  That's not accurate. That's not fair.




Senator MILNE:
  I am glad there has been an interjection there, because I am going to give you some very good examples. If the mining industry cares to have a look, I refer them to the Tarkine in north-western Tasmania, where the Australian Heritage Council recommended that the area be protected for its natural values. I was appalled, during the last government, when the Labor minister decided not to implement the Heritage Council's findings and protect the area. Minister Burke came out strongly saying he would prefer mining to go ahead in the area, even though there was no business case—even though these tin-pot miners were going to make a wreck of the place. And that is exactly what has happened.


So let me just go through what has happened—and they get this, of course, in addition to accelerated depreciation for their capital, materiel and exploration costs and fuel tax credits. It goes on and on in this mission to use taxpayers' dollars to dig it up, cut it down and ship it away. That is essentially the only vision you have got. Why would you be using taxpayers' dollars to give these miners access to greenfield sites?


Venture Minerals proposed three open cut mines in the Tarkine. Mount Lindsay mine has tin, tungsten, copper and iron. The mine has a predicted life of eight years. It is the main mine in the group, and the lease was granted by the Tasmanian government in July 2014. The Stanley River mine has hematite, iron and tin. The predicted life of the mine is two years. The Riley Creek mine has hematite. The predicted life of the mine is two years. Work began in May 2014 and was suspended in August 2014. All of these mines sit within the area recommended by the Heritage Council for a Tarkine National Heritage listing. The Mount Lindsay and Stanley River mines are within the myrtle forest and the button grass and heathland in the Meredith Ranges reserve created under the Tasmanian Regional Forestry Agreement. The Riley Creek site would involve clearing myrtle forest. Threatened species that may be impacted through the clearing include the Tasmanian devil, the spotted-tail quoll and the wedge-tailed eagle, as well as the expected increase in road kills.


And then, of course, we have Shree Minerals. What a disaster! Their hematite, magnetite and iron ore mine at Nelson Bay on the west coast had a predicted life of two years. Imagine giving an incentive to these miners to go in and wreck the place for a mine life of two years! The mine was approved by the federal minister in July 2013. Work started in November 2013 and was suspended in June 2014—after the Tasmanian Labor government gave Shree Minerals a royalties holiday. So the federal minister overlooked the heritage listing and the Tasmanian Labor government gave them a royalties holiday. Worse still, we now find that legal action was taken against the Environment Protection Authority in Tasmania for allowing Shree to store at its mothballed mine more than 20 times the amount of acid-producing waste rock than was in the environmental permit—20 times more, stacked on the surface, than was in its environmental permit. And then, in August 2014, Shree surrendered its licence to explore at Rebecca Creek.


These miners have gone in and wrecked the place. They have left a great mess in the Tarkine. They have not said they are walking away, because then they would have to rehabilitate it. It is just going to sit there as a horrible great mess. All of this acid-producing waste rock will be sitting there in a mess as a tribute to the former minister Tony Burke and the former Tasmanian Labor Premier Lara Giddings. Good on them! Those photos will be there. The destruction is there. And now, in this federal parliament, suddenly it seems like a very good idea to the Abbott government to give more of these tin-pot mining companies taxpayer's dollars to go and wreck greenfields areas with relatively little possibility of ever creating the jobs they promised or indeed the production they promised.


I am sick to death of the fact that we cannot get real in this country about making the transition away from digging up, cutting down and destroying our natural resource base to recognising that the future depends on a transition to a low-carbon economy which invests in brains and capacity building—universities—and selling the technologies and the advancements rather than continuing to think that we are suddenly going to find all these great new mining prospects. The fact is that the mining companies have had a good go at Australia. They would argue that all of the major deposits that are relatively accessible and profitable have already been accessed. Now we have got the petroleum industry, the mining industry and the coal industry just out there after more, and I have absolutely no intention of ensuring that the mining industry gets access to even more taxpayers' dollars.


As I said, on top of their fuel tax credits, which is an absolute fossil fuel subsidy, and their accelerated depreciation, you now want to give them an exploration tax credit. Well, not with taxpayers dollars. You have not got the money to invest in universities and to support the healthcare system so that you do not impose co-payments. Let's be very frank, the so-called pause in index payments is just a continuation of what the former government proposed, which is to freeze the indexation, which is a cut every single year to support doctors and the health system. Let's face it, if we do not have the money to provide health and education, if we do not have the money to provide the basics in terms of public transport, we as sure as anything do not have the money to tip into the pockets of tin-pot miners who go in there and get the licences—and, if they do happen to hit it big, they of course have an arrangement with one of the big miners to move straight in and transition that prospect. If they walk away, the big miners do not have the liability that goes with cleaning up the site.


It has been my experience from one end of the country to the other that these rehabilitation bonds are not worth the paper they are written on. If you have a look in Victoria at the moment, with Hazelwood for example, why aren't they interested in closing down that coal fired power station and mine? It is because if they do close it down they are going to have to rehabilitate it. Rehabilitation is going to cost them way more than has ever been provided for, so they do not want to have to cop the cost of rehabilitation. That is going to be the case from one end of the country to the other—whether it is in the Hunter Valley, Victoria or wherever. That is because governments have failed to make mining companies accountable. They make their profits and their profits go offshore—overwhelmingly to foreign shareholders—and Australian communities are left holding the baby with the pollution of waterways and the destruction of agricultural land. It is just appalling.


People are going to look back and say, 'What sort of governments did you have in this country that were so keen to maximise the profits of the mining corporations at the expense of the community?' That is why the Greens will not be supporting this particular schedule. The Greens will be opposing schedule 1 and schedule 6 and would like the opportunity to vote on those separately in the committee stage.

Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (17:52):  First of all, I would like to thank those senators who have contributed to this debate on the Tax and Superannuation Laws Amendment (2014 Measures No. 7) Bill 2014 and the Excess Exploration Credit Tax Bill 2014.


Schedule 1 demonstrates that the government is committed to ensuring that individuals need no longer be disproportionately penalised for inadvertently exceeding their superannuation non-concessional contribution caps. Individuals will have greater confidence to save long term for their retirement.


Schedule 2 will provide for more efficiency in government by transferring the tax-complaints-handling and tax investigative functions of the Commonwealth Ombudsman to the Inspector-General of Taxation. The transfer will simplify tax scrutiny by replacing the split jurisdiction that exists currently with a single-agency jurisdiction over tax complaints and systemic reviews.


Schedule 3 ensures that life insurance policies are treated properly in the capital gains tax provisions of the taxation law.


Australians look for certainty in the superannuation tax and regulatory laws when saving for retirement. Schedule 4 shows that this government will deliver on that front. The measure will clarify that superannuation fund mergers will not trigger a tax integrity rule. This provides greater certainty for superannuation funds undertaking fund mergers to achieve greater efficiencies and comply with regulatory requirements. It also ensures that members do not incur a potential unintended tax disadvantage from the merger.


Schedule 5 clarifies the position of Commonwealth, state and territory law enforcement agencies regarding the ability of the Australian Taxation Office to share information with them.


Schedule 6 and the Excess Exploration Credit Tax Bill 2014 deliver on this government's election commitment to provide an exploration development incentive which will encourage greenfields exploration expenditure by junior exploration companies. The incentive recognises that the future prosperity of the mining sector and the Australian economy is dependent on our ability to make new mineral discoveries. It also recognises a tax disadvantage that junior exploration companies face relative to large miners and explorers. The cost of the incentive is capped at $100 million over three years. The scheme will be reviewed in 2016 and, subject to the outcome of the review, may be extended for a further period. The incentive is similar to a scheme in Canada which has been described as a spectacular success. The Canadian scheme has been extended numerous times since its introduction.


Schedule 7 provides increased certainty for taxpayers by making a number of tax law amendments. These address unintended legislative outcomes, correct defects in the law and make sure that the law operates as intended. I commend the bills to the Senate.

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (17:57):  The Greens oppose schedules 1 and 6 in the following terms:


(3) Schedule 1, page 5 (line 1) to page 24 (line 8), to be opposed.


(4) Schedule 6, page 55 (line 1) to page 89 (line 4), to be opposed.


I do not wish to speak to these amendments any further than I have in my speech on the second reading. It is very clear why we do not want to see $100 million of taxpayers' money given as an exploration incentive to the mining industry, nor do we want to assume that people who choose to exceed their non-concessional superannuation contribution have done so inadvertently.

Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (17:57):  Labor does not support the Greens amendment to remove schedule 1 from the bill. Schedule 1 amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 and the Taxation Administration Act 1953 to reduce the tax penalty of individuals with excess non-concessional superannuation contributions. The current excess non-concessional contributions tax imposes a severe punishment for what is often an inadvertent breach of the non-concessional cap. The proposed changes will allow individuals to withdraw any excess contributions and have this amount treated as income for tax purposes.


The measure is largely supported by the superannuation stakeholders. The previous Labor government enacted a similar measure on a temporary basis in 2012 and 2013 to allow excess non-concessional contributions to be withdrawn. In addition, the Inspector-General of Taxation recommended that the government change the treatment of excess non-concessional contributions following a review in 2014.


Schedule 6 and the Excess Exploration Credit Tax Bill 2014 introduce an exploration development incentive by amending the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 and other tax legislation to provide a tax incentive to encourage investment in small mineral exploration companies undertaking greenfields mineral exploration in Australia.


Junior mineral companies undertake a disproportionately large amount of mineral exploration in Australia. However, as the vast majority of these companies never become profitable they are not able to take advantage of the tax deductions for exploration activities. This schedule creates a capped spending program to provide a tax credit that is passed through to investors in junior mineral exploration companies that are conducting greenfield exploration.


The capped spending and caveat nature of this measure call into question how effective a stimulus of exploration activities it will be. Labor believes that this program should be reviewed in the future to identify whether it has achieved its objectives but supports its inclusion in this bill.



The CHAIRMAN:  The question is that schedules 1 and 6 stand as printed.



The CHAIRMAN:  Senator Milne, I take it that you will not proceed with your next two amendments, so the question now is that the bills be agreed to without amendments or requests.

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (17:34):  I know you will all be very disappointed that my colleague Senator Whish-Wilson was not able to continue from where he left off, which of course was parking his boat next to something on Rottnest Island! But I do wish to make a serious contribution to this debate. I want to indicate that with regard to this Tax and Superannuation Laws Amendment (2014 Measures No. 7) Bill 2014 the Greens will be opposing schedule 1 and schedule 6. When we get to committee we will be seeking to have those voted on separately and will oppose them. I wish to speak to those issues now and indicate why we are opposing them.


Schedule 1 relates to excess superannuation contributions, and this is very much the frustration the Greens have that the Abbott government talks constantly about the budget problems, talks constantly about making life harder for ordinary people—everything from the GP co-payments and the like—and here we have a proposal once again to let the big end of town off scot-free. It is just wrong. What is being proposed here is that, if a person exceeds the legal cap on their non-concessional superannuation contributions, they be virtually let off scot-free. I just think it is wrong.


The substance for this is that the government is in its explanatory memorandum assuming that many of the relevant tax law violations are inadvertent. The government argues that people just somehow overlook it, make a mistake, exceed the contribution and—oh dear!—they should not then have to suffer any real penalty for that. I keep making the point, as I did in the tax estimates the other day, that if a person gets into trouble with Centrelink or gets a pension overpaid for a period of time then before they know it they are in the courts, but when it is the big end of town it is always assumed, 'Oh, it must've been inadvertent; we mustn't do anything that would cause them any difficulty.' Industry Super Australia had a look at that and they have said that they are concerned that the legislation, in its current form, would undermine incentives to comply with the tax laws and further threaten the sustainability of superannuation tax concessions, including by exposing superannuation to gaming behaviour. They say that very few people are in a position to violate the non-concessional contributions cap—that is, the $180,000 extra that you can put in. There are not many people who have $180,000 extra to put into their superannuation so, in the case of voluntary contributions, we are talking about a small number of very wealthy people, and the legislation would enable those few people to engage in gaming behaviour. In this game there would be a number of ways to win.


First of all, the tax office may not detect or enforce a tax liability against excess contributions. If that happens, individuals who breach the law get to enjoy significant tax concessions on earnings and income arising from these unlawful contributions. However, if a violation is detected and the tax office seeks to impose a tax liability, individuals who breach the law are then given a free pass: they can have the excess contribution returned to them with no penalty. How is this fair? The law is the law. If you breach the law, you should pay the penalty. Everybody else does. Why is it that, for high-income earners, it is assumed that it is just inadvertent and they should get the money back—that they should get it out of their fund and pay no penalty for what they have done? That is what this is. That is why it is so wrong.


In fact, the legislation creates perverse incentives by giving an individual who has broken the law the option to choose to withdraw the excess contribution, which returns the individual who has breached the law to an approximation of the same position they would have been in had they not violated the cap; plus they get any earnings that accrue between the assessment date and the withdrawal date, compounded over time. They can also pay the penalty and keep the concessional treatment on earnings and retirement income. Further arbitrage opportunities are available under the proposed legislation because earnings for tax purposes are calculated by reference to a formula that is the average general interest charge for the relevant financial year, rather than the actual earnings received; and as a result, if the constructed earnings are less than the actual earnings, a further benefit is possible.


This is a ridiculous piece of legislation you are bringing in here which once again gives the wink and the nod to the big end of town. It is simply wrong to suggest that it is inadvertent because most individuals in a position to exceed the non-concessional contributions cap are likely to be receiving professional advice and tax preparation assistance. Let's face it—if they have that much surplus cash to put into super, they are going to be getting their tax done. This goes back to the financial services industry and all the problems we have with that.


If there is a legitimate concern around inadvertent violations, more moderately targeted reforms could be contemplated. But I do not accept that we should be presuming this is accidental or inadvertent and that there should be no penalty. That is why we should recognise that it is wrong and a mistake.


Everybody should be equal under the law. That should be a fundamental premise in Australia. Everyone is equal under the law. If there is a law which says that you cannot get the pension if you have a certain amount of money or if certain changes apply and you breach that, then you suffer the consequences; but equally, if the big end of town stacks up this money in their super beyond the cap they are allowed, they should pay a penalty when they are found out. Why is it that we assume rich people make mistakes to their financial advantage inadvertently, but poorer people are clearly not innocent and have done so for some criminal intent? That is wrong, and that is why the Greens will be strongly opposing schedule 1 of this particular tax bill. It shows again that the Abbott government cannot help itself. Where the rich are concerned, no penalties apply. Where other people are concerned, every penalty applies and the book is thrown at them. It is wrong.


The other schedule we will be opposing today is about the destruction of the environment and using public funds to benefit mining companies. That is exactly what exploration tax credits do. What this schedule does is provide tax credits for junior mining companies—essentially, mining start-ups that have no current investment from which to redirect existing profits into further exploration. It is giving these mining start-ups a credit when they are exploring greenfield areas. In other words, this is about new miners on new exploration projects. Guess what? They are trying to get into every protected area around the country. We would be offering a tax credit for these miners to open up areas that ought to be protected. The fact of the matter is that frequently they go in and destroy these areas. State governments fall over themselves to give them licenses, a royalty holiday and every concession under the sun. They go in and wreck the place; they go broke; and then they leave. They never meet the bond, if there was one, to rehabilitate the area.




Senator O'Sullivan:
  That's not accurate. That's not fair.




Senator MILNE:
  I am glad there has been an interjection there, because I am going to give you some very good examples. If the mining industry cares to have a look, I refer them to the Tarkine in north-western Tasmania, where the Australian Heritage Council recommended that the area be protected for its natural values. I was appalled, during the last government, when the Labor minister decided not to implement the Heritage Council's findings and protect the area. Minister Burke came out strongly saying he would prefer mining to go ahead in the area, even though there was no business case—even though these tin-pot miners were going to make a wreck of the place. And that is exactly what has happened.


So let me just go through what has happened—and they get this, of course, in addition to accelerated depreciation for their capital, materiel and exploration costs and fuel tax credits. It goes on and on in this mission to use taxpayers' dollars to dig it up, cut it down and ship it away. That is essentially the only vision you have got. Why would you be using taxpayers' dollars to give these miners access to greenfield sites?


Venture Minerals proposed three open cut mines in the Tarkine. Mount Lindsay mine has tin, tungsten, copper and iron. The mine has a predicted life of eight years. It is the main mine in the group, and the lease was granted by the Tasmanian government in July 2014. The Stanley River mine has hematite, iron and tin. The predicted life of the mine is two years. The Riley Creek mine has hematite. The predicted life of the mine is two years. Work began in May 2014 and was suspended in August 2014. All of these mines sit within the area recommended by the Heritage Council for a Tarkine National Heritage listing. The Mount Lindsay and Stanley River mines are within the myrtle forest and the button grass and heathland in the Meredith Ranges reserve created under the Tasmanian Regional Forestry Agreement. The Riley Creek site would involve clearing myrtle forest. Threatened species that may be impacted through the clearing include the Tasmanian devil, the spotted-tail quoll and the wedge-tailed eagle, as well as the expected increase in road kills.


And then, of course, we have Shree Minerals. What a disaster! Their hematite, magnetite and iron ore mine at Nelson Bay on the west coast had a predicted life of two years. Imagine giving an incentive to these miners to go in and wreck the place for a mine life of two years! The mine was approved by the federal minister in July 2013. Work started in November 2013 and was suspended in June 2014—after the Tasmanian Labor government gave Shree Minerals a royalties holiday. So the federal minister overlooked the heritage listing and the Tasmanian Labor government gave them a royalties holiday. Worse still, we now find that legal action was taken against the Environment Protection Authority in Tasmania for allowing Shree to store at its mothballed mine more than 20 times the amount of acid-producing waste rock than was in the environmental permit—20 times more, stacked on the surface, than was in its environmental permit. And then, in August 2014, Shree surrendered its licence to explore at Rebecca Creek.


These miners have gone in and wrecked the place. They have left a great mess in the Tarkine. They have not said they are walking away, because then they would have to rehabilitate it. It is just going to sit there as a horrible great mess. All of this acid-producing waste rock will be sitting there in a mess as a tribute to the former minister Tony Burke and the former Tasmanian Labor Premier Lara Giddings. Good on them! Those photos will be there. The destruction is there. And now, in this federal parliament, suddenly it seems like a very good idea to the Abbott government to give more of these tin-pot mining companies taxpayer's dollars to go and wreck greenfields areas with relatively little possibility of ever creating the jobs they promised or indeed the production they promised.


I am sick to death of the fact that we cannot get real in this country about making the transition away from digging up, cutting down and destroying our natural resource base to recognising that the future depends on a transition to a low-carbon economy which invests in brains and capacity building—universities—and selling the technologies and the advancements rather than continuing to think that we are suddenly going to find all these great new mining prospects. The fact is that the mining companies have had a good go at Australia. They would argue that all of the major deposits that are relatively accessible and profitable have already been accessed. Now we have got the petroleum industry, the mining industry and the coal industry just out there after more, and I have absolutely no intention of ensuring that the mining industry gets access to even more taxpayers' dollars.


As I said, on top of their fuel tax credits, which is an absolute fossil fuel subsidy, and their accelerated depreciation, you now want to give them an exploration tax credit. Well, not with taxpayers dollars. You have not got the money to invest in universities and to support the healthcare system so that you do not impose co-payments. Let's be very frank, the so-called pause in index payments is just a continuation of what the former government proposed, which is to freeze the indexation, which is a cut every single year to support doctors and the health system. Let's face it, if we do not have the money to provide health and education, if we do not have the money to provide the basics in terms of public transport, we as sure as anything do not have the money to tip into the pockets of tin-pot miners who go in there and get the licences—and, if they do happen to hit it big, they of course have an arrangement with one of the big miners to move straight in and transition that prospect. If they walk away, the big miners do not have the liability that goes with cleaning up the site.


It has been my experience from one end of the country to the other that these rehabilitation bonds are not worth the paper they are written on. If you have a look in Victoria at the moment, with Hazelwood for example, why aren't they interested in closing down that coal fired power station and mine? It is because if they do close it down they are going to have to rehabilitate it. Rehabilitation is going to cost them way more than has ever been provided for, so they do not want to have to cop the cost of rehabilitation. That is going to be the case from one end of the country to the other—whether it is in the Hunter Valley, Victoria or wherever. That is because governments have failed to make mining companies accountable. They make their profits and their profits go offshore—overwhelmingly to foreign shareholders—and Australian communities are left holding the baby with the pollution of waterways and the destruction of agricultural land. It is just appalling.


People are going to look back and say, 'What sort of governments did you have in this country that were so keen to maximise the profits of the mining corporations at the expense of the community?' That is why the Greens will not be supporting this particular schedule. The Greens will be opposing schedule 1 and schedule 6 and would like the opportunity to vote on those separately in the committee stage.

Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia) (19:20):  After delivering another record level of harvest, 13.52 million tonnes, Western Australian farmers are busy preparing for the upcoming season. And, despite producing another record level of grain harvest, the third in four years, many farmers, especially in the drought-stricken eastern wheat-belt, remain nervous about their financial future. The same can be said about pastoralists in the Pilbara and the Kimberley and sheep producers in the Great Southern, who are finally seeing prices slowly return to the levels they were at prior to Labor's disastrous decision to suspend live exports to Indonesia, crippling the financial future of thousands of families across regional Western Australia.


WA's farming families are no strangers to hardship. For generations, they have grown crops and raised livestock in some of the harshest and most challenging conditions you can find. They know too well the devastating impact of drought, of hailstorms, of bushfires, of floods, of having their markets taken from them at the whim of a Labor minister. This notion of toughing it out is something you have to admire, and the 'battler' myth remains true throughout much of rural Western Australia. Yet, like all myths, it is slowly disappearing in an economic and social environment that is challenging the viability of most rural businesses.


Many farming families with long-term relationships with the land are slowly losing the battle to remain viable. Lack of profitability remains a major challenge for many farm businesses, with production costs such as fuel, labour, fertiliser, and transport continuing to increase, resulting in decreased profitability and increased farm debt levels. The purchase of stock, seed, tractors and headers all requires capital which is often difficult to source, especially when many banks are trying to limit these same debt levels.


Traditional farm succession practices involving the intergenerational transfer of the family farm are no longer viable, with tighter margins and high land values making it difficult to buy out siblings. The traditional practice of handing the farm to the eldest son is no longer acceptable, and the conflicting expectations of family members, divorce, and the growing complexity of laws which impact on the transfer of assets are making farm succession planning emerge as a major issue for most primary producers.


In every family, financial problems are the major source of stress and anxiety, but their impact on farming families, who live and work in isolated areas, is immense. These issues often cause a quiet desperation which becomes a way of life for many families, who try to manage without advice and support, often resolving to battle it out against the odds, often until the financial reserves are exhausted.


This is why the decision of the coalition government to maintain the current funding of the Rural Financial Counselling Service is to be commended, because it highlights that this government cares about the farming families in regional areas of my home state of Western Australia. Unlike Labor, we are committed to expanding their markets, cutting red tape, creating opportunity for regional industries and ensuring the continuation of the Rural Financial Counselling Service in Western Australia.


The value of the contribution being made to the lives of farming families by the Rural Financial Counselling Service in WA remains unquestionable. The Rural Financial Counselling Service of Western Australia offers a free, confidential and mobile service which assists individuals, families and small rural businesses with under 10 employees in identifying financial and business options for those in stressed situations, whilst dealing with the complex set of emotions being expressed by rural customers. It assists with negotiating with financiers and provides information about government and other assistance schemes. It helps rural businesses access accountants, farm management consultants and educational services. Perhaps most importantly, it provides support in identifying and approaching key professionals for succession planning, family mediation and personal counselling.


The board of the Rural Financial Counselling Service in Western Australia contains some of the most respected figures from the industry, from a range of backgrounds including banking, consulting, support agencies and farming groups. Over the past five years it has provided support and services to almost 600 clients, and it employs ten rural financial counsellors located throughout the state, all of whom are focused on engaging with and incorporating their client's ideas and solutions within a proper, sustainable business framework. In the words of the CEO of the Rural Financial Counselling Service of Western Australia, Chris Wheatcroft, the strength of the Rural Financial Counselling Service is that it 'returns control to the decision makers, the farming family'.
