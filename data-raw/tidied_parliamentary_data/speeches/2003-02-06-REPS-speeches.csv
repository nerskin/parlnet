"O'Byrne, Michelle, MP",ALP,2003-02-06,"—I welcome the opportunity to continue my remarks from last night. The collective voice of the Australian people marshalling against involvement in a war in Iraq without United Nations sanctions comprises the broadest range of our community, including that of the RSL. The people of Australia are making it very clear that they are not happy for our troops to join a war against Iraq at the behest of one or two other nations, however close those countries might be as allies. As the Leader of the Opposition stated, the very first clause of the ANZUS treaty makes it clear that all alliance decisions must be in conformity with the United Nations. The people of Australia are saying that global peace is best preserved by the combined voice and actions of the nations of the world. A single nation should not take on the role of the world's policeman. If that were allowed to occur, then it would not be long before another nation believed it also had a right to play that role. The authority of the United Nations must be upheld. 
If a war with Iraq should eventuate, there is no question that thousands of lives of innocent people would be lost, thousands of innocents would be maimed and injured and more would be made homeless. As a previous speaker mentioned, there would be every chance that Saddam and those close to him would somehow survive a war, whilst the very people who have suffered under his regime would again be forced to pay a very high price. This is a very poignant reason why every possible avenue to avoid a war must be taken. 
I am concerned that the Prime Minister authorised the deployment of Australian troops to the Persian Gulf and then only yesterday sought to explain and justify same to the parliament and the Australian people. I am concerned that the same process might be followed in committing these forces and others to battle. The Prime Minister's statement provided me with no new information or further justification as to why Australia should join the United States and Britain in an unsanctioned attack upon Iraq. We have known for a very long time that Saddam is a horrendous dictator. We have always accepted that he must disarm. Until now we as a nation have accepted that we must allow the United Nations to maintain and assert its authority. But what I heard from the Prime Minister yesterday was a justification for another plan and, sadly, without new information.
I was then made even uneasier by the revelations surrounding the foreign minister's discussion with the New Zealand High Commission. Since then we have heard the minister attempt to justify his comments. He claims that they did not outline a pre-existing alternative plan to that which had been conveyed to the government and to the Australian people. The explanations and semantics have flowed, but I cannot be convinced that the government has not been working on another agenda. The foreign minister says that the comments related only to Australia's participation in the Multinational Interception Force. To me that does not make sense and it certainly does not ring true.  
In my remaining remarks on this motion I would like to address the third of my concerns arising from the Prime Minister's statement. I have a very special respect for our service personnel and it has been my resolve since I entered this House to ensure that ex-service men and women and those that they leave behind are adequately and appropriately cared for. Last week I convened a forum on veterans' affairs in Launceston. It was attended by ex-service men and war widows from all over northern Tasmania, together with their advocates. The stories they had to tell were a sad litany of the problems faced by veterans and war widows that are going unanswered by this government. If the government cannot provide for our existing ex-service personnel, how can it justify asking more Australians to serve, with an expectation that they and their loved ones will be properly cared for when and if they return?
The list is frightening. It was reported that doctors have begun advising veteran patients that they are already unable to recognise the gold card or will be unable to do so in the near future. This government's answer has been to threaten doctors who do not sign up for an unnegotiated extension of the memorandum of understanding. Others were distressed by cutbacks in Veterans' Home Care, fearing that the withdrawal of that little bit of help would force them out of their own homes and onto an already stretched waiting list for aged care places. This government's excuse is that there are more people wanting support than they have budgeted for. This government's answer is that veterans should return to the community home care system they were previously in.
Lack of appropriate psychiatric care, especially after hours, was highlighted. One advocate told of veterans being locked up in police cells overnight and at weekends because no other care was available. This is simply not acceptable. Inadequate access to legal aid to support claims, inadequate access to crisis accommodation and lack of support for carers were also presented as areas of great concern. If we are to contemplate sending more Australians into battle, we have to make absolutely sure of two things: first, that there is no alternative and, second, that, if that be the case, we are prepared to look after them when they return.
As I see it the government has dropped the ball with respect to our existing ex-service men and women. It must live up to its obligations to them right now and at the same time think about the consequences of their increased numbers. For all three of the reasons I have outlined I cannot support the pre-emptive actions of the Prime Minister. He is so eager to commit us to an unauthorised military engagement, yet so reluctant to accept the consequences.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,1,1
"Panopoulos, Sophie, MP",LP,2003-02-06,"—Since September 11 and the barbarous attacks in Bali our world has changed. Terrorism has visibly thrived on our doorstep. A key sponsor nation, Iraq, has a track record of funding, training and financially rewarding terrorists around the world. To my knowledge, so far in this debate no-one has claimed that such support is being withdrawn. When Labor argue that more time is needed for UN inspectors, they are really burying their heads in the sand and avoiding the real issues and the hard decisions that need to be made. This is perfectly consistent with their track record: they have been weak on terrorism and weak on border protection. They have mastered the inability to act in the interests of their fellow citizens. As Colin Powell has so concisely said, the issue is not how much time we are willing to give inspectors to be frustrated by Iraqi obstruction but how much longer we are willing to put up with Iraq's noncompliance before UN resolutions are enforced.
Saddam Hussein has been playing with the Western world for 12 years now. At the conclusion of the 1991 Gulf conflict Hussein signed an agreement that Iraq would vacate ownership of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems. Twelve years later there can be no doubt that, in spite of numerous demands by the United Nations that Iraq disclose and destroy such weapons, Hussein has failed to do so. As recently as 1999 the UN concluded that Hussein had 25,000 litres of anthrax, enough to kill several million people, and that he had 38,000 litres of botulinum toxin, enough to subject millions of people to death by respiratory failure—and the list goes on. If we back away from enforcing existing UN declarations on Iraq, of some things we can be certain: Hussein will not reward us with compliance and he will be free to generously furnish terrorist cells around the world with these deadly biological weapons. 
I have commented on other occasions about the inability of the opposition leader to rise to the task of leading his party in the interests of Australia. His term as opposition leader will be marked by a discredited, divided and dispirited Labor Party in which the word mainstream is deemed politically incorrect and may not be uttered. He claims that there can be no action against Iraq without yet another UN resolution, yet even if we do get another UN resolution Mr Crean has left open the door to oppose that action. He is so frozen with fear about his leadership that he cannot even take on discredited former ministers like Carmen Lawrence and get a firm resolution through his own caucus.
Mr Crean has allowed the Labor Party to slip back into the bad old days of the seventies when the unions and the ALP were obsessed with hatred of the United States. Just the other day the union movement in WA promised industrial turmoil in that state in the event of an Australian military commitment to a conflict in Iraq. Back in the seventies the ALP could not accept that they had presided over the worst government since Federation, with the inevitable consequence that they were voted out of office in a landslide. At their conspiratorial best, some in the Labor Party blamed the CIA for bringing down the Whitlam government. Such statements came as no surprise. After all, back then the Labor Party actively sought campaign funds from Saddam Hussein's murderous Ba'ath Socialist Party.
Mr Crean's contribution thus far to the issues of the war against terrorism, disarming Iraq of its deadly weapons of mass destruction and Iraq's potency for exporting terrorism has been at best embarrassing and at worst a clumsy attempt at political point scoring. He has put his political ambitions above the interests of the citizens of this nation. Last December, when he refused to see US Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage on his visit to Australia, Simon Crean lost the last vestige of credibility in the struggle against terrorism. This was an ideal opportunity for him to be briefed first-hand of the US perspective and to put his point of view to one of the most senior decision makers in the US administration. Because of fear of provoking criticism from his left wing faction, Mr Crean abrogated his proper responsibilities and boycotted this critical meeting with a senior official of an administration that he now criticises for the same reason from the refuge of Parliament House.
Mr Crean could not find time to see Mr Armitage, but he could not scurry down fast enough to the wharf to hector our troops about the evil of their mission. If he could not offer support to our defence forces, he should have kept his mouth shut and stayed away. His speech seemed to serve no purpose other than to demoralise our troops and cheer up his own side. As I have said previously in this House, many in the Labor Party pretend to support great Australian institutions, but scratch the surface and you will find disdain and disrespect. Only last December the member for Corio mockingly labelled our great Navy `McHale's NAVY,' but I am sure he is not averse to having publicity photos taken with his local RSL branch. People like Simon Crean and his fellow travellers have no respect for our serving men and women and no sensitivity for their families.
—The member for Indi will refer to members by their office.
—These troops who have gone to the Gulf choose to make it their vocation in life to serve their country and to place themselves in potentially life-threatening situations. My thoughts are with them and their families. The Leader of the Opposition is driven by a desperate attempt to hang on to his job rather than securing our region against terrorism and cutting off the supply of weapons and training of terrorists by nation states. In addressing the motion, the Leader of the Opposition spent most of his time snarling at the Prime Minister and the President of the United States. He referred to the Prime Minister 83 times, to the Bush administration 56 times—mostly in pejorative terms—and to Saddam Hussein only three times. He spent no time focused on the human rights abuses of the Iraqi regime and the critical role Iraq plays in giving succour to terrorist cells around the world, including those in the South-East Asian region. 
It is also true that the Leader of the Opposition's crude anti-Americanism must please the left fringe in his party, but those on the other side of the House who fit more comfortably with the mainstream are hanging their heads in embarrassment and shame. They know that the United States is a friendly nation with which we share the common values of democracy and respect for the dignity of human life. They know how important the United States is to maintaining world peace. As Kim Beazley said in this place in 1996 when he welcomed the then President of the United States, Bill Clinton:
We have always sought American engagement in this region. We have never always agreed with you on things that you have chosen to do in time, but we have always sought it because we have always believed that at the end of the day the values we share are the same. Those values are egalitarian values that recognise the rights of all people of all backgrounds. Those values are values which at the end of the day ensure world peace and ensure decent living standards.
And of course we all remember the comments the member for Brand made in 1998 when he fully supported the deployment of Australian troops and stated:
... the stand Australia takes on this is very important. When we were in government we always took the international arms control issue seriously. ... We hope that the international community will pursue the enforcement of those agreements with good commonsense and with a degree of substantial unity.
The current Labor leader could learn something from his predecessor. Similarly, another born-again pacifist, Laurie Brereton, could do well to reread his comments of 1998 when, in regard to Australia's deployment of troops to the Gulf, he said—
—Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I believe that it is appropriate for the member speaking to refer to members in a proper and appropriate way.
—The member for Kingsford Smith should have been addressed by his appropriate title. 
—My apologies. The member for Kingsford Smith said:
... the threat of military action was justified, given Iraq's undeniable record as a rogue state. Saddam Hussein has never hesitated to use military force to pursue his objectives. ... His is a regime with an extraordinary record of aggression, of treachery, of duplicity and of gross abuse of human rights. It is a regime which routinely resorts to appalling violence to achieve its ends and at the end of the day appears to respect only the threat of military force.
Yesterday, however, the member for Kingsford Smith stated that our involvement should be:
... limited to the present naval enforcement of the UN sanctions and our bilateral logistic and intelligence cooperation with the United States.
How things change with the internal convulsions of ALP party machinations. But Mr Brereton does not have a monopoly on shameless hypocrisy. The opposition spokes-man on foreign affairs has also done a 180 degree turn on the role that he believes Australia should take in international affairs. In his maiden speech, he expressed pride in Australia's role in the resolution of international problems and said:
... we have been respected as an effective international citizen. This represents the cumulative capital of successive Australian governments, ministers and officials. This capital must be harnessed for the future. That requires leadership ... 
He went on to say:
Our future challenge is to build across this nation a robust domestic constituency of support of Australia's future engagement, one that will not be hijacked by the periodic outbreak of local populism.
So much for the U-turn of the politics of yet another leadership aspirant.
In addressing this motion, the Leader of the Opposition has said on the one hand that Saddam Hussein needs to be disarmed and on the other hand that we have an opportunity to secure a peaceful outcome—yet he has not explained the process of the peaceful outcome that will disarm Hussein. The UN has been trying for 12 years to do so and it has failed. If the Leader of the Opposition has a hidden plan to succeed where the UN has failed, it would do his standing and his approval rating in the polls some good if he shared that wisdom with us. In spite of all the evidence, the Leader of the Opposition has said that no case for war has been established. We do not know what further facts and justification Mr Crean needs. Why is it that, if the UN Security Council says it is okay to use military pressure to disarm Saddam Hussein, somehow justification magically material-ises.
Of course it is preferable to have support from as many nations as possible in the attempt to disarm Saddam Hussein. The fact that any of the five permanent members of the Security Council, including Russia and China, may not agree with taking such steps does not take away the fact that it is morally the right decision for Australia to make. Cooperation with other nations does not translate into an automatic abrogation of our responsibility to make the right decisions for Australia and the moral decisions for enduring world peace.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,1,1
"King, Catherine, MP",ALP,2003-02-06,"—It is with profound sadness that I rise today to participate in this debate. In September last year I stood in this place and said that we must not commit Australian men and women to war before all diplomatic efforts have been exhausted. Today, just five months after this parliament's last debate on Iraq, 2,000 Australian service men and women have been dispatched to the Middle East, without regard for the diplomatic processes currently under way in the United Nations. What we now know, but suspected in September, is that the Howard government has never intended to allow the United Nations to exhaust diplomatic means to disarm Iraq. We now know this because we are privy to what the Minister for Foreign Affairs told the High Commissioner for New Zealand in October last year. He has protested his innocence on the issue but his explanations are just not credible. It is something the Australian people were never meant to know. We know that because the minute from the meeting records the foreign minister saying that `this was not a point that could be made publicly'. We know from the leaked document that, as early as October last year, the Howard government decided it would not withdraw any Australian forces once deployed to the Middle East—not even, according to the document, if the United Nations diplomatic effort `broke down'.
For months, the government has deceived the parliament and the Australian people about its plan to involve this nation in a war against Iraq. Forces are now committed, but the government still refuses to be honest with the Australian people. The government refuses to reveal the details of the commitment the Prime Minister has made to the United States on behalf of the nation. It is deceitful, shabby behaviour. I believe the people of Australia will hold the Howard government accountable for this deceit.
I represent an electorate scarred by war. Many towns in Ballarat are entered through `avenues of honour', arboreal tributes to sacrifice on foreign shores. No town in my electorate lacks a memorial to sons and daughters sent to war. These wars were declared by the men who occupied the office held by the member for Bennelong today. State schools in my electorate hang honour boards that display the names of boys who went away but did not come home. The people of my electorate know the pain of war. They know war is sometimes necessary and they know no war is fought without a cost. It is because they know war that they demand that governments do all they can to avoid military conflict. I fear that the Howard government has not done all it can to avoid this war.  
In September last year, this House debated the foreign minister's statement on Iraq. It was a statement delivered reluctantly and in response to the opposition's demand that the government bring before this House the matter of Iraq's noncompliance with the United Nations resolution. Before he delivered his September statement, the foreign minister spent a few days trying to play down his strident support for a unilateral strike on Iraq by the United States. This posture of support was one he maintained through most of 2002. It reached its apogee in the middle of the year, when he labelled the opposition `appeasers' for suggesting that the United Nations should be asked to address Iraq's noncompliance with UN resolutions. The foreign minister's unbalanced and hysterical position was fully exposed when he said that the Labor Party was talking like Saddam Hussein, because we wanted Australia to engage the United Nations in a process to deal with Iraq.
The parliamentary debate on the foreign minister's statement took place at the same time as the United Nations was negotiating with Iraq on the return of weapons inspectors. Rather than welcome the return of weapons inspectors, the Howard government adopted an ambivalent position. Soon after the September debate, the rhetoric about support for the United Nations was put in the bottom drawer, and enthusiastic endorsement of war talk by the United States became the norm once more. It is a pattern we have seen repeated in recent days.
Just like the foreign minister in September, the Prime Minister would now have us believe he is a strong supporter of the United Nations. What is more, the Prime Minister wants us to swallow the proposition that Australia's participation in a United States invasion of Iraq is not guaranteed should the United States make that request. I do not believe him and I do not think the people of my electorate believe him either.
In its management of this matter, the Howard government has demonstrated the sort of lowly behaviour we have now come to expect of it. Rather than take the Australian people into its confidence, the government has shunned them. Rather than reveal the commitments it has made on their behalf, it has deceived them. And rather than stand up and protect Australia's national interest, it has subordinated our interests to those of the United States.
There are two elements I want to address in relation to the United States. The first is the nonsense we have heard from the Prime Minister and others about Australia's obligations under the ANZUS treaty. The ANZUS treaty does not require Australia to respond to all requests from the United States anywhere in the world and on any terms. It simply does not. Similarly, the United States is not required to respond to all requests from Australia.
The second matter to address is that of our national interest. Australia cannot determine its national interest by reference to those of another country. It is important that Australia has regard to the views of other nations. It is important that Australia has regard for the views of the world community expressed through the United Nations. But the argument that we must uncritically adopt the views held by the United States administration because the United States is a powerful friend is absurd. The absurdity of that proposition is easily exposed in the sphere of trade policy, where US interests only sometimes coincide with our own. They do not always concur.
Saddam Hussein is a ruthless ruler of his people. The Iraqi regime is undemocratic, and Saddam Hussein governs without mercy. Like most Australians, I believe Australia should support efforts by the United Nations to enforce disarmament in Iraq. I believe that we must allow the weapons inspectors to continue their efforts. Along with 16 members of the federal opposition and a range of other MPs from around the country, I today joined community, church and union leaders in a statement to express our opposition to Australia's unilateral involvement in war with Iraq. We, together with millions of Australians, oppose unilateral action and do not believe that the case has been made for war. 
Overnight, the US Secretary of State, Colin Powell, made a presentation on Iraq to the UN Security Council. Nothing I have seen in that presentation has changed my view that the international community must do everything it can to resolve this crisis without resort to war.
As we debate this matter today, some 2,000 Australian service men and women are assembling in the Middle East. As simply and honestly stated by the Leader of the Opposition at the departure ceremony for the HMAS Kanimbla, Labor does not support the Prime Minister's decision to predeploy Australian service men and women to the Middle East ahead of any decision by the United Nations to authorise military action. Labor does, however, give its strong support to the men and women of the Australian defence forces.
For the first time in decades, this nation is divided on the question of whether Australia should send service personnel to war. It is important for service men and women, and their families, to understand that this parliament is not divided in our support for them.
As the Prime Minister departs for Washington this week on what he describes as a `peace mission', I implore him to keep the following words by former US President Franklin D. Roosevelt in mind:
I have seen war. I have seen war on land and sea. I have seen blood running from the wounded. I have seen men coughing out their gassed lungs. I have seen the dead in the mud. I have seen cities destroyed. I have seen 200 limping, exhausted men come out of line—the survivors of a regiment of 1,000 that went forward 48 hours before. I have seen children starving. I have seen the agony of mothers and wives. I hate war.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,1,1
"Bartlett, Kerry, MP",LP,2003-02-06,"—Any sane, rational person is repulsed by the very thought of war. The human costs—the dreadful loss of life and the shocking injury toll, the destruction and waste—are always far too high. Yet peace at any price is not acceptable either. An illusion of peace that delays and multiplies the inevitable casualties could be far worse. The illusion of Chamberlain's so-called `peace in our time', which was so soon and so cruelly shattered with such appalling loss of life, is not ultimately an option. Nor are the more recent examples, such as East Timor in 1975, Rwanda and Bosnia. The immense human cost of war which forces any reasonable person to recoil must be weighed against the consequences of appeasement, denial and indefinite inaction.
In the context of the current debate regarding Iraq, I wish to make a number of points. The first is that before embarking on any military action, every reasonable attempt at finding a peaceful solution must be undertaken. Every alternative must be exhausted. War must be absolutely a last resort. The efforts by the United Nations to secure disarmament by Iraq, the efforts to force Iraq to comply with a series of UN resolutions, have been lengthy, patient and protracted. From the initial resolution requiring Iraq's disarmament 12 years ago up to the current time, exhaustive efforts have been made. 
Throughout this time Iraq has delayed, obstructed and obfuscated, violating many UN resolutions along the way. Attempts at peaceful diplomatic resolutions continue with UN resolution 1441. The Blix report to the United Nations clearly shows that it, too, has been treated with contempt. In the report of UNMOVIC to the UN Security Council on 27 January, which details many areas of concern regarding Iraq's non-compliance, Hans Blix concluded that `Iraq appears not to have come to a genuine acceptance—not even today' of the need to disarm. Certainly, UN weapons inspectors need to be given sufficient time to complete their task. However, the questions remain: how long is enough and will extra time make any difference? After 12 years of Iraq's refusal to comply with UN demands, surely there are limits to how much more time is justified.
Secondly, we must also consider the consequences of a failure to act. In Saddam Hussein, we are talking about a dictator with an appalling record of human rights abuse; one who has accumulated biological and chemical weapons; one who has used poison gas against his own people, massacring thousands of Kurds—in some estimates, up to 100 000; one who has systematically used torture, mutilation and rape against his own citizens; one who has financially supported Palestinian suicide bombers and other terrorist groups; and one who has allowed a branch of al-Qaeda to wage a war against the Kurds in northern Iraq. How many more thousands of Iraqis will be subjected to torture and death by the refusal of the world community to act? 
But the threats imposed by this regime potentially go far beyond the borders of Iraq. The dual development of weapons of mass destruction and links with terrorist organisations is a scenario which the world cannot afford to ignore. To allow biological and chemical weapons to be supplied to terrorist organisations provides them with much more sinister and destructive power than car bombs or fuel laden planes ever could. To sit idly by and just hope that good wins out—that sanity will prevail—is not an option. The mentality that deliberately wreaked death and destruction on innocent civilians in New York on 11 September 2001 and in the Bali bombing will not suddenly and voluntarily reform itself. Backed with access to weapons of mass destruction, the potential threat to innocent civilians in Western democratic countries across the world is both real and frightening. The potential consequences are too horrific to be ignored.
As Tony Blair, the British Prime Minister, has said: `Every single day as Prime Minister'—faced with information about how biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons are being freely developed and traded around the world—`I tell you honestly what my fear is: my fear is that we wake up one day and we find either that one of these dictatorial states has used weapons of mass destruction ... and we get sucked into a conflict ... or alternatively that these weapons fall ... into the hands of these terrorist groups, these fanatics who will stop at absolutely nothing to cause death and destruction on a mass scale.'
The other related point which needs to be noted is this: if the world fails to act, it sends a very dangerous message to other despots, other dictators with links to terrorist organisations. If after 12 years of UN resolutions requiring disarmament, now, at the brink of forcing compliance, the UN and Western nations refuse to act, what chance is there to seek compliance and disarmament in the future to prevent the accumulation of weapons of mass destruction by other rogue states? As the British Prime Minister said:
Show weakness now and no-one will ever believe us when we try to show strength in the future.
The third point I would make is this: we need to continue to work towards a united approach with the United Nations. Certainly, the efforts of Australia and Britain have been strongly directed towards this. It is worth pointing out that the British Prime Minister and our Prime Minister had been instrumental in urging the US to seek that resolution with the UN late last year rather than acting unilaterally. It is Tony Blair and John Howard who have currently pressed the United States to seek a further United Nations resolution. It is important that the world sends a united message to brutal dictators such as Saddam Hussein regarding the resolve of democratic and peaceful states.
The recent letter to the United Nations by eight European leaders from Spain, Portugal, Italy, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic urging support for the United States said this:
The Iraqi regime and its weapons of mass destruction represent a clear threat to world security. This danger has been explicitly recognised by the UN. All of us are bound by Security Council resolution 1441, which was adopted unanimously. ...
In doing so, we sent a clear, firm and unequivocal message that we would rid the world of the danger posed by Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction. We must remain united in insisting that his regime be disarmed. The solidarity, cohesion and determination of the international community are our best hope of achieving this peacefully. Our strength lies in unity.
The combination of weapons of mass destruction and terrorism is a threat of incalculable consequences. It is one at which all of us should feel concerned. 
...				...			...
Our governments have a common responsibility to face this threat. Failure to do so would be nothing less than negligent to our own citizens and to the wider world.
...				...				...
We cannot allow a dictator to systematically violate those resolutions.
If they are not complied with, the Security Council will lose its credibility and world peace will suffer as a result.
The way ahead, particularly in an increasingly mobile global community, must be for democratic countries to stand together for peace and for the values we share. It is essential that we show a collective will to resist evil in the world. But it is also essential to ensure the relevance of the UN in international peacekeeping. For 12 years its resolutions have been ignored and subverted. The most recent resolution 1441 demanding Iraq's compliance stated clearly that this was Iraq's final opportunity to disarm and it threatened `serious consequences' if it failed to so. If, after all this, the United Nations walks away from its responsibilities, it surely will be consigned to irrelevance. It will ultimately suffer the fate of the League of Nations following its failure to act prior to World War II: in 1931 when Japan invaded Manchuria; in 1935 when Italy attacked Abyssinia; in the early 1930s when Germany rearmed and then reoccupied the Rhineland contrary to the Versailles Treaty; in 1938 when Germany annexed Austria and then occupied the Sudetenland. If the UN fails to act here it will be consigned to the same impotence and irrelevance. This would ultimately mean the removal of its ability to prevent other regimes such as Saddam Hussein's from developing similar threats to the world.
The fourth point I wish to make is this: the efforts to politicise and cheapen this serious debate are appalling. The transparent claims by the opposition leader and many on the other side are based on nothing but their own assumptions and what they think others want to hear. To do this, as the opposition leader did, in front of departing Australian troops, was reprehensible. Absolutely no-one wants to see Australian Defence Force personnel put in harm's way. It is still to be hoped that a decision to commit Australian troops can be avoided, that the issue can be resolved peacefully. But if this eventually becomes unavoidable, our forces need the full and unequivocal support of the Australian community.
In conclusion, the world must be willing to stand up for what is right. We must all rigorously exercise our consciences in this. We must do whatever we can to preserve peace, international security and the rule of international law. This requires at times some very difficult decisions. It may in the last resort require united action to force compliance. 
The consequences of war are horrific, but so too are the potential consequences of a protracted failure to act. At this very late hour we still hope and pray that diplomatic pressure will be sufficient to convince Iraq to comply with UN resolutions and that war can be averted.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,1,1
"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,2003-02-06,"—In September last year, I twice spoke in this House on the growing international crisis over Iraq and expressed the grave concerns of many of my constituents about Australia's possible participation in a US-led military attack on Iraq. Like many of my constituents I called upon America to tell the truth to the world, that the attack we were being called upon to participate in was really about the need for America to more reliably control oil.
—That's nonsense.
—No, that's the truth, Member for Macquarie. I have not changed my mind. What has changed, however, is that the Howard government has, through the recent commitment of Australian troops to the Gulf, enthusiastically embraced President Bush without the public or parliamentary debate needed before taking that most serious decision to put at risk the lives of 2,000 Australians who have been committed to the Gulf. 
Another change I can report is a multiplying of the number of messages I have received from my constituents condemning the government's rush to support the seemingly inevitable unilateral strike on Iraq by the United States that will do untold damage to the United Nations, to the international rule of law and the security of our planet. Whatever the perceived weakness of the United Nations, Australia must always work to strengthen the authority of the UN, not to undermine it. Australia must never, directly or indirectly, assist in so damaging the international rule of law. No-one in this House believes that Saddam Hussein's regime deserves any sympathy—quite the reverse. It is an oppressive and violent dictatorship and a great threat to peace in the world. Saddam Hussein is an evil despot who kills and oppresses his own people. Whatever the real extent of Iraq's weapons program, again, sadly, Iraq is not alone. North Korea is another terrifying example.
What makes Iraq more dangerous than North Korea? The truth is that there is no difference. They are both proliferating deadly weapons. The threat they pose to the world is identical. What makes Iraq more important to the United States than North Korea? I believe there are at least two answers. Firstly, the United States has failed to win the war we seem to have forgotten about—that is, the war on terrorism. For George Bush, answering to an angry American people, Iraq is the easy alternative to effectively hunting down Osama bin Laden and eradicating al-Qaeda terrorist networks. Secondly, Iraq produces oil—lots of oil. I do not agree with the Prime Minister when he says it is ridiculous to talk about oil in this context. The United States burns a quarter of all the oil consumed in the world. It is utterly dependent on foreign oil supplies. It increasingly has to import oil from a growing number of unreliable or unstable sources, including the Persian Gulf, Caspian states such as Kazakhstan, Russia, Venezuela, Algeria, Nigeria and Libya. The precise significance of the world oil market to current US foreign policy considerations is difficult to measure. However, when President Bush and the Prime Minister become so defensive about suggestions that a new, US sponsored regime in Iraq would ease at least some of the pressure on the United States economy it makes me deeply suspicious, and I know many Australians feel the same way.
Labor believes that any Australian government has a fundamental responsibility to do everything in its power to maintain two important priorities: Australia's national security and its international security, particularly in our region. There are many important questions about Australia's national security that the Prime Minister has not answered—questions we were not allowed to ask on Tuesday, because the Prime Minister cancelled question time. This is infuriating if you consider that this debate should have taken place before the Prime Minister took it upon himself to blindly follow the orders of President Bush in deploying Australian troops. Nevertheless, the Prime Minister must explain to the Australian people exactly how the urgent removal of Saddam Hussein protects Australia and neighbouring countries from threats of terrorism. Some of Australia's important neighbours—including our nearest neighbour, Indonesia—fear that Islamic extremists will see an attack on Iraq as an attack on Islam and that the result will be an upsurge of terrorist activity that could spill onto our soil. Following the Bali tragedy, this fear is real.
We all agree that the present Iraqi regime and its weapons threaten the world, but so does North Korea. In some ways, so do India and Pakistan. Unquestionably, the government's first priority must be to consider Australia's immediate national security. The opposition believe that Australia's national security is better served by using Australia's strong relationship with the United States to promote a collective United Nations response to the question of permanently disarming the present Iraqi regime. Unfortunately, the Prime Minister has fallen victim to his belief that Australian foreign policy should always come from London and Washington. It is Vietnam all over again. The ANZUS treaty has never required Australia to say `yes sir' to every request for military force. Australia's solidarity with the United States should never be questioned. Alliance, however, does not mean subservience. 
This government is not only likely to fail in its responsibility towards national security but it is also failing to preserve international security. The Howard government's obvious support for a unilateral attack on Iraq helps the United States set an ominous precedent. In my view, the United Nations will suffer irreparable damage and the law of the jungle will replace the international rule of law. The veracity of Colin Powell's presentation to the UN this morning has to be tested. Hans Blix and the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission—UNMOVIC—must be allowed every opportunity to complete their job. Every effort must be made to disarm Iraq by peaceful means. The risk of a nuclear war and the danger to Australia—in fact to all human life—is far too great. As he has done in the past, Saddam Hussein will inevitably use millions of Iraqis as a human shield against a United States led strike, and that must surely trouble everyone. We must at the very least allow UNMOVIC to complete their task.
I believe that, unfortunately, the Prime Minister and the foreign minister, Mr Downer, are not interested in forensically and exhaustively pursuing a peaceful resolution to the Iraq crisis. Instead they accuse the opposition of appeasement. Laurie Oakes and Channel 9 exposed last Tuesday evening what we already knew: that the government has decided that Australian troops will participate in an attack on Iraq regardless. The foreign minister told the New Zealand High Commissioner:
... Australia would ... prefer UN backing. However, and this was not a point that could be made publicly, Australia was not in a position if the UN process broke down, to withdraw our ships and other presence from the Gulf.
The government has not been telling the truth about the extent of Australia's commitment. Mr Downer's response, in my view, is not believable. The Prime Minister is not listening to the people of Australia. Remarkably, the most poll driven Prime Minister is ignoring the polls on this issue and seems handcuffed to George W. Bush—
—What about Tony Blair?
—or to Tony Blair. He is not listening to Hans Blix, the United Nations, Nelson Mandela or even other Liberals against war on Iraq. The Prime Minister can ignore all of them, but I know who he cannot ignore. He cannot ignore the people I represent in my electorate of Lowe. They are giving me a clear message. The Prime Minister should be listening to messages from Drummoyne such as the one from my own parish priest, Monsignor Vince Redden:
A committed effort by everyone to satisfy the universal longing for peace is the solution, not military might.
From an Abbotsford constituent:
I also object very strenuously that Australia is aligning itself with an American administration that is clearly out of control and interested only in war mongering.
From a Croydon constituent:
... pre-emptive aggression is completely against the principles of the United Nations.
Or this observation from another Croydon constituent:
John Howard says one of Iraq's gravest sins—the one that is about to be used to justify the invasion—is that Iraq has not cooperated fully with the UN inspectors. When UN inspectors were here in Australia to inspect our refugee facilities last year, I don't recollect that John Howard's attitude to them was one of full cooperation. He bagged them, discounted them, belittled them and allowed them limited access.
From a Strathfield constituent:
I find it immoral that you would send Australian citizens to fight a war that is so unjustifiable. I do not believe that such a decision shows due care for the Australian people.
From a Concord constituent:
I oppose most strongly any war with Iraq and I strongly disagree with Australia being involved in any such war.
From another Concord constituent:
I write to you to urge you not to condone Australia's involvement in a war on Iraq, even if such an action is sanctioned by the UN. Iraq is not a credible threat to Australia or indeed the United States. 
From Canada Bay constituents:
We do not believe that the government is adequately representing the people of Australia as the majority do not want a war.
In concluding I say that Dr Blix must be given more time to complete his task. We must give peace a chance.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,1,1
"Lloyd, Jim, MP",LP,2003-02-06,"—I do not want war, the Prime Minister does not want war, and I know that the Australian people do not want war. War, and all that it brings, is abhorrent to me. But there are times when tough decisions have to be made, and this is one of those times. Saddam Hussein has repeatedly refused to abide by United Nations Security Council resolution 1441 to give up its weapons of mass destruction. Only this morning on the national news we heard details of the UN briefing by US Secretary of State, Colin Powell, providing further evidence that Iraq continues to hide its chemical weapons and other weapons of mass destruction and continues to hinder the work of the UN weapons inspectors. 
Australia supports the UN process. UN Security Council resolution 1441 sets out a process by which disarming Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction can be achieved peacefully. Australia, as a non-Security Council member, will continue to support that process in whatever way we can. We have underlined to the US the importance Australia places on pursuing the issue through the UN, and I am very pleased that our Prime Minister, John Howard, will be travelling to the United States, the United Kingdom, the United Nations and Indonesia next week to put forward Australia's view and to do what he can to prevent war in the Middle East. 
An interesting point that has not been highlighted in the media is the fact that our Prime Minister can very quickly organise meetings with the US President, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, representatives of the United Nations and the President of Indonesia—all in a very short time frame. I do not recall another time in Australia's history when any of our Prime Ministers could arrange such high-level meetings with the leaders of so many major countries in the world in such a short time frame. The reality is that we are a very small country and a relatively small player in the world. But the fact that those meetings have been arranged so quickly emphasises the importance and the stature which are placed on Australia and particularly on the role that our Prime Minister, John Howard, plays in this issue and in other issues on the world stage.
In my electorate on the Central Coast, a poll was conducted by a local paper, the Central CoastHerald, which asked residents a number of questions. There were six questions:
Do you support a war against Iraq without United Nations backing?
Do you support a war against Iraq with United Nations backing?
Do you accept Prime Minister John Howard's support of US President George Bush in his campaign against Iraq?
Should Saddam Hussein be removed as leader of Iraq?
Do you think Saddam Hussein is a threat to Australia?
Do you think Saddam Hussein is a threat to the world?
For the first question, 29 per cent said `yes' and 70 per cent said `no'. For the second question, 83.67 per cent of people polled said `yes'; for the third question, 64 per cent of people said `yes'; for the fourth question, 87.1 per cent of people said `yes'; for the fifth question, 67.7 per cent said `yes'; and for the sixth question, an overwhelming 93.55 per cent of people questioned said that they believe he is.
The poll was conducted by telephone between the hours of 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. on Thursday, 30 January and 8 a.m. and 10 a.m. on Friday, 31 January. The paper phoned 100 random numbers on the Central Coast. To achieve a random sample, callers asked to speak to the person of voting age whose birthday next occurred in the household. It was a very random survey and it showed that many Australians, certainly on the Central Coast of New South Wales, are supporting what our Prime Minister and government are trying to do to ensure peace throughout the world. 
I would like to read a small quote from an article by Piers Akerman in the Sunday Telegraph of 2 February. The last part of the article says:
Seventy years ago, the League of Nations dithered when asked to act against Hitler's Germany. We all know the consequences of that inaction and the fate of the League after the ensuing World War. The UN is now faced with the same irrelevance.
The issue is clear. For the UN to have any credibility it must take action now.
I have heard many speakers on the other side say that they do not want to be the ones to tell their children or grandchildren that they were involved in sending some of our troops to the Middle East to be involved in this conflict. However, I do not want to be the one to tell my children and grandchildren that I had the chance to act to prevent war and to prevent weapons of mass destruction being used but that I did not act. I did not act at a time when we could have stopped Saddam Hussein, others like him and terrorists around the world by taking strong action and showing him and like-minded countries that the world will not put up with the threat of weapons of mass destruction and the threat to world peace. Strong action now by the United Nations and other countries could avert a much greater disaster in the future. I want to be able to tell my children and grandchildren that I was part of a government that, in a timely manner, made a strong stand when it was needed and that we were part of a force that took a stand that led to world peace, making the world a safer place so that our children and grandchildren could get on with their lives in Australia—which, despite all the concerns that we have, is most certainly the best country on earth.
In conclusion, I am very proud to be part of John Howard's government. Yesterday this House witnessed what I believe is one of the best speeches the Prime Minister has ever made when he spoke in his own defence against the pathetic censure motion moved by the opposition. As we all know, the Prime Minister is a great orator. He is a great, compassionate person. I would encourage all Australians, if they have the opportunity to read what the Prime Minister had to say in the House yesterday afternoon, to do so. Unfortunately, those sorts of speeches do not get reported in the media, and most Australians do not get the opportunity to hear or read them.
I am pleased to have had the opportunity today to put some of my thoughts on the record in the House so that the Australian people know how determined I am in supporting the government in its role of, hopefully, finding a peaceful solution in the Middle East and, if this is not possible, of doing something—hopefully with UN backing—to ensure that our children and grandchildren can look forward to a safer world without the awful threat of weapons of mass destruction hanging over their heads for many generations to come.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,1,1
"Emerson, Craig, MP",ALP,2003-02-06,"—Elected governments have no more onerous a responsibility than to decide whether or not to commit the country's fighting men and women to war. Yet this government made that commitment long ago and outside the legal processes of the United Nations. As far back as July last year, Australia's Minister for Foreign Affairs publicly pledged the government's support to the US administration's position on Iraq at that time, accusing Labor of `appeasement' for wanting this matter to be pursued through the United Nations. This has been the centrepiece of the Howard government's attack on Labor: that we have wanted the United Nations, not the United States acting alone, to decide whether an attack on Iraq is warranted.
Months ago, under the direction of the Howard government, Australia joined with just one other country, Great Britain, in forming with the US a coalition of the willing—being prepared to attack Iraq outside of the United Nations processes. Let us be clear: such an attack would contravene international law. It would breach article I of the ANZUS treaty with the United States, which says: 
The Parties undertake, as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations, to settle any international disputes in which they may be involved by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security and justice are not endangered and to refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force in any manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.
Labor takes seriously Australia's rights and obligations under the ANZUS treaty, including article I. Labor has been a consistently strong supporter of the ANZUS treaty, of the United Nations and of Australia engaging with our neighbours in the Asia-Pacific region.
The Howard government, on the other hand, has been consistently hostile to the United Nations. It has singled out the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees for its most vitriolic attacks—a politically convenient target in its strategy of winning over former One Nation voters in the lead-up to the last election. The Howard government has been consistently critical of Labor's close engagement with Asia. Indeed, in the Prime Minister's famous interview in which he espoused the self-proclaimed Howard doctrine of Australia behaving as the deputy sheriff in Asia to the United States, he lamented:
We are a European, Western civilisation with strong links with North America, but here we are in Asia.
It was only when the US administration suddenly and belatedly decided to give the UN processes a go that the Howard Government just as suddenly rediscovered the UN system—not because the Prime Minister believes in the UN system or has any faith in it, but because the President changed tack and he quickly followed. But we all knew—the Australian people knew—that the deal had been done.
It might be technically true that Australia is not yet formally committed, and certainly nothing under ANZUS obliges us. But how can the Prime Minister credibly claim that he, rather than Australia, has a choice? Having joined last July the most hawkish in the US effectively against figures such as Colin Powell, how could he pull out? John Howard knows that, if he pulled out now, he would be this century's David Lange, the man whose address Washington lost.
The Howard government is now literally going through the motions—the motions of the UN weapons inspectors, the motions of UN resolutions, the motions of consulting other countries like Indonesia and the motions of a parliamentary debate that does nothing more than take note. The die has been cast: the Prime Minister has handed to President Bush the decision on whether Australia goes to war. Barring Saddam Hussein and his family going into exile, that decision has already been made—the United States is going to war and, as a consequence, Australia is going to war, with or without the approval of the United Nations. 
When will the Prime Minister start acting in Australia's national interest? Labor has strongly supported and continues to strongly support the alliance with the United States. America has been a good friend of Australia. We remain good friends and firm allies. But, while nurturing the alliance, we have to balance it with a clear understanding of Australia's interests.
Labor supported US-led action against Iraq more than a decade ago, but under the auspices of the United Nations and in the face of clear-cut Iraqi aggression against a neighbour. Labor cooperate in supporting intelligence gathering for the US and Australia through the joint facilities based in Australia. Labor refused all demands, including by the National Farmers Federation, to put the joint facilities up for negotiation in trade disputes with the United States over rural export subsidies through the export enhancement program. We regarded the joint facilities as critical to the global balance and the free world's defence. But Labor asserted Australia's right to have a foreign policy that did not involve signing on the dotted line for every policy of the United States. We wanted, always, a clear understanding of the Australian interest.  
Labor in government did not agree to the proposed MX missile trials in the Tasman Sea. We were fearful of a shift from the stable concept of mutually assured destruction to a destabilising strategy of first strike. Labor in government did not agree to the US Strategic Defense Initiative—Star Wars—for similar reasons. Labor in government espoused a South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone against the expressed wishes of the United States. But we accommodated their real concerns on the capacity to deploy United States Navy ships through the region. More recently, Labor in opposition have not supported the US National Missile Defense System, worried again that it will accelerate the development of nuclear systems in countries like China and encourage local arms races between India and China, for example. 
None of these differences has threatened or weakened the alliance. Good friends can differ. That they can differ is an affirmation of friendship and a basis for mutual respect. A good friendship does not involve one taking instructions from the other and carrying them out unquestioningly. But, because Labor have consistently argued for the UN processes, consistent with article I of the ANZUS treaty, we are accused by the government of being appeasers. As shadow trade and industry minister, I was intrigued to note that, in his original opinion piece accusing Labor of appeasement, the foreign minister wrote extensively of the benefits he could expect from complying with US wishes on Iraq. Front and centre of those benefits was a prospective US agreement to negotiate a free trade agreement with Australia. The foreign minister said:
The government makes no apologies for the closeness of our ties with the US and the opportunities it provides to promote our national interests. During his visit the Prime Minister was able to help prepare the way for a free trade agreement between Australia and the US, which will generate even greater economic benefits from this trading relationship.
Here is an Australian government—the first in the postwar era—entangling trade policy with our strategic alliance with the United States. I am deeply sceptical about the purported benefits of a preferential trade deal with the United States and I am deeply worried about the damage it will do to our trading and wider relationship with the countries of East Asia. But today is not the occasion to set out my concerns about the proposed US-Australia free trade agreement; I have done that before and will do so again. 
My point today is that this is the first Australian government in the postwar era to entangle trade and strategic policy. In an extraordinary speech late last year, trade minister Mark Vaile listed as a compelling reason for a free trade agreement with the United States:
An FTA would help engender a broader appreciation—in both countries—of our alliance and our common role in helping underpin the stability and prosperity of East Asia and the Pacific. This is now doubly important given the nature of threats to security—and especially to Western interests—in the region.
The foreign minister delivered the same words in a speech exactly two months earlier. It sure sounds like Australia as deputy sheriff to the United States in the Asia-Pacific region.
Although Mr Howard has recanted his `deputy' language, the sentiments of his self-proclaimed Howard doctrine are alive and well in his government—so much so that the foreign minister delivered a speech last August titled, `The strategic importance of a free trade agreement to Australia-United States relations'. In his speech, the foreign minister rejected criticism that pursuing a free trade agreement with the United States detracts from Australia's relations with East Asia. In mounting his defence, the foreign minister cited US military expenditure as being six times that of Russia and 10 times that of China. The foreign minister considers that Australia's trade policy should be shaped in accordance with the size of the defence budgets of different countries!
The Prime Minister has done untold damage to Australia's relations with East Asia with his `deputy sheriff' rhetoric. We ought to be cooperating with the governments of our region in combating terrorism. The Howard government has conducted no high-level diplomacy with the countries of our region about its reasons for going to war with Iraq. Instead, it has despatched a junior foreign affairs official to do the diplomatic rounds. The Prime Minister should have visited the countries of our region, explaining his position. Contrast his slackness with the diligence of Bush and Blair. Yet in many ways we are more at risk than they are in their own regions. To gravely compound the situation, the Prime Minister engaged in unnecessary language of pre-emptive strikes against possible terrorists in sovereign Asian countries. This entire failure of regional diplomacy has made Australia and Australians abroad more vulnerable to terrorism. 
Make no mistake: Saddam Hussein is an evil killer. He has gassed, tortured and murdered his own people. He must be disarmed. Despite 12 years of relative failure, the inspection process is now working. But it cannot work on its current schedule. UN weapons inspectors, headed by Hans Blix, have not delivered their second report and yet the Australian Prime Minister has committed Australia to a war with Iraq, within or outside the UN system. He will not and cannot extricate the Australian forces already committed to an attack on Iraq.
The government has given no thought to the weeks and months following an attack on Iraq. It has given no thought to the security of our country against the elevated risk of terrorism. It has given no thought to the duration of Australia's involvement in Iraq. If the objective is disarmament, we are told that will happen very quickly. But, if the government's objective is regime change, it may commit to a long military presence in Iraq to usher in a new regime. It has given no thought to the prospect of thousands of Iraqi refugees making their way to Australia, other than hoping that somehow it can blame Labor. And it has given no thought to our relationship with our Asian neighbours.
During this debate the government has said nothing about these issues so vital to the wellbeing of the Australian people and Iraqi civilians. It is our local needs and concerns that we must protect first. While supporting disarming Iraq, we must keep our commitments in proportion to the relative significance of the issue to our security. Above all, we must prepare the ground. The Prime Minister's sloth since last July has meant that nothing has been done on this preparation. We needed the Prime Minister constantly visiting South-East Asia arguing his case. In the absence of this, we desperately need UN cover. It would have to be the starting point of mounting a defence of our actions as our interests in the region come under attack. But through the Prime Minister's sloth none of these things has been done. Australia faces an elevated risk as a consequence of the negligence, neglect and sloth of the Prime Minister of Australia.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,1,1
"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,2003-02-06,"—I find it a matter of great disappointment that it is necessary for me to rise in the chamber to speak on this particular matter on Iraq. The fact that we as Australians are being forced to consider involvement in military action against Iraq is something that distresses and disappoints me. It distresses me because our freedom, liberty and way of life are being threatened by an increasingly desperate and despotic dictator who has shown little respect for the rule of law or the sanctity of life. It disappoints me because Iraq has repeatedly shown contempt for its international obligations. I am also disappointed at the failure of the United Nations up until this stage to take a position of leadership and strength on this matter.
The issue of Iraq and how the world deals with Iraq's possession of chemical and biological weapons and other weapons of mass destruction and the possibility of a nuclear capability will be one of the defining moments of the 21st century. It will define whether good can triumph over evil and whether the United Nations has a future as an organisation that is capable of solving problems that challenge humanity. I am reminded of Edmund Burke's quite famous and much cited quote:
The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing. 
The appropriateness of this quote, here and now, cannot go unstated. If, as members of the free world and as peace-loving, law-abiding citizens, we fail to take a stand on Iraq, we can be assured that in years to come the problems and threats posed by Iraq will continue to mount. As the Prime Minister in his speech in this place indicated:
... if the world turns its back on the threat posed by Iraq, if the community of nations gives up because it is all too hard, then Saddam Hussein will not reward us all with benign behaviour.
They are very thoughtful and thought-provoking comments made by the Prime Minister of this nation. Concerningly, there are those who continue to be deceived by Iraqi spin and deception. Regrettably, some honourable members opposite would have to be placed in that particular category. There are people who argue that Iraq is being targeted because of its oil reserves. That is absolute and patent nonsense. If Iraq were being targeted for that reason, there would have been a much easier way to go about it. If that were the case, the United States, for instance, could have made some sort of deal with Iraq to get cheap oil from it or, when the Gulf War to liberate Kuwait took place a number of years ago, other arrangements could have been made with respect to oil. There are others who contend that war is not the answer and that peaceful means of disarming Iraq should prevail. Obviously, the preferential way to proceed would be if Iraq could be disarmed peacefully, in accordance with the resolutions of the UN Security Council. But Iraq has shown a material and ongoing refusal to abide by its international obligations.
As a Christian, a parent and a person who values human life, I too hope for a peaceful resolution to this issue. I hope that the United Nations and the broader community of the world can convince Iraq to make a full disclosure of its chemical, biological, nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction programs. I hope that at this late moment—five minutes to midnight, as one of the media outlets suggested—Saddam Hussein can be convinced to abandon these programs and comply with the resolutions of the Security Council. Sadly, when one looks at the record of the Iraqi regime, this is a very unlikely possibility. The last 20 years have shown Iraq to be a great threat to its neighbours. Time- and time again, Saddam Hussein and his ilk have shown a capacity to act irresponsibly and inappropriately.
It is now time for the world to take a stand—to take decisive action against Iraq and other rogue states, to indicate that the world will not be held to ransom and that we will not tolerate the use of chemical weapons or rape or torture or execution as a means of spreading terror and repression. We hope that this matter can be resolved peacefully. Saddam Hussein is the person who can avoid war. Saddam Hussein is the person who can ensure that Iraq observes the requirements of the UN Security Council resolutions. But, regrettably, not only has he tortured and victimised his own people for decades; he is refusing to observe Iraq's international obligations.
The decision of the Howard government to forward deploy troops to the Middle East demonstrates our resolve that Iraq should obey the UN's demand to disarm. In the event Iraq does not disarm, then the possibility of becoming involved in military action will have to be contemplated. The Australian Labor Party has wrongly suggested that the government has forward committed our troops to a war against Iraq. Nothing could be further from the truth and the Prime Minister of this nation has said that at this stage no commitment has been made. He has indicated that if or when the appropriate occasion arises then such a decision will be made in accordance with what is right and in accordance with Australia's national interests. The forward deployment of some Australian forces to the Middle East adds to the pressure being placed on Saddam Hussein and Iraq.
While Australian troops alone will not bring Iraq to its knees, I am again reminded of the comments of Edmund Burke, which I mentioned a moment ago. He said:
The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing. 
By contributing to the pressure being placed on Iraq and by taking a strong stand against its noncompliance with the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council, Australia is doing its part to bring about a diplomatic solution to this problem. The alternative would be to do nothing or, worse, prevaricate by sitting on the fence and having two bob each way.
Under the leadership of the Leader of the Opposition, the Australian Labor Party is doing exactly that. I have a personal view that, if the Australian Labor Party were in office, they would do exactly what this government has done. You only have to look at their record in the past to know that what is happening at the moment is that the ALP are endeavouring to manage their internal divisions rather than taking a principled stand on this issue as the government has done. The ALP are trying to bolster the Leader of the Opposition's leadership and trying to paper over the cracks. They are sitting on the fence and they are guilty of a gross dereliction of duty. They are being opportunistic and they have a major credibility problem.
Saddam Hussein is a murderer. He is a man who has condoned eye gouging, rape, piercing the hands of people with electric drills, burning people with hot irons and blowtorches, and numerous other forms of torture. So the ALP should really be joining with the government on this issue. The ALP, if it were in government, would be taking the same stand as this government has been taking. As an aside, it is a matter of very great regret that the ALP did not welcome the member for Brand back onto the opposition front bench. He is one of the few people in the Australian Labor Party who have any level of credibility in the eyes of the Australian people and it would be good for the political process in Australia if the ALP had someone who had some credibility talking on the ALP's behalf on this issue. But of course the Leader of the Opposition is so uncomfortable with the security of his leadership that he just rejected the obvious talents of the honourable member for Brand. The ALP continues to wander in the wilderness because it does not have a position of principle on this issue; it is simply a position of pragmatism and opportunism. The Australian Labor Party will not receive the support of the Australian people for taking this sort of irresponsible stand.
Because of the agreement about time I cannot say all that I had planned to say. I get particularly worried when I see the elements of anti-American sentiment being portrayed in the speeches made by some honourable members of the Australian Labor Party. The member for Werriwa was reported in the Australian as having launched a scathing denunciation of Mr Bush whom he described as `the most incompetent and dangerous President in living memory'. The member for Lilley referred to what he said was `the cavalier language of George W. Bush' and claimed that this had inflamed the crisis in the Gulf.
The member for Melbourne said that Mr Bush was `straight out of Dr Strangelove'. He said that Mr Bush `wants to take the world back to the 19th century, where might is right and there is no international law'. As I pointed out, there is international law. There are the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council, which Iraq continues to ignore. Yet you find that the member for Melbourne appears to be defending those breaches of international law by the Iraqi regime. There were many other anti-American sentiments expressed by members of the opposition. I think it is particularly unfortunate that members of the opposition are indulging themselves in this way when, if their party were in office, they would be taking a responsible stand in the way that this government has.
The UN Security Council received a report from General Powell and it contained a lot of damning information. Iraqi defectors have brought additional information to light. So the UN Security Council now has an opportunity to prove that it is relevant. Iraq is on trial and the United Nations is on trial. I hope that war can be avoided but it is important that the United Nations accepts its responsibility. I would like to call on Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi regime to observe international law and to accept and implement fully the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council. 
Debate (on motion by Mr Ruddock) adjourned.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,1,1
"Draper, Trish, MP",LP,2003-02-06,"—I wish to commend the Prime Minister for his detailed and comprehensive statement on Australia's role in seeking the enforcement of United Nations Security Council resolutions concerning Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. It is important for us all to remember that a peaceful resolution of this issue is still possible. All it would take is for Iraq to honour its commitments to the United Nations—to reveal all of its many weapons of mass destruction and, through disarmament, cease to threaten its neighbours, and indeed its own citizens, with their use. 
Surprisingly, there are still some who persist in doubting the existence of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. In an interview with Leon Byner of Radio 5AA in Adelaide, the former UN chief weapons inspector and Australian diplomat, Richard Butler, stated:
But the evidence exists. This is where the notion that a case has to be presented, has to be proven, is actually not right. It's in the record, it's thoroughly established on the record that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction, chemical, biological and now we hear from Hans Blix, a new mix of capabilities that simply needs to be accounted for. The real issue is not so much whether or not it has these things, of course it does, but what do we do about it.
In his statement, the Prime Minister provided information from various national and international intelligence sources which provides clear evidence of Iraq's chemical and biological weapons program and of its intent to develop nuclear weapons. The fact that Iraq has sought to purchase uranium from Africa is further chilling evidence of the clear intent of Saddam Hussein to remain a threat and an enemy to his neighbours and the civilised world in general.
On 27 January the United Nations chief weapons inspector in Iraq, Mr Hans Blix, noted serious unresolved issues concerning Iraq's chemical and biological weapons. Dr Blix indicated his strong concern about the following: Iraq's efforts to produce VX, one of the world's most lethal chemical agents; Iraq's failure to explain discrepancies in the account-ing of 6,500 chemical munitions; Iraq's failure to account for biological growth material which could be used in the production of up to 5,000 litres of anthrax; and Iraq's continued efforts to produce missiles of a range exceeding limits allowed for by the United Nations.
The seriousness of such a threat is clear. What is it about those facts that the Labor Party does not understand? The Iraqi dictator is a proven aggressor. For the majority of his dictatorship, he has chosen to make war on his neighbours and on dissidents within his own nation. If the world community had taken no action in 1991, the people of Kuwait would today be under the yoke of the aggressor. Without the willingness to back up the resolutions of the United Nations, with force if necessary and as a last resort, terror would have won and peace would have been dealt a serious blow.
In 1991 the then Labor government committed Australian troops to the Gulf War with the full support and best hopes of the coalition parties. The Liberal and National parties provided their support to our Defence Force personnel for two reasons: firstly, because their cause was right and just; and, secondly, because the decision to send Australian service men and women into a potential zone of conflict and danger is not a time for partisan politics. But does the Leader of the Opposition, Simon Crean, understand even this basic fact? Apparently not. I note the comments of Major David Bermingham, published in the Australian on Monday, 27 January 2003, where he expresses his alarm at the comments of the Leader of the Opposition during the departure of our service men and women on the HMAS Kanimbla. The major makes the following very strong point in his letter. It reads: 
Combatants who depart on their nation's business must do so with the full confidence of that nation.
I understand the strength of feeling on this point because I am a former member of the Women's Royal Australian Naval Service. I know how important it is for our service men and women to know, at all times, that when they risk their lives they do so with the full support and appreciation of the Australian nation. To question the deployment of our troops in the way the opposition leader did, as they were about to depart and in front of their families, was a serious breach of faith in them and a serious error of judgment by him. As Major Bermingham stated in his letter: 
While he may harbour these thoughts as a private citizen, as leader of the loyal Opposition, he is meant to provide nothing less than full support to the nation's defenders.
I am sure most Defence Force members and their families and friends are as appalled and disgusted as I am with the behaviour and the pathetic comments by the Leader of the Opposition, Simon Crean. The leader's contribution to the debate on this issue was a very poor one. It sounded more like a third-rate dissertation from a radicalised college student who was intent on displaying his anti-American credentials than a mature statement of policy from a leader of a major political party. Perhaps this was some attempt to stop the flight of his left wing to the Greens, following last week's defection of a South Australian Labor MP to that political group, which espouses hatred towards anything American and most things Australian.
UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan has indicated the significance of the forward deployment of troops from this country, the United States and the United Kingdom in the backdown by Iraq to allow weapons inspectors to re-enter that country. In other words, our troops are currently serving the cause of peace by their very presence in the Persian Gulf. I am proud of our defence forces and I am proud of the role Australia is playing in standing up to the Iraqi aggressor.
Our troops are entering a zone of danger, just as so many other Australians risk their own lives to protect and save others on almost a daily basis. I speak of our police officers, emergency service officers and firemen, who are expected to put their lives on the line to protect us from fear and danger. They are doing their best to serve and protect Australians, just as our service men and women are protecting us as part of an international effort to disarm Saddam Hussein. Our police do not serve overseas as our troops do, but they serve in our community, in our shopping centres and around the corner. Each day, when a policeman, a fireman or an emergency worker puts on their uniform, they are risking their lives to keep us safe. Their wives, children, brothers, sisters and parents never know from one day to the next whether they will come home. Those people choose to serve. They volunteer to keep us safe, as our troops in the Defence Force do. Does the Labor Party believe that they should all stay at home because it is not safe or they might get burnt in a bushfire? I suppose not, but how hypocritical of them.
Australia's position has been clear and consistent from the beginning of this crisis. From the start we supported action through and by the United Nations. Today we see weapons inspectors in Iraq only because of the action the United States and the United Kingdom took, with the support of Australia, in bringing the matter to the UN Security Council.
From the comments I have received from my constituents in Makin as I doorknock my electorate, I believe the vast majority of people believe that Iraq is an aggressor, that it does possess terrible weapons of mass destruction and is not restrained in using them, and that the world community, through the United Nations, must act to insist on the eradication of Iraq's chemical, biological and nuclear weapons capabilities. UN Security Council resolution 1441 sets out a process by which disarming Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction can be achieved peacefully. The choice between peace and war is a choice for Iraq. It must either comply with the wishes of the world community or face the consequences.
The world community does not enjoy the option of doing nothing, despite the protestations of some who claim to stand for peace. If the world ignores the problem of Iraq, it will not go away but will grow into an even greater threat to peace and security. It will send a message to other tyrants and dictators throughout the world that the democracies are weak and divided and are unwilling to defend the freedom and prosperity they enjoy.
The question then is this. In the face of such evil, what are we to do? I was interested to read the comments made by the Catholic Archbishop of Sydney, George Pell, in a recent edition of the Australian. In an article entitled `The gospel for a just war', the archbishop stated: 
The theory of a just war, first spelt out by St Augustine in 5th century North Africa, has been in continual develop-ment since then, with politicians and military thinkers, some-times more than theologians, wrestling with the basic Augustinian requirement that a just war required a just cause, legitimate authority and right intention.
The intention of Australia and its allies is clear—to disarm Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction and put an end to its aggression. From the beginning, the Australian government has advocated that this can best be achieved through and by the United Nations. The Prime Minister has made our position clear. In relation to the just nature of our cause, I wish to quote the words of a veteran Labor Party activist, Mr Jim Nolan. In an article printed in the Australian on 21 January 2003, he stated:
What appears to be beyond the grasp of many of my comrades in the left is the scale and scope of a modern totalitarian regime such as Hussein's. It is truly—to use Iraqi dissident Kanan Makiya's eloquent term—a republic of fear. It is a police state which conducts its ruthless totalitarian control through more than 100,000 secret police. It is a regime which treats its populace with complete contempt—consider the recent humiliation dealt to the Iraqi people by Hussein's referendum. And it is an outlaw state that has acted in continuous violation of the disarmament conditions of the post-Kuwait ceasefire in 1991.
So we meet the test of St Augustine. But does that mean that war is inevitable? The answer is no. If Saddam Hussein acts now he can avoid conflict. If he destroys his weapons of mass destruction and if he ceases his aggression, war can be avoided.
I do not want war and I know of no Australian who does. But the lessons of history have been learnt. Tyrants grow in the face of weakness and fall in the face of strength. The Prime Minister has again shown strong leadership on this issue and it is for that reason that I and the majority of Australians continue to show our faith in his judgment and our confidence in his ability to lead us through this present crisis.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,3,1
"McFarlane, Jann, MP",ALP,2003-02-06,"—I rise today in this debate on Iraq to restate my commitment to peace and a diplomatic solution to the problem of Saddam Hussein within the frame-work of the United Nations. War is evil, a sickness that has plagued human society since the estab-lishment of civilisation. Like poverty, it is something we have always had with us.
I have experienced first-hand the misery and heartache that war can bring to a family. My family has spent 50 years dealing with the consequences of its involvement in war. My father and stepfather both served in World War II, my brother served in Korea and my nephew served recently in East Timor. I will not go into the details of the effect of war on my family as I have already spoken about this in my first speech in this place. But I will say that war has an enormous impact on the fabric of our society.
My experiences and beliefs have led to my involvement in a number of groups in the peace move-ment and I am currently actively working within my electorate and in parliament with some of these groups. My opposition to war originates from a commitment to human rights and dignity. It is from these commitments that, although remaining fervently against war, I understand it is in some cases a necessary evil. If one's principles could not justify the use of force to prevent the rise of Hitler then they would not be worth holding, let alone defending. However, Saddam Hussein is not Hitler and we are, more importantly, not in 1939 but in 2003 with many different options at our disposal.
International law and institutions have developed since 1945 in response to the horrific crimes and consequences of the Second World War. The United Nations has over time constructed an overlapping consensus from the developing international community over the boundaries and nature of just and unjust wars. Attempting to settle international disputes through peaceful means is the greatest tribute our nation can pay to the men and women who died in World War II and conflicts such as Vietnam.
One of the peace groups sent me a letter pointing out the general principles of international law. Those principles hold that peaceful resolution of conflicts between states is required; the use of force is only permissible in case of an armed attack or imminent attack or under UN authorisation when a threat to peace has been declared by the Security Council and non-military measures have been determined to be inadequate; and enforcement of international law must be consistently applied to all states. 
In 1991 the Security Council responded to an actual invasion of Kuwait by Iraq by authorising all means necessary to restore peace. In the current case there has been no indication by Iraq that it intends to attack another country and no evidence of military preparation of any such attack. In addition, it is generally recognised that it does not have the military capacity to attack the key countries in dispute; that is, the UK and US.
The Prime Minister and his government have more than likely already committed to abandoning those principles in favour of George W. Bush's call to arms. The Australian public is entitled to the truth about what commitment the Howard government has made to George W. Bush on behalf of our nation. A government is entrusted with a great amount of power over its citizens, and with great power comes great responsibility. The Prime Minister needs to make sure he lives up to this responsibility. Prime Minister Howard is sending Australians into a war which will possibly be without UN authority. The Prime Minister may talk of peace; however, he was very quick to deploy Australian troops behind the backs of the Australian public and parliament.
This is not the first time the Howard government has lacked transparency. Prime Minister Howard told the Australian public there would `never, ever be a GST'. It is also the government that told us the story of children overboard. This is the Prime Minister who now wants the Australian public to believe that he has made no personal commitment to George W. Bush in terms of committing our troops unilaterally with the US in Iraq.
I would like to note at this juncture so as to avoid any confusion that, although I am criticising the deployment of troops, I am not criticising the troops themselves. I would just like to state that the men and women who serve in the Australian defence forces are some of the finest citizens our country has to offer and embody some of Australia's finest virtues. They have no choice; they are only doing their duty. My argument is with the Howard government, which has made the decision to send them.
What would unilateral action mean for Australia? It would mean that the Howard government would be committing to a war that the Australian community does not want and one that would further damage our reputation in the international community. Australia has always worked through the UN. Australian support for the UN goes back to 1947, when we participated in the UN's first multinational peacekeeping operation. Australia has played a significant part in numerous UN missions, right up to the UN Transitional Authority in East Timor from 1999 to 2002.
The Australian people have not been taken in by the red herring that the ANZUS treaty requires us to cooperate with the US and go to war on Iraq. People can look behind this myth and understand that the ANZUS treaty allows the US and Australia to assist each other if their continents are attacked. Article 1 of the ANZUS treaty states:
The Parties undertake, as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations, to settle any international disputes in which they may be involved by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security and justice are not endangered and to refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force in any manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.
The US, Australia and the UK are not under attack by Iraq.
Another myth is that Australia is supporting the war on terrorism by going with the US to Iraq. At this stage a link between Iraq, al-Qaeda, September 11 and the Bali tragedy has not been established. Therefore, there is no link between Iraq and terrorism. My colleague the member for Brisbane has pointed out the following in his paper:  
Worse than that, it seems most likely that were this war on Iraq to occur in the current circumstances, it would undermine rather than support the war on terror. Security would almost certainly be worse in many nations, including Australia. Any hope of resolving the underlying causes of terrorism, any hope of overcoming the factors that extremists feed upon as they seek to recruit future terrorists, would be dashed.
Out of the 191 members of the UN only two other countries have deployed troops in response to George W. Bush's call to arms: the UK and Australia. Deploying troops without the authority of the UN undermines the mutually agreed upon norms of the international community and does not represent a plan for peace but for war. 
I am convinced that the United Nations can deal with this matter. The fact of the matter is that the UN reached a unanimous resolution back in October; weapons inspectors have produced a tough report; the United Nations is prepared to consider the additional information of Colin Powell; and there is a realisation that Saddam Hussein cannot snub the United Nations. All of that points in the direction of the United Nations being able to get a resolution up that matters. Working within the UN is also a matter of common-sense, which is something the Prime Minister has lacked throughout the issue. It is clear that the best chance for peace exists working within the framework of the UN. The means for dealing with Saddam Hussein are in place and in motion, so I ask: why take the risks, which are substantial—further threatening Australian, regional and global security—by going it alone?
In my electorate of Stirling, my office—as with many of my colleagues' offices—has been flooded with anti-war sentiment. I will read from an email from a constituent:
I am a Major in the army, with service in East Timor, and I strongly object to the Government's deployment of troops in Iraq.
This move shows blatant disregard for the UN and the Australian people....
Additionally, the use of our Defence force in this instance is not what the Force is intended for: defence.
In short, the Government's subservience to the US is disgraceful.
I would suggest it takes a leaf out of New Zealand's book when it comes to treading the boards on the international stage.
PS Nelson Mandela can't be wrong.
In my work with the Medical Association for Prevention of War, I attended the launch of the report Our common responsibility: the impact of a new war on Iraqi children. The report clearly predicts that a war with Iraq will place children at grave `risk of starvation, disease, death and psychological trauma'. The President of the Medical Association for Prevention of War, Dr Sue Wareham, brings the costs of war into focus when she says, `The blood of adult civilians is bad enough. The blood of children is even more morally repugnant.'
The Prime Minister acknowledged this week that Saddam Hussein does not care for Iraqi citizens. I have no doubt of this. Having acknowledged this, why is he so eager to join George W. Bush in a war which will make them suffer unjustly? The 13 million Iraqi children are solely dependent on food distributed by Saddam Hussein. The Prime Minister pointed to Saddam Hussein's refusal to trade oil for much needed medical resources, instead opting to trade it illegally to line his own pockets. War will only compound the food shortages that Iraq is already experiencing. Combined with the fact that only 60 per cent of Iraqis have access to fresh potable water, war will make a bad situation worse for people who are not responsible for the actions of an evil despot.
If war is justified through the UN process, this does not logically imply that Australian forces have to be involved in war. There is nothing contained within UN resolution 1441 that states that Australian troops must participate in a war on Iraq. Australia is a sovereign state, which the Prime Minister may do well to remember. We have out own culture, beliefs and values and my loyalty lies there—not with that of the US or, for that matter, the UN. As a sovereign nation, we parliamentarians are ultimately account-able to the Australian people. People tell me that the case for a just war has not been proven, and I agree with them. Even with UN endorsement, I believe Australia would be entitled to make a just decision not to join the war against Iraq. If the United Nations decided to raise a force to send into Iraq, then Australia as a sovereign state can choose to accept the invitation and participate or can choose to reject the invitation.   
War leaves no side unscathed; I am reminded of this every week working with veterans in my electorate. Veterans, more than any other members of the community, are aware of the consequences of war. They are not in favour of peace at any price but will not support a US war at any cost. A well-respected veteran in my electorate recently spoke to me on the possibility of a war in Iraq noting that the last thing we want is another generation of permanently disabled and psychologically scarred young Australians.
The issue of Iraq, unlike any issue of recent times, defines the differences between the two major political parties in this country. Although the Labor Party may be the party of peace, this does not mean we are the party that is soft on Saddam Hussein. We believe—on this point we are united with the government—that Saddam should be disarmed, but this is best done with the collaboration and cooperation of the 191 other countries within the UN. Labor has always supported the role of the United Nations and the rule of international law. We helped create the UN out of the rubble of the Second World War. It was in fact a former Labor foreign minister, Dr Evatt, who became the founding President of the General Assembly. But while we always support the role of the UN, the Liberals always support their `great and powerful friends'. Let us not have another Vietnam.
The Prime Minister has made a great mistake in committing our troops ahead of the UN. On behalf of the countless number of constituents who have contacted my office over the last few weeks, I oppose his decision. We should not pre-empt war.
In matters of war it is not always easy to know what to do. I personally believe that war is an evil and repugnant act. Michael Walzer, a well-respected author on matters of war and justice, noted in one of his books, `For as long as men and women have talked of war, they have talked about right and wrong.' Prime Minister, as long as people will talk about the war on Iraq, which you are trying to lock us into, they will talk about how you misled the Australian parliament, people and Defence Force.
I would like to conclude by asking the Prime Minister to take note of a truly great statement from Nelson Mandela, who knows the painful costs of freedom and peace. Mandela wrote in his autobiography about the long road to freedom, `If you want to make peace with your enemy, you have to work with your enemy. Then he becomes your partner.'
The first step is for the Prime Minister to be truthful with the Australian people, to heed the words spoken by Mahatma Ghandi, `Truth never damages a cause that is just.' Your handling of the situation has been less than fair, open, transparent and—most importantly—just. Prime Minister, the Australian people deserve better. They deserve a strong leader who is not a sycophant to George W. Bush, who does not go weak at the knees when he meets George W. Bush. The people want you to be fully committed to the UN process. It is time for Prime Minister Howard and the government to show some patriotism and stand up for Australian interests.

"Baird, Bruce, MP",LP,2003-02-06,"—I am pleased to participate in this important debate on Iraq in the House today. As clearly demonstrated by Colin Powell in his presentation to the United Nations Security Council last night, the difficult situation currently confronting the international community with regard to Iraq is not our doing. It is purely and simply the result of Iraq's persistent refusal to comply with United Nations resolutions. In fact, Iraq have been found to be in breach of 16 separate UN resolutions since they signed the cease-fire to end the Gulf War 12 years ago. Under that cease-fire agreement they committed to dismantling and destroying all their stockpiles of chemical and biological agents as well as significant amounts of their delivery systems. This still has not been done, despite the clear will of the United Nations. 
In November last year, the Security Council gave Iraq one last chance to comply with resolution 1441 or face the consequences. Last night Colin Powell patently demonstrated that there had been no such compliance. Using tangible evidence, he showed that Iraq had systematically concealed chemical weapons evidence, despite the promise of full cooperation; that Saddam Hussein had threatened with death any scientist who cooperated with weapons inspectors; that al-Qaeda operatives were working in Baghdad with the approval of the Iraqi government and that Iraq is still working on developing ballistic missiles with a range of over 1,000 kilometres. All of these activities are well outside the terms of the `last chance' resolution 1441.
It is important to remember as we debate this important issue that no final decision will be made by the government until this new evidence has been considered by the United Nations Security Council. In the Prime Minister's own words:
The government will not make a final decision to commit to military conflict unless and until it is satisfied that all achievable options for a peaceful resolution have been explored.
We are all concerned about the prospect of war, but I remain optimistic that there will be a United Nations resolution before a commitment is given to support military action in Iraq.
The debate we are having today is vitally important. Any decision to expose our defence personnel to the danger of armed conflict must take into account all of the relevant issues, including Saddam Hussein's track record and the lessons we must learn from history. While there have been some sensible contributions to this debate from both sides of the House, I am particularly concerned by the arguments being mounted by the old Left, who are saddling up to try to relive the glory days of the Vietnam War protests. I hear that one of the speakers from the other side was even quoting the words of Give Peace a Chance. That is part of the problem with the Labor Party: they are stuck in the past without examining the reality of the current context.
Worryingly, the statement by the Leader of the Opposition also showed real naivety about how we must deal with the problem. He said, `Saddam Hussein must disarm,' and, `Nonproliferation is a critical security issue.' He said that Saddam Hussein's regime was `an evil regime that must be disarmed'—but how does he propose to do this? Does he think these important goals will be met by dialoguing, group discussions or all holding hands together and singing Kumbaya? The reality is far removed from this. I hear consistently from the other side the statements, `This is an evil regime,' and, `The man must be removed,' but they do not outline how this is going to be done.
The fact is that Saddam Hussein has a track record of ignoring international diplomacy and non-forceful means of getting him to behave responsibly. We must face the truth that more drastic action will need to be taken at some stage. Let us look closer at his track record: the attacks on Kuwait and Iran, the use of mustard gas on Kurds—including 5,000 killed in the town of Halabja in just one attack—and 90 Scud missiles fired at Israel during the Gulf War. His record shows gross abuses of the human rights of his own populace—systematic torture of political prisoners by electric shocks, the death penalty imposed without trial and thousands killed, including 3,000 simply removed on one particular day. There is silence from the Left on the other side about these gross abuses of human rights. Where are they? Where is the concern about that? If you want to show genuine concern about human rights, address this issue in a realistic way.
Saddam Hussein is obviously continuing with his program to build weapons of mass destruction. In this respect, he is a clear and present danger. VX is a deadly chemical agent, just one drop of which can cause nerve failure and immediate death. Iraq has previously been found to have four tonnes of VX, in breach of its obligations. We saw the deadly potential of anthrax post September 11. Will Saddam Hussein use these weapons? He certainly has the track record of using them in the past. His preparedness to do so is clearly evident. What evidence that he has destroyed these chemical and biological agents does he present? The Blix report comments on Saddam Hussein's lack of cooperation. It says: 
Iraq appears not to have come to a genuine acceptance, not even today, of the disarmament which was demanded of it and which it needs to carry out to win the confidence of the world and to live in peace.
In reality, the international community probably should have taken action a long time ago. Saddam Hussein promised to dispose of his weapons of mass destruction, yet he has continued to thumb his nose at the UN and the international community.
I am reminded of a quotation from Edmund Burke that I once saw on the wall of the Jewish Museum in Sydney: `For evil to triumph, good men have to do nothing.' We in this parliament are accountable not only to the people we represent today but also to the next generation, their children and their children's children. The international community will not have a better opportunity to stop the threat of Saddam Hussein. We must learn from our past failings. Europe, understandably, sought peace in the 1930s through a general appeasement of Hitler, and action was not taken until it was far too late. Look at the price the world had to pay for that delay. We stand accountable for the future suffering of Australians in any major terrorist attack resulting from these weapons of mass destruction or the biological stockpile falling into the wrong hands. 
In conclusion, there is little doubt that Saddam Hussein is stockpiling weapons of mass destruction and chemical and biological materials. There is little doubt that his regime has close connections with al-Qaeda and other terrorist organisations and that it will take any opportunity to strike at a slow-moving Western world. 
Bali has shown us clearly and demonstrably how easily weapons of mass destruction can fall into the hands of terrorists. I had the privilege of attending the Christian memorial service that was held in Bali, and there were 7,000 to 8,000 people in attendance. The reality of the events in Bali was clear and evident. The destruction caused by the bombs was amazing. I spoke to some Indonesians who said they could hear the bombs going off some 20 kilometres away. Buildings were absolutely devastated within a one-kilometre radius of the Sari Club site. If ever we had a clear demonstration of the threat to Australia, this was it.
I also attended several funerals in my electorate for people who died as a result of the bombing—they were in the Sari Club. There were three people who were killed on that night and one person died as a result of severe burns. She hung on desperately. Just a week ago I was speaking to a group of young surfers from my electorate who were in the Sari Club on the night that it was bombed. Their horror as they recalled the event brought home to me in a demonstrable way the clear and present danger that exists for us in the world now. It is not simply a matter of saying, `It is in the Middle East; let the US take care of it' or `Let's wait for some nirvana period.' 
We all hope that there is a clear resolution from the UN endorsing action against this evil regime; but we have a clear demonstration in Australia of the threat to us of terrorism, of the stockpiling of these weapons of mass destruction and of chemical and biological warfare. We have seen it first-hand in Bali. We have seen evidence of what flows from someone who is intent on destroying his neighbours and who grossly abuses human rights in his own country. Here is a man who needs to be removed, not only for the sake of those in Iraq but also for the peace of his neighbours and the stability of the world. 
I heard comments from several speakers about not listening to the US. Our relationship with the US in terms of our security is strong, and it has been in the past. During the Coral Sea battle, the role the Americans had in defending Australia was absolutely pre-eminent. In my electorate, people say very clearly that we must remember the importance to us of America and its own track record in Europe following World War II. The actions that it took in bringing stability to Europe have paid off for many generations since then, and America continues to play a very positive role in the world. We would not have seen the inspectors come into Iraq if it had not been for pressure by the US and other allies in this regard. 
We have a situation which requires action and we are waiting for the UN to pass a new resolution, and we hope that follows. But we also have a situation that is real and clear. Action must be taken not only for the security of the Middle East but also for the long-term future of the people of Australia.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,3,1
"Andren, Peter, MP",IND,2003-02-06,"—The reasons why Australia should not be involved in any war on Iraq have been detailed in many quarters. The reasons why we should be involved have also been outlined but certainly not justified to the satisfaction of the overwhelming majority of Australians. The Prime Minister's statement has not satisfied that majority. Why, they ask, has Saddam Hussein become enemy No. 1 of the United States, Great Britain and Aust-ralia following September 11? With no link satisfactorily explained between the fundamentally opposed Baghdad regime and Osama bin Laden, is Saddam the king terrorist you have when you cannot find the real terrorist?
Australians are also asking: if the majority of the September 11 terrorists came from Saudi Arabia, why is that country not a candidate for regime change? Or is it? Indeed, what is the legitimacy of any leadership in the Arab League? Australians want to know whether regime change in Iraq is simply about putting in place another regime sympathetic to American, British and other interests in the Middle East—that means oil interests and pro-Israeli interests—with the current candidates to replace Saddam fraudsters and charlatans in their own right. They want to know why another 70,000 children, quite apart from thousands of innocent adults—give or take a few thousand—must die in any bombing attack on Iraq, either through pre-emptive strikes by America with British and Australian support or under the umbrella of a less-than-unanimous UN mandate forced on the Security Council. They want to know why this country has committed its defence forces to a war before military action has been declared and sanctioned by the only umpire we have—the UN Security Council.
In this place last September I moved an amendment to a not dissimilar motion to note a statement on Iraq from the foreign minister. I sought approval from this House for Australia not to be involved in any action in Iraq without United Nations endorsement. That was the overwhelming feeling of the Australian people then, and it remains so. My Independent colleague, the member for New England, was the only member to support that amendment and the ultimate vote, twisted as it was by procedures of the House and the cowardice of the government and opposition, to reflect the original, benign, non-binding motion. But the intent of my amendment was not lost on the Australian people, and it is to the shame of this place that we, as representatives, were not prepared to send a strong message to the electorate which reflected public opinion on this issue.
As we have seen, it suited the Prime Minister to not lock himself into a UN position, and that has been clearly demonstrated with the premature deployment of troops to the region without that UN support. The opposition has come on board the UN sanctioned position, but only with some ambivalence when faced with overwhelming public support for that position.
Before the Leader of the Opposition's contribution to this debate, the rhetoric of Labor on this issue was sickening—with the notable exception of the contributions of the members for Kingsford-Smith and Fremantle and a few others, including the member for Franklin. To its disgrace, the party watched the polls before it took any tentative steps to differentiate itself in any substantial way from the government. Where was the opposition support for my amendment to the ministerial Iraq statement last September, calling for this House to not support our involvement in Iraq without specific UN Security Council sanction? 
Alan Ramsey credits the member for Kingsford-Smith with turning Labor around, saying this week that Mr Brereton had become `tired of the fog of words a timid Crean insisted on presenting as Labor policy on military action against Iraq'. Labor policy is now at least catching up with public opinion and has almost matched the Greens and Democrats in reflecting the opinion of the nation. I would like to read into the Hansard some of those sentiments from people in my electorate. Lyn Maciver from Mount David near Bathurst said:
Might alone, no matter how many missiles are deployed, will not win. The losers will be the innocent, as in the previous war against Iraq when an estimated 70,000 children under the age of 15 were killed ... The United States probably has the greatest arsenal of weapons of mass destruction, weapons which have been sold to many other nations and are now being turned back upon themselves.
Herman Hofman from Kelso said:
The billions of dollars we will spend on killing Iraqis need to be spent in Australia. Why use helicopters in Iraq to rain death on people who cannot help where they are born—
and who we will not help to become fellow citizens? Richard Hampton said:
How have we as a nation become such sabre rattlers? How do we get back the balance that was typical Oz not so many years ago?
Robert Muller from Cowra said:
I worry that George Bush seems obsessed with attacking Iraq regardless of what the UN or international community think. Australia should not align itself with this fanatical thinking ... it only adds to the paranoia that is being generated through certain sectors of the media and, I believe, in the government's latest advertising campaign.
Dennis Campbell emailed me from the Whitsundays in North Queensland, where the member for Dawson apparently seems to think—according to her recent ABC AM interview—that there is not a lot of opposition to Australia joining a pre-emptive strike against Iraq. Dennis Campbell wrote:
Last year Mr Howard said there would be no commitment by Australia to any conflict without the matter being debated or the public being consulted. Today without any mandate he is sending our defence personnel to the Middle East ... there is no justification for this action ... the argument of weapons of mass destruction is a fragile argument—as other events have shown, every farmer with a pallet of fertiliser in his shed is a potential terrorist.
Janelle Gervasconi from Wimbledon near Bathurst wrote:
I hope that the recent letters to the editor in the Western Advocate—
expressing overwhelming opposition to this war—
are a reflection of what people are feeling all over Australia.
I might add at this point that a continuing poll of readers of the CentralWesternDaily in Orange has consistently shown that opposition to Australia's involvement without UN approval is running at 87 per cent—having peaked at 91 per cent—saying no to being involved without any specific UN Security Council endorsement. Former Australian rugby captain and Cowra farmer John Thornett wrote to me and that paper, saying:
Howard, no matter how he falls back now, has made us a front line terrorist target and alienated our Muslim neighbours ... Iraq is not the remotest threat to Australia and little to anyone else. It has no link with Al qaeda terrorism—remember it lost half a million young men in its war with fundamentalist Iran ... The US foreign policy record is appalling ... it has propped up corrupt and brutal regimes regularly in its own commercial interest. Its long pro-Israeli and anti-Palestinian stance is at the heart of much of Islamic extremism.
Eric Tanner emailed:
Korea ... Vietnam ... Iraq ... all wars we had to have the USA told us; but did we? What does Australia have to gain when such a big percentage of our citizens are Moslems and peace-loving?
Linda Cormack from Glanmire near Bathurst wrote:
I cannot see how the combined resources of the Western World targeting poverty stricken Iraq could ever be seen as just. 
Simon Francis of Lithgow posed some very pertinent questions about the United Nations. He asked:
... while the US is clearly over the top in some of their sabre rattling, there is a good case to be made for the total uselessness and corruption of the UN Security Council, and the UN itself.
This was one of the very few emails among more than a hundred messages that in any way suggested that regime change in Iraq might be the best course, and I replied:
Of course the UN is corrupted—
the permanent members of the Security Council all have weapons of mass destruction and, indeed, an interest in the fortunes of Iraq—
However, if America is to be the policeman of the world, and not the United Nations, however imperfect, then we endorse regime change anywhere, any time.
Let me remind the House of the words of Robert Fisk in the SydneyMorningHerald of 21 February 1998 when he said:
It is as well to remember that the real trials in the Middle East, the real potential explosion, is in the collapse and death of the Oslo peace process, a calamity that has left Israelis and Arabs on the brink of war with each other ... the crisis over weapons inspection in Iraq has served to divert attention from this colossal blunder in US foreign policy. Washington betrayed the Arab states by persuading them to accept an Israeli-Arab peace and then letting Israel go on building Jewish settlements on stolen Arab land.
There is now no Western-Arab coalition against Iraq, just a bunch of Christian armies poised to attack a Muslim state—to the suppressed fury of the rest of the Arab world.
Fisk reiterated those sentiments on the SBS program Dateline last night, and I would urge everyone to obtain a copy of the transcript of that interview. Those words of Fisk's are as valid now as they were when written five years ago—well before September 11—and they are valid notwithstanding September 11.
Only a foreign policy even-handedness from the West will begin to deny terrorism the oxygen it requires. Australia once had a chance to display that even-handedness, but we have thrown that away by engaging in America's determination to reconfigure the Middle East in its own image. We are being asked to believe new evidence from Colin Powell alleging definite Saddam-al Qaeda links when a British intelligence report that was leaked overnight says that there are no links. In fact, the secular Saddam regime and fundamentalist al-Qaeda have incompatible ideologies.
Russia asks why any photographic evidence of weapons sites has not been made available to the inspectors before. France says that wider inspections and more inspectors are needed. That surely is a reasonable ask. Let us remember that any hiding places would contain material derived from original supplies obtained from the US and, indeed, other members of the Security Council. What guarantees have we that the major powers will not resort again to providing weapons development assistance similar to that provided by the USA and others in the first place to Iraq? The Prime Minister said:
The only hope of a peaceful solution will be if the Security Council acts clearly, decisively and unambiguously.
Does this mean that the Prime Minister says that the only hope for peace is war? To test this parliament's commitment I propose to move an amendment to the motion before the House, which at the moment is: `That the House take note of the paper'. I move:
That the following words be added to the motion:
“and insists that in the absence of specific, unambiguous and unanimous support of the United Nations Security Council, Australian defence forces not be involved in any military action in Iraq”.
I, and indeed the Australian people, demand that this debate not be cynically and cowardly adjourned before my amendment is dealt with. We must at least put this rider on any military commitment we make to Iraq. The Australian people demand this, and this parliament should determine that. Let us not see the sort of cowardice we saw last September.
Personally, I would not support our going to war in any circumstances, unless we or our allies were directly attacked. But I respect those who believe a proper—and I say `proper'—UN Security Council resolution is the best means of determining whether action should be taken to disarm Saddam. Let me remind the House of the article in the current issue of Foreign Policy by Harvard University's Stephen Walt. He says that the historical record shows Saddam can be effectively contained, even if Saddam has nuclear weapons—which is highly unlikely—just as the US contained the Soviet Union with its 46,000 nuclear weapons during the Cold War. Walt also rejects suggestions that Saddam would arm al-Qaeda with nuclear weapons if he had them. He also poses the question: apart from the fact that the secular Iraqi state has little in common with Islamic fundamentalists, like al-Qaeda and especially Iran—something confirmed by the UK intelligence report leaked overnight—why would Saddam risk losing control of those weapons and risk detection and certain retaliation at that point? I am against our involvement in this conflict under any circumstances. It is not a declared war; it is a pre-emptive strike, whether it has UN endorsement or not. But I am happy to move the amendment to reflect the assurance that millions of Australians seek: that the UN Security Council's permanent five, as one, need to support any action against Iraq. 
I have tried to reflect the views of some in my electorate, many of whom will gather in Canberra on Thursday next week, 13 February, at noon outside parliament—the last sitting day before a likely war—to express the overwhelming feeling in country New South Wales that this war is wrong and is certainly not our war. Let me close with the words of Bev and John McClaren of Oberon:
We most sincerely desire that our Nation, Australia, be agents of world peace, not protagonists of conflict.

"Ciobo, Steven, MP",LP,2003-02-06,"—Edmund Burke, a gentleman and a philosopher to whom I made reference in my maiden speech, said:
The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.
It would seem to me that this provides a very acute way of bringing to the attention of this House and the Australian people the very necessary decision—but very unfortunate decision—that we are all faced with making. On this issue, more than on any other issue that I have dealt with since I came to this place, I have taken a great deal of time to consult extensively with my constituents and with my own conscience. I have taken this time because of the absolute sheer enormity of the topic that we are all discussing. Most importantly, I have also listened intently to the arguments that have been put forward from those of the centre, from those right of the centre and from those left of the centre.
What I have come to understand and become even more certain of is that those who are on the left of the centre do not have any arguments. There is in fact a complete vacuum of intellectual rigour coming from that side of the chamber—and it is distressing. It is distressing that the best that the Left can do when they come into this chamber is to engage in rhetoric, hyperbole and invective against the Prime Minister, the President of the United States and the Prime Minister of Great Britain. I have heard illogical references to this being nothing but a war about oil—completely devoid of any rationality; completely escaping and mistaking the fact that, if that were in fact the circumstance that motivated this country, the United States, Great Britain or indeed many of the European countries that stand together on this as the coalition of the willing, that could have been achieved years ago. So how can that possibly be a motivation now? Did President Bush awake one day and say to himself, `This is the way to go to ensure that we get control of 20 per cent of the world's oil supply'? That is certainly not the case. What is very clear is that it is not even anywhere close to that. Norway exports more oil to the world than does Iraq.
I have also heard illogical references and arguments coming from the Left—most notably from the Leader of the Opposition—that what this is all about and the central issue in this debate is whether or not our Prime Minister has already committed troops and whether or not we can turn back our commitment should we ultimately make the decision that it is not in Australia's national interest to engage in any possible confrontation. But what I am looking for, and what I believe most Australians are looking for, is a position from those on the Left that provides clear guidance as to why they stand opposed to any action. It is all well and good to have arguments at the periphery saying that we should not engage in any action, that we should not be engaged in committing troops to possible action; but where is the argument to say why we should not? 
We had a 53-minute speech from the Leader of the Opposition. It was an opportunity for him to put forward his view as to why we should not engage in confrontation if push comes to shove. But what did we get? We got a 53-minute speech about whether or not our Prime Minister had already committed troops. It did not even address the central issue in this whole debate as to whether there is justification for Australia joining with the coalition of the willing to engage in any possible action should we believe it to be in the national interest of this country.
I have heard many arguments from those on the Left about past US failures, and the Independent member for Calare also made reference to that topic. I am not in the slightest bit convinced by these arguments. I completely and totally agree that there have been instances—some could even say many instances—of US failure. But at least the United States has the courage and leaders with the conviction to stand up for what is good, what is right and what is proper. The United States has leaders who will stand up for the rule of law, who will stand up for democracy and who will not confuse oppression with cultural difference. There is a vast gulf between those on this side of the chamber and those on that side of the chamber—and let that be a clear indication of that gulf. I listened when the Leader of the Opposition spoke.
—It's about heart.
—That is exactly what it is about. This debate is very much about heart. The Leader of the Opposition used the word `threat' seven times in his 53-minute oration—but not once did he use the word `threat' in relation to Iraq. He spoke about threats. He made reference to threats from the United States, threats from Australia and he made reference to the US being in a threatening position, but he never once made reference to the word `threat' with regard to Iraq. How extraordinary that he would not make reference to Iraq presenting a threat not only to Australia and Western democracies but also to, domestically, the people of Iraq—the people that Saddam Hussein has proved entirely willing to execute and murder.
Another point that has been extraordinarily disappointing for me has been the personalisation of this debate. The member for Werriwa spoke about this side of the House being filled at the moment with `suckholes'. It is extraordinarily upsetting to me that this language would be the rationale they would use for opposing any possible action. How absolutely incredible that those on the Left would use this kind of personalisation as a justification for not engaging in a possible confrontation should it be demonstrated to be in the national interest. We do not hear any arguments at all that demonstrate why it is not in the national interest. Instead, we get the words `suckhole' and `lap-dog'. Let all those on the Left, or who are left of centre apologists—those who have been emailing politicians throughout this country, saying we should not engage in conflict—display some intellectual rigour. Let them display the reasons why confrontation is not in the national interest, if we can demonstrate that as a result of confrontation we bring democracy to the people of Iraq or, indeed—and perhaps even more importantly—we can provide, to all peoples in Western democracies, a minimised risk of the rogue state of Iraq getting together with terrorist organisations like al-Qaeda. 
We hear arguments that there is no connection between terrorist cells like al-Qaeda and Iraq. There may not be now, but who is to say that in five years time that will still be the case? Where will the Left be in 10 years time, when we have terrorists running around with dirty weapons and releasing them in our capital cities or something like that? Where will they stand and say, `We made the right decision back in 2003. It was those on the Right who were the aggressors and the ones who were keen to murder Iraqi children and do those types of things.' It is absolutely absurd, and I would like to hear, for once, some rationalisation and some intellectual argument from the Left rather than invective.
It seems to me that a large part of the Labor Party's position is based on a form versus substance argument. We hear elements of the Labor Party—and I stress that it is only elements—saying that, if the United Nations supports action against Iraq, they would be willing to support military action. There are also elements—and I highlight this to the House—of what I would call rabid lefties in the Labor Party that are opposed to war at any cost. These people make absolutely no sense at all to me, because they are effectively saying, `It is just a cultural difference for there to be oppression, rape, torture and all sorts of abuses of human rights in countries like Iraq. We can turn our backs to that. They are just cultural differences. We should not engage in confronting that.' They say that the Western democracies and regimes like Iraq are on a similar, level playing field—we are on an even keel. What absolute rot.
The form versus substance argument comes down to this: if they want to talk about the failures of the United States, let us also turn to some failures of the United Nations. Where were the letters that came from the lefties, where were the letters that came from the Medical Association for the Prevention of War and where was the human shield movement that is now mobilising people to go into Iraq, when there was the mass genocide of Tutsis? Where were all of these organisations? Where were the calls for the United Nations to step in when the Tutsis were being massacred and the UN was recoiling at a great rate of knots from Rwanda in 1994? The United Nations stood idly by as over 500,000 Tutsis were massacred, murdered, raped, tortured and abused. The United Nations did absolutely nothing.
—What about the Kurds?
—The member for Moreton speaks about the Kurds. Where were all the human shield movements and the Left then? They stood idly by and turned a blind eye to it. Yet when free, open, tolerant democracies say, `We have a problem here; there is a threat that is posed by a rogue state,' all of a sudden they start jumping up, personalising the issue and calling it `George W. Bush's war' and `a war about oil'. They have all these grand conspiracy theories about the truth of the matter rather than an understanding of what it is really about: a rogue state that has a comprehensive, detailed plan to develop chemical, biological and nuclear weapons of mass destruction.
In 10 years time, or in five years time, what are we going to do when Iraq actually has nuclear weapons because we stood idly by, listened to the arguments of the left and decided to do nothing? What do we do then? We cannot do anything then. We cannot do anything about the fact that terrorist cells have access, through rogue states, to dirty nuclear weapons. We cannot do anything then. Let the coalition of the willing stand up now to be the good men who say, `We will not allow evil to triumph.' Most importantly, we most certainly will not confuse the evil that is Iraq with cultural differences. We are not about that. That is not what this side of the chamber stands for. This side of the chamber stands for the rule of law. It stands for democracy and it stands for the fact that we have the right to demand of other countries that they do not present a threat to us by propagating, through terrorist cells, dirty bombs, chemical weapons and things like that.
Iraq has a fundamental responsibility to disarm. That has already been made clear by the United Nations and it has already been made clear by the world community. So what happened to the missing 360 tonnes of bulk chemical warfare agents that Iraq had? What happened to the 3,000 tonnes of precursor chemicals? What happened to the growth media that is sufficient to produce 26,000 litres of anthrax spores? What happened to the 30,000 special munitions that Iraq had that were specifically designed to deliver chemical and biological agents? 
According to those on the Left we should stand idly by while the United Nations inspection team engages in some kind of scavenger hunt in Iraq. It is lunacy. Let it be clear who the onus is on. The onus is fairly and squarely on Iraq to deliver up the weapons, precursors and tonnes of equipment that are purposely designed to wreak terror on Iraqis and, most importantly, on one of their neighbours—the Israeli democracy.
In the closing moments I come back to one point. Some goods mates and friends of mine were severely injured—some even losing limbs—in the attacks in Bali. I know what their view is and I know, in my heart, what my view is—that is, that we have the opportunity now to stop playing games with Iraq. I am certainly not in favour of war—not at all. But I also know that it is Iraq's responsibility to come clean; it is not our responsibility. Let the left, for once, instead of engaging in invective, put forward a robust argument about why it is not in our national interest. Put the form to one side and look at the substance. Do not say that it can only be through the United Nations, unless it is very clear that the United Nations is doing what it is required to do.

"Windsor, Antony, MP",IND,2003-02-06,"—I would like to speak briefly in support of the amendment that the member for Calare has put forward. But before doing so I would like to congratulate the member for Cunningham on his maiden speech today and welcome him to the parliament. Being a single member of a group, he will find from time to time that this body does not endorse unilateral decisions other than the decision about the possibility of going to war with a number of other countries. I think that is one of the very real community concerns about Australia's position in terms of a possible Iraq war.
I intend to read a number of my constituents' references in relation to the possible situation but the research that I have done indicates that most Australians—and the Prime Minister virtually said this the other day—are opposed to this war. I think all Australians are opposed to war but most Australians would rather see a United Nations sanctioned act if some sort of military action were to take place in the future. We had a Green come into the parliament this morning to give his maiden speech and we had the Prime Minister talking the other day about black and white in terms of this issue. And he mentioned the colour grey and said that there may be some grey areas. This obviously left the government, in their view, with some options in relation to how they can handle this issue. 
The word `grey' has certain connotations and creates great concern with many people in our community. The Australian people do not want a grey solution. They want a solution that is quite clear. That solution, in my view and their view, involves endorsement by the United Nations if some military action is to take place against Iraq. I think that is the intent of the amendment that the member for Calare has put before the House, and I will be supporting it. This debate is possibly overdue and I can understand some of the reasons for that. I think the people of Australia have wanted the parliament to convey their views about what should be happening, to the government, the opposition and the press.
I am not an international lawyer and I do not pretend to be one. I have been fascinated by the number of speeches I have heard by people who are purporting to suddenly be experts in fields where they are obviously not. My role here today is essentially to convey the feelings of the people in my electorate. Hundreds of people have contacted us, and the privatisation of Telstra is the only other issue where there has been such unity of feeling in people. All of us understand that in our electorates there are people of various political persuasions. Quite often when we pick up the phone we can guess what particular individuals who ring us are going to say. But on this issue there is a commonality of purpose right across the traditional political spectrum. 
People are very concerned. They understand that Saddam Hussein is a madman. In September when this debate was on, I was howled down when I said in the parliament that, if Saddam Hussein is such a problem, given the technology the world now has to destroy itself, it is beyond me that one individual has managed to avoid destruction. Yet here we are talking about sending people to the beaches with .303s et cetera. To some degree I can understand the logic of creating a political pressure valve, but the destruction of people, possibly Australians and particularly innocent Iraqis, is prominent in our minds. 
The amendment that the member for Calare has moved embraces a total United Nations sanction—`being with the team'. Many members of this parliament say—particularly with reference to Independent members—that you have to be a member of the team to achieve anything. If that is the case, I think we have to be part of the international team to achieve success. To promote the idea that we have to kill to create peace seems quite strange to me. I suggest that we look at history. Speakers in this debate have quoted various historical figures talking about good men doing nothing and that sort of thing. In Northern Ireland killing has not created peace—it never will. In fact, it has perpetuated a political division. One must ask why we are profiteering politically from fear. That is a recent invasion of the body politic in Australia that we should all be very concerned about. 
It is easy to promote fear within the community; we have gone through some horrendous events. But when the Prime Minister of this country starts comparing Canberra bushfires to acts of terrorism, we are starting to overshoot the mark. People are becoming fearful. There are certain political advantages in using fear as a tactic, but if we are to preserve the way of life which we are used to and which we promote internationally we must recognise that we can overdo those sorts of things and create a society that is not the one we would all want. I think this is happening. If we promote that sort of agenda, we give in to terrorism—we let the enemy win. I suggest that the profiteering from fear that is going on—the $15 million that has been spent on fridge magnets and that sort of thing—is starting to eat away at people. 
I would like to read out some of the comments that have come from people in my electorate. Dr Anthony Simpson from Tamworth says: 
The immense destructive power of modern warfare, including the large numbers of deaths of innocent civilians, and the destruction of the means of survival for those not killed in the immediate onslaught, requires us, as responsible members of the human community, to only conduct such warfare as a last resort, when all other possible means of solving the problems have been genuinely tried and proven to fail. 
Professor Iain Davidson from Armidale says:
The US, and its sad little group of followers, does not seem to understand that, as obnoxious as terrorism is, it has real causes and some of them can easily be removed. This war will cause terrorism, not prevent it. 
The Israeli-Palestinian situation probably has some degree of relationship to what is happening elsewhere at the moment in the Middle East. Surely we can look at other solutions to that problem. Left as it is, it is not going to cure itself. Surely we can look at some degree of land ownership for the Palestinians in the future—the root cause of some of the dissension in the world. Carl Petersen from Armidale says:
I have no beef with Australia providing such war support where there is worldwide acceptance for action (sanctioned via the UN), but our abrogation of an independent foreign policy and slavish unthinking US support, I find repugnant and frankly, quite unAustralian.
Rosalind Fuller from Inverell, another community in my electorate, says:
Why has Iraq become the current focus of attention? Is Iraq currently invading another country? Are the Iraqis currently committing genocide? Do we think that every political system should be a western type democracy? What right have we to impose our politics on other countries?  
John Ellis and Marie Jones have written:
Australia's allegiance should be to the UN rather than the unilaterally acting US. Australia's alignment with the US without the UN backing exposes us unnecessarily to present and future Islamic backlashes. Australia's troops should not have been deployed to the Middle East without parliamentary mandate. 
That is a fairly common comment that I have received across the electorate. To continue:
Australia's unwarranted involvement in the Vietnam conflict sees unresolved problems amongst the returned personnel and their families after more than 30 years. Do we not learn from our mistakes?
Yesterday I took great interest in listening to one of those returned Vietnam veterans, the member for Cowan, relating some of the messages he is currently hearing. They were similar to the ones he heard many years ago. Peter Szacsvay from Armidale strongly opposes Australia's involvement in any war on Iraq without a UN mandate. Jennifer Miller from Armidale writes:
I disagree that this aggression on the part of America is something that Australians must support, and am disheartened by the Prime Minister's resolve to involve Australians in this way.
Neville Crew OAM from Armidale writes:
Iraq is not the only country with weapons of mass destruction. It would be a tragic irony if the US used its weapons of mass destruction to eliminate those in Iraq, and leave a stockpile in Israel, Pakistan and India.
Reverend Fred Miller from Walcha, a smaller community in my electorate, writes:
I consider myself a pacifist and oppose any military action at any time ahead of diplomatic negotiation.
Paul and Margaret Halloran from Tamworth write:
We want to raise our voice along with the majority of Australians to protest against the proposed war with Iraq and its ultimate outcome.
John and Margaret Ryan from Armidale write:
We are totally opposed to war with Iraq with or without UN approval.
Morna Winter-Irving from Armidale writes:
I'm very disturbed by the image of Australia being the USA's “deputy sheriff” in the Asia Pacific region.
Beverley Simpson from Tamworth writes:
I wish to register my strong disagreement with the government's decision to dispatch Australian troops to Iraq when our representatives have not even debated the issue in Parliament.
Murilyn Airs from Uralla says:
The Australian government may have information about Saddam Hussein's position and actions that have not been made public. However, if they want the backing of the Australian public, they have to “come clean” and let us know all the facts.
That is a sample of the way the electorate of New England has responded, and there are many more like-minded comments coming from a broad cross-section of the community. As I said earlier, the common bond that is threaded through this issue and the issue raised by the member for Calare in his amendment is that Australians want a clear-cut voice from this parliament in relation to the circumstances in which they will engage in military conflict. As the member for Calare's amendment proposes, Australians' involvement in military action should only take place if there is the full endorsement of the United Nations. That would remove the grey from the black and white that the Prime Minister was talking about in relation to this issue.
So I urge members—particularly the Leader of the House and the Prime Minister—to note that this is the first time we have had an opportunity to debate this motion, that the motion should come to some finality, and that both sides of this House should vote on the amendment so that there is a clear expression from the parliament as to where the people's representatives sit on this issue. We are not grey people; we are people who can make decisions and make our voices heard. We should, in this parliament, do so.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,3,1
"Williams, Daryl, MP",LP,2003-02-06,"—History is replete with examples of dictators and rogue countries who have wrought destruction that could have been avoided had the world community taken effective action to stop them. Here we are faced with another dictator leading a nation that seems bent on retaining weapons of mass destruction and using those weapons to undermine international peace and security. The threat is not a theoretical one. We have already seen Iraq, led by Saddam Hussein, carry out an unprovoked attack on a peaceful neighbour, Kuwait. We have also seen Iraq use weapons of mass destruction against elements of its own population. This betrayal of his own people indicates the character of the Iraqi leader and his likely lack of concern for other citizens around the world. 
The possession of weapons of mass destruction by countries such as Iraq, combined with the terrorist threat, is a frightening prospect. The Prime Minister noted the comments of the British Prime Minister, Mr Blair, over the weekend that, unless the twin evils of terrorism and the spread of dangerous weapons are dealt with, at some moment in the future they could well come together, with terrifying consequences for the rest of the world. This cannot be allowed to happen. The world community must ensure that Iraq rids itself of all weapons of mass destruction.
Iraq's record of cooperation with the United Nations on this matter is abysmal and does not augur well for the current efforts by UNMOVIC. The government is still hopeful of a peaceful solution. However, military action might become necessary. The United Nations should not shrink from support for such action if necessary, given the potential dire consequences of Iraq continuing to hold these weapons. Members of the Security Council have a great responsibility. They passed a resolution unanimously and now they must ensure that it is enforced.
Iraq's actions in the past are indicative of the grave threat it poses in the future if it is not forced to disarm. Time and time again Iraq has violated international law. It would be foolhardy of the international community to stand by and let Iraq continue to threaten world peace and security. In 1991, Iraq invaded Kuwait in contravention of the United Nations charter. This flagrant violation of the UN charter was an affront to the basic principles nearly every nation in the world has agreed to live by. Between 1983 and 1988, Iraq used chemical weapons on at least 10 known occasions, causing an estimated 25,000 to 30,000 casualties. In the Iran-Iraq War, Iraq used chemical weapons against Iranian soldiers. Iraq even went so far as to use these horrendous weapons against its own people.
Iraq's behaviour is evidence of a regime that refuses to comply with international laws other nations of the world live by. Not only has Iraq used chemical weapons but it has also developed the most toxic of all known chemical warfare agents, VX. Contact with as little as one drop of this deadly agent can cause paralysis, convulsions and ultimately death. Even after the UN uncovered unambiguous physical evidence of its production, Iraq continued to deny producing VX. Not only has Iraq produced and used chemical weapons, it has also produced biological weapons. In 1995, Iraq admitted that it had biological weapons at the time of the Gulf War. The use of these weapons is condemned by the international community. Iraq has also actively pursued a nuclear weapons program. In breach of its obligations under the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty, Iraq conducted an extensive clandestine nuclear weapons program prior to the Gulf War. Numerous Security Council resolutions have called upon Iraq to abandon its nuclear weapons program.
Iraq has defied the will of the international community during the 1990s and continues to do so in the new century, refusing to take steps identified by the Security Council as necessary for the re-establishment of international peace and security. In resolution 687, the Security Council set down the terms of a cease-fire that ended the Gulf War. Among other things, Iraq was ordered to accept, unconditionally, the destruction of all weapons of mass destruction. Twelve years have passed since the Security Council ordered Iraq to eliminate its weapons of mass destruction, and for 12 years Iraq has refused to cooperate. In November 1998, after continued defiance by Iraq, the Security Council passed resolution 1205. In that resolution, the Security Council condemned Iraq's refusal to cooperate with weapons inspectors. Iraq's behaviour was expressly condemned as a flagrant violation of resolution 687. Iraq then refused visits by weapons inspectors.  
Iraq's intransigence on the issue of inspections was highlighted by President Bush in a speech to the UN in September last year. This ultimately led to the adoption by the Security Council of resolution 1441. This resolution noted in part that Iraq was and remains in material breach of existing UN resolutions and provides the basis for the current regime of inspections being carried out by the United Nations. I will not dwell on that resolution other than to say that, in part, it provides that Iraq must provide immediate unconditional and unrestricted access to the weapons inspectors. Such access is not being provided. Indeed, the chief weapons inspector, Hans Blix, in his report to the Security Council on 27 January this year stated that `Iraq does not appear to have come to genuine acceptance, not even today, of the need to disarm'. 
US Secretary of State Colin Powell's presentation to the Security Council overnight confirms that Iraq is making no effort to disarm. Secretary Powell's presentation provides further evidence that Iraq is actively concealing its efforts to maintain and expand its weapons of mass destruction. Compliance with Security Council resolutions is not optional. Under article 25 of the UN charter, every member of the United Nations has an obligation to comply with Security Council resolutions. Iraq accepted this obligation when it joined the United Nations. Every time Iraq flouts UN efforts to ensure the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, Iraq breaches this obligation. 
Australia remains committed to a peaceful solution, one that is best pursued through the United Nations. It is up to the United Nations to ensure that its own resolutions are enforced. Given the horrendous nature of weapons of mass destruction, we simply cannot afford to do nothing. Of course, there are risks inherent should armed force be necessary to ensure compliance; but in this case the greater risk lies in doing nothing. The continued holding of weapons of mass destruction by Iraq represents a threat to the Middle East and a fundamental challenge to the rules of international law. Australia cannot afford to sit idly by. It must take a proactive role. In this respect, the Prime Minister's initiative in travelling overseas to discuss these matters with key world leaders is to be applauded. 
In the course of debate, there have been a number of ill-founded suggestions that the government is focused on Iraq to the detriment of countering terrorism in the region. This is simply a nonsense. I wish to state categorically that nothing could be further from the truth. The government takes the threat of terrorism extremely seriously and is doing everything it can to protect Australians and Australian interests from the threat of terrorism both domestically and abroad. The government continues to place a high priority on working closely with countries in our region. To this end, Australia has been working hard to promote regional counter-terrorist cooperation. We are expanding our network of counter-terrorism memoranda of understanding. Already bilateral MOUs have been negotiated with Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. Other MOUs are currently being negotiated with the Philippines and Fiji. The MOUs are aimed at fostering cooperation on a range of issues relating to combating terrorism, including shared intelligence, law enforcement cooperation, training and education and official-to-official contact. Close cooperation also continues in the intelligence area.
Perhaps the best example of the success of the cooperative efforts against terrorism with our neighbours is the cooperation between the Australian Federal Police and the Indonesian National Police on the Bali bombings investigations. The joint investigation team continues to work closely with the Indonesian National Police on this investigation. The relationship is working extremely well, with over 100 AFP and state and territory officers having worked jointly with the INP on the investigation. Following significant arrests, approximately 45 AFP members are still in Indonesia assisting in the preparation of evidence for prosecutions. AFP Commissioner Mick Keelty has publicly stated that the joint investigation foiled a second planned attack. There are many other examples of what Australia is doing to address the threat of terrorism in the region. In May 2002, two officers of the department visited Indonesia to assist the Indonesian government to develop its draft law for the elimination of terrorism. The departmental officers provided technical assistance to Professor Romli Atmasasmita, head of the National Law Reform Agency in the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights, and the task force he was leading. The visit was funded by AusAID's legal reform program. 
In December 2002 Australia co-hosted with Indonesia in Bali a very successful regional conference on money laundering and terrorist financing, which was attended by 33 countries. Australia has played a leading role in assisting countries in our region to comply with international obligations with respect to counter-terrorism. In March 2002, Australia co-hosted with the United States a counter-terrorism workshop for Pacific Island countries. The purpose of the workshop was to assist Pacific Island countries to fulfil their obligations under resolution 1373 of the United Nations Security Council. Ambassador Greenstock, Chairman of the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Committee, charged with monitoring the implementation of resolution 1373, was on hand to assist the Pacific Island countries.
From 15 to 17 October 2002, the Pacific Islands Law Officers Meeting met in Samoa. PILOM delegates considered the Nasonini declaration, which requires forum island countries to have Honiara declaration legislation in place by the end of 2003. The Honiara declaration includes extradition, mutual assistance in criminal matters, proceeds of crime and money laundering. The Nasonini declaration updates the Honiara declaration to include legislation enabling the forum island countries to comply with UNSCR 1373 and the Financial Action Task Force's special eight recommendations on terrorist financing. PILOM put forward a proposal to enable forum island countries to have the legislation as soon as practicable.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs announced in December 2002 that the government will allocate up to $150,000 to help the region strengthen its defences against terrorism under the Nasonini declaration. Aust-ralia is also working within APEC to build inter-national cooperation on critical infrastructure protec-tion. Australia brought a project proposal to the 26th meeting of the APEC Telecommunications and Informa-tion Working Group in August 2002. The project requests APEC funding to build the capacity of computer emergency response teams, CERTs. The main aim of the project is to help developing APEC economies protect their critical infrastructure from hackers and viruses. As part of this project, my department is providing funds for a seminar in March this year in Malaysia. The seminar will raise aware-ness of the need for CERTs in APEC. My department has also been awarded a grant from AusAID to provide training to CERTs in Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines.
Finally, I would like to address the suggestion that Australia's involvement with the US and the stance against Iraq have somehow led to an increase in the threat of terrorism to Australia. It is interesting that the same people who say on the one hand that there is no link between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda or Osama bin Laden say on the other hand that our involvement in the US-led efforts to disarm Iraq has increased the threat of terrorist action from such terrorist organisations.
We live in a security environment that has changed remarkably since September 11 2001. The govern-ment take the protection and the safety of the Australian people very seriously. We have taken significant steps both domestically and inter-nation-ally to address the threat of terrorism to Australia and Australian interests. Regrettably, we are now more of a terrorist target than we were prior to September 11. We know that we are in the minds of some terrorist groups. Osama bin Laden has mentioned Australia three times in his television broadcasts in the Middle East. We have seen Jemaah Islamiah in Singapore target the Australian High Commission; we have seen a person arrested in Perth for allegedly conspiring to blow up an embassy in Canberra; ASIO has told us that there are people in Australia who are supporters of overseas terrorist organisations; and we know there are a small number who have trained with overseas terrorist organisations in Australia. 
We simply cannot afford to ignore those sorts of things. We cannot ignore, either, the fact that the threat of terrorism to Australia existed before our support for the United States and the United Kingdom. There were al-Qaeda attacks on US embassy buildings in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, there were German tourists killed in North Africa and there were French tourists killed in Pakistan. The object-ives of some of the Islamic fundamentalist terrorist groups are to destroy the Western way of life and Western democracy. They do not believe that people should have the freedoms that we enjoy under our democratic system.
Australia, with its proud tradition of democracy, has always been a target for these groups, and Osama bin Laden's interest in Australia started as a result of our role in East Timor, well before Australia joined US-led efforts to disarm Saddam Hussein. By sitting back and doing nothing we are not going to stop these people from attacking Western democracies, including Australia. Pretending that terrorism will not affect us and putting our heads in the sand will not stop terrorists attacking Australian interests or Australians overseas. We have to stamp out terrorism. Being active is not only the right thing to do; it is also the only way we can ensure that we are doing everything we can to protect the Australian public.

"Ferguson, Martin, MP",ALP,2003-02-06,"—I think it is fair to say that there is much the government must be condemned for concerning its mishandling of the situation involving Saddam Hussein and the possibility of war in Iraq. The opposition actually agrees with some aspects of the current debate that have been put forward by the coalition, but there are also huge differences between the opposition and the government on how this situation has been handled, not only in a factual sense but also in a political sense. The truth of the matter is that for every issue the Prime Minister handles at the moment it is not a question of his choosing what is in the best interests of Australia; he is choosing on the basis of what is potentially in the best interests of his coalition government in a political sense. If anyone approaches governing Australia with that objective in mind, they stand condemned, because they are not operating on the basis of what is in the best interests of Australia as a nation. That is the crux of the debate on the issue of a war against Iraq and Australia's potential involvement.
Labor correctly believe that Saddam Hussein must disarm, that the authority of the United Nations must be upheld at all costs, that the issue of Iraq cannot be seen in isolation from the broader security issues in the Middle East and, more importantly, that Australian Defence Force troops should have our total support, as the Leader of the Opposition, Simon Crean, said at their send-off just over a week ago. Labor—not only in terms of our representatives in the House of Representatives but more importantly in terms of our rank and file members around Australia, our affiliates in the trade union movement and the community groups that we work with on a close and ongoing basis—and, perhaps more importantly than anything else, the Australian community are very firmly of the view that we as a nation do not support war over peaceful resolution. Unfortunately, we also have to accept that war is the only thing on the Prime Minister's mind. In essence, the record shows that the Prime Minister is nothing but a warmonger.
We heard in this place the Prime Minister's justification for a US-led war against Iraq. What we did not hear about was a plan to pursue a diplomatic, peaceful resolution to the issue of Iraq's disarmament. We heard,  alternatively, in a very stark, black and white statement by the Prime Minister, merely a message about warmongering. To this end, I contend that the Prime Minister is failing the people of Australia, who overwhelmingly oppose action against Iraq without UN sanction. Labor firmly believes that the deployment of Australian troops was premature. The UN process remains ongoing and there was no mandate at all for deployment. What we have is a Prime Minister who has committed Australian forces—our young men and women, our sons and daughters, our brothers and sisters, our cousins, our nation—to a war in the Gulf, not under a UN mandate but at the request of one person and one person alone, a well-known warmonger: the President of the United States, George Bush. 
The Prime Minister continues to deny the Australian public the knowledge of his full commitment to George Bush, as was clearly evident in question time yesterday. Instead of facing the people of Australia and answering questions asked of him in this place and in the broader community, he is high-tailing it to sit at George Bush's feet yet again. In making this trip, the Prime Minister is conceding very publicly that he is not prepared to front up to parliamentary and public scrutiny for his actions as he ought to.
—And the same can be said of Tony Blair, I suppose.
—The Australian people deserve better from their Prime Minister. They deserve a Prime Minister who answers the questions asked of him, and it is about time that the member for Mitchell actually stood in support of accountability in this House rather than running away from his responsibilities. The Australian people deserve a Prime Minister who puts his accountability to the people who elected him ahead of the wishes of another nation. But he will not be here to answer those questions. Instead, he is leaving the country. It is a bit like when he went to Lords not that long ago when we had Australians losing their jobs—he was off at the cricket rather than worrying about the impact on many ordinary Australian working men and women of the loss of their jobs. This time, yet again, he is leaving the country at an exceptionally important point in the debate both within the parliament and the broader community.
In my view, this again shows the contempt of the Prime Minister for the people of Australia—the people he claims to represent. The Prime Minister claims that he made the decision to predeploy troops to the Gulf because it was in the nation's interest. As the Leader of the Opposition has correctly asked: which nation might that be? Is it Australia or is it the United States yet again? Certainly, Australia must consider our national interest. That issue must always be at the forefront of debate in this House: what is in our nation's best interests? That is why we are elected. That is why we work so hard to make sure that that is the focus of debate in this House. But I suggest that the Prime Minister's decision is not in the interests of all Australians; it is not in our interests to have a Prime Minister kowtowing to the interests of another nation.
I think it is fair to say that it is about time that we as a nation were not dictated to by the foreign policy of another nation. We should put Australia first. We should put security at home first. We should make sure that we go to bed each evening secure in the knowledge that our No. 1 priority as a nation is security at home. We should make sure that we actually put Australia's best interests first. We should put the people of Australia first. We should put the people of our region first. It is clear that the government is turning its back on our own region. The Asia-Pacific region has many problems of its own, including the threat of terrorism that the Prime Minister is ignoring. Only recently we were made aware of the true extent of the terrorist networks across Asia; yet we hear nothing from the government about this.
The volatile history of East Timor appears to have slipped the government's mind—as has the coup in Fiji, the uprising in the Solomons and the instability in Papua New Guinea. As for Indonesia, the government treats this nation with contempt. The Prime Minister's hastily arranged meeting with President Megawati on his way home from London next week—probably via Lords to view the pitch for next season—should be viewed with the cynicism it deserves. His visit is nothing but an attempt to talk up Australia's commitment to the United States-led war against Iraq. In the mind of this government, security in the Asia-Pacific region—our backyard; not the US's backyard—clearly increasingly plays second fiddle to the US war. 
The government has been unable to maintain a consistent position on the issue of Iraq. The government initially assured us that diplomatic processes would have to be exhausted before any military action could reasonably be considered. However, soon after, the United States indicated that America would consider a pre-emptive military strike on Iraq to achieve a regime change. We then had the Minister for Foreign Affairs begin his appeasement rhetoric followed by claims that the Leader of the Opposition was `talking like Saddam Hussein'. The Prime Minister, following discussions with George Bush, then suddenly found new enthusiasm for the involvement of the United Nations in negotiations on the future of action against Iraq. One day the UN process is being accepted; the next the UN process is being cast aside and troops are on their way to the Gulf. So much for consistency and accountability from Prime Minister John Howard.
I simply say that we do not need a prime minister who plays on the fears of ordinary Australians, as he did at the last election over the Tampa issue. As I said at the outset, the Prime Minister is driven not by what is in Australia's best interests but by what he considers to be in the best interests of the Liberal Party. He stands condemned. He was elected to represent Australia's national interests, not the Liberal Party's national interests.
We have the government's antiterrorism campaign flooding our televisions, airwaves and mailboxes, yet the Prime Minister, through his warmongering, is only adding to people's fears. I suggest this afternoon that the Prime Minister must make it clear to George Bush next week in Washington that no Australian troops will be involved in the war in Iraq without the backing of the United Nations. That is what the people of Australia want the Prime Minister to tell George Bush. That is what the Prime Minister should have told George Bush from the start. Only time will tell whether the Prime Minister has the guts to stand up for Australia and for our national interests and to stand up to the President of the United States.
The Australian people overwhelmingly support the United Nations processes—and correctly so, because we have a proud history of internationalism. Australians are not anti-UN. I am pleased to say that I have actually served in the United Nations processes through the governing body of the ILO, something I am exceptionally proud of as an Australian. The truth of the matter is that we are not anti-UN but, more than ever, Australians are anti-US. We are sick of being led by the nose and told what to do because the Prime Minister of Australia is merely a lap dog to George Bush, the President of the United States.
In conclusion, Australians have had a gutful. They are sick and tired of the government's compliance to every demand that the United States makes. Certainly, for the right reasons, Australia should enjoy good relations with allied nations. There is no doubt about that. But I would also say that our first priority is our backyard. That is central to this debate. This should not be in defiance of the wishes of the people of Australia. I ask the Australian community to continue to campaign in the streets for what they believe is right on an ongoing basis and to make sure, in the debate about our involvement as a nation in Iraq, that, firstly, it is about what is in Australia's best interests and, secondly, we continue as a proud nation prepared to pull its weight internationally, to abide by and support the United Nations processes, and not be led by a warmongering Prime Minister who is content to sit at the feet of the warmongering President of the United States, one George Bush.

"Cadman, Alan, MP",LP,2003-02-06,"—The message came through loud and clear from the previous speaker that the Australian Labor Party is certainly anti-US. They are pro-Iraq and pro-UN. The United Nations is the basis for any decision—
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I find that remark completely offensive. There is no basis for an allegation that the Australian Labor Party is pro-Iraq. I ask that the remark be withdrawn.
 (Mr Mossfield)—The member has taken objection to that remark. Would the member for Mitchell clarify his statement.
—No, I am not prepared to modify that. There is no doubt that the Australian Labor Party is pro-UN. Let us just have a look at who is on the Security Council. Let us have a look at who they are supporting—
—Mr Deputy Speaker, on the point of order, my colleague rose and asked that that statement be recalled. We asked you to do that, you asked the member and the member refused. We ask that the member withdraw that comment.
—I think the members of the opposition have taken exception to the wording that the ALP is pro-Iraq. I think that is the term the members are asking be withdrawn. I request the member to withdraw that statement.
—I have no intention of withdrawing that statement. There is no statement that I can find where the Leader of the Opposition says he is against Saddam Hussein. I have not found you to say that you are going to pursue any course of action to bring down that government.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, on the point of order, I follow up on my request that the member withdraw that remark. He provided evidence for his assertion that the Australian Labor Party is pro-Iraq by saying that there is no statement by opposition leader Simon Crean that in any way criticises Iraq, which is absolutely ridiculous. If we are going to have a civilised debate in this parliament, we should refrain from excesses such as the absolutely ill-founded allegation that the Australian Labor Party supports the regime of Saddam Hussein in Iraq. We do not.
—I will rule on the point of order. The custom and practice in this place, as I understand it, is that, if one side takes exception to the wording used by members on the other side, they are requested to withdraw that statement. That is what I have asked the member for Mitchell to do.
—I would like to make a comment on the ruling, Mr Deputy Speaker. It is my understanding that, if a member says that the comment applies to them in particular and if their name or electorate is identified with the assertion, then that member has a right to ask for that matter to be withdrawn. But, as to descriptions of a general nature, we have had the Prime Minister described as a warmonger here this morning. This is a broad debate. We had the description of the government as `warmongering' and nobody objected. This is a wide-ranging debate. My description of the opposition as pro-Iraq is based on the evidence that I see. I do not see any more difficulty with that than with having the Prime Minister described as a warmonger—which he is not.
—Order! I have made my position very clear to the member for Mitchell. I have requested that he withdraw that statement.
—You are defying Mr Deputy Speaker.
—Who's this person?
—Order! Member for Mitchell, would you like to indicate whether you are prepared to accept the request that the chair has put to you?
—In deference to you, yes.
—Thank you, Member for Mitchell. I ask you to continue your submissions.
—The opposition certainly is pro-UN. Let us have a look at the Security Council. These are the people they want to control the decisions of the Australian government. I would like the members of the opposition to understand what they are saying to the Australian people: `We are anti-Bush, but we are pro-UN.' The people that you want to make a decision about the freedoms of the world are from countries like Guinea, Mexico, Pakistan, Syrian Arab Republic, Angola, Bulgaria, Cameroon and Chile. Those are the countries to whom you are going to hand this decision of whether we are going to take any action against a tyrant like Saddam Hussein. You want to hand that responsibility to the Security Council comprised of a majority of those sorts of people. 
The proposition that I understand we are debating today is that under no circumstances should the Australian government take a single action that is counter to the mandate of the Security Council. The Security Council in fact becomes the de facto government of Australia. One only has to refer to the speeches of the Leader of the Opposition. We have heard our national interest referred to time and time again. What is our national interest? Does it lie with having our future controlled by the Security Council of the UN and countries such as Guinea, Mexico, Pakistan, Syrian Arab Republic, Angola, Bulgaria, Cameroon and Chile? Surely the Australian people would not want that. Surely the Australian people would rather have our interests attended to in discussion and cooperation with our allies.
Our allies are, in fact, the United States of America and Great Britain. In all of its comments, the Australian Labor Party seems to neglect Tony Blair, the leader of the Labour Party in Britain, with whom they wanted to identify themselves so strongly over the last few years. They called themselves the new Labor Party for a while in Australia. They wanted to identify with Blair, but on this issue they are not prepared to give advice to Tony Blair and they are not prepared to be critical of him; rather, they direct their attack towards the President of the United States. To indicate how strongly the Australian Labor Party wants to identify with the United Nations, yesterday the Leader of the Opposition said:
Indeed, when we on this side of the House were arguing that you had to go through the United Nations, we had you and your ministers accusing us of being appeasers of Saddam Hussein. Do you remember that, Prime Minister? That was your attitude back from June to September ...
He went on to say:
The point that the foreign minister also makes is the sequence of timing. My charge, Prime Minister, is this: you have made the commitment to the US to back them in relation to a war in Iraq that does not have UN backing ...
Time and again through his speech—in every paragraph—there is a reference to the fact that we should subjugate any independence in the Australian government to the Security Council of the United Nations. I have gone through the list of states that are involved in making those decisions. I note with interest the changing attitude of France. France has some significant interests—talk about oil for food! Under those sanctions, the French government has certainly benefited from the process. The major commercial interests of France in Iraq consist of oil, telecommunications, cars and defence equipment. Those are the interests of the French government, and they are a member of the Security Council. What sort of person are they backing? The fact of the matter is that we need to look at the regime of Saddam Hussein.
To minimise overcrowding prisons, the Iraqi government has conducted prison cleansing campaigns that consist of executing large numbers of prisoners. That is the sort of regime that the Australian Labor Party want to equivocate. More than 3,000 prisoners have been executed since 1997 in such exercises. These are well-known facts. Amnesty International and organisations like it have presented these facts time and time again, yet it appears to me that the Australian Labor Party want to stand back from that process. It is widely known that Saddam Hussein has been involved in cooperation with al-Qaeda in the persecution of the Kurds—they are acting for him; they are agents for him, and that is known. That was established today. You should read Colin Powell's stuff and establish for yourselves whether you are prepared to accept that. I think you would rather accept the words of Angola, Bulgaria, Cameroon or Chile than those of the United Nations. You would prefer to accept that point of view rather than the point of view of an ally. That is the problem with the Australian Labor Party. They are so benevolent to everybody, including this tyrant. Go through the material of this tyrant and see what he has done to his own people. 
It would be the ultimate nightmare if the weapons that have not been destroyed were used. There is one man who can stop this war: Saddam Hussein can say, `Here are the weapons. Here's the stockpile. This is what we have done.' There are 6,500 chemical bombs, including 550 shells filled with mustard gas; 350 tonnes of bulk chemical warfare agent, including 1.5 tonnes of the deadly nerve gas VX; 3,000 tonnes of precursor chemicals, 300 tonnes of which could be used for the production of VX; and over 30,000 special munitions for the delivery of chemical and biological agents, all unaccounted for. None of these have been accounted for, yet the Australian Labor Party says, `We can just let them sit there. If they get into the hands of some terrorist group, that doesn't matter too much.'
Iraq has not complied with 24 out of the 27 provisions contained in successive Security Council resolutions. Over the last 12 years the Security Council has passed no fewer than nine resolutions condemning Iraq. Iraq has not cooperated with the weapons inspectors. We hear the weapons inspectors, some of whom are Australians, saying the US is right in their assessment that weapons are being held. It appears to me that the Labor Party offers no reason why we should go to war except to say, `The United Nations need to control that.' On those grounds I am prepared to work with our friends and not have this nation run by the United Nations.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,3,1
"Sidebottom, Sid, MP",ALP,2003-02-06,"—I wish to join the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and all members of this parliament in condemning the excesses of Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq. Clearly, Saddam Hussein is a noted dictator with little regard for the wellbeing and welfare of his people. His crimes against his own people and against humanity are well known and abhorred throughout the world. Of course, and unfortunately, he is not alone in this amongst similar leaders throughout the world. The excesses of Saddam Hussein's regime are repeated in other countries throughout the world, but this in no way lessens them nor justifies them.
The dark world of terrorism faces Australia, as it does many other countries throughout the world, whether it is in beautiful Bali, the USA, Russia, Palestine and Israel, Northern Ireland, England, Spain, Sri Lanka, East Timor or in many other places. Since 11 September 2001, the USA has made it a national campaign to wage war on terrorism. It has sought to do this by forming a coalition of world forces to track down terrorist organisations and neutralise and/or remove those states, individuals, organisations and resources that give succour to or harbour terrorists.
Australians, and in particular people in my electorate of Braddon, have little time or regard for Saddam Hussein. Indeed, like me, they abhor his regime and would like to see his dictatorship removed. Likewise, they support the war against terrorism. However, many people who have contacted me, and who universally abhor Saddam Hussein's regime, do not believe this is sufficient reason to wage war on Iraq. Nor, to date, can such actions be legitimised as being a necessary part of the war against terrorism.
The Australian people hate war. However, they are not convinced that war against Iraq is warranted on the grounds that have—or, more accurately, have not—been advanced to date. The dilemma is that the reasons offered by the coalition against terrorism to take military action in, for example, Afghanistan do not exist to justify similar military action against Iraq. This lack of conviction is demonstrated in the numerous polls taken on this important issue. No matter how hard a number of media commentators and some members on the other side have sought to dismiss the results by trying to demean them as `populist', this conviction is rooted in a deep suspicion of political history and decision making in relation to war—particularly in light of Australia's and the USA's involvement in Vietnam. The Australian people must be convinced of the morality and the legitimacy of such action. 
That is why there is so much support for the United Nations involvement in the decision to deal with Iraq. Some commentators are quick to point out that the average citizen does not appreciate the political machinations that attend decision making in the Security Council and the UN General Assembly, thereby diminishing the validity of this so-called populist view. Be this as it may, the point does not diminish the popular conviction and desire for a collective legitimacy for actions based on international law, not on the whim of one or two countries or as a desire to act in a unilateral manner. The UN may not be the perfect body to deal with international affairs, but it is the best we have. People are not silly. They appreciate the deficiencies of such a multinational global organisation, but they prefer this to international anarchy and/or unilateralism based on might determining what is right. The polls clearly demonstrate Australians do not want Australian men and women committed to military action in Iraq on a unilateralist platform led by the USA. Only UN sanctioning of military action, should it be unfortunately necessary, will satisfy a reluctant majority of Australians, whilst a significant number, on the other hand, oppose any war on Iraq.
Two significant things, I believe, drive this concern. The first is a healthy scepticism to date that the evidence presented, both by UN weapons inspectors and by members of what President Bush has called the `coalition of the willing', has failed to prove two things. Firstly, that Saddam Hussein has expanded his stockpile of weapons of mass destruction and/or is still stockpiling such weapons. Secondly, that he has links with al-Qaeda and its terrorist action of 11 September. The second significant point is a belief that military involvement in Iraq by Australian personnel should occur only if there is a clear and present danger to Australia and our national interests. However, currently there is a common feeling that, given the insufficient evidence and the current reservations I have outlined above, fighting a war in Iraq does not serve our national interests. Indeed, there is a fear and belief that our national interests will be seriously harmed if military action is taken against Iraq without the sanction of the UN, and without clear evidence that Iraq is a realistic danger to the world and a source of armaments for terrorists to use against others.
Some on the other side and amongst our print media argue that anyone who opposes the military solution on Iraq, even if reluctantly, is going to contribute to the demise of the United Nations. Like many of the arguments being thrown up to justify the disarming and removal of Saddam Hussein now—rather than two, four or 10 years ago—on the grounds that his weapons, whatever and wherever they may be, may be used to threaten others directly or through providing these to terrorist groups, the so-called `demise of the UN' argument suffers with the same exaggerated threat. Retired diplomat Richard Woolcott, Australia's UN Ambassador from 1982 to 1988 and our representative on the Security Council from 1985 to 1986, says it is an overstatement to suggest that, if the Security Council does not come in behind the Anglo-American pressure, it will become irrelevant. He says:
For 40 years, the Security Council was paralysed by the Cold War and by repeated Soviet and American vetoes. But it has survived and, whatever position it takes this month, it will survive the present crisis.
He goes on to say:
Why should the UN's credibility be determined solely by Iraq's failure to comply with Security Council resolutions when many countries, including Greece, Cyprus, Indonesia and in particular Israel, have ignored Security Council resolutions for years? The US itself has vetoed no less than 22 draft Security Council resolutions on the Middle East, which all other members of the Council supported. 
I believe the majority of Australian people question the motives of those who are advocating war and regime change, particularly given what many regard as a lack of real evidence to warrant war rather than the continuation of the weapons inspection process. President Bush said in his State of the Union address that war with Iraq was being forced on the US. I believe the majority of Australians do not believe this argument, and I do not believe Secretary of State Colin Powell's so-called damning evidence speech, delivered last night, has changed their opinion. Richard Woolcott probably best sums up what I believe the majority of Australians think:
The truth is that an unnecessary war is being forced on Iraq.
The deep concern of many is not how much time the weapons inspectors should be given or the degree or otherwise of Saddam Hussein's compliance; it is whether a devastating war based on an exaggerated threat which Prime Minister Howard has echoed should be launched as a result of unconscionable pressure exerted by the US and Britain in pursuit of a predetermined objective of regime change in Iraq. This scepticism is based on a track record of intent reflected in the actions and comments of people like our own foreign minister. From the outset of the publicly stated intention of the US to change the regime in Iraq and remove Saddam Hussein by any means, most notably unilateral action, Minister Downer labelled anyone who disagreed with such actions an appeaser.
Until Australian public opinion quite clearly indicated that it did not support action outside the proper processes of the UN, the Howard government was quite strident in its support of unilateral action against Iraq, even though this is contrary to article 1 of the ANZUS treaty, which, ironically, the Howard government cites as one of the primary sources of its support of the actions of the United States. Not only did the weight of public opinion of the Australian people force the Howard government to revert to supporting the UN process, as correctly proposed by Labor as far back as April 2002, but public opinion did the same thing in the USA and Great Britain. The Howard government now parades itself as a strong supporter of the UN processes but this was not the case initially and public opinion is sceptical of its change in tack, particularly in the light of the PM's recent deployment of additional Australian military personnel and resources to the Gulf.
Members on the other side make a quirky assessment of the published opinion polls gracing our dailies. Essentially, it goes something like this: the government has finally stated that it supports the proper processes of the UN being carried out in relation to disarming Iraq; public opinion supports a war with Iraq if sanctioned by the UN Security Council; therefore, public opinion now supports the Howard doctrine on Iraq. Indeed, the Australian newspaper carried the deceptive heading `Battlers turning to PM's war'.
I believe this assessment is quite strange and misleading. It misses the fundamental rationale about the majority of Australians' views on this matter. Their support for a war against Iraq under the sanction of the UN Security Council is based on the belief and hope that due process and not undue haste will mark the UN's deliberations on this matter. No wonder the US, the UK and even Australia are so adamant to pressure other members of the Security Council to halt rather than hasten the weapons inspection process in Iraq. I believe the so-called battlers referred to in the Australian newspaper only support the war option using the sanction of the UN and its processes if it exhausts all peaceful means to disarm Iraq. This is their expectation. They do not support the Bush-Blair-Howard policy of undue haste in this matter, and they trust that the UN will moderate this. Clearly, the Bush-Blair-Howard view of how the UN processes should play out is not what popular public opinion demands, and this explains why so much pressure is now being applied to the UN Security Council by this so-called coalition of the willing.
Many Australians question the extent and almost eager participation of our government in the drive to disarm Saddam Hussein. This is not to be confused with being anti-American, which is what many on the other side charge critics of the government line with. This criticism and scepticism is based on a history that saw Australia dragged into the Vietnam War for very spurious reasons. It is also based on a belief that Australian national interests are not being best served by precipitous rhetoric and action in the Middle East on the part of the Australian government. Taking the nation into its confidence on this matter has not been a hallmark of this government, and its changing of tack reflects this. 
Why has our PM been so eager to take up the cudgels with the US and Great Britain? How are Australia's national interests served by these actions? Many Australians question the government's motives, explanations and actions to date on this very serious issue. They also question the exclusivity of the choice to deal with Iraq in the absence of a war against terror and the capture of Osama bin Laden. This is the basis of public disquiet with the actions of this government, President Bush and Tony Blair. Does anyone seriously believe that the might of the United States of America cannot and does not contain Iraq effectively? Why would the USA arm and support Saddam Hussein in the 1980s if they did not believe they could not deter him from deploying those weapons against US interests, both then and later? That occurred in the Gulf War. That is why Hussein did not use weapons of mass destruction; the United States can contain him and can do it now. National propaganda aside, public opinion almost unconsciously perceives the reality of power. The reality in this situation does not lie in supporting and fighting what the evidence to date suggests would be an unnecessary war.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,3,1
"Billson, Bruce, MP",LP,2003-02-06,"—Let me say at the outset that, in relation to Iraq and weapons of mass destruction, I am very much pro disarmament and consider this matter with this objective at the forefront of my mind. It is important to recognise that the Australian government has not made any decision to commit Defence personnel to military operations in Iraq. I accept the government's belief that the forward deployment adds to diplomatic pressure on Saddam Hussein. In mid-January the UN Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, recognised that it was only the threat of military action that pressured Saddam Hussein into allowing weapons inspectors to return to Iraq. This, to me, is an endorsement of the shared purpose and approach of the leaderships and governments of the United States of America, the United Kingdom and Australia. Only by maintaining this pressure and leaving no doubt about the consequences of noncompliance will there be any chance of a diplomatic solution.
My conviction is that we must work to ensure that Iraq is disarmed of its weapons of mass destruction, and I welcome our government's strong commitment to international efforts to achieve this disarmament goal. Saddam's pursuit of weapons of mass destruction represents a particular and very real threat as he has used weapons of mass destruction before, both against his neighbours and his own people. He has proven form in actively hiding these weapons, and a number of serious, unresolved questions remain about Iraq's chemical and biological weapons activities and missile delivery systems.
In his briefing to the Security Council, the Chairman of the UN Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission, Hans Blix, said:
Iraq does not appear to have come to genuine acceptance, not even today, of the need to disarm.
Whilst Saddam's pursuit of weapons of mass destruction presents an immediate and present threat to the Middle East, that region is of particular significance to our region and beyond. This is reflected in the regional concern within the Asia-Pacific to avoid the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the regional goal of ensuring that international obligations are fully implemented. Allowing the continued development of weapons of mass destruction capabilities in Iraq, or signalling to other countries that obfuscation and avoidance of international disarmament obligations will be tolerated by letting Iraq off the hook, opens up the potential for and increases the possibility of weapons of mass destruction falling into the hands of terrorist groups. We must therefore work decisively to guard against this risk and to abate the known threats of weapons of mass destruction capabilities in breach of international obligations. 
Iraq's declaration to the UN in December continues more than a decade of failure to comply with internationally agreed obligations. The declaration failed to resolve questions outstanding from the time UNSCOM weapons inspectors were forced out at the end of 1998, including Iraq's failure to account for 6½ thousand weapons of mass destruction capable warheads; 360 tonnes of bulk chemical warfare agent; 1.5 tonnes of VX nerve agent; up to 3,000 tonnes of precursor chemicals, including approximately 300 tonnes for VX production; growth media for biological agents able to produce three times the 8½ thousand litres of anthrax spores Iraq admits to having manufactured; 30,000 special munitions able to deliver chemical and biological agents; and the claimed destruction of Scud missiles filled with chemical and biological agents.
UN Security Council Resolution 1441 sets out a process by which disarming Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction can be achieved. Just as the Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs lobbied Security Council members in support of UNSCR 1441, Australia continues to actively support pursuing the issue through the UN. The UN auspice for any possible military action is desirable and offers a key advantage that gets little mention in the public debate. Succession planning for a disarmed Iraq, achieved either peacably or by way of force, needs to hold out the prospect of a peaceful, prosperous and pluralist nation where the universal values of hope for a brighter future, tolerance and personal security flourish. The UN can and should play a central role in supporting the development of the civil, political and social infrastructure in a disarmed Iraq that is committed to these universal values and not to the development of weapons of mass destruction and totalitarian dominance of its citizens.
The prudent contingency planning against the possibility that military action might ultimately become necessary has seen some ADF personnel and assets forward deployed to the Middle East in a manner designed to support the UN disarmament process. Every opportunity needs to be given to allow the UN process to work. This includes stepping up the pressure on Saddam to cooperate with the noncombatant disarmament solution envisaged in the terms of the UN resolution. Measured advocacy is needed to ensure that the required pressure that should undoubtedly be exerted on Saddam and his regime to end the avoidance of UN resolutions and peacably disarm does not of itself make armed conflict unavoidable. The disarmament imperative needs to be pursued with caution and care, but our conviction to pursue the disarmament path cannot waiver.
The electors and broader community of Dunkley can be assured of my ongoing advocacy for an informed and sober debate about how to most safely rid the world of the threat to peace, prosperity and stability posed by Saddam and weapons of mass destruction, how best to ensure that the United Nations Security Council functions as a credible and reliable force for peace and the successful implementation of agreed international disarmament obligations.
Before concluding my remarks, I will read into the Hansard a section of a recent feature broadcast on the ABC that was drawn to my attention by Dunkley resident Ms Byrne. It encapsulated her thinking and was put to me as compulsory reading for all elected representatives. It was one of the recent weekly editions of the world's longest running speech radio program, Alistair Cooke's Letter from America, which was first broadcast in 1946 on the BBC and today is also retransmitted on the ABC. In his letter titled `Peace for our time', Alistair hears the voices of the 1930s echoing through 2003. He said:
I promised to lay off topic A—Iraq—until the Security Council makes a judgement on the inspectors' report and I shall keep that promise.
But I must tell you that throughout the past fortnight I've listened to everybody involved in or looking on to a monotonous din of words, like a tide crashing and receding on a beach—making a great noise and saying the same thing over and over. 
This ordeal triggered a nightmare—a day-mare, if you like.
Through the ceaseless tide, I heard a voice, a very English voice of an old man—Prime Minister Chamberlain saying: `I believe it is peace for our time'—a sentence that prompted a huge cheer, first from a listening street crowd and then from the House of Commons and the next day from every newspaper in the land.
There was a move to urge that Mr Chamberlain should receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
In Parliament there was one unfamiliar old grumbler to growl out: `I believe we have suffered a total and unmitigated defeat.'
He was, in view of the general sentiment, very properly booed down.
This scene concluded in the autumn of 1938 [with] the British prime minister's effectual signing away of most of Czechoslovakia to Hitler.
The rest of it, within months, Hitler walked in and conquered.
`Oh, dear,' said Mr Chamberlain, thunderstruck. `He has betrayed my trust.'
During the last fortnight a simple but startling thought occurred to me—every single official, diplomat, president and prime minister involved in the Iraq debate was in 1938 a toddler, most of them unborn. So the dreadful scene I've just drawn will not have been remembered by most listeners.
Hitler had started betraying our trust not 12 years but only two years before, when he broke the First World War peace treaty by occupying the demilitarised zone of the Rhineland.
Only half his troops carried one reload of ammunition because Hitler knew that French morale was too low to confront any war just then and 10 million of 11 million British voters had signed a so-called peace ballot.
It stated no conditions, elaborated no terms, it simply counted the numbers of Britons who were `for peace'.
The slogan of this movement was `Against war and fascism'—chanted at the time by every Labour man and Liberal and many moderate Conservatives—a slogan that now sounds as imbecilic as `against hospitals and disease'.
In blunter words, a majority of Britons would do anything, absolutely anything, to get rid of Hitler except fight him.
At that time, the word pre-emptive had not been invented, though today it's a catchword.
After all, the Rhineland was what it said it was—part of Germany. So to march in and throw Hitler out would have been pre-emptive—wouldn't it?
Nobody did anything and Hitler looked forward with confidence to gobbling up the rest of Western Europe, country by country—`course by course', as growler Churchill put it.
I bring up Munich and the mid-30s because I was fully grown, on the verge of 30, and knew we were indeed living in the age of anxiety.
So many of the arguments mounted against each other today, in the last fortnight, are exactly what we heard in the House of Commons debates and read in the French press.
The French especially urged, after every Hitler invasion, `negotiation, negotiation'.
They negotiated so successfully as to have their whole country defeated and occupied. 
But as one famous French leftist said: `We did anyway manage to make them declare Paris an open city—no bombs on us!'
In Britain, the general response to every Hitler advance was disarmament and collective security.
Collective security meant to leave every crisis to the League of Nations. It would put down aggressors, even though, like the United Nations, it had no army, navy or air force.
The League of Nations had its chance to prove itself when Mussolini invaded and conquered Ethiopia (Abyssinia).
The League did not have any shot to fire, but still the cry was chanted in the House of Commons—The League and collective security is the only true guarantee of peace.
But after the Rhineland the maverick Churchill decided there was no collectivity in collective security and started a highly unpopular campaign for rearmament by Britain, warning against the general belief that Hitler had already built an enormous mechanised army and a superior air force.
But he's not used them, he's not used them—people protested.
Still for two years before the outbreak of the Second War you could read the debates in the House of Commons and now shiver at the famous Labour men—Major Attlee was one of them—who voted against rearmament and still went on pointing to the League of Nations as the saviour. 
Now, this memory of mine may be totally irrelevant to the present crisis. It haunts me.
I have to say I have written elsewhere with much conviction that most historical analogies are false because, however strikingly similar a new situation may be to an old one, there is usually one element that is different and it turns out to be the crucial one.
It may well be so here. All I know is that all the voices of the 30s are echoing through 2003.
I do not attempt to comprehensively summarise all of the arguments for and against the pathway the government is pursuing. I can add nothing new in terms of evidence that security services and weapons inspectors can provide to guide our choices or challenge the arguments of international lawyers and diplomatic historians about the pathways available. The atrocities committed by Saddam and his regime against innocent Iraqi civilians are well documented and should provide the greatest repulsion to latter-day human shield activists. But if you agree with the basic proposition that Iraq and its weapons of mass destruction represent a very real and genuine threat then the apparent complete absence of alternatives to the action currently being pursued by the government has to be highlighted. If you cut away the process arguments, there seems to be little difference in the views expressed in this place other than in relation to who decides to initiate Australia's involvement.
Do we abdicate this decision to the United Nations as Labor would have us believe it supports doing, or do we seek the guidance and concurrence of the international community as articulated, albeit imperfectly, by the UN before deciding for ourselves what is in our national interest and what warrants putting Australian service men and women in harm's way? No national leader can delegate the fate of its citizens and national interest to those without responsibility for the consequences. I hope this information is helpful to Dunkley electors and conveys some of my thinking on this difficult and complex subject.
—Order! It being 2.00 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 101A. The debate may be resumed at a later hour and the member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,3,1
"Edwards, Graham, MP",ALP,2003-02-06,"—One of the reasons for this MPI today is simply that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the minister representing the Minister for Defence in this place, has chosen to absent herself from the debate on Iraq and the deployment of troops under her care. She is not on the speakers list and, given her responsibilities, I think that is an absolute disgrace. By doing that, she has done our members of the Australian Defence Force and their families a disservice. Not only does she show them a lack of courtesy but also she allows to pass an opportunity to update the House on the status of a number of reports which go to the welfare of the Australian Defence Force personnel and their family members. They have been waiting for these reports for some time—in some circumstances, six years. I am looking around the chamber and I cannot see the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. I hope that she is not going to squib this debate. 
One of the things that I want to put to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs is: where is the military compensation and rehabilitation scheme rewrite? With all of the responsibilities that the Prime Minister has, I can understand that he does not know that. But the Minister for Veterans' Affairs is directly responsible for this rewrite, and she should be here to explain to the House, to members of the ADF and to their families where this report is and why we have been waiting over six years for it. 
We are also waiting on the release of the health study into Gulf War illness—once again, a report for which this minister has direct responsibility. That is a study that I embarrassed this government into conducting back in 1999. As I understand it, the results of that report have been made available to the minister—I am pleased that the minister is back in the chamber—but it is interesting to note that she has not released it. Where is it? She may have some good reason for not having released it, but I hope she can tell the House what that reason is. I hope this report has at least been made available to the Australian Defence Force, particularly in view of the fact that we have now redeployed troops who will serve and, indeed, are serving in that very same region. Where is that report, Minister? And what health issues will confront members of the ADF who are serving and who will serve in that area? That is an important question. 
The other thing that we in the opposition, members of the ADF and their families want to know is the conditions of service of the troops who have been deployed. Why haven't they and their families been told their conditions of service? I understand that those deployed on the Multinational Interception Force are covered by what is classified as `warlike service' but those deployed under Operation Bastille are not—or at least some are not. So those members of the SAS, for instance, who are already on the ground and who are conducting warlike training are not classified as being involved in a warlike service, but those on ships in the Gulf are. By classifying their service as `warlike', would the PM be admitting to the people of Australia that these troops have already been committed to war—something that the PM denies.  
So what we have is mate against mate, digger against digger; some are classified and some are not. Some are entitled to be covered under the Veterans' Entitlements Act and some are not. That is why that classification is crucial to these members of the ADF. If they do not get that classification, they do not have coverage under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. Then we come to the FA18 pilots and their support crews. What are their conditions of service? Are those on HMAS Kanimbla under the same conditions of service as those serving on the Darwin and the Anzac? No wonder members of the ADF and their families are up in arms. We want to know the truth. It is a disgrace, and all of this is happening during a debate in which the minister cannot be bothered involving herself. 
The Prime Minister has said that the Kanimbla is going to the Gulf as part of the MIF. That puts those personnel on warlike service if they are going to enjoy the same conditions of service as other people who are up there on Operation Slipper. So we have some members of Operation Bastille on warlike service and others not. I say to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs that, when she responds to this MPI, I hope she will clarify these situations for the people of Australia, the members of the ADF and their families. Yesterday in the Senate a question on whether that service was routine or warlike was put to the Minister for Defence, Senator Hill. He said: 
... there is not a declaration of warlike service. I want to check with the Minister for Veterans' Affairs but I would therefore presume that the general provisions apply.
If the general provisions apply, these troops who have been deployed under Operation Bastille will not have the coverage of the Veterans' Entitlements Act. As I said, you will have some troops up there covered by the Veterans' Entitlements Act and some not. The minister needs to clarify that situation. If I am wrong, I want the minister to tell me, and I want her to tell the people of Australia, members of the ADF and their families what the true and real situation is.
We still want to know why we are waiting for the release of the Clarke report. That review has been conducted. It has been completed. We know that the minister has had the review for at least a month. But she has not yet released it. I want to say to the minister, `Where is the report and why are you sitting on it?'
I now want to turn to the issue of Mrs Kylie Russell. Kylie Russell is one of my constituents, who lost her husband in Afghanistan almost 12 months ago. She is a very brave young lady, caring for her daughter, a daughter who was born about two weeks before Mr Russell was killed. Earlier this week, Kylie Russell called a media conference in Perth. It was a very brave thing to do. Not only did she not want to face the media; she did not want to have her personal circumstances thrown into the community. But she did it, and I am going to explain why, although she explains why herself. It was a very brave thing for her to do and I want to compliment her on her acceptance of the principle of mateship. I want to quote from some of what Mrs Russell had to say:
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Australian people who sent cards, condolences and well wishes on hearing the news of the death of my husband Drew in Afghanistan.
The overwhelming grief and loss that I felt and still feel today can never be taken from me but to know that so many people cared and still do does help.
If it were not for my amazing family, friends and the members of the SAS and Association I do not know how I would have survived these past months.
My husband, Sergeant Andrew Russell, was killed when the vehicle he was a passenger in drove over a landmine in Afghanistan on February 16, 2002.
His injuries were severe and he died on transit to hospital. The actions of those soldiers with him, who tried everything to save him, can never be overlooked and my admiration and thanks to them can never be expressed enough. 
What I do here today is for these soldiers, their families and for all members of our Defence Force.
Almost a year after my husband's death, I sit here before you still waiting for the Commonwealth Government to introduce legislation into parliament reviewing the compensation and welfare available to families on the death or injury of their loved one.
Two Federal Ministers assured me that this legislation would be discussed in parliament last year, it is sad for me to sit here before you to announce that this has not happened and no dates have been given as to when this is likely to occur.
It seems to me that the Commonwealth has given this a low priority, which is extremely upsetting considering the number of Defence Force personnel currently deployed overseas and those making preparations to do so.
They are just some of the things that Kylie Russell had to say. They are a part of the very compelling and moving statement that she made.
Once again, in the Senate, the Minister for Defence, Senator Hill, was asked where this compensation scheme is. He said, in part:
We do expect, however, that that exposure draft will be available in the not too distant future, so the process will continue.
On the one hand, we have a government that is prepared to fast-track the deployment of troops to a war zone; on the other hand, we have a government that can sit for six years on a report and on a rewrite of the compensation act, an act that goes to the direct wellbeing of troops and their families.
We in the opposition gave the government the commitment of a bipartisan approach to that rewrite. I have offered it again, as I have responsibility for that, and I again offer a bipartisan approach to the minister now so that we can fast-track this piece of legislation. Of course, our final position will depend on the content of that legislation and on whether it is a fair and reasonable piece of legislation.
In response to the statement that Kylie Russell put out, the Coalition of Australian Veterans also put forward a release. It is headed `Government not dinkum on fair compensation for Australia's serving men and women'. I will quickly quote some of what is in this release:
The Federal Government is failing Australia's Defence personnel through its lack of resolve to produce a fairer and more equitable Compensation Scheme which will cover all serving members in the event of death or serious injury.
This is despite a government promise for a new scheme in 1996 following the Blackhawk disaster.
Delay after delay and procrastination by a series of Defence Ministers since Bronwyn Bishop has resulted in this legislation being downgraded in importance at the same time that deployment of troops in places like East Timor and Afghanistan has escalated.
The most recent deployment of troops to the Gulf is taking place and we are yet to see either the report of the review into the Military Compensation and Rehabilitation Scheme or the necessary legislation which was again promised to be in the Parliament by September of last year.
Once again the troops are sailing but their expectations of a fair and reasonable compensation system have sunk.
Kylie Russell, Australia's most recent war widow, is a prime example of our inadequate system. On her husband's death in Afghanistan last year, she was presented with a meagre compensation package of a one only payment of $92000 made up of $37000 that can be accessed now and $55000 in trust for little Leisa with a War Widows Pension of $13520 per year. Kylie and Leisa have enjoyed a rise in pension this year to $13624.
I know that the minister's office likes to fudge those figures, but that is the truth about the package that Australia's most recent war widow receives.
In conclusion, I want to say this to the minister: she needs to come to this dispatch box and explain those things which I have put before her on behalf of the people of Australia, the members of our Australian Defence Force and their families. She may have been saved by the Prime Minister today, but next week the Prime Minister is away and she is it. We are not going to let her off the hook.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Australian Defence Force: Personnel</title>,Matters of Public Importance,9,1
"Vale, Danna, MP",LP,2003-02-06,"—The member for Cowan raises a matter that is very serious for us here in Australia at any time, and that is the care of our veterans and our Defence families. I would like to actually address some of the issues that the member for Cowan has raised in order. 
First of all, he raised the release of the Gulf War Veterans Health Study, and I think I should deal with that first. The Gulf War Veterans Health Study set out to investigate the physical and psychological health of those Australians who served in the Gulf War in 1991. It looked at psychological conditions and physical conditions, including respiratory health, reproductive health, chronic fatigue syndrome, neurological health, cancer incidences and indeed the causes of death. Veterans taking part in the study were examined and their health was compared to a similar group of ADF members who did not serve in the Gulf, as well as to the health of the general population. The member for Cowan should be aware that there is some good news in this Gulf War study. There is no indication in any findings of the study to suggest that Gulf War veterans are at an increased risk of any unique disorder, and this is consistent with the findings by other countries such as the United States and Great Britain.
The study was done for us by Monash University and the study found that the number of deaths and cancers among Gulf War veterans was small. Indeed, the death rate and cancer rate for both Gulf War veterans and the comparison ADF group were lower than expected in the general population. However, the study found that the Gulf War veterans are at a greater risk of developing psychological disorders, and this includes anxiety disorders and post traumatic stress disorder, and they are more at risk of substance abuse.
It is important to note that there are programs already in place to assist veterans in this situation but the government will be looking at additional support if assistance is needed to be provided in those areas. I intend to release this report once it has been finalised by the expert committee, and I anticipate that that will be soon; a matter of weeks rather than months.
Another issue that the member for Cowan raised was the issue of conditions of service of Operation Bastille. That was actually reiterated by the Prime Minister in question time and for the sake of the record I will repeat it. Those members of the ADF who are being predeployed to the Gulf region in Operation Bastille will receive upon entering the relevant area conditions of service equivalent to those currently applying to ADF personnel in the region who are involved in the war against terrorism and the Multinational Interception Force. In the event that the government took a decision to participate in military action against Iraq, new and more generous conditions of service would apply to those directly involved in combat operations.
Another issue raised by the member for Cowan was the date of release of the Clarke review. On 8 February last year I announced the make-up of the committee and the terms of reference for an independent review to consider the perceived anomalies in the eligibility criteria for veterans' entitlements. The review examined wide-ranging issues that were raised by the ex-service community and indeed received over 3,000 submissions from across the nation. The review committee also had open hearings in different state capitals. I intend to release the report by ministerial statement when I receive the report in publishable format next week. The member for Cowan will certainly be advised well and truly of the date of that release.
Another issue is the compensation for our war widows. Initially I must say very clearly that no amount of compensation can possibly make up for the absence of a loving husband and father. But the member for Cowan has raised the particular circumstances of Mrs Russell. I have had and I have valued the opportunity of meeting with Mrs Russell last year, and I do welcome this opportunity to clarify again to the House and to the veterans of Australia and their families some important aspects of the support that is available for our Defence families. 
Australia has one of the best repatriation systems in the world. As a matter of fact, up to recent times our repatriation system also has had the support of both sides of the House. There has been a lot of misinformation and confusion surrounding the entitlements of Defence members and their families for those who are injured in action and those who are killed in action. But I completely reject and I am disappointed by the member for Cowan's suggestion that war widows are condemned to poverty. We have one of the most generous repatriation systems in the world. But our repatriation system is about care for life. It is care and commitment to our Defence families for the whole of their lives. You cannot compare our repatriation system to a one-off claim to a local civil court where there are huge lump sum payments in the vicinity of millions of dollars.
As a matter of fact, when this issue was first raised with me last year there were many successive common law claims of enormous figures that were actually being reported in the newspapers. You cannot compare our repatriation system with one-off claims. I also would point out to our veteran community and to the member for Cowan that with a lot of those one-off claims from civil courts the person has to live the rest of their lives on that payment. From that amount, from the millions of dollars that are granted, would have to come lawyers' fees, doctors' fees, expert fees and hospital fees, and what is left for that person is the total amount they have for the rest of their lives.
Our repatriation system represents a commitment for the lifetime care for our defence families. The family of an ADF member killed in action is entitled to a choice between various legislation. This would comprise a lump sum under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act and the Defence Act which is currently in the vicinity of $229,000; a further lump sum of $57,256 for each dependent child; a weekly payment of $61 for each dependent child and funeral expenses or a lump sum of $38,450 for the spouse and $57,000 for each dependent child under the Defence Act; a non-means-tested tax-free lifelong war widows pension indexed twice a year, regardless of the war widow's marital or income status. It also includes a gold card, which provides free, comprehensive health care for the life of the widow and for the children until they reach their independence. There is also an orphans pension and education assistance for dependent children in full-time education. There are choices of packages for our defence families and we also pay for professional advice, so the widow can actually acquire an accountant of her choice to advise her on what the best package is for her particular circumstances.
Also, the widow of any ADF member killed in the line of duty has access to military compensation and superannuation. This includes a further lump sum, a tax-free death benefit, a superannuation entitlement and a further pension from the superannuation scheme. I know that there are some people who do not believe that a member's superannuation should be included in the amounts considered as a means of support to the family of the member, but those are the same people who are trying to perpetrate the myth that all our defence families have to live on is a war widow's pension—and that is clearly not true. They also overlook the fact that the Defence Force superannuation schemes are considerably more generous than the civilian schemes. For example, the Defence Force retirement death benefit provides a pension of 35 per cent of a member's retiring salary after 20 years full-time military service. This rises to a maximum of 76.5 per cent of salary after 40 years. On death, the spouse receives a pension of 48 per cent of the deceased member's annual salary, with additional amounts being paid for each dependent child. This is paid for life and is indexed twice a year—again, irrespective of any other income.
Whilst superannuation depends on each individual's circumstances, if these are all taken into account, a war widow can be entitled to an annual pretax income stream of around $45,000 for life. To put that into perspective, an investment of around $1.2 million would be required to generate that same income stream. This is a total lifetime package for our war families. Over 30 years, it amounts to over $1.1 million; if this amount is taken over 40 years, it is almost $1.5 million; and, if we extrapolate it over 60 years, it is more than $2.2 million. That is the cost to the government. The total value of these lifelong comprehensive benefits surpasses the one-off, large court claims, as I have already articulated before. In contrast, on top of that income stream of around $45,000, the war widows receive the gold card which provides them with free, comprehensive health care for the rest of their lives and for any of their dependent children. This clearly demonstrates the federal government's ongoing commitment to lifelong support to our defence families. We are in there for the long haul. This is a lifelong commitment for lifelong health care and lifelong financial support. 
I would like to turn my attention now to the new military compensation scheme, which is of great concern to the member for Cowan. I think it is worth while to look at some of the background. Following the Black Hawk tragedy in 1996, the Howard government moved to top up the lump sum death benefits under this scheme to $229,000—an increase of almost $40,000. It also topped up the additional lump sum benefits for death or severe injury to $57,256 for each dependent child and the maximum lump sum payments for the severely injured to $229,000—an increase of over $54,000. It also provided $1,145 for financial advice for dependants following the death or the severe injury of their partner, introduced bereavement payments of four fortnights' salary for the spouse of a deceased member and provided additional counselling services for the dependent children of deceased or severely injured members under the Veterans' Children's Education Scheme.
The government also commissioned at this time the Tanzer review into military compensation arrangements. The government have accepted the review's recommendation for the creation of a new, modern, stand-alone compensation scheme for our military. The government have conducted an extensive program of consultations with members of the defence community and veteran groups right across the nation in our pursuit of designing a modern compensation scheme with the key features that will protect our defence personnel. The government believe that the support of the defence and ex-service community is essential before we proceed with this new legislation. The member for Cowan has already said that, if they do not agree with the new legislation, they have no alternative but to oppose it. That is a very good reason for us to make sure that we do get it right in the first place. I do not see how it could be expected that we could introduce legislation that does not yet have the support of all the relevant stakeholders. The government are seeking to expedite this process. The legislation is with our drafters for preliminary drafting. We still have some vital elements of the compensation package to finally agree on with some of our veteran stakeholders and, in the interests of our serving members of the ADF, we believe we have to get it right.
It is very complex legislation. Once, during the consultation that I have had with our veterans affairs and defence advisers, when we actually agreed on a certain benefit for the defence member, that, in its turn, was going to cancel out something else; it is very complex legislation. We believe that we have come up with an excellent modern rehabilitation and compensation package that has the right balance between proper rehabilitation and proper compensation. Our Australian Defence Force is of major concern to this government, and we will certainly be pursuing the Military Compensation Scheme. As I said, we do believe that we have the balance just about right but there is some further consultation to be done on that scheme.
I also point out our support and compensation for those injured while in the service of this country. All members of our Australian Defence Force who are injured due to operational service are entitled to compensation coverage under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act and the Defence Act—which provides benefits additional to those under the SRC Act—and to veterans' entitlements. We are in the business of care for life. This is lifetime care. (Time expired)

"O'Byrne, Michelle, MP",ALP,2003-02-06,"—I am very pleased to have the opportunity to support my colleague the member for Cowan on this matter of public importance. He is an excellent advocate for defence personnel and their families, and we need that. We need that because this government has shown indifference to the futures of our current forces and contempt for our veterans. This is highlighted by the inability of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs to even answer a question in question time and by her complete lack of regard for speaking in the debate on Iraq.
I turn to some of the comments made by the minister in her speech on this matter today. The minister gave us a lovely summary of what the Gulf War veterans' health study is all about. We knew what it was about—we read the terms of the inquiry and we understand, as does the veteran community, what it is all for. Interestingly, she then gave us some findings of this review. We are interested to hear that there are some findings but, Minister, if you know what the answers are, just release the study so that people know exactly what circumstances they are dealing with. Stop sitting on stuff; get your job done.
We had a summary of the Clarke review. That was very interesting as well. Once again, the minister has given a commitment to release the report. Frankly, we are getting to the stage where we will believe it when we see it. The minister then went on to talk about the payment received by Kylie Russell. Minister, let me tell you what the Coalition of Australian Veterans says about your justification of the war widows payments:
Minister Vale's office continues to push figures to the media and the defence community in response to the war widows payment which are grossly misleading. These figures contradict her own department's web site. They include double counting. They include a pre tax assumption, which does not exist. They include two small lump sums as an indexed pension ... There is no doubt that the Minister's office is trying to fudge the figures. This is because the government is embarrassed at the inadequacy of existing compensation and its lack of action to fulfil its own promises made since the Blackhawk disaster in 1996.
Minister, I am looking forward to touching on your complete misunderstanding and misrepresentation of the current situation with the gold card later on.
As I stated in my contribution on the subject of Iraq, I have a very special respect for our service personnel. One of the reasons I am in this House is to ensure that ex-service men and women and those they leave behind are adequately and appropriately cared for. Like all members on this side, I support our troops and particularly those who have been predeployed to the Persian Gulf. We hope that they come home quickly and safely, but let us paint a picture of the uncertainty that these defence personnel and their families are currently facing.
We have all been moved—perhaps not the minister, but the rest of us—by the plight of Kylie Russell and her baby daughter. The minister's failure to address this issue leaves existing service personnel extremely concerned that their families will not be provided for should they fall whilst in service to our nation. We are still waiting for the legislation or even the report on the review of the Military Compensation and Rehabilitation Scheme. We are still waiting, as I said, for the Clarke review and the Gulf War veterans' health study. We are still waiting for the commencement of a study that it has been indicated will take place into SAS health, and we are still waiting for this government to tell the truth about the extent of the commitment to the US-Iraq agenda.
It is interesting to compare John Howard's treatment of the troops that he has committed to George Bush's invasion of Iraq—Operation Bastille—with his treatment of the troops that were committed to the war against terrorism. The Prime Minister announced the deployment to the war against terrorism, amid much fanfare, on 17 October 2001. Of course, Labor was equally supportive of that deployment and that remains the case today. In the middle of an election campaign—very interesting—the Prime Minister could barely wait to publicise the conditions of service for the troops involved in that campaign. Two days after announcing the deployment, he declared that the troops committed to the war on terrorism would be on warlike service. This entitled the ground troops to a tax-free allowance of $200 a day and the naval and air personnel to an allowance of $125 a day. The troops also received additional leave and were covered by veterans' entitlements and full military compensation arrangements. Their families were able to access high-level support and counselling services in recognition of their immense personal sacrifice. In his press release, the Prime Minister said: 
This package of conditions of service and the support mechanisms put in place to assist them and their families during their deployment are a clear demonstration of the Government's commitment to supporting those who serve in the national and international interest in this vital war against terrorism.
Of course, this was an entitlement and a commitment to which the troops and their families were fully entitled.
Contrast that to the Prime Minister's shameful treatment of the forward deployment as part of Operation Bastille. The Prime Minister announced this deployment on 10 January this year. The crucial difference this time is that the Prime Minister refuses to admit that he has already signed up to George Bush's pre-emptive war against Iraq. The Prime Minister's announcement today has once again exposed his deceitful treatment of service personnel and their families—deceit that has characterised his stance on this issue. He refuses to acknowledge that he is locked into George Bush's war plans. He now declares that the troops deployed as part of Operation Bastille will receive the same conditions as those troops that were deployed to the war on terrorism, but this is patently not the case. The Minister for Defence explicitly acknowledged in the other place today that the troops deployed on Operation Bastille are not on warlike service. It is not the same.
The minister was unable and unwilling to utter the words `warlike service'—very similar to the Prime Minister today—because he knows that it would be an admission that Operation Bastille is a fully integrated component of President Bush's war plans. Senator Hill's admission makes a mockery of the Prime Minister's claim that the troops deployed to Operation Bastille will receive the same conditions as the troops that were deployed to the war on terrorism. The Operation Bastille troops will not receive the same military compensation entitlements as those troops already in the Gulf as part of the war on terrorism. They will not receive the same entitlements as those troops who are currently serving on board the frigates as part of the maritime interception force. The Prime Minister claims that he is fully supportive of our troops and their families, yet even now he cannot bring himself to truthfully provide the conditions to which they are entitled. Even now he cannot come clean, because he does not want to admit that he has signed them up for a war that Australians do not want.
These people deserve to know their conditions of service; they deserve to know if they are going to be covered by the Veterans Entitlements Act; they deserve to know that, if the worst happens, their families will be provided for; and they deserve to know if this government has the wherewithal to provide for them into the future. The government ought not to be even contemplating sending any more Australians into armed conflict or active overseas duty until it has an adequate program in place to properly service and care for those who have previously served this country. 
Last week, I convened a forum on veterans affairs in Launceston. It was attended by ex-servicemen and war widows from all over northern Tasmania, together with their advocates. The list of concerns raised by these ex-service personnel, their families and advocates stands as stark condemnation of this government. If the government cannot provide for our existing ex-service personnel, how can it justify asking more Australians to serve, with an expectation that they and their loved ones will be properly cared for when and if they return? Lack of appropriate psychiatric care, especially after hours, was highlighted at the forum. One advocate told us about veterans who are locked up in police cells overnight and at weekends because there is no other care available.  
There is inadequate access to legal aid to support claims for compensation. Even if they get legal aid, there is a limited number of lawyers who offer their services to veterans. Crisis accommodation and a lack of support for carers were presented as areas of massive concern. The failure of this government to negotiate an acceptable agreement with doctors in relation in the gold card has meant that doctors have begun advising veteran patients that they are already unable to recognise the gold card or will be unable to do so in the future. One veteran was even told by the Department of Veterans' Affairs that they were not interested in fixing the problem. Unless the government is forced into action, the gold card will become almost valueless—next to useless, Minister.
If we are to contemplate sending more Australians into battle, we must be prepared to look after them when they return. The home care allowance is an example of the government's failure to understand this and the resulting consequences. Despite the minister's denial that cuts had taken place, veterans and war widows right across northern Tasmania began receiving advice from the department last year that their hours of home care would be cut. My office—and, I know, the office of the member for Braddon—was absolutely inundated with calls from very distressed veterans and war widows. War widows told me point-blank that the home care scheme was the determining factor for many of them in staying in their own homes. In a press release on this issue, the minister said:
Veterans Home Care agencies have been asked to pay close attention to their guidelines when they assess veterans for services, because if people receive more services than they need, other veterans will miss out.
Governments just have to accept that, in the immediate future—especially as the large number of World War II veterans and their widows enter their twilight years—the cost of supporting those who served our country is going to increase. Of course these programs are going to require extra funds; that goes without saying. But this is all about those fine Australians being able to live the later years of their lives with dignity and with as much independence as possible.
I find the minister's remarks about veterans and war widows who want to remain living in their homes quite bizarre. Here we have a group of Australians who are happy to stay in their own places, freeing up an overstretched aged care system. And the minister said that they should be reassessed for a higher level of care from other more appropriate services. Minister, they do not want or need a higher level of care. All they want and need is the one or two hours a week of support they had until you took it away from them. A fair go for veterans and those they leave behind has always been something which Australians have held dear. There can be no justification for changing this now.
The government has walked away from its obligations to our service personnel. It has walked away from its obligations to tell them the truth, to provide them with timely information about their service conditions, and to provide for their needs into the future.

"Bailey, Fran, MP",LP,2003-02-06,"—This matter of public importance purports to be about fairness and support for defence personnel and their families. So why don't we get down to the nitty-gritty of this question of fairness and support? I want you to imagine the scene on the Kanimbla on 23 January. Here we have the Kanimbla, with a full crew of young men and women who are highly trained and who have been looking forward to their deployment. I say that quite carefully, because all of the young service personnel that I have met have made a point of thanking me for enabling them to have the opportunity to use their skills.  
These young men and women who are about to be deployed are there, and all their families are there on the docks to support them, the Prime Minister is there, and the Minister for Defence is there. The Prime Minister thanks them for their contribution and wishes them well, as does the Minister for Defence. Then we have the Leader of the Opposition. So that I do not misquote him, I am going to read exactly what he said. He stood up and he faced those young men and women on the Kanimbla and their families. He said, `I don't want to mince my words, because I do not believe that you should be going.' In saying those words, he diminished himself—and he diminished every member of the opposition as well—
Opposition members interjecting—
—Oh yes, he did. He lost every shred of respect. It is one thing for the Leader of the Opposition to debate this question in this House; it is a very different thing to stand up on the Kanimbla, in front of those young men and women of the ADF and their families, and to make such a comment. It was insulting to those families. It showed absolutely no respect whatsoever for those families, and he is to be condemned for that. In fact, I am still waiting for him to come into this place and apologise, but I guess I will be waiting forever.
The reason those troops are being predeployed—as the Prime Minister has stated very clearly in this place—is to maintain pressure on Iraq. It is also to enable those young men and women to become familiarised in that setting and to give them the very best chance if they are to be placed in a warlike setting. If we are talking about fairness and support to defence personnel, I am going to compare those disgraceful comments by the Leader of the Opposition with those of your previous leader. I am going to quote him accurately so that I am not accused of misquoting him. He said:
... part of the reason why we have supported the government in giving our approval to the steps that they've taken thus far, has been to assist in putting pressure on Saddam Hussein. And there's no doubt in my mind if there had not been pressure coming in from those who are prepared to be part of a coalition, the energising of the United Nations Security Council and the energising of a couple of members of the United Nations Security Council—Russia and France—to try and find solutions, simply wouldn't have occurred.
There we have the difference between the former Leader of the Opposition, who was fair and did show support for the members of the ADF, and the current Leader of the Opposition, who does not show support and who has been very unfair in relation to our serving personnel. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs has detailed all the means of compensation and has gone through them in great detail.
I want to address an issue. The members of our ADF, our serving personnel, are not very different from any of us in terms of what they want and what they need in order to do their jobs properly. They want certainty with their employment, good conditions, their living and working conditions taken care of and good levels of training and support services—many of which the Minister for Veterans' Affairs has already detailed.
The sorts of things that this government has been doing, including the redevelopment of bases, fairly and squarely put us on the record as supporting the members of the ADF. I notice that the member for Herbert has just sat down in this chamber. Redevelopment has occurred up in his electorate at RAAF Base Townsville, with redevelopment stage 1 having been completed at a cost of $70 million. That includes the construction of new maintenance facilities and operational areas, including the ordnance loading aprons. Stage 2, at a cost of another $75 million, has commenced. 
Earlier today the member for Herbert was telling me how well the base redevelopment at Lavarack Barracks has been received by our serving ADF members. Stage 2 redevelopment has been completed at a cost of just over $151 million, and this included the construction of 1,004 living-in accommodation units and associated messing facilities. Other examples of work that has been completed in the last 12 months include facilities at RAAF Base Darwin for operational and support capabilities costing just over $57 million. 
These amounts can be added up right around the country. But, in essence, it all says that this is a government that listens to its ADF members. Just over 12 months ago, being very new to this position, I started visiting bases right around the country. I was able to see first-hand that this government has delivered support on the ground to people in terms of their living and working accommodation and their training—listening to them saying what was needed and fulfilling their needs.
Most importantly, this government has looked at the key issues of spouse employment, child care, child support and developing community centres. One of the first things I do when visiting a base is go and visit the Defence Community Organisation centres. They are the hub of any base. They are the hub into which this government has directly put funding. I can speak from first-hand experience with my own electorate. For five years people who live and work at the Puckapunyal army base in my electorate have been identifying the real needs of their serving members and looking at issues of spouse employment and child care. They determined that the most pressing issue was long day-care, and that is exactly what this government has delivered.
For members of the opposition to stand up and criticise this government's lack of support for and lack of fairness to ADF serving members is simply a joke; they are absolute hypocrites. For example, PuckaOnline is a new IT system. A serving member posted to Darwin or any other base in Australia can use the online service to find out exactly what is available. They can organise their accommodation and their children's schooling. They can look at what activities are available for the children of defence families. I will complete this debate by saying that, while this MPI purports to be about fairness and support, the opposition knows nothing about those things.

"SPEAKER, The",N/A,2003-02-06,"—I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the United States of America and the European institutions, 1 to 13 September 2002. I had the privilege of leading the delegation and was accompanied by Senator the Hon Peter Cook as Deputy Leader, Senator Kerry O'Brien, Senator Ross Lightfoot, and the members for Grey, Lillee and Riverina. The delegation's visit to the United States of America was part of an ongoing parliamentary program of biennial visits to the United States, with the purpose of reviewing any issues affecting the bilateral relationship and renewing parliamentary and other contacts.
After a brief stopover in Los Angeles, the delegation travelled to San Francisco where the program included a visit to Stanford University, briefings on the information technology industry and site inspections in the Silicon Valley, focusing on companies with an operational arm in Australia. The delegation also visited the major wine-growing area of Napa Valley. In Washington, the delegation focused on discussing in detail the direction of United States trade policy and its impact on Aust-ralia, as well as prospects for the expansion of trade through the proposed Australia-US free trade agreement. Our delegation also took the opportunity to express support for further multilateral trade liberalisation through the Doha Round of trade negotiations within the WTO.
The delegation's visit to New York was particularly significant in that it coincided with a special session of Congress held in New York City to commemorate the thousands of lives lost in the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001. I am sure I speak for the delegation when I say that our visit to the `ground zero' site was a sobering reminder of the horror caused by terrorist attacks.
In Belgium the delegation met representatives of several important European institutions and members of the European Parliament. The relationship between the two parliaments has been developed over the years with regular biennial visits in both directions. This program of visits has served to strengthen and emphasise the support the parliament has for continued contact with the European parliament and European institutions. The delegation was able to assess perspectives of the European security situation since 11 September 2001, including the role of a changing NATO. Security issues were also discussed at length with the president of the International Crisis Group, which has its headquarters in Brussels. 
The sessions with the European parliament covered topics ranging from the processing of asylum seekers, human rights in Australia, immigration and EU enlargement. Discussions also focused heavily on issues of subsidy and dumping, together with restricted trading access. The delegation took the opportunity to emphasise Australia's support for common agricultural policy reform and pursued every opportunity to promote the cause of free trade and to criticise restrictive measures that deny Australian producers access to fair, competitive world prices. 
In our discussions with members of the European parliament, animal health and food sanitation issues were also raised. Of particular interest to the delegation was a session of the Temporary Committee on Foot and Mouth Disease. This provided a significant opportunity for the Australian delegation to vigorously defend Australia's strict quarantine regulations, which some of our interlocutors suggested could be used by Australia as a barrier to free trade.
No visit to Belgium by a parliamentary delegation would be complete without visiting the historically important Menin Gate Memorial. On behalf of the parliament, the delegation took the opportunity to pay respects to the thousands of Australians and their comrades who lost their lives in the bloody battles of the Ypres Salient.
I take this opportunity to express the delegation's appreciation to His Excellency Mr Michael Thawley, Australian Ambassador to the United States of America; Mr Alan Rocher, Consul-General in Los Angeles; and Mr Peter Frank, Consul-General and Senior Trade Commissioner in San Francisco. Our thanks go to Her Excellency Ms Joanna Hewitt, Australian Ambassador to Brussels and to the European Union. Special thanks go to Ms Antoinette Merrillees who not only supported the visit but also served as the conduit between the European parliament and the Australian parliament in assembling the delegation's program. I also wish to express the delegation's gratitude to His Excellency Mr Thomas Schieffer, Ambassador of the United States of America, and His Excellency Mr Piergiorgio Mazzocchi, Ambassador and Head of Delegation of the European Commission, for their frank and informative briefings prior to departure.
I take this opportunity to commend my colleagues for their commitment to the success of the delegation's visit. I particularly appreciated the hard work that all delegates undertook to effectively represent Australia throughout an intense but highly informative parliamentary exchange. I commend the report to the House.",REPS,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,"<title>Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the United States of America and the European Institutions, 1 to 13 September 2002</title>",Delegation Reports,10,1
"Hull, Kay, MP",NP,2003-02-06,"—by leave—I thank the parliament for allowing me the opportunity to participate in the delegation and the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the United States of America and the European institutions, 1 to 13 September 2002, which you have just presented, Mr Speaker. I take this opportunity to congratulate you for your leadership of this delegation. I also thank the members of the delegation for the cooperative spirit in which they participated in the best interests of Australia, regardless of politics. This report is a good account of the content of the visit, and I congratulate Ms Brenda Herd and Mr Peter Gibson for the way in which they ensured accuracy within the report. However, what cannot be translated into the report is the vigour and the gusto with which debate was held on many issues and how we entered into the most robust discussions on most issues that were affecting Australia in the US market and the EU market, most particularly with regard to our agricultural industries. 
Having experienced the views of the European Union and recognising that enlargement of the EU will continue, I found that I had changed my thoughts on any opposition that I had to a free trade agreement with the USA. I now support a free trade agreement with the USA but only on the basis that agriculture leads the way in any negotiations. In my opinion, after having attended this very important delegation visit, our agriculture and farm trade reform must spearhead and be guaranteed before undertaking any other FTA. We must achieve a breakthrough on the tariffs and protection that the US affords its farmers, particularly under the US Farm Bill. Issues of the US Farm Bill must be at the heart of any discussions on any free trade agreement. We must negotiate the elimination of tariffs and quotas on our export of food and produce prior to engagement and completion of any FTA.
Also during our delegation's visit, EU and US officials and bureaucrats raised the issue that Australia uses biosecurity to provide protection for our producers and our farmers. As is indicated within this report, I reject that totally. We must withstand any pressure to water down our science based method of assessment of risk and quarantine. We are already transparent and thorough and occasionally we are accused of being not rigorous enough to protect our own people. We certainly do not need any less rigour, and we must fight to keep that science based risk in all processes of biosecurity.
Being part of the delegation was an eye-opener for me. As I said, it was a serious delegation, adequately and capably led by you, Mr Speaker. All the members of the delegation participated in the spirit of cooperation. We certainly saw great benefits in having these negotiations and discussions with the bureaucrats and senior members of the government in the US and also in the EU. I thank you again for all of the courtesy that was afforded to me during this delegation—the first and perhaps the last of my delegations. I was very proud to represent the Riverina in many of the aspects of negotiations that we had, particularly on behalf of my rice growers and citrus growers, who I feel are most worthy of representation in these markets. I am very pleased with the content of this report, I congratulate all of those people who were responsible in formulating it—and I thank you, Mr Speaker.",REPS,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,"<title>Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the United States of America and the European Institutions, 1 to 13 September 2002</title>",Delegation Reports,10,1
"Gillard, Julia, MP",ALP,2003-02-06,"—I have listened to this debate with interest and occasionally with disgust. There have been government members—indeed, even the Prime Minister—who have directly alleged or alluded to the Labor opposition being too soft on Saddam Hussein. In their speeches they have tried to paint Labor as the appeasers, as the foreign minister did last year. These base politics deserve our condemnation. Saddam Hussein is an evil man who has done evil things. He has killed, he has tortured and he has oppressed. The world would be a better place if he had never lived. No-one in this place is an apologist for Saddam Hussein and no-one who wants to be taken seriously in this debate—and this also applies to the failed former leader of the Liberal Party, the current Minister for Foreign Affairs—should stoop to making such an allegation. Understanding that Saddam Hussein is evil, it is our responsibility as elected representatives to answer the question: should Australia be involved in military action in Iraq and, if so, in what way and for what purpose? This is a question we must answer for ourselves. The answer cannot be supplied by the United States of America. When it comes to making a decision—our own decision—about military action, two things must guide us: what is morally right and what is in Australia's national interests.
Australians are not cowards, and Australians are not pacifists. Australians understand that, as much as we hate war, sometimes it is right to go and fight. In the last century it was right—morally right—to fight fascism in World War II and to fight for our survival as a nation against Japanese aggression. During my time in this parliament, I have strongly believed that it was right to deploy troops to make the peace in East Timor and I regretted that Australia had not done so earlier. But Australians know that, while it is sometimes right to go and fight, this nation's leaders have not always been right when they have sent this nation into conflict. Australians are rightly sceptical because they know there have been times our troops have been deployed when it was not right to go and fight. That scepticism is the true legacy of Vietnam.
So is military action in Iraq right or wrong? Saying Saddam Hussein is evil does not answer the question. He has been evil for many years, yet no-one in this parliament advocated Australia being involved in military action against him in 1995, 1997 or 1999. He was killing, torturing and oppressing in those years as well. What is different now is the adoption by the United Nations Security Council of resolution 1441 in November last year. In that resolution the UN and the world community said to Iraq that, having been in consistent defiance of its obligations under successive Security Council resolutions to disarm itself of weapons of mass destruction and long-range missiles, time was now running out. The UN said, `We will send in weapons inspectors one last time and if you do not cooperate and if you do not disarm, force is justified.'
In many speeches in this House, reference has been made to September 11 and to the horror of Bali. Both were outrageous atrocities against humanity and those responsible should be made to pay. But there has been no evidence to prove that Iraq and Hussein were implicated in these events. Colin Powell last night produced some material on links between Iraq and al-Qaeda but even Colin Powell does not put the case that Iraq caused September 11 or the Bali atrocity. It is therefore simply wrong to pretend to the Australian people that the horror of Bali is the reason we need to engage in military action in Iraq. 
So what is right? What should Australia do if what it wants to do is to do what is right? My answer is as follows. In a globalised world we need a global process to deal with conflict and disarmament. In the world in which we live the body that deals with conflict and disarmament is the United Nations. I know that the United Nations has its flaws—to deny that would be risible—but the United Nations is the only mechanism that the world has to deal with conflict and to make peace. In my view, it is right to back it.
I therefore conclude that it is right to support military action in Iraq only if the United Nations authorises it. I do not believe it is right to support such action outside the UN process. I specifically do not believe that we should back action if the UN says no and one nation, the United States—or even two nations, the United States and the United Kingdom—says yes. Just as I believe no one person should get to run a nation—that nations should be run collectively through democratic structures—I believe that no one nation should get to run the world. The community of nations should deal together with the global issues of peace and war.
Clearly, many Australians believe that, even if the UN authorises action, Australia should not back it—this is the message of those who simply say, `No war.' I say to those who say that, I do not agree with you. I say to you that if you do not back the United Nations, then what do you say about how the world should manage conflict? If we do not back the United Nations, what else do we have? When I started this contribution, I said it is our responsibility as elected representatives to answer the question: should Australia be involved in military action in Iraq and, if so, in what way and for what purposes? I seek to answer those two questions now.
If the UN sanctions action then the purpose is disarmament. That should also be Australia's purpose. The United States of America might say its goal is regime change. But that should not be Australia's purpose because it will not be the United Nations' purpose. In what way should we be involved? To answer that question, it is necessary to say that, if the UN authorises action in Iraq, I believe it is our responsibility to express our support for that action. But the nature of our involvement is a matter for us. We should decide what we can deploy based on the premise that the most important purpose for our defence forces is the defence of Australia, including from terrorist threat. I note that the United States of America endorsed the UN's role in East Timor whilst putting no boots on the ground.
While many hours in parliament have been devoted to this debate, we all know that in some ways we are debating a fait accompli. In forward deploying our troops, the Prime Minister has committed them to war—with or without UN sanction. His decision to do so in my view was morally wrong and his refusal to be truthful about it compounds the moral wrong; and Australians should never forget it. The Prime Minister has put us on a course for war. 
I still hope that war can be avoided but one must address the consequences of war should it occur. In my capacity as shadow minister for population and immigration I am particularly concerned about the flood of refugees that will be generated. I draw to the attention of members of this House a confidential leaked United Nations report about the humanitarian consequences of war. Let me take you to their predictions. They have done two scenarios: the immediate humanitarian interventions that are likely to be required, and then the humanitarian interventions that are likely to be required following a protracted conflict.
The immediate humanitarian intervention includes the food and necessities for some 5.4 million people, health supplies to treat injuries for approximately 100,000 people, health supplies to treat up to 1.23 million highly vulnerable people, health supplies to cater for the ongoing needs of 5.4 million people, nutrition supplies for 5.4 million people, water treatment equipment for 5.4 million people, chemicals and consumables for 5.4 million people—and on it goes. These are the immediate needs for humanitarian intervention but a total range of services for two million internally displaced persons will be needed. Emergency shelter for 1.4 million will be required and facilities will be necessary for about 100,000 Iraqi refugees in neighbouring countries. Those are the immediate week 1 needs. 
As the conflict goes on, the humanitarian interventions change and grow in magnitude. This leaked United Nations report says that there will be a need for food and necessities for a minimum of 23 million people. Health supplies will be required to treat injuries for approximately half a million people. Health supplies will be required to generally treat 23 million people. They will need water treatment equipment for more than 18 million people. They will need a total range of services for two million internally displaced persons, some of whom may well become refugees. They will need emergency shelter for 3.6 million people and they will need facilities for 1.4 million Iraqi refugees, with about 900,000 of them entering neighbouring countries and 500,000 remaining along the border but inside Iraq.
Obviously these figures are the best guesstimates of the United Nations. We do not know whether they will be right, but they are chilling all the same, and I trust that everybody in this House will be praying they do not come true. But, if they do and there are hundreds of thousands of Iraqi refugees on the move into neighbouring countries, what will Australia do? As I have already noted, this Prime Minister, through forward deployment, has committed us to war. If war ensues and refugees who reach neighbouring countries are not adequately supported, we know for sure—because history has taught us this lesson—that some will continue to move forward and try to reach Australia by boat.
When that happens, when refugees flee a war the Prime Minister has supported, what will the Prime Minister do? Will he rub his hands and look for the domestic political advantage in calling them queue jumpers and pushing them onto Pacific nations? If he does then Australians need to remember that you cannot advocate support for war and avoid the humanitarian consequences. With a huge refugee flow to cope with, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the UN instrument this government has profited from by vilifying—
—That is an extraordinary leap, isn't it?
—I really do not know what the parliamentary secretary is on about. I have made my position clear on the nature of the intervention in Iraq with United Nations support. You would think that would be a simple proposition for anyone to understand. With a huge refugee flow to cope with, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the UN instrument this government has profited from by vilifying will have to be out on the ground with food, with water, with tents and with doctors. If they cannot cope, if there is nothing, then people will keep moving and more than likely we will see some on boats to Australia.
 (Hon. L.R.S. Price)—Order!
—The parliamentary secretary at the table might learn from the following statistic. The UNHCR needs to be resourced to ensure that it can meet these needs. Surely, the parliamentary secretary would not suggest displaced refugees in neighbouring countries should be left to starve. But what is the track record of this government?
—Order!
—The Howard government has slashed core funding to the UNHCR from around $14 million per year to just $7.3 million in the current financial year, a budgetary cut of 50 per cent—no amount of government delusion changes that fact.
—Order!
—I take it from the way the parliamentary secretary is reacting that this is a sore point. What will the Howard government do on this issue? Will it wait? Will it do nothing? Will it not help the UNHCR and wait for refugees to turn up on our shores? Or is it doing what it should be—working with the international community to develop a plan for these refugees, and funding the UNHCR and the agencies that will deal with the crisis? I fear that we will end this debate and never know the answers to those questions because Minister Ruddock is not due to speak in this debate. The reality is that a war in Iraq will displace hundreds of thousands. Some of them will be internally displaced in Iraq, but many hundreds of thousands will be in neighbouring countries.  
—I hear the government asserting there will not be anybody displaced. Well the UN thinks so, and I think it is in a better position to judge than you are. There will be hundreds of thousands of internally displaced people and hundreds of thousands in neighbouring countries and their needs will need to be met.
—Order! The parliamentary secretary!
—In those circumstances, is the government involved in contingency planning for that? If so, what is it? Minister Ruddock should speak in this debate and he should make that clear. This government should make it clear that its approach will be a constructive one of help and not one of vilifying refugees who arrive later.

"Hawker, David, MP",LP,2003-02-06,"—I rise to wholeheartedly support the words of the Prime Minister in this debate, as well as his answers to various questions during the week. I take strong exception to a couple of comments by the member for Lalor. She says first of all that the Prime Minister has committed us to war. The Prime Minister has repeatedly pointed out that that is not true. What the Leader of the Opposition, what the member for Lalor and what other members of the opposition have been saying is simply not true. It cannot go unanswered. It is false and the Prime Minister has explained at length why it is false.
The second point that came through while listening to the member for Lalor was that she set up a straw man. She talked about a war that has not been declared and then talked about the consequences of this hypothetical war. It may be a very interesting academic exercise, but that is all it is. It really does show that she wishes to divert attention from the main point, which is that there is overwhelming evidence as to not only the evil that is going on in Iraq under the regime of Saddam Hussein but also the reasons why Saddam Hussein has to be forced to get rid of his weapons of mass destruction in whatever way we can force him to. This has been pointed out by the Prime Minister, and the Secretary of State, Colin Powell, pointed it out yesterday in the United States. Hopefully, pressure will be brought to bear on Saddam Hussein from the work that the United States have done and what we are expecting from the United Nations.
I want to come back to what the Prime Minister has been doing. He has been showing outstanding leadership in this situation, and it is something that is widely respected by many Australians. While nobody wants a war, people respect the way that the Prime Minister is handling a very difficult situation and showing leadership—leadership that has been strongly supported by the excellent work of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who is also to be commended for the way he has handled this difficult situation. But I want to say again that no decision has been made to commit Australian troops to conflict. That point has to be made and made repeatedly because it seems that there are some who wish to misrepresent the situation. I hope that war will not be needed but, equally importantly, it is clear that Iraq has to be brought to account for this growing arsenal of weapons of mass destruction. What the world now requires and what the United Nations has been demanding for 11 years has to be seen to happen.
I think we should be asking ourselves a simple question: why does Iraq continue to develop weapons of mass destruction? I do not think there is any doubt, after what Secretary of State Powell has said and shown in his speech to the United Nations, as to what has been going on. In fact, from 1991 the world has been trying to get Iraq to get rid of weapons of mass destruction. That was part of the conditions of the cease-fire at the end of the Gulf War. The United Nations has passed nine resolutions to this effect since, and they have all been ignored. People tend to say that the United Nations has to do something; the United Nations has been trying to do something for nearly 12 years. It is clear that, if Saddam Hussein had agreed with what he said he would do at the cease-fire and what the United Nations has been trying to do since, we would not even be having this debate. 
There is no doubt that the international community faces a threshold question: if we cannot deal with Iraq, what hope is there that we are going to be able to deal with other rogue states? That is a very fundamental question. It recognises that there is no doubt that we are facing a very different world from the one we faced 10 years ago or prior to that. Some people, including the previous Labor speaker, try to make the point that there is no definite link between Saddam Hussein and terrorist organisations such as al-Qaeda. Secretary of State Powell made it quite clear that al-Qaeda operatives are taking refuge in Iraq right now. I would have thought that that was a fairly serious point, and one that cannot be overlooked.
The real point is that we have a situation where Saddam Hussein is developing these weapons of mass destruction, and there are the awful consequences that go with that. At the same time we have terrorists showing, with September 11 and the tragedy in Bali, just what they can do, and I suspect we all know that they have not given up on trying to do other things. While they may be running parallel in their ruthless and sinister ways, as the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, pointed out, sooner or later they will come together if we allow them to go on, and the consequences are terrifying. I think all Australians know that. All Australians know that we cannot ignore that, because we are going to be part of it if it occurs.
The other change that occurred in the last decade and caused a new dynamic was the end of the Cold War. We no longer have that balance of tension. We now have rogue states getting bolder. Iraq is only one of them; others have been mentioned. September 11 and the tragedy in Bali show that terrorism is now occurring on a scale that none of us ever believed possible—certainly in a way that none of us in this region has ever experienced.
Yet, when the United States shows world leadership, many people in the Labor Party seem to be more keen to denigrate this leadership—by, let us face it, a democratically elected government and a very strong ally—than to appreciate the leadership the United States has given in trying to maintain a stable world. In listening to the debate, I have noticed that there seems to be a very simple formula that many members of the opposition are using in this debate. They start off with a perfunctory denouncement of Saddam Hussein—they say, `I don't think much of that'—and then they go on to take refuge in the United Nations.
I think there are two points to remind everyone about here. The first is, as I said earlier, that Saddam Hussein has been ignoring United Nations resolutions since the cease-fire agreement in 1991, when his regime was told it had to get rid of weapons of mass destruction. There have been nine separate resolutions, and all of them have been ignored. We have had inspectors go in and we have had inspectors thrown out. We have had the pressure brought back by the United Nations, under the force of the United States and the threats they have had to make in order to get the United Nations to agree. As the foreign minister said today, Kofi Annan agreed that it is difficult to believe that the Security Council would have reached resolution 1441 without the support of the United States.
What really concerns me is that, if the United Nations Security Council does not give total agreement, again, that Iraq has to get rid of weapons of mass destruction, it seems that the ALP has a do nothing position. In other words, if the United Nations does not reach a unanimous decision, does that mean that the ALP does not feel that weapons of mass destruction are such an important matter? It does not bear thinking about. It is a serious question, and I wonder whether members of the Labor Party can answer it. Taking refuge in this UN issue seems to me to be very much avoiding the seriousness of the whole issue. 
Let us look at some of the comments Secretary of State Powell made. He said that the weapons inspectors who have been in Iraq under Hans Blix have deliberately and systematically been misled. I believe that, as the Prime Minister said today, there is some very powerful information in that address by Secretary of State Powell. That information is described as deeply troubling and compelling evidence. It shows that, as I say, Iraq is not cooperating. I do not have time to go through all of the things Powell had to say now, but I will take a couple up. He said, among other things:
I cannot tell you everything that we know, but what I can share with you . . . is deeply troubling.
Those are very strong words and we cannot ignore them, we cannot put them aside. They show us how very serious this matter is; therefore, the stand that the Prime Minister has taken is deserving of support from the whole parliament. I find it deeply troubling that so many people on the other side cannot see that point.
Secretary of State Powell also pointed out that a tape of a colonel and a brigadier from the Republican Guard had them talking about hiding vehicles. He talked about satellite photos that indicated the presence of active chemical munitions bunkers disguised from the weapons inspectors. He talked about how Saddam Hussein had personally barred Iraqi scientists from participating in interviews with the UN inspectors and had forced them to sign documents acknowledging that divulging information was punishable by death. We heard earlier today about some of the ways that people meet their death in Iraq. He called it `the discovery most worrisome' when US intelligence indicated that Iraq had production facilities for biological weapons on wheels and on rails. He talked about the stockpile of between 100 and 500 tonnes of chemical weapons, including four tonnes of the nerve gas VX. A single drop of VX can kill a human being. What is one drop when you have got four tonnes of it? Among a number of other things he talked about was that al-Qaeda fugitives from Afghanistan had found safe haven in north Iraq and that al-Qaeda associates are operating in Baghdad.
I could go on about the seriousness of this issue but it comes back to the point that the Prime Minister made when he began this debate. He made the case very clearly and in great detail that to do nothing is not an option, that we have to force Iraq to rid itself of these weapons of mass destruction and that we have to be mindful, as the British Prime Minister Tony Blair has said, that the consequences of not doing that are truly terrifying. I greatly fear what the consequences of Iraq and the terrorists coming together would be for the sort of world we would have to face in the future. I strongly support the Prime Minister, and I commend all that he has done. ",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,14,1
"Zahra, Christian, MP",ALP,2003-02-06,"—Something very profound has been revealed about the Prime Minister's character from the way he has conducted himself in making this decision as to whether or not Australia should go to war against Iraq. What has been revealed is that Prime Minister John Howard, like former Prime Minister Robert Menzies, does not believe in Australia. He does not believe that we can find our own way. He believes and Menzies believed that Australia can only be an appendage to another country. It is obvious in the way that he has sought to do the bidding of one man and one country that Australia's national interests have been far from his mind.
Where is the Prime Minister we were promised in 2001 during the election campaign? Where is the Prime Minister who banged the podium in front of him and said, `We will decide who comes to this country and we will decide the manner in which they come to this country'? It was an assertion of Australia's national interests. He presented himself to the Australian people as a man who could stand up for Australia's national interests, not as a man who could be told what to do by anyone outside Australia.  
We heard before from some people in the Liberal Party that the Labor Party is about subjugating Australia's interests to the United Nations. What about subjugating Australia's national interests to the United States? We have to stand proud as Australian people. We have to be able to find our own way in the world. We are a good enough nation to make up our own mind and choose our own future. When it comes to matters to do with Australia's national security, no issue is more important for Australia than to find its own way and find an approach to suit its interests—not any other country's interests. 
The Prime Minister promised so much in terms of being a man who could stand up for Australia's national interests. Here was a man who would not be told by anyone else what was right for Australia. Yet here he is kowtowing to George W. Bush. He has been going through this elaborate charade with the Australian people and saying, `I have not committed Australian troops', but all the while he had committed Australian troops to this conflict with or without United Nations sanction. The people that I speak to in my electorate want a proud Australian Prime Minister, someone who is proud to be the Prime Minister of Australia and who has no concern for anything else except dealing with issues in Australia's national interest. 
We are seeing right now that Australia's Prime Minister is only wanting to do the bidding of George W. Bush. You cannot have a properly arrived at position that deals with our national security when it has been arrived at from the viewpoint of John Howard doing whatever George W. Bush tells him to do, and nothing else. A position on something as precious, sacred and important to our nation's future as our national security should not be arrived at through a process that is only concerned with what one country and one man want for Australia. It is clear to me that, when dealing with matters of national security, our Prime Minister is only interested in what the United States tells him to do, instead of dealing substantially with these issues in Australia's national interest. 
 (Hon. L.R.S. Price)—The parliamentary secretary will extend courtesy to all speakers on both sides of the House and not constantly interject. If she persists in doing so, I will deal with her. 
—In relation to these issues, what people in Australia want to see is an Australian Prime Minister committed to finding a national security outcome which is in our nation's interests, not one that is in any other nation's interests. We should not be taking direction from foreign countries when it comes to talking about what is in Australia's national interests, especially when it comes to matters to do with national security.
The United States and Great Britain are a long way from Australia. We have in our history plenty of examples of where what is right for them is not necessarily right for us. There is much evidence—report after report, information and intelligence from countries in our region—to say that we in our region face a substantial threat from terrorist networks. That should be our national security priority. People in Australia want to know that we are secure at home. They want to know that our defence forces are being used to deal with the issues which affect our national security—that is, our security in our region.
The deployment which the Prime Minister has committed himself to in relation to a war in Iraq is a substantial contribution. We are talking about in the order of 2,000 troops. This is a substantial contribution relative to many other contributions which we have made in recent times. Given the increased risk in relation to terrorism in our region, I think it is fair to ask whether that is the most appropriate deployment of our defence forces at this time. I am not convinced that our Prime Minister has arrived at the decision that he has made to send our troops to Iraq on the basis of what is in the best interests of our nation in our region as opposed to just wanting to do what George W. Bush wants him to do. 
We have had plenty of examples of Liberal prime ministers who were very keen to be feted by powerful countries overseas. We saw Robert Menzies' gushing love for the British royal family. How embarrassed we all felt when he said of the Queen, when she visited Australia, `I did but see her passing by and yet I love her till I die.' These are embarrassing things for the Australian people to hear. I see this in footage and I am embarrassed. I squirm watching an Australian Prime Minister being so sycophantic to a foreign interest. I squirm when I see that.
In the same way as Robert Menzies was in love with the British royal family and was someone who viewed Australia as only ever hoping to be part of the British Empire, we have an Australian Prime Minister today who cannot assert strongly and powerfully Australia's national interests. That is exactly what people in Australia want him to do. They want to know that our Prime Minister is making decisions not based on what any foreign interest wants but on what is in the best interests of our country. Right now, it is my belief that we have a Prime Minister who is making decisions not based on the national security of our country but based on what is best for him and his relationship with George W. Bush.
The people in my electorate understand the importance of not allowing a situation where countries are encouraged to take unilateral action. People in my electorate have a good memory of why the United Nations was created in the first place. Allowing countries to act unilaterally against each other will create for us the type of international climate which breeds insecurity, creates more conflict and creates a situation where we have an enormous cost in terms of the loss of life due to war. None of us want to see that happen. People are fearful that, if we have a situation in which Australian troops are deployed without United Nations sanction, we will start to move towards a situation where we are siding not with the international community but with one country, leaving ourselves dangerously exposed and not acting in Australia's national interests.
Interestingly, I heard the Minister for Trade, Mark Vaile, comment yesterday in question time that he sees Australia's trade relationship as not stepping back from Asia but `stepping up to Asia'. This language that the government uses to describe our relationship with our closest neighbours is all wrong. This idea that you somehow have to be combative and step up to the plate or step up to the fight is all wrong. We have to find our future in Asia, we have to find—increasingly—defence arrangements in Asia, and we have to make sure that we do not leave ourselves dangerously exposed by just having one defence relationship, one relationship which is worth anything to us. The only relationship which John Howard is interested in is the relationship which he has with George W. Bush.
I do not think that is in Australia's national interest. People in our country know it is not in Australia's national interest. People see this very powerfully. Before the end of last year, I spoke to an adult day activity group from Latrobe Community Health Services at the Morwell East Senior Citizens Centre. There were probably about 50 or 60 people there. They were people of an age where a lot of people would traditionally consider them to be strong supporters of the coalition. In relation to the issue to do with whether Australia should commit troops to a war in Iraq, they were unanimous—50 or 60 people—that Australia should not commit troops without United Nations sanction. They were absolutely unanimous. It is unusual to have a group of people so absolutely in agreement in relation to any issue in political life, but there you go. That is what people felt. I think the reason that people of that generation are so concerned about the Australian deployment of troops to a potential war in Iraq is that they know the loss of war from personal experience and they understand what it means. 
People in my electorate have made a big contribution over the years to Australia's national security. Many, many people from our area lost their lives in World War I, World War II and the Vietnam War. We have had a long association with the military forces and we are people who understand the importance of our national security. We owe it to all of the people in Australia to make sure that we make decisions that affect the lives of our men and women in the defence forces that are in Australia's national interests and that relate to Australia's national security.
We need to have a good Defence Force. We need to have a properly funded, well-equipped and capable Defence Force for our nation. People in Australia understand this and people in my electorate in particular understand the importance of this. The reason that we have a Defence Force like that is to defend Australia. The idea of our troops being far from our shores at a time of insecurity when we have so much information which points to a threat of terrorist action in our region does not make sense to me. It does not seem to me to be the result of a proper consideration of the immediate priorities for defence in our country. It seem to me to be all about John Howard wanting to do whatever George W. Bush tells him. We cannot run Australia's defence policy on who it is that John Howard wants to impress. We have to have a defence policy which meets the needs of the Australian people and our unique security environment.
There have been a lot of people who have had a lot to say in relation to this issue, but to me what it boils down to is: what is in Australia's national interest? What is in our national defence interest? Is it really in our defence interest to associate ourselves with a pre-emptive strike by the United States against Iraq without United Nations sanction, or would we be better off making sure that our defence forces are used in Australia's national defence; that is, to make sure that our national security is not compromised? That is why we have defence forces. Everyone understands the importance of them and that is what I think the Australian people want to see the government arrive at: a position that is in our national interest and which is not about appeasing the interests of a foreign country.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,14,1
"Schultz, Alby, MP",LP,2003-02-06,"—Today I spoke with a person whom I have an enormous amount of respect for and whose wise counsel I value. That person is the former president of the New South Wales RSL, Rusty Priest. During my conversation with him today I asked him what his views were with regards to Australia's decision to predeploy troops to the Middle East. He said to me that in the past that has been the position of many prime ministers, and that is their role as elected leaders of this country. He said that at the same time as those decisions are taken it is incumbent upon all Australians to give their full support to those ADF personnel who have been deployed.
He also said to me that it is terribly important that we as a nation recognise that the predeployment of troops has occurred frequently in the past and that it is a very good military decision to make when troops have to be acclimatised to a particular area and become familiar with the procedures of supporting nations in any possible conflict in any area.
I took that on board because I am absolutely amazed as a member of this place and as an Australian about the anti-American nonsense that has been going on in an environment in which at the same time those people who are pushing that anti-American sentiment think it is okay for a dictator who has committed genocide against his own people and executed members of his immediate family to be in possession of chemical and biological weapons. Those people certainly have short memories, and they certainly have short memories with regards to America's role in protecting Australia in the past. 
The possibility of weapons of mass destruction, including biological agents, being in the hands of rogue states and terrorist groups is too frightening to contemplate. Over the past 12 years, Iraq has failed to comply with 24 of the 27 provisions contained in UN Security Council resolutions. In 1991 the UN passed nine resolutions condemning Iraq's non-cooperation with weapons inspectors. There is proof that Iraq has not destroyed pre-1998 weapons and materials. 
Saddam Hussein is a real danger to peace in the world. He is a known sponsor of terrorism, sponsorship which includes giving payment to the families of Palestinian suicide bombers, providing shelter to terrorist groups and operating a secret terrorist training facility within Iraq. Saddam Hussein has a history of aggression in the Middle East and has been almost continuously at war with his neighbours. He started a fruitless war against Iran which from 1981 to 1988 cost over a million lives. When the war finished he spared little time starting another, invading Kuwait in 1990. He has used weapons of mass destruction against his neighbours, using chemical weapons in the Iran-Iraq War and long range missiles against Saudi Arabia, Israel and the United Arab Emirates during the Gulf War.
Saddam's sorry record demonstrates that his regime will not listen to the UN unless diplomacy is backed up by military strength. We all want Saddam to disarm peacefully through the UN. Australia's military presence and that of other like-minded countries helps to strengthen the UN position.
Our commitment to the Middle East and to our friends and allies in the Gulf was demonstrated in our active and immediate willingness to participate in the liberation of Kuwait in 1991 and again in our rapid deployment to defend that country from the threat of the massing Iraqi troops along Kuwait's borders in 1998.
The opposition is not only playing divisive politics with this issue; it has demonstrated its abject hypocrisy on the whole issue of Iraq. There is no more compelling evidence of this than what it was saying about Australia's role in Iraq in 1991, when it was in government, and in 1998, when it was in opposition. I think this is graphically spelt out in two very important media articles. The first is an article in the Australian on Monday, 23 September 2002 by Glenn Milne. He says:
When you talk about history repeating itself in relation to Iraq, the immediate supposition is that you're referring to the fact that in January 1991 it was George Bush Sr who went after Saddam Hussein. A decade later and it looks very much as if George Bush Jr will do exactly the same. But the parallels have a domestic resonance as well.
Back then it was Bob Hawke who was supporting the father in much the same way as John Howard now backs the son. In the case of the Labor Party, the internal problems Hawke faced in selling the first Gulf War to his own party are very much the same difficulties Simon Crean now confronts. But whereas Hawke had the benefit of incumbency, Crean does not. And for reasons that will soon become clear the damage for Crean could likely be much greater.
In another echo from 10 years ago, the behaviour of the Coalition will once again be critical to the circumstances in which the Labor leader finds himself. How so? In 1991 Hawke committed Australia to support a US-led international coalition against Iraq on the basis of a phone call from the then US president and informal consultations with a handful of senior ministers. There wasn't even a full cabinet discussion.
It's on this basis that Howard now asserts the decision on whether to commit troops against Hussein is one for the executive and not the parliament. Crean has to demur on this point because of the Hawke precedent. As in 1991 the Coalition is rock solid in its support of the war against Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. And again, as in 1991, it is the Labor Party that is split on the issue of war.
Prior to the vote in parliament that endorsed Hawke's decision, there was vigorous internal debate. Two hundred leading members of the ALP took out an advertisement urging the government not to send troops to the Gulf. They “firmly opposed” a first strike by the US and its allied forces. This opposition to Hawke carried over into the parliament. But even more deeply opposed to the war than the Labor splinter group was the then independent MP for North Sydney, Ted Mack. In much the same way today the independent member for Calare, Peter Andren, is railing against Howard's decision to act as Bush's international cheer leader. 
A number of Labor MPs during the 1991 debate spoke against at least part of Hawke's pro-war resolution. As the two day's worth of speeches drew to a close, just before midnight, Mack was ready to call for a formal division. That would have required MPs on both sides to stand up and be counted on their final position. But remarkably, he couldn't find anyone, from either side of politics, to second his motion.
One contemporary report noted: “He did have some admirers, however, Mr Barry Jones, the former Labor minister [and future ALP president] returned to the nearly empty chamber to hear Mr Mack speak and congratulated the independent afterwards. Visitors in the public gallery applauded politely.”
That was the obvious theatre. What had been going on behind the scenes was much more gripping. Hawke had lobbied the eight dissenting members of his backbench until 2am the previous day, imploring them to support the motion. To no avail. So when the vote was finally due to be taken, the Government only had the support of 74 of its own members, one short of a simple majority. For the first time in its then seven-year history, Hawke was forced to rely on the support of the opposition to secure parliamentary endorsement of a policy—in this case Australian involvement in the first Gulf War.
He then goes on to talk about Mack. In the latter part of the article he says:
At least two Labor members, Harry Quick and Tanya Plibersek have already called for a conscience vote on any motion committing Australian troops. Plibersek has even gone further, declaring remarkably that Australian troops will be directly involved in killing innocent people: “I think the issue of sending our soldiers to possibly die in Iraq, certainly to kill Iraqi civilians including children, is an issue that must be defined as a conscience vote. I think there's no question of that.”
And she's not alone.
He goes on to mention three other Labor members: Harry Quick, Martin Ferguson and Carmen Lawrence. He concludes his article by saying:
And so it went on. The anti-US sentiment in many of the speeches was strident.
Up in the Senate, one speech was strikingly different in tone. It was that of Robert Ray. “The one statement,” said Ray, “by President Bush that I was overjoyed to hear was that the only way into the future is not just to deal with terrorism, but to deal with the states that sponsor it. Those countries should be put on notice that if they want to fund, sponsor and encourage terrorism then they are going to be punished in turn.”
Unlike many others in the Labor Party, Ray knows what's at stake in the debate over Iraq. After all, he was defence minister during the first Gulf War. He understands where the Labor Party has been on this issue in the past. And the moderation of his tone might well be noted by those on his side of politics who are now seeking to choose another direction in these difficult times.
End of article. The other article which was very good was written by Jim Nolan. He is described as a `veteran Labor activist' and he has been a member of the Australian Labor Party since 1968. He talks about `Labor and the Australian Left call for the removal of Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein on human rights grounds alone' and he asks why Labor will not call for that. He says:
After all, the party and its ideological soul mates in the community have had a proud and noble record in championing the democratic cause of the oppressed and condemning the evil ways of their aggressors.
He goes on to say:
Yet the Left's opposition to regime change in Iraq stands in stark contrast to these principled campaigns. But turning a blind eye to the Iraqi tyrant will only lend aid and comfort to one of the most brutal and murderous regimes on earth. And opposing the Bush-Blair-Howard position of regime change in Iraq will only prolong the life of an ugly, brutal, fascist state.
He goes on to talk about Simon Crean:
And Simon Crean has echoed Brereton's call, telling The Australian Financial Review last week that he has all but ruled out support for a US-led attack on Iraq.
But neither Brereton nor Crean has offered any real analysis of the alternatives to regime change. It's almost as if the British Labour Government's detailed dossiers showing the horrors Hussein has inflicted on Iraqis and the build-up of weapons of mass destruction never existed.
I think that is indicative of what various speakers on this side of the parliament have been trying to highlight about the Labor Party and its abject hypocrisy on this issue. Nolan goes on to say: 
What appears to be beyond the grasp of many of my comrades in the Left is the scale and scope of a modern totalitarian regime such as Hussein's. It is truly—to use Iraqi dissident Kanan Makiya's eloquent term—a republic of fear. It is a police state which conducts its ruthless totalitarian control through more than 100,000 secret police.
And so on. Finally, he wants to know `how the leopard could possibly change its spots'. He is of course talking about the Left of the Australian Labor Party. He says:
Lest anyone is fooled into believing that ordinary Iraqis strongly support their nation's dictator Hussein, consider the work of Brussels-based International Crisis Group, headed by former Labor foreign minister Gareth Evans. In its informal survey of Iraqi opinion in September and October 2002 in large Iraqi cities, it noted that a significant number of the Iraqis interviewed, with surprising candour, supported the overthrow of Hussein, even if such a change required an American-led attack.
In closing, he says: 
British Prime Minister Tony Blair has articulated such a challenge powerfully and persuasively. It's just a pity his Labor party comrades here have failed to heed his message.
That is a pretty eloquent indication of just what some Labor people think about the weak and divisive way in which the Labor Party has reacted to this predeployment of troops.
The government remains hopeful that Iraq will accept the diplomatic demands of the world to end its program of weapons of mass destruction and to destroy the weapons it already has. The best chance of peace is for the United Nations Security Council to resolve to enforce complete compliance with resolution 1441 and for the world community to also insist on Iraq's disarmament. I compliment the Prime Minister on the stand he has taken as the duly elected leader of this country on behalf of the Australian people. I know he has done it in the best interests of Australians and Australia's future security and, like all of my colleagues on this side of the House, I support him. All I can say to the Labor Party is: you ought to be ashamed of the way in which you have disgracefully abused a very serious issue and, more importantly, put a very negative reflection on the men and women who are going to serve this country in whatever conflict or action they have been asked to undertake on behalf of the Australian government and its people.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,14,1
"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,2003-02-06,"—I really think the electors of Hume deserve something better than a representative whose speech on such an important issue constituted reading out newspaper articles from two or three journalists—a very mediocre performance indeed.
—Did he get paid for that?
—Yes, do you still get paid for that? I believe that, when we come to parliament and to public office, we all come to try to do good—to try to do the right thing by ordinary people. But there is no doubt that we are subjected to all kinds of pressures and sometimes end up losing sight of these things and thinking about our own political advantage and interests ahead of those people we are supposed to represent. Frankly, I think that is what has happened in the case of George W. Bush. There are people who say that this is about oil, but one thing I do agree with the Prime Minister about is that this is probably not about oil. If it were about oil, you would imagine that it might have come up years ago or might have been resolved in some other way.
What I think is going on here is that he has learned something from the political experience of his father, who was highly successful in the Gulf War in driving Iraq out of Kuwait and whose opinion poll ratings went sky high—above 80 per cent. But he won and, when the war was over, attention in the United States turned to domestic things. Bill Clinton famously said, `It's the economy, stupid,' and went on to beat George Bush Sr. In the wake of September 11, George Bush has gone into Afghanistan—a move which has my full support—and has been successful there, but he has thought to himself, `You know, if this finishes, domestic attention will turn to other things.' I have sadly come to the conclusion that this is all about electoral advantage—that Iraq is not about weapons of mass destruction but is rather, for John Howard and George Bush, a weapon of mass distraction. 
Unfortunately, Iraq represents not merely a matter of convenience but also a distraction from the main game. The war on terrorism should be about Osama bin Laden, al-Qaeda and Jemaah Islamiah—not about Iraq, with which there has been no valid connection made. In putting the international focus on Iraq we have taken our eye off the ball, and it is not in Australia's interests for us to focus on Iraq at the expense of these things. Just today, a report from British defence intelligence experts was leaked which said, `There is no current link and the suggestion that there have been any links in the past between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda is out of date.' For people who take an interest in these things, Saddam Hussein is not a religious fundamentalist and not an Islamic extremist. He is a pretty common or garden dictator with, as far as I can tell, no genuine religious or other convictions at all. The suggestion is very much that he and al-Qaeda have little in common.
The other issue which has been raised here is weapons of mass destruction. Yes, Saddam Hussein should be disarmed. Yes, we should be vigilant about these things. But the situation of other powers is just as relevant and there is evidence concerning weapons of mass destruction in India, Israel and North Korea as well. Just a year ago, George Bush talked about North Korea as part of the `axis of evil'. Now he says that `quiet diplomacy' is the way to go. The difference is that Iraq is an Islamic nation, and the suspicion amongst people of Islamic background that Iraq can therefore be treated differently is a matter of great concern to those people. I support United Nations processes as the way to deal with this issue. My son Ben pointed out to me a day or two ago, `Dad, people need to remember here what happened with the League of Nations.' When the League of Nations was treated with contempt and that process broke down, it was part of the background to the Second World War. After the defeat of Hitler the powers around the world said, `We've got to do better than this,' and they set up the United Nations. Whatever its sins and shortcomings, it is the way forward. There must be international rule of law.
Debate interrupted; adjournment proposed and negatived.
—Regrettably, the government and the Liberal Party do not support the United Nations. Instead, they prefer to sit on George Bush's lap. We see this not only with the international issue before us, Iraq, but also with things like the Kyoto protocol, where they fail to be part of that collective international action. It is my view that we need to support the United Nations and that unilateral action would be disastrous. I ask those who are prepared to contemplate engaging in unilateral action whether they realise what the consequences of this would be and whether they realise where this would be going. George Bush and, indeed, Tony Blair need to realise what 15-year-old boys in Iraq would think if they believed that there were no rules and that this is just about force, crude might and crude power. In light of this, there would be hundreds of Osama bin Ladens. People need to understand what the consequences of unilateral action would be.
International terrorism is indeed a problem. We have got to be tough on terrorism and we have also got to be tough on the causes of terrorism. By all means, we need to hunt down al-Qaeda and Jemaah Islamiah, but we also need to look at things like international aid. We have been too selfish. There are hundreds of millions of people around the world without access to things like decent drinking water and decent sanitation. We also need to put a better international focus on the Middle East. It has obviously been an intractable problem, but we have got to be tougher on Hamas and Arafat on the one side and Sharon and the settlers on the other side. 
If the United States and other powers were prepared to apply the international blowtorch to the Middle East in the way that they are prepared to apply it to Iraq now, then maybe we would get something in relation to the settlements and the occupied territories. And maybe we would get something if we were to say to Arafat and the Palestinian Authority, `This dream of one day driving the Israelis into the sea is utter rubbish. It is never going to happen and you need to have the guts to tell your people that.' Government members have outlined a catalogue of evils on the part of Iraq, sure; but we do not go in and take out every evil regime. We talk about Zimbabwe. We need to learn some of the lessons of Vietnam, where regimes imposed by force from outside are unlikely to get popular support and are unlikely to succeed. 
In conclusion, the Howard government's forward deployment is absolutely wrong. It represents clear support for the inevitability of war when we should be doing everything we possibly can to avoid war. We have once again become a US lap-dog. This Prime Minister is the most sycophantic towards the United States of any Prime Minister since Harold Holt with his infamous `all the way with LBJ' performance. It has been a matter of seeking political advantage—regrettably by scaring people. I remember when the Prime Minister came to power and he talked about making people `relaxed and comfortable'. Instead, we are being turned into `alert but not alarmed'; indeed, a `fearful and scared' community. I appeal to the Prime Minister to think about what kind of country we have become and are becoming; I ask him to think about what kind of world we have become and are becoming. We can do much better than this.

"Ripoll, Bernie, MP",ALP,2003-02-06,"—With all the world's attention focused on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and a possible war with Iraq, it would seem that North Korea has been left to advance its own nuclear program undeterred. Ever since George Bush's `axis of evil' speech, North Korea's attitude to the West has chilled. Now it seems this sleeping giant is stirring once again—or at least letting us know that it was only snoozing for a while.
In the past few months, North Korea has reignited its nuclear program. It has confessed that it was enriching uranium and that it has restarted plutonium reactors—effectively tearing up global nuclear treaties—and it has also announced plans to resume ballistic missile testing. On top of this, it has recently been confirmed that North Korea possesses up to three nuclear warheads already, with several more on the way. Foreign Minister Alexander Downer seems to think that North Korea's actions do not amount to a regional threat, let alone a global threat. The Federation of American Scientists lists North Korea as having—or having the ability to acquire—nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, apart from the ones that it already possesses. This is a full arsenal, and it also has a full ability to deliver them.
While the federal government commits 2,000 troops to the Gulf in anticipation of a war in Iraq, it sends but three public servants to North Korea to deal with a potentially catastrophic nuclear proliferation crisis. By attempting to disarm one nation, it is ignoring serious efforts to re-arm in another. The US Deputy Secretary of State, Richard Armitage, claims that the major difference between Iraq and North Korea is that North Korea wants nuclear technology for economic gain but not terror. I gain very little if no comfort at all from that assumption. I still believe in the adage that countries that possess weapons of mass destruction have a `use it or lose it' mentality. 
Iraq does not have the ability to strike at our region, let alone Australia, with a weapon of mass destruction. However, this should not deter us from disarming Saddam Hussein. North Korea on the other hand does have such weapons. They possess a missile called Taepodong-2, which can carry a nuclear warhead all the way to our backyard and into Australia. By ignoring the security of our own region, the federal government is letting a crisis there balloon out of control. What is happening in North Korea has the potential to impact upon Australia far more than a war with Iraq would, especially as we know there is the potential for nuclear and ballistic weapons to be involved.
How can John Howard, the Prime Minister, say that he is acting in the best interests of Australia if he does not stand up on this issue? This government obviously has the wrong priorities and no idea of how to manage our most important policy area—regional security. Australia is one of the few countries left in the world that still has diplomatic relations with North Korea, and we should be making the most of that relationship to address this crisis. The Minister for Foreign Affairs should be on the plane to Pyongyang—and, if Mr Downer has no success, the situation is grave enough to warrant the Prime Minister making the trip himself. Even if this potential threat is really only a form of fantastic bluff to get more foreign aid out of the West, the real prospect that this strategy may work threatens our strategic role in the region and amounts to an upping of the ante on how to deal with nuclear powers, particularly those such as North Korea.
Labor leader Simon Crean committed Labor to re-establishing the Canberra Commission on the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons. This should be commended and supported. Mr Crean also said that what is happening in North Korea represents a serious deterioration of Australia's regional security interests and, as such, Australia cannot sit by and let this important issue be handled by others. Nuclear weapons are the ultimate weapon of mass destruction. They are perhaps the most serious threat to our global community, and we must make a stand. In this struggle to disarm Iraq and rid the world of weapons of mass destruction, we have underestimated North Korea's role. North Korea's part in this crisis is paramount, and downplaying their actions is a gross miscalculation. It shows once again this government's total disregard for and miscalculation of the threats in our region.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>North Korea</title>,Adjournment,17,1
"Bailey, Fran, MP",LP,2003-02-06,"—I want to place on record my appreciation and thanks to the thousands of volunteer firefighters who have performed so superbly in recent bushfires. I also want to place on record my appreciation of the Australian Defence Force involvement in the bushfires. Australian Defence Force personnel again demonstrated strength of character and versatility as they worked shoulder to shoulder with on-the-ground firefighters over the holidays against some of the most fearsome bushfires we have seen in this country. Faced with an enemy of a different kind, defence personnel were quick to respond to the call from emergency service workers to strengthen the lines of defence against raging firestorms in north-east Victoria, Canberra and New South Wales.
In the great spirit of the Anzacs, hundreds of personnel postponed regular duties to lend a mate a hand, providing invaluable backup and support personnel to weary firefighters who in some cases had been working at clearing firebreaks for several weeks. As well as supplying much-needed manpower, Australian Defence Force support included the provision of: bulldozers, water tankers, fuel tankers, buses and drivers, heavy vehicles and utilities, generators, accommodation, bedding and rations, graders, chainsaw operators and a fire truck, as well as defence planners and transport and logistics operations staff. The ADF also provided six helicopters: two fitted with water buckets, two for fire spotting and two for transporting firefighters. Also, 100 Army personnel were deployed in north-east Victoria to help contain bushfires in the rugged high country, hand clearing massive firebreaks around communities already suffering and counting the cost of peak tourism season minus the tourists.
As we have come to expect, defence personnel acted with the utmost professionalism, stamina and courage to support the efforts of the volunteer firefighters and emergency service workers, pitching in to defend our rural communities against the peril of the firestorms. It has become an all too familiar sight—those men and women, who pledge to protect the security of our nation and uphold our global obligations, taking up tools of another sort to protect and care for so many of our communities: in cams, fighting fires alongside the CFA; or combining air and sea rescue; or, as they did just recently, using heavy vehicles to clear a path through bush to enable paramedics to access accident scenes. We have seen those vivid pictures, and I want to place on record my thanks and say what a great privilege it is to have those wonderful men and women of our Australian Defence Force there to come to the rescue.",REPS,<title>STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS</title>,<title>Bushfires</title>,Statements by Members,18,1
"Sidebottom, Sid, MP",ALP,2003-02-06,"—The Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Legislation Amendment Bill 2002 introduces reforms to the National Registration Scheme for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals. These reforms are designed to streamline and improve the operation of the scheme created by Labor way back in 1991. Farm chemicals assist Australian farmers, graziers and orchardists to produce quality products for domestic and international markets. Most farmers do, of course, seek to minimise the use of chemicals in their production and they do this for both economic and environmental reasons. 
It is equally true that the safe use of chemicals makes an important contribution to the productive capacity of our lands—in particular, in Tasmania's beautiful north-west coastal region in my electorate of Braddon, in the south in my colleague Harry Quick's electorate of Franklin and in the north and north-east in my colleague Michelle O'Byrne's electorate of Bass. In addition, these chemicals help Australian primary producers earn valuable export income through commodity and processed food exports. This government's appalling record on trade invests every export dollar earned by our farmers and food processors with even greater value. Australia's most recent trade deficit was the worst in our nation's history—$3 billion worth, the 13th monthly deficit figure in a row and the worst ever. I noticed the Treasurer scurry in to question time yesterday. In between barrages, he got up and tried to defend this worst ever trade deficit in our history in a pathetic way and then he snuck away. Unfortunately, that does not augur well for our economy. It was interesting to see the Treasurer without his normal aggressive aplomb in the House.
As a former college teacher, I have seen some pretty poor report cards, but this report on the government's performance makes all others pale into insignificance. Despite the relatively poor quality of its ministers, this government has been fortunate in many ways. It is fortunate that Labor did the hard work in government to reform and modernise the economy and fortunate that Labor remodelled Australia's relationship with the region and the world and created strong and enduring trade ties in the Asia-Pacific region. It is fortunate also that Labor worked with the states on issues of national significance and introduced national standards such as those that underpin the National Registration Scheme for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals.
On the matter of cooperation, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry's boast about his `administrative partnership' with the states in his second reading speech is a bit rich. This minister has adopted an antagonistic attitude towards the states—shared, I must say, by many of his other cabinet colleagues. It is an attitude that has hindered rather than assisted national cooperation on matters of national significance. There is no better example of that than the minister's failure to progress reform of the exceptional circumstances program. It is a failure that has cost many farmers on the mainland dearly and one that rural and regional Australia will not quickly forget.
The matter of assessment, registration and regulation of agricultural chemicals is one that Labor primary industries ministers addressed seriously. Under Labor, cooperation with the states was not damaged by the sort of campaign we have seen from this minister in relation to the drought, for example. This minister has been fortunate indeed that Labor's legacy included a functioning, effective national chemical registration scheme. The proper assessment, registration and regulation of agricultural and veterinary chemicals does, of course, provide an important safeguard for the health and safety of Australian consumers and the natural environment. Dependent on this system are no less important matters than the prosperity of Australia's rural industries, the maintenance of our export markets and the health of rural workers, animals and the environment. My electorate of Braddon is home to industries including beef cattle production, poppies, vegetables and food processing. These industries, Minister, benefit immeasurably from the proper use of chemicals and rely on good and sensible regulation to maintain market and commodity confidence in the produce they create. 
The National Registration Scheme for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals was, as I mentioned, first agreed between federal Labor and the states in 1991. Between 1992 and 1995 the scheme took shape, with the Commonwealth gaining responsibility for the evaluation and assessment of certain chemical products and their clearance for registration. Since 1995 the National Registration Authority has had responsibility for the evaluation, registration and review of agricultural and veterinary chemicals and their control up to the point of retail sale. The states and territories have retained responsibility, on the other hand, for control of use activities.
The bill amends the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code 1994, the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Administration) Act 1992 and the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Products (Collection of Levy) Act 1994. In his second reading speech, the minister told the House the amendments are designed to facilitate a more efficient and effective scheme for registration of agricultural and veterinary chemicals. The minister then outlined the amendments in five very short sentences. The opposition recognises the minister's disdain for detail, but five short sentences is not an adequate explanation for the changes wrought by this bill, Minister. The bill extends—as you know, I hope—to 88 pages and amends three separate acts. The explanatory memorandum tabled by the minister extends to 87 pages. The amendments concern an important national regulatory scheme, and we are told by the minister that the bill reflects an agreement between the Commonwealth and the states and territories. But it is my view that the minister should extend this parliament the courtesy of explaining the detail and impact of the legislation he brings before it. In fact, if we in the opposition had any confidence in the minister, we might well insist he do so before we agree to the passage of the legislation here and in the other place. Regrettably, we lack that confidence.
The key amendments contained in the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Legislation Amendment Bill 2002 include a new low regulatory regime for certain agricultural and veterinary chemicals, which constitutes the response to a recommendation of the national competition policy review of agricultural and veterinary legislation, and expansion of the deemed permits mechanism to ensure stockpiles of chemicals that lose registration can be utilised safely. This utilisation, including disposal, must be consistent with the instructions contained in the deemed permit issued by the National Registration Authority. The amendments also include a new requirement that labels contain instructions for use and that there be greater consistency in the use of language relating to these instructions; an increased capacity for the National Registration Authority to vary conditions of approval, registration and labelling; a new capacity for the National Registration Authority to seek public comment as part of any reconsideration process; increased penalty provisions; and the standardisation of some definitions.
The opposition supports these changes to the National Registration Scheme for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals. In our judgment, the bill will contribute to the efficiency of the scheme by reducing the administrative burden on business. Importantly, the bill will maintain appropriate standards that continue to protect public health, environmental safety and our trade credentials. Labor is pleased, therefore, to lend its support to the passage of the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Legislation Amendment Bill 2002.

"Truss, Warren, MP",NP,2003-02-06,"—I thank the member for Braddon for his contribution to the debate. It was a rather interesting contribution, I thought, because usually opposition members complain that ministers' speeches are too long. It was rather different to hear him complain that the speech was too short—although I would have thought that having 87 pages of explanatory memoranda was enough, even for the opposition. But he also chose to make a rather brief contribution, and I welcome the opposition's support for these changes to the legislation.
Since 1995, the National Registration Scheme for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals has been established to ensure the safe use of agricultural and veterinary chemicals in terms of the health and safety of the community, the environment and our overseas trading relationships. As the regulatory, governmental, community and industry stakeholders have become more confident in the scheme, they have proposed reforms to facilitate a more efficient, effective and responsive regime for the registration of agricultural and veterinary chemicals. These reforms will hopefully make some contribution to reducing unnecessary red tape, promoting innovation and providing access to safe chemicals for those that need them. The amendments should reduce business and regulatory costs and generally reduce the administrative burden without compromising the health and safety standards we expect from a national registration scheme.
With the implementation of these reforms, Australia's traditionally rigorous and scientifically credible processes and standards will continue to be maintained. All state and territory governments have provided their agreement to this package of reforms. The reforms make good public health and safety sense. They make good sense for the environment and for the small and large businesses that need to access the scheme. I commend the legislation to the Main Committee and thank the opposition for its smooth passage.

"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,2003-02-06,"—Disastrous bushfires have devastated not only Canberra but large areas of regional and urban Australia, while the unending drought brings ruin even to the best parts of our country. Once again, climatologists and CSIRO scientists are warning the government that the intensity and frequency of extreme weather conditions that provide opportunities for large-scale bushfires are directly linked to global warming, which is itself driven by greenhouse gas emissions.
The evidence that the Prime Minister claims to have for the existence of Saddam Hussein's arsenal is far more tenuous than the evidence linking the drought and bushfires to global warming. And yet, despite a lack of any substantial evidence, the government is willing to spend billions of dollars to send troops to Iraq while at the same time it claims that Australia cannot afford to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. If the government can argue that spending large sums of money on a war in Iraq is justified because of the possibility of the existence of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons, why can it not find the same amount of money for the protection of Australia from the ravages of greenhouse gas induced climate change? There is no doubt that a significant number of the frail, the sick and the elderly will have died as a result of the extreme temperatures of recent times. This does not include those tragically killed in recent bushfires around Australia.
While the government cannot be blamed for these deaths, there is no doubt that they will bear a growing responsibility for future disasters if they continue to do nothing to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. The evidence for the damaging effects of global warming continues to mount. The New Scientist of 18 January this year reports on new research that has uncovered a previously mysterious circulation pattern in the Pacific Ocean. Francisco Chavez from the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute has shown that the El Nino phenomenon follows a roughly 25-year cycle. The cycle alternates between many years with warm Pacific waters and strong El Ninos and many years with cooler waters and weaker El Ninos. In the years with stronger El Ninos, Australia experiences more severe droughts. Australia is presently in the grip of an unprecedented severe drought.
According to this new evidence, Pacific waters should be cooler and El Ninos should be significantly weaker. This tells us that a severe drought is not meant to be occurring at this time. Reviewing this new data, Frank Schwing of the Pacific Fisheries Environmental Laboratory in Pacific Grove, California, has speculated that global warming could spark a perpetual regime of severe El Ninos or `something even less welcome'. How much worse could things get? 
In answer to my question on notice No. 1202 to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage regarding the cost of implementing the Kyoto protocol, the minister replied:
... the annual costs of implementing the Kyoto Protocol range from a low of 0 to a high of 0.4 per cent of GNP at 2012. 
The minister's own figures show that it would not significantly harm our economy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These figures no doubt ignore the many savings that could be achieved if the analysis were not affected by the constraints imposed by the minister.
An underlying, if unstated, principle that is often used to justify government defence spending is that no matter how small the threat there should be no constraints on the money spent to meet that threat. Why is this government so inconsistent? Why does the government maintain a head-in-the-sand approach to our environment? For how much longer will this government ignore the very large threat posed to Australia by global warming caused by greenhouse gas emissions?",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Environment: Global Warming</title>,Adjournment,21,1
